The next 30 minutes will be equally \ndivided, so whoever is recognized will be able to speak for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed on S.J. Res. 9. Since that time, the Republican leader and I \nhave been discussing a proposed agreement that would allow votes on \nvarious proposals. Late yesterday, we received a proposal from Senator \nWarner, and I understand Senator Ben Nelson was involved. We have it \nhere now. It has been rewritten during the night, and we will see if we \ncan include it in some agreement we have. If we can do that, we will go \nahead with whatever we can work out to vote on today.\n  I would say--and the distinguished Republican leader knows this--we \nare going to do everything we can to put the votes over until a \nspecific time so that people aren't coming back and forth. That is \nprincipally for the Budget Committee, which is meeting as we speak to \ntry to finish that bill as quickly as possible so we can work on it \nnext week.\n  I know Members were counting on the previous announcement of no votes \nthis Friday. We are going to do everything we can to make sure we have \nno votes, but until we get an agreement on this Iraq issue and on the \nU.S. attorneys, we will have to have everyone wait until--we should be \nable to have something even before morning business is closed. If we \ncan work on it prior to morning business closing, we will come, the \nRepublican leader and I, and announce that agreement. We hope we are \nclose.\n  Again, I thank everyone for their patience, especially the Republican \nleader. We have tried to be fair to everyone, and sometimes that is \ndifficult to do, as people have so many different opinions as to how we \nshould proceed. I will keep the Members apprised of the schedule based \non the outcome of our negotiations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3149-7", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we all know and understand that \nAmericans are deeply concerned about the war in Iraq. We all represent \nthe finest and bravest men and women across this great country who put \nthemselves in harm's way to protect our very way of life. We all want \nour brave men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to come \nhome as soon as possible.\n  Members of Georgia's military community have given mightily to our \nefforts in the Middle East. In fact, members of the 3rd Infantry \nDivision, headquartered at Fort Stewart, GA, are heading to Iraq for \nthe third time as we speak, and I wish to underscore how much we \nappreciate them and their families. These resolutions which the \nDemocrats continue to put forth undermine these men and women. Any \nattempt to set a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, as \nthe latest resolution does, will embolden the enemy and tell them \nexactly how long they need to wait until they are free to take over and \nwreak havoc in Iraq.\n  I understand the desire to have the Iraqis take responsibility for \ntheir own country and step up to the plate in terms of taking the \npolitical, economic, and military actions necessary to secure Iraq, and \nI strongly support that goal. However, this resolution is the wrong way \nto accomplish it.\n  These resolutions--and I believe there have been about 17 put forth \nover the course of the last couple of months--simply send the wrong \nmessage to our troops, and they send the wrong message to the enemy.\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       Nothing is more dangerous in wartime than to live in the \n     temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup poll, always feeling \n     one's pulse and taking one's temperature.\n\n  I think that sums up what is going on here today.\n  These resolutions only serve to micromanage the war by a political \nbody which simply is unable to do it effectively. We have a Commander \nin Chief who is entrusted with managing and leading our military during \nwartime, and the Commander in Chief's new plan for Iraq deserves a \nchance to succeed. These resolutions are designed to ensure that the \nPresident's plan fails, not that it succeeds.\n  Also, these resolutions are completely contradictory to the Senate's \nsupport for GEN David Petraeus, our new commander of the multinational \nforces in Iraq. No Senator opposed General Petraeus's nomination. I \nhave not heard anyone criticize him, and rightly so. We need to give \nGeneral Petraeus and his counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq a chance to \nsucceed. The people of Georgia, myself included, want General Petraeus \nto succeed. We understand the consequences of failure, and there is no \nquestion the latest resolution we are considering in this body will not \nhelp him succeed.\n  This resolution advocates transitioning U.S. forces in Iraq to \nprotecting U.S. coalition personnel, training and equipping Iraqi \nforces, and conducting counterterrorism operations, and calls for a \ndiplomatic, political, and economic strategy to stabilize Iraq. Many \npeople say the situation in Iraq requires a political and not a \nmilitary solution. I strongly agree with that position; however, it is \nnot possible to have a political solution or to make political progress \nif citizens live in an unstable and unsafe society. Some level of order \nand stability must be in place before a political solution can take \nhold.\n  In America, we take order and stability for granted because we live \nin a country that is extremely safe, secure, and stable. However, Iraq \nis not the United States. Iraqis do not live in a secure and stable \nsociety, and order and stability must be in place before there can be \nany hope for a long-term political solution. The additional troops we \nare sending are meant to create that order and stability, particularly \nin Baghdad. We need to give this effort a chance to succeed, and we \nneed to create stability and order before we can be hopeful about a \nlong-term political solution.\n  The Reid resolution opposes the President's plan without offering any \nconcrete alternative. It opposes the mission which the Senate has \nunanimously confirmed General Petraeus to carry out, and it will not \nserve to help our troops and our commander in Iraq succeed in the \nmission we have sent them on to accomplish. For these reasons, I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to point out some of the bitter \nironies of this debate.\n  Since roughly January, when the new majority took charge of this \nCongress, there have been numerous proposals with regard to how we \nshould conduct ourselves in Iraq. I have tried to keep track of the \nvarious resolutions that have been proposed and, as my colleagues can \nsee, there have been, according to my count, at least 17 resolutions. \nThey start with the Biden and Levin resolutions, the Reid-Pelosi \nresolution, the Murtha resolution, the Biden-Levin resolution, the \nConrad funding cut resolution, a waiver plan, a timeline plan, the \nFeingold resolution, the Obama resolution, the Clinton resolution, the \nDodd resolution, the Kennedy resolution, the Feinstein resolution, the \nByrd resolution, the Kerry resolution, and then the latest, the Reid \nresolution we are on today.\n  Under this current iteration before the Senate, it says: The \nPresident shall commence the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from \nIraq not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this \njoint resolution, with the goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008, all \nU.S. combat forces from Iraq, except for a limited number that are \nessential for the following purposes: protecting U.S. and coalition \npersonnel and infrastructures, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and \nconducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  The reason I find this list of resolutions--and now with the \nculmination on March 15--somewhat ironic is we are beginning to see \nsome of the signs of success of the new plan, the Baghdad security plan \nproposed by Prime Minister Maliki, with the support of the United \nStates.\n  For example, in the Associated Press yesterday, Robert Reid wrote \nthat bomb deaths have gone down 30 percent in Baghdad since the \nsecurity crackdown that began a month ago and that execution-style \nslayings have been cut nearly in half.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  I want to add a few key quotes to highlight what this article says.\n\n        . . . there are encouraging signs. Gone are the ``illegal \n     checkpoints,'' where Shiite and Sunni gunmen stopped cars and \n     hauled away members of the rival sect--often to a gruesome \n     torture and death.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The rattle of the automatic weapons fire or the rumble of \n     distant roadside bombs comes less frequently. Traffic is \n     beginning to return to the city's once vacant streets.\n\n  Consider this:\n\n       In the months before the security operation began, February \n     14, police were finding dozens of bodies each day in the \n     capital--victims of Sunni and Shiite death squads. Last \n     December, more than 200 bodies were found each week--with the \n     figure spiking above 300 in some weeks, according to police \n     reports compiled by the Associated Press. Since the crackdown \n     began, weekly totals have dropped to about 80--hardly an \n     acceptable figure but clearly a sign that death squads are no \n     longer as active as they were in the final months of last \n     year.\n\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to recognize that it has only \nbeen since February 14 that this new security plan has been operating \nand that Iraqi brigades and American surge forces are coming over the \nperiod of months and will not finally be deployed there for some time \nyet. Yet we are seeing some preliminary indications--nobody is claiming \nsuccess or victory, but there are some preliminary indications that the \nplan is actually working. The article quotes MG William Caldwell, and I \nshare in the sentiments he expresses when he says:\n\n       I would caution everybody about patience, about diligence. \n     This is going to take many months, not weeks, but the \n     indicators are all very positive right now.\n\n  We should also be cautious and patient and diligent, but we should \nalso recognize that progress is being made with this new plan proposed \nby General Petraeus, embraced by the President and his new Secretary of \nDefense, Robert Gates, and we should give it the chance to work.\n  That is precisely the reason I think this resolution is so misguided. \nThe idea that we have simply lost and we have to give up, with no \nconstructive alternative plan being suggested to deal with what will \noccur. In all probability there will be massive ethnic cleansing and a \nvast humanitarian crisis when the various sects continue to escalate \ntheir conflict against one another, which likely will draw in other, \nfor example, Sunni majority nations such as Saudi Arabia to try to \nprotect the Sunni minority in Iraq, and Iran, a Shiite majority nation, \nseeks to take advantage of the chaos there. Without the stabilizing \ninfluence of the U.S. and our Iraqi allies and this new Iraq security \nplan, it is probable that this troubled area of the world will descend \ninto a vast regional conflagration.\n  What I don't understand about this resolution is that there is \nvirtually not even a nod of the head or a tip of the hat to the fact \nthat, as Senator Levin pointed out, there are about 5,000 to 6,000 al-\nQaida foreign fighters in Al Anbar Province. This so-called phased \nredeployment, which is just Washington-speak for getting out of town as \nfast as you can, leaves a void, a power vacuum in this area where al-\nQaida can basically run wild and continue as they did in Afghanistan \nbefore 9/11--to plan, recruit, train, and finance terrorist attacks and \nlaunch them against the United States.\n  I am sure I wasn't the only one who was chilled at the testimony \nreleased today in the newspapers of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who \nconfessed to beheading Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter, \nin Iraq and some 30 other terrorist attacks, including the attacks of \n9/11. But how anybody in good conscience can advocate simply quitting \nin Iraq with the threat of 5,000 to 6,000 al-Qaida foreign fighters \nthere, with the risk of a regional conflict, along with the tremendous \nbody blow that would cause to the American economy, I don't know. I \njust don't understand it.\n  I was also surprised to see in today's New York Times some comments \nby Senator Clinton, who, of course, is running for the Democratic \nnomination for President. Notwithstanding this resolution and her \nstated support for the resolution, she is quoted as saying she foresees \na ``remaining military as well as political mission'' in Iraq. If \nelected President, she would keep a reduced military force there to \nfight al-Qaida--I am glad to hear that--deter Iranian aggression, \nprotect the Kurds, and possibly support the Iraqi military.\n  It is a little troubling. While she says that would be her goal, it \nappears to be inconsistent with this resolution that she also says she \nwill vote for. This is another quote in the article of March 15 in the \nNew York Times. She said:\n\n       So it will be up to me to try to figure out how to protect \n     those national security interests and continue to take our \n     troops out of this urban warfare, which I think is a loser.\n\n  This article says:\n\n       Asked if her plan was consistent with the resolution, Mrs. \n     Clinton and her advisers said it was, noting that the \n     resolution also called for ``a limited number'' of troops to \n     stay in Iraq to protect the American Embassy and other \n     personnel, train and equip Iraqi forces, and conduct \n     ``targeted counterterrorism operations.''\n\n  I don't know how that is consistent with this resolution. I don't \nknow how it is consistent with her other statement that she made on the \ncampaign trail when she said:\n\n       If we in Congress don't end this war by January 2009, as \n     President, I will.\n\n  It is speculated in this article that what she is proposing is a \nmirror image of a plan advocated by Dov S. Zakheim, a Pentagon \ncomptroller under Donald Rumsfeld. He estimated that no more than \n75,000 troops would be required for the kind of plan she describes, as \nopposed to the 160,000 troops the United States will have in Iraq once \nthe surge is complete. But I wonder whether it is wise to embrace a \nplan proposed by the Pentagon's comptroller--in other words, the \nPentagon's numbers cruncher, the budget man, as opposed to the plan \nproposed by GEN David Petraeus, who is an acknowledged expert in \ncounterinsurgency matters, the very kind of plan that is being executed \nnow with the Baghdad security planning--clearing, holding, and \nbuilding. I cannot understand how you would embrace a plan essentially \nproposed by the Pentagon's bookkeeper as opposed to the Pentagon's best \ngenerals.\n  I see the distinguished whip on the Senate floor. I will yield the \nrest of our time to him.\n  I cannot understand why our friends on the majority side cannot make \nup their minds. We have 17 resolutions and counting. It seems as if \neach day brings a different plan but none to address the most urgent \nneeds for our national security in the Middle East.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Some Progress May Mean Hope for Baghdad\n\n                          (By Robert H. Reid)\n\n       Baghdad.--Bomb deaths have gone down 30 percent in Baghdad \n     since the U.S.-led security crack down began a month ago. \n     Execution-style slayings are down by nearly half.\n       The once frequent sound of weapons has been reduced to \n     episodic, and downtown shoppers have returned to outdoor \n     markets--favored targets of car bombers.\n       There are signs of progress in the campaign to restore \n     order in Iraq, starting with its capital city.\n       But while many Iraqis are encouraged, they remain skeptical \n     how long the relative calm will last. Each bombing renews \n     fears that the horror is returning. Shiite militias and Sunni \n     insurgents are still around, perhaps just laying low or \n     hiding outside the city until the operation is over.\n       U.S. military officials, burned before by overly optimistic \n     forecasts, have been cautious about declaring the operation a \n     success. Another reason it seems premature: only two of the \n     five U.S. brigades earmarked for the mission are in the \n     streets, and the full compliment of American reinforcements \n     is not due until late May.\n       U.S. officials say that key to the operation's long-term \n     success is the willingness of Iraq's sectarian and ethnic \n     political parties to strike a power- and money-sharing deal. \n     That remains elusive--a proposal for governing the country's \n     main source of income--oil--is bogged down in parliamentary \n     squabbling.\n       Nevertheless, there are encouraging signs.\n       Gone are the ``illegal checkpoints,'' where Shiite and \n     Sunni gunmen stopped cars and hauled away members of the \n     rival sect--often to a gruesome torture and death.\n       The rattle of automatic weapons fire or the rumble of \n     distant roadside bombs comes less frequently. Traffic is \n     beginning to return to the city's once vacant streets.\n       ``People are very optimistic because they sense a \n     development. The level of sectarian violence in streets and \n     areas has decreased,'' said a 50-year-old Shiite, who gave \n     his name only as Abu Abbas. ``The activities of the militias \n     have also decreased. The car bombs and the suicide attacks \n     are the only things left, while other kinds of violence have \n     decreased.''\n       In the months before the security operation began Feb. 14, \n     police were finding dozens of bodies each day in the \n     capital--victims of Sunni and Shiite death squads. Last \n     December, more than 200 bodies were found each week--with the \n     figure spiking above 300 in some weeks, according to police \n     reports compiled by The Associated Press.\n       Since the crackdown began, weekly totals have dropped to \n     about 80--hardly an acceptable figure but clearly a sign that \n     death squads are no longer as active as they were in the \n     final months of last year.\n       Bombings too have decreased in the city, presumably due to \n     U.S. and Iraqi success in finding weapons caches and to more \n     government checkpoints in the streets that make it tougher to \n     deliver the bombs.\n       In the 27 days leading up to the operation, 528 people were \n     killed in bombings around the capital, according to AP \n     figures. In the first 27 days of the operation, the bombing \n     death toll stood at 370--a drop of about 30 percent.\n       Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, made a show of \n     confidence Tuesday by traveling out of Baghdad for meetings \n     with Sunni tribal leaders and government officials in Ramadi, \n     a stronghold for Sunni insurgents.\n       ``I would caution everybody about patience, about \n     diligence,'' U.S. spokesman\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\n     Maj. Gen. William C. Caldwell said Wednesday. ``This is going \n     to take many months, not weeks, but the indicators are all \n     very positive right now.''\n       Figures alone won't tell the story. In Vietnam, generals \n     kept pointing to enemy body counts to promote a picture of \n     success even when many U.S. soldiers and civilian officials \n     realized the effort was doomed.\n       True success will be when Iraqis themselves begin to feel \n     safe and gain confidence in their government and security \n     forces. Only then can the economy, long on its heels and with \n     unemployment estimated between 25 and 40 percent, rebound and \n     start providing jobs and a future for Baghdad's people.\n       A long-term solution also must deal with the militias that \n     sprang up after the ouster of Saddam Hussein.\n       Much of the relative calm may be due to a decision by \n     Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to remove his armed militiamen, \n     known as the Mahdi Army, from the streets. Al-Maliki warned \n     the young cleric that he could not protect them from the \n     Americans during the offensive.\n       U.S. troops rolled into the Mahdi stronghold of Sadr City \n     on March 4 without firing a shot--a radical change from \n     street battles there in 2004.\n       Some Mahdi Army fighters may have left the city. But Iraqis \n     who live in Shiite neighborhoods say many others are still \n     around, collecting protection money from shopkeepers and \n     keeping tabs on people--albeit without their guns.\n       When American patrols pass by, Mahdi members step into \n     shops or disappear into crowds until the U.S. troops are \n     gone. Sunni militants remain in some areas of the city too, \n     although last year's sectarian bloodletting drove many Sunnis \n     from their traditional neighborhoods, depriving extremists of \n     a support network.\n       Sunni militants, meanwhile, are believed to have withdrawn \n     to surrounding areas such as Diyala province where they have \n     safe haven. The U.S. command sent an extra 700 soldiers \n     Tuesday to protect the highways leading into the capital from \n     there.\n       If militants from both sects are indeed lying low, that \n     suggests they may have adopted a strategy of waiting until \n     the security operation is over, then reemerging to fight each \n     other for control of the capital.\n       Conscious of that possibility, new U.S. commander Gen. \n     David Petraeus and other senior generals avoid setting a date \n     for when the operation would end. They insist the extra \n     troops will stay as long as they are needed.\n       And they say the military will continue to track down key \n     militia and insurgent figures, in hopes of crippling the \n     leadership of insurgent groups before they attempt to re-\n     emerge.\n       ``You generally think that if you're going to achieve (the \n     desired results), that it would need to be sustained \n     certainly for some time well beyond summer,'' Petraeus told \n     reporters last week.\n       The No. 2 commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, has \n     recommended that the buildup stretch longer, into the early \n     months of 2008--if Congress will provide the money.\n       But positive trends in Iraq have proven hard to sustain. \n     Hopes for reconciliation are quickly shattered. There have \n     been a series of failed security initiatives. With so many \n     uncertainties, public opinion appears mixed.\n       ``We gain nothing from this government. No change,'' said \n     Abu Zeinab, a Shiite father of two in Baghdad's Hurriyah \n     district. ``Today is like yesterday. What is the \n     difference?''\n       In eastern Baghdad, one homeowner whose house was seized by \n     the family of a Shiite militiaman gained enough confidence to \n     tell them to leave or he would turn them in to the \n     Americans--unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have not had a whole lot to say in the \nSenate about the process, the various proposals, and even the substance \nof the Iraq resolutions. But it obviously is a very troublesome issue \nfor me.\n  One of my concerns is the process. How bad could we possibly look as \nan institution? We can't come to an agreement on how to have a full \ndebate and votes. Everybody says we will agree to this but not that, \nand it goes back and forth. For the life of me, I cannot understand why \nwe cannot have some clear identification of some different approaches \nto this issue and have debate and vote on them.\n  The majority leader has to understand he cannot dictate what \namendments the Republicans are going to offer and the substance of \nthose amendments or resolutions, if you will, any more than we can \ndictate that to the Democrats. It has to be a fair process. I think \nthat can be worked out. I know our leaders are talking--and I wish them \nthe best--so that we can have debate and a vote on different approaches \nand move on to other issues.\n  My second problem is, how many iterations is this going to go \nthrough? I remind my colleagues that the election is over. It was last \nyear. All we have been doing in the Senate is political partisan \npositioning, all sound and fury, achieving nothing. What is the score \nin the Senate? 0 to 0. Democrats haven't gotten anything done. Not one \nbill of any substance that we have passed has been signed into law, \nexcept a continuing resolution, which we acknowledged had to be done to \nkeep the Government operating and, frankly, because we didn't do our \nwork like we should have on that issue last year. That is all. It is \nall about positioning.\n  There is one other score that is the worst of all: Democrats, 0; \nRepublicans, 0; American people, 0. We have to figure out a way to quit \nfinding what we can disagree about and find some things we can work \ntogether on for the good of the people.\n  Regarding this Iraq issue, on the one hand, we say we want to \nsucceed. On the other hand, you have the out-of-Iraq caucus saying get \nout of there, set deadlines, and withdraw the troops. We say we are \ngiving General Petraeus our total confidence with a unanimous approval \nin confirmation. He is there trying to get the violence calmed down and \nto do a better job and get an opportunity for their Government to do \nwhat it needs to do, have economic development. So while we are saying: \nCongratulations, we all vote for you and wish you will succeed, we are \nover here doing things that could potentially undermine his ability to \nget them done.\n  You might say: Oh, well, that is not really what is at stake with the \nIraq resolutions. Remember, to show you what positioning is going on, \ntoday, let's say we come to the conclusion that we are going to have \ntwo or three different votes and we will finish at some point this \nafternoon on the latest iteration of the Reid positions and we will \nmove on to the budget. Well, the problem with that is we have already \nbeen told this will be back on the supplemental appropriations--the \nemergency appropriations to fund the needs of our men and women in \nuniform. We are being told: By the way, we are going to put this \nrestrictive language on the funding resolution. So we are going to \nrevisit this issue the week after next.\n  I think what we are doing is the worst of all worlds. We have had \nnonbinding resolutions to express the sense of the Senate, which is a \nmisnomer in itself. Then, now we finally come to what would be \nstatutory language in a joint resolution by Senator Reid, which has \ndeadlines and begins a process of Congress micromanaging a war.\n  We have tried it before and it didn't work, or it led to what some \npeople consider a disaster. For us to state some opinions is one thing, \nbut it has gone beyond that now. This is going to have an effect. I \ndon't think there is a lot of language or a lot we can do that can \npositively affect what is going on in Iraq right now, but there is a \nlot we can do that will negatively affect it.\n  So I think to start setting deadlines and having the Congress trying \nto micromanage what is going on in Baghdad--we cannot even manage the \nprocess. How are we going to manage a war? Even the New York Times--and \nI don't usually quote them because most of the time I disagree with \neverything they have to say--is raising questions about the different \nresolutions and what would be the effect of what we are trying to do in \nthe Congress about Iraq.\n  The Economist, I think the world's most respected magazine, said \nthere is actually progress being made. General Petraeus is doing some \nthings that have made a difference. Maliki and the Government there are \nbeginning to make some decisions. We say meet your benchmarks, but as \nprogress is being made, we say: If you don't do it like we have \noutlined, we are going to begin to just withdraw.\n  Mr. President, I wish my colleagues--all of us on both sides of the \naisle--would think seriously about what we are doing in Iraq.\n  Then also, of course, we are going to go to the budget resolution \nnext week. I have been through a lot of budget battles. Again, we are \ngoing to fuss and we are going to fight and we are going to have lots \nof amendments and we will have a vote-arama, which is the worst \nexhibition imaginable. We will vote on\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n25 amendments in a row probably every 3 minutes and have no idea what \nwe are voting on. We will finish it up, and what effect does it have? \nNone. The President doesn't sign it. We treat our own budgets about the \nsame as we treat the President's budgets: We ignore them. We trash them \na while and then throw them out in the street and do what we want to \ndo.\n  I do think the budget is going to be the beginning of an opportunity \nfor the American people to have buyer's remorse about what they have \ndone with the Congress. This is going to be sort of a typical budget \ndebate. The headline again in the New York Times is: ``Senate Democrats \noffer spending plan but no way to pay for it.''\n  I think in theory you can say Republicans always want to cut taxes, \nand they don't want to worry a whole lot about the effect that has on \nthe deficit, although I believe if we cut taxes in the right way, we \nget more revenue.\n  I also think we all better take a look at what has been the effects \nof our tax policy and our budgets on the economy. The economy is good. \nDo we have some problems in the energy area and health care? Yes. We \nought to do something about those issues. But overall, we have had \neconomic growth. Revenues are pouring in.\n  So what is the budget I am looking at going to do? I think Senator \nConrad is a very serious chairman of the Budget Committee. I know he \nwould like to do more than he is going to be able to do. I know he \nwould like to do entitlement reform. We know it has to come. We will \nnot belly up to that bar this year or next year. Maybe something will \noccur and we will do it in 2009.\n  This is going to be a budget where there is more domestic spending, \nless defense spending, and tax increases. That is what is going to \nhappen. That is what always happens. We may not be a whole lot more \nresponsible with a Republican budget, but this is your basic Democratic \nbudget, and we are going to see it next week. We are going to describe \nit as one of smoke and mirrors. It assumes the tax cuts are going to be \nextended into the future, but it doesn't come up with any way to pay \nfor them. Under the new rules, we are going to have pay-fors. If you \nincrease spending, you are going to have to pay for it, or if you have \ntax cuts, you are going to have to pay for them, but it doesn't say how \nthat is going to occur.\n  I do think we are at a critical juncture. We have gone through the \nopening, trying to get used to how we run the institution with new \nmanagement. We haven't done it well. I am going to mark it off as the \nearly phases of a new Congress and feeling our way forward. But when we \nget through positioning, I hope we are going to find a way to do some \nthings together. We should have immigration reform. We need it. I know \n``comprehensive immigration reform'' has gotten to be a dirty word, but \nI do think we have to deal with it in a broad way. It has to deal with \nlegal immigration, illegal immigration, and we are going to have to \nhave a temporary worker program. We have to find some way for people to \nhave a pathway to citizenship.\n  We have to address health care in America. Health care has become so \nexpensive and, in many cases, not accessible. Why can't we work \ntogether on that issue?\n  Energy--the energy situation in America is a national security risk \nand an economic risk. Some people say: Oh, we can fix it by raising \nmileage standards for automobiles, CAFE standards. Some of us--I am in \nthat group--think we don't have to produce less or get along with not \nhaving more oil and gas and nuclear power and everything else. I think \nwe can have more of everything. Let's see if we can't find a way to \ncome together and maybe do both in a responsible way.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to talk about these issues this morning. \nI hope we can come to an agreement on how to proceed on Iraq, and I \nhope we can finish it by sundown tonight and then move on to the \nobligatory vote on the budget, which will be a waste of time, next \nweek, and then maybe we can get serious about what we do in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the floor situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period for morning \nbusiness. Democrats control the next 30 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield myself \napproximately 10 minutes.\n  First, I wish to respond for a few minutes to my colleague, the \nSenator from Mississippi, the Republican whip. We have been in session \nless than 70 days. We have already been spending more time on \nlegislation than the Congress led by the other party last year. Last \nyear, we were in session less time than the Maryland General Assembly. \nWe only voted 108 days.\n  Now we have been in session 70 days. We have had a robust work \nschedule. Our colleagues in the House have passed significant \nlegislation. What takes them 1 day takes us 2 weeks. It takes us 2 \nweeks not only because parliamentarily and constitutionally we are the \nmore deliberative body, but at the same time it has been the \nobstructionist tactics of the other party that has prevented us from \nbeing able to move our legislation.\n  Nevertheless, thanks to the determination of our majority leader, the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, we have been able to pass ethics reform. \nThe American people wanted us to clean up our own act before we cleaned \nup Government and, man, have the Republicans left us a lot to clean up: \nthe Walter Reed scandal, the Attorney General scandal, the national \nsecurity letter scandal--scandal after scandal after scandal. We came \nsaying we weren't going to be seeking investigations, but now their \nreckless incompetency is forcing us to do that.\n  Then we pushed to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. It \nhas been 5\\1/2\\ years since the dastardly attack on the World Trade \nCenter, and it has taken us forever to implement these recommendations.\n  So when the other party criticizes us for not doing the people's \nbusiness, maybe if they get out of the way with their obstructionist \ntactics and let us move ahead with an agenda that is bipartisan, we can \nget the job done.\n  Too often, when all is said and done within the Senate, more gets \nsaid than gets done. So before people throw rocks, remember those who \nlive in a glass house might end up being shattered to bits themselves.\n  Let us do our work. Every time we turn around, Harry Reid has to file \nanother cloture motion. Why? Because they threaten filibuster. So, \nhello, don't criticize us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3153-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3153-S3154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, let's get on with this micromanaging the \nwar business. Maybe if the administration was micromanaging the war, we \nwouldn't be here today. They said there were weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq. Maybe if they had micromanaged the intelligence \ncommunity, we wouldn't even have gone into Iraq in the first place.\n  No. 2, they said, We are ready to go. If Mr. Rumsfeld had \nmicromanaged the U.S. military, maybe we would have had enough troops. \nMaybe if they had micromanaged the war, they would have had enough body \narmor. Maybe if they had micromanaged the system, we wouldn't have the \nscandal at Walter Reed. Maybe if they had micromanaged, we wouldn't \nhave this horrific backlog at VA. They are the ones who should have \nbeen micromanaging the war, and if they can't do it, they need to get \nout of the way and let us pass our resolution.\n  The distinguished whip from the other party said he wants us to \nfinish by sundown. We would like to sunset the war. That is what we \nwould like to do. It is time for our troops to come home, and it is \ntime for us to bring them home swiftly. But we have a moral obligation \nand a constitutional obligation to bring them home safely. This is why \nI support the Reid resolution. This resolution states clearly that the \nCongress and the American people support our troops. Yet, at the same \ntime, we are saying bring the troops home by March 31, 2008. Unlike the \nreckless incompetency that got us into the war, we are following the \nguidelines of the Iraq Study Group, wise heads who pondered some of the \nbest ways to a new way forward.\n  The Reid resolution sets a framework and a time line for doing what \nneeds to be done and assuring our troops that we honor their service, \nand we are\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\ngoing to protect them on the battlefield. We are going to make sure \nthey have the resources to do the job, and when they come back home, we \nwant to be sure they have health care and they have jobs and they have \njob training.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has been a leader in \nmaking sure that when our troops come home, they have job training, and \nI thank him for that.\n  I am not new to this position on the war. I never wanted to go to war \nin the first place, not because I am a pacifist--and I respect those \nwho are--but I read that national intelligence report; I am on the \nIntelligence Committee. I had very grave suspicions about the level of \nweapons of mass destruction Saddam had. But I also believed it was the \nU.N.'s job to go to Iraq and do the work that the U.N. was supposed to \ndo.\n  I opposed giving the President unilateral authority to engage in a \npreemptive attack just because he said we were in imminent danger. I \nwish he had micromanaged that a bit. Maybe we wouldn't have had to go. \nI said the United States had to exhaust our diplomatic options, and I \nencouraged the administration at that time: Please, stick with the U.N. \nso the U.N. can meet its responsibility to deal with the Saddam threat. \nI said we shouldn't go on our own and we should work with the U.N. and \nthe international community.\n  The day of the vote when I spoke, I said I didn't know what lies \nahead. I didn't know if our troops would be greeted with flowers or \nwith landmines. Go to Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital and talk \nto those coming home from Iraq. You know what we got. When we got \nthere, there were no weapons of mass destruction, but destruction sure \nhappened.\n  After 4 years of fighting, are we better off in Iraq? The United \nStates went to war with Iraq, now we are at war within Iraq. Saddam is \ngone, we are still there, and now we are in a civil war. It is time for \nus to come home, and it is time for us to come home following the Iraq \nStudy Group recommendations.\n  We need a new way forward in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group gave us 79 \nrecommendations. Surely, we could agree on 50. If the administration \nwasn't being so isolated and so rigid, they would know it is time to \nengage in the international community, that it is always better to send \nin the diplomats before we send in the troops. Let's send in the \ndiplomats so we can bring our troops back home.\n  The Iraq Study Group calls for enhanced diplomatic and political \nefforts in Iraq and outside Iraq. It provides a direction for the U.S. \nGovernment and the Iraqi Government to follow that would bring our \nforces home by the first quarter of 2008. That is what the Reid \nresolution calls for.\n  The Reid resolution sets a goal of bringing all U.S. combat forces \nhome by March 31, 2008, except for limited numbers of troops for force \nprotection, training of the Iraqi troops, and targeted counterterrorism \noperations. It would begin a phased redeployment within 4 months after \nthe passage of this legislation. But it also develops a comprehensive \ndiplomatic, political, and economic strategy. Finally, this resolution \nrequires the President to report to Congress within 60 days.\n  That is why we support this resolution. Are we micromanaging? No, but \nI wish the administration, as I said, had micromanaged the war. We \nwouldn't be in the debacle we are in now.\n  I support the Reid resolution because I believe what the Iraq Study \nGroup said, that the Iraq problems cannot now be solved with a military \nsolution, no matter how brave, no matter how smart. It requires a \npolitical solution by the Iraqis and a diplomatic solution with Iraq's \nneighbors. It says the Congress and the American people will not just \nsupport the troops, but protect them.\n  I want this war to end, and I believe this Reid resolution will do \nthat. Yet, in ending the war, it is my responsibility to ensure our \ntroops are brought home not only swiftly but safely.\n  Mr. President, I have had sit-ins in my office four times during the \nlast 3 weeks. Four times, people have come to my office to sit in. Some \ncome to protest, some come to get arrested, but all have a right to \nspeak out. They want me to vote against the spending for the war. Well, \nthere is no way a responsible Senator can vote against spending. There \nis no one line item that says: War, yes or no. That is not the way the \nsupplemental works. That is not the way the defense budget works. That \nis not the way our entire budget works. There is no vote that says: \nWar, yes or no.\n  So I won't vote for defunding the war. I say to the protestors--I say \nto those well-intentioned liberal activists--know that we are on your \nside, but what are you asking us to vote against? Do you want us to \nvote against the pay for the soldiers and for their spouses and for \ntheir children? I won't vote against their benefits. What do you want \nus to vote against--the bullets and what they need to fight? I won't \nvote against that. Do you want us to vote against the body armor and \nthe armored humvees they need for survival? I won't vote against that.\n  What if they are injured? One of the things that save their lives on \nthe battlefields is the tourniquet. I won't cut off the money for the \ntourniquets. I want them to have the tourniquets to cut off the \nhemorrhaging on the battlefields. When they come out of there, there is \nthe jet fuel that gets them on the medevac from Baghdad to Germany to \nWalter Reed and Bethesda. We will clean up Walter Reed, and we will fix \nBethesda Naval Hospital, but they have to get here. When they get here, \nthey need medical care. Hats off to acute medical care.\n  Now we need outpatient care. Now we need long-term care for the 50 \nyears or so these men and women will have the need for it. We have had \n22,000 people receive Purple Hearts in Iraq, and more have been injured \nthan we will ever know or we will know years from now. So I can't vote \nagainst funding.\n  I tell all who are listening that you can sit in every single day, \nyou can follow me throughout my Senate career, you can follow me to my \ngrave--I will not vote to in any way harm the U.S. men and women in the \nmilitary, nor will I cut off the support for help to their families. If \nyou want to picket, you want to protest, you want to disrupt my life, \nbetter my life is disrupted than the lives of these men and women in \nuniform.\n  I am going to support this Reid resolution because I believe it helps \nbring the war to an honorable end, but at the same time, we are going \nto support our troops. It is time to stop the finger-pointing, and it \nis time to pinpoint a new way forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3154-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3154-S3155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, some years ago, the distinguished and late \ngreat Senator from the State of Minnesota, Hubert H. Humphrey, said the \nfollowing when he was talking about how we should evaluate budgets in \ngovernment. He said:\n\n       The moral test of a government is how it treats those in \n     the dawn of life, those in the shadows of life, and those in \n     the twilight of life.\n\n  I rise today to speak of those in the dawn of their lives--children \nacross America and especially the children of working families, working \nfamilies who have no health insurance.\n  Unfortunately, despite good intentions and despite a good program I \nwill be speaking about this morning, there are 9 million American \nchildren with no health insurance at all--9 million children. That is a \nblot on the American conscience--or should be--that there are 9 million \nchildren who have no health insurance at all. Justice cannot abide 9 \nmillion children in America with no health insurance.\n  That is the bad news. The good news is that we have a way to bring \nsome relief to those children, to their families, and to the American \neconomy. It is called the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nknown by the acronym SCHIP. So when I refer to SCHIP by that acronym, I \nam speaking of that program, the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  Here is what this program does, and it bears repeating because of the \nbroad coverage that important program provides to children across \nAmerica. It provides comprehensive health insurance coverage to up to 6 \nmillion American children. It is financed jointly by State governments \nand the Federal Government. Currently, that program\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\ncosts the Federal Government just over $5 billion per year--a very \nsmall price to pay in a huge Federal budget with all the return you get \nfrom that investment for our children. Remember what this program is: \nIt is a program that covers the children of working families, those \nfamilies whose incomes are too high to be covered by Medicaid and whose \nincomes are too low to have the coverage that is provided in the \nprivate market. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about \nfamilies who are squeezed in between and who cannot afford coverage in \nthe private market but also don't qualify for Medicaid.\n  In Pennsylvania, my home State, I am honored and proud to say that my \nfather, Governor Casey, when he was the Governor of Pennsylvania, \nsigned into law one of the first children's health insurance programs \nin the Nation in 1992. Since that time, not only in Pennsylvania but \nespecially in our State, we have had broad bipartisan support for this \nprogram from Republican Governors and Democratic Governors. Currently, \nGovernor Rendell is trying to expand the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in Pennsylvania. That is a good thing because even though it \ncovers as many as 150,000 Pennsylvania children, there are still over \n130,000 children in the State of Pennsylvania who have no coverage. The \nGovernor wants to attack that problem and reduce that number. \nUnfortunately, this Governor of Pennsylvania, Governor Rendell, as well \nas Governors across the country, in both parties, are unable to expand \ntheir programs if the budget proposal set forth by the President \nbecomes the law.\n  Here is what the Bush budget does when it comes to the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and I am quoting from a report by \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: ``The Bush budget provides \nless than half''--less than half--``of the funding needed for States to \nmaintain existing caseloads.'' What we are talking about there is, \ngoing forward in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, in those budget \nyears, the President's budget provides less than half the money to \nmaintain the coverage for those approximately 6 million children who \nhave coverage. This doesn't even address the problem I started with \nthis morning, the 9 million children who don't have any health care \ncoverage at all.\n\n  We have to do two things. We have to make sure we maintain the \ncoverage for the 6 million children who have it in America across the \ncountry in almost every State in the country. They are not divided by \nDemocrat and Republican; they are children and their families, and they \nare part of the family of America. We have to make sure we maintain \ntheir coverage. At the same time, we have to expand coverage to begin \nto cover the 9 million who have no health insurance coverage at all.\n  What is the effect of this budget on these families? The Bush budget \nhas a funding shortfall over 5 years of $7 billion. That is a big \nnumber, but let us talk about that in terms of children. That is the \nmost important thing here. That $7 billion shortfall equates, by 2012, \nto 1.4 million children losing their coverage. We are still on problem \nNo. 1, those who have coverage who will lose it--1.4 million of them--\nif this budget goes through. That is what we are talking about when we \ntalk about this budget and this important program. But we have to make \nsure we do more than just maintain coverage; we have to make sure we \nexpand it for the millions of children who don't have health insurance.\n  I wish to conclude this morning with a couple of basic questions for \nthe President, for the Senate, and for the House. This is what every \nelected official in Washington has to answer when they vote on this \nbudget and when they vote on the question of the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  Question No. 1 for the President and for the Congress: Does the \nadministration and the Congress want 1.4 million children to lose their \nhealth insurance coverage? You can't have it both ways. If you vote for \nthe President's proposal, you are voting to cut 1.4 million kids from \nthe insurance rolls. That is question No. 1, and it is a ``yes'' or \n``no'' answer. There is no dodging that question.\n  Question No. 2: Are tax breaks for millionaires and multimillionaires \nand billionaires more important than the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program? Do they have a higher priority? Do their needs come \nahead of the children of working parents?\n  That is another question we have to answer because there will be \npeople in this town who will talk about the cost of expanding health \ninsurance coverage or even maintaining the coverage that is there. They \nwill say: Oh, that is going to cost lots of money. Well, I have to ask \nthem a basic question: Are the millionaires and billionaires who have \nbenefited year after year to the tune of hundreds of billions of \ndollars--is their tax cut more important than children? It is a ``yes'' \nor ``no'' answer, and that is what the Congress and the President have \nto answer.\n  Finally, No. 3, the basic question for today, tomorrow, but \nespecially for many years from now: Do you want the gross domestic \nproduct to grow? Do you want the American economy to grow? Because if \nyou answer that question ``yes,'' you cannot oppose the expansion of \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program. You cannot. We know the \nbenefits of providing health insurance to children. We know they will \ngo to school ready to learn. We know they will be healthier in school, \nthey will get higher test scores, and they will have the benefit of \nhigher education, hopefully, for many of them, and they will go on to \nachieve their full potential in the job market and help grow the \nAmerican economy. So if you care about the economy today, tomorrow, and \ninto the future, and you care about growing jobs, you must vote, in my \njudgment, to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Finally, it is about coverage. It is about maintaining that coverage, \nand it is about making sure 9 million kids have health insurance in the \nfuture. It is also making sure we do everything possible to reach every \nchild and make sure that child's family is utilizing the great services \nof the State Children's Health Insurance Program. If we meet this \nobligation to cover the kids who are covered now, to make sure their \ncoverage is maintained, and to cover the 9 million children, we will \nhave gone a long way toward meeting Hubert H. Humphrey's moral test of \ngovernment: to make sure we are taking care and helping children in the \ndawn of their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 22 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3155-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3155-S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             U.S. ATTORNEYS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have come here today to talk about the \npolitical firings of U.S. attorneys, which I believe raises serious \nconcerns over the administration's encroachment on the Senate's \nconstitutional responsibilities but now I also believe raises serious \nconcerns over the Attorney General's ability to serve. That is why I \ncome here today to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales's \nresignation.\n  There has been a lot of attention focused on U.S. attorneys over the \nlast couple of weeks, but this is an issue I have been involved with \nfor the last 9 months. I first realized a problem existed in July of \n2006. On February 6, 2007, I testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I won't repeat that testimony here, but I will focus on five \nfacts today, and these are undisputed facts. First, based on the e-\nmails produced by the Department of Justice, this administration set \nout to fire or replace U.S. attorneys, some without cause and in some \ncases for suspicious reasons.\n  Second, this is different from anything done in previous \nadministrations and includes putting a provision in the PATRIOT Act to \ncarry out their scheme.\n  Third, it started with the White House.\n  Fourth, it was carried out by the Attorney General.\n  Fifth, the Attorney General crossed a line by putting politics above \nthe pursuit of justice and has seriously damaged his stature and legacy \nin the process.\n  The first of these points is proven by e-mails from the Attorney \nGeneral's Office and the White House. The fifth\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\npoint is evidenced by the Attorney General's statements to me, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and his public statements.\n  Immediately after the 2004 elections, the White House began a scheme \nto replace all U.S. attorneys. The Attorney General joined in that plan \nin early 2005 but recommended to limit the number of U.S. attorneys who \nwould be replaced. During this process, the Attorney General identified \nU.S. attorneys to sacrifice to the White House demands.\n  In January 2006, the Attorney General sent a memorandum to the White \nHouse detailing obstacles that must be overcome before going forward \nwith the plan. One such obstacle was the Senate. So in March 2006 the \nAttorney General hatched another scheme to get around Senate \nconfirmation. During the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, the Attorney \nGeneral, with the apparent purpose of replacing U.S. attorneys, had a \nprovision slipped in during the Senate and House conference to allow \nthe Attorney General indefinite appointment authority.\n  After this plan came to light, the Attorney General responded by \nmisleading the American people. For example, in press interviews he \nsaid the Clinton administration had done something similar. That is not \ntrue. In an Attorney General memorandum dated January 9, 2006, it \nclearly says:\n\n       In recent memory, during the Reagan and Clinton \n     Administrations, Presidents Reagan and Clinton did not--\n\n  And that is underlined, did not--\n\n     seek to remove and replace U.S. Attorneys they had appointed \n     whose four-year terms had expired, but instead permitted such \n     U.S. Attorneys to serve indefinitely under the holdover \n     provision.\n\n  His own chief of staff has contradicted his public justification. \nOnce the decision became apparent that they were going to push out U.S. \nattorneys--which, by the way, is the term the Attorney General's Office \nuses in the September 17, 2006, memo to the White House, that they are \ngoing to ``push out'' U.S. attorneys--there began a clear and precise \nmethod to obfuscate and delay the confirmation process by lying to home \nState Senators, including me. I know this because I have e-mails that \nlay out the game plan on how to get around Senator Blanche Lincoln from \nArkansas and myself.\n  I have in my hand a plan to replace certain U.S. attorneys, dated \nNovember 15, 2006. This memo gives a five-step plan on how to do this \nand also how to talk about it.\n  Step No. 1 has specific talking points. Step No. 2 says to call and \nto contact Republican Senators. This is an important point. Step No. 2 \nsays the U.S. attorney--on step No. 2--should make these calls. The \nU.S. attorney says, on December 7: very important U.S. calls and \nAttorney General calls happen simultaneously. Mike Battle contact the \nfollowing U.S. attorneys.\n  So they do that, and I'm sorry, in step No. 1 they contact Jon Kyl, \nJohn Ensign, Pete Domenici. And then it says, ``the California \npolitical lead, the Michigan political lead, and the Washington \npolitical lead.''\n  Please notice, there are no Democrats who were contacted about this; \nnot even a courtesy call from the White House or the Justice \nDepartment. Only calls made to Republicans. If there is not a \nDemocratic Senator in that State it just says ``to the State's \npolitical lead.''\n  Clearly, this was a partisan effort on the part of Justice.\n  I believe the Attorney General crossed a line when they chose to go \nthe partisan route on U.S. attorneys. Now the Attorney General states \nthat he was unaware of all the details of their plans that were hatched \nby his chief of staff. I do not believe this for a minute. I know that \nan e-mail written on December 19, 2006, on how to get around Senator \nLincoln and myself is exactly what Attorney General Alberto Gonzales \nsaid to me in a telephone conversation.\n  In fact, by way of background, I had called the White House and the \nAttorney General to ask them to please nominate a suitable nominee for \nU.S. attorney in Arkansas. They had canned or pushed out Bud Cummins. \nThey were going to, or were about to, do an interim appointment for Tim \nGriffin. I asked them to please not do that and please send someone \nthrough the confirmation process. If it was Tim Griffin, send him \nthrough. I couldn't say I was going to vote for him, but please send \nhim through.\n  The December 19, 2006, memo is very enlightening. It is from Kyle \nSampson, chief of staff to Alberto Gonzales. It is to Christopher G. \nOprison, apparently at the White House. Again, this is from the chief \nof staff of the Attorney General.\n\n       My thoughts: 1. I think we should gum this to death: ask \n     the Senators--\n\n  And they are talking about Senator Lincoln and myself--\n\n     ask the Senators to give Tim a chance, meet with him, give \n     him some time in office to see how he performs, etc. If they \n     ultimately say ``no, never'' (and the longer we can \n     forestall that the better), then we can tell them we'll \n     look for other candidates, ask them for recommendations, \n     evaluate the recommendations, interview their candidates, \n     and otherwise run out the clock.\n\n  This is an e-mail from the Attorney General's chief of staff to the \nWhite House.\n\n       All of this should be done in ``good faith'' of course.\n\n  When they put ``good faith'' in quotes, that tells me they are going \nin bad faith. They are not going in good faith, but they are giving the \nappearance of good faith in order to run out the clock.\n  No. 2 says:\n\n       Officially, Tim is the U.S. Attorney and will identify \n     himself as such on pleadings and other official documents. I \n     think it's fine for us to refer to him as an ``interim U.S. \n     Attorney'' in talking points, with the understanding that by \n     ``interim U.S. Attorney'' we mean [Attorney General] \n     appointed, (as opposed to Presidentially-appointed and Senate \n     confirmed) U.S. Attorney.\n\n  No. 3:\n\n       Overall, I think we should take the temperature way down--\n     our guy is in there so the status quo is good for us. Ask for \n     them to consider him; note that he is qualified and doing a \n     good job whenever asked . . .\n\n  Here, again, they are telling him to tell us that he is doing a good \njob whenever asked. He hadn't been in office but 1 day when this thing \nwas written. So, again, they are setting up a deception on the front \nend.\n\n     . . . pledge to desire a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney; and \n     otherwise hunker down.\n\n  No. 4:\n\n       The only thing really at risk here is a repeal of the AG's \n     appointment authority.\n\n  You bet your life that is what is at risk because we are going to \nhave that vote later today or tomorrow or Monday or Tuesday or at some \npoint, and absolutely that is what is at risk because I think the \nSenate should change that law and should take that provision out of the \nPATRIOT Act, that they snuck in in the dark hours in a conference.\n\n       We intend to have DOJ legislative affairs people on notice \n     to work hard to preserve this (House members won't care about \n     this; all we really need is for one Senator to object to \n     language being added to legislative vehicles that are moving \n     through). There is some risk that we'll lose the authority, \n     but if we don't ever exercise it then what's the point of \n     having it? (I'm not 100 percent sure that Tim was the guy on \n     which to test drive this authority, but know that getting him \n     appointed was important to Harriet, Karl, etc.\n\n  I could spend all day talking about this memo. But, basically, in \nhere they say that the Attorney General is going to tell us, Senator \nLincoln and me, about six or seven things, and they did every single \none of them. This is the playbook. They say ask the Senators to give \nhim a chance. Attorney General Gonzales did ask me that. Meet with him. \nHe asked me to, and I did. Give him some time in office. He asked for \nthat, even though usually people don't get a little test drive before \nthey get appointed. He asked me--they wanted to delay, just run out the \nclock.\n  At one point he said if I am not happy they will interview other \ncandidates that I am interested in. They also mentioned for me to \nconsider him and to look at him in a way that he is doing a good job.\n  Here, again, every single thing in this memo was done. Again, this is \nthe playbook. This is why I feel lied to. The truth is, I was lied to \nbecause I was told that the Attorney General--and he not only said it \nto me, he said it to the Senate Judiciary Committee and he said it to \nthe world--the Attorney General wanted a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney \nin every slot. That is absolutely not true in Arkansas based on this e-\nmail from the Justice Department.\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n  I assure you when they put ``good faith'' in quotes that means they \nare not proceeding in good faith. They didn't proceed in good faith \nwith me, and that is one of the reasons I think Attorney General \nGonzales should resign immediately. I do not think he has the \ncredibility to run that department anymore.\n  Let me tell you this. I was one of six Democratic Senators who \nsupported Attorney General Gonzales' nomination and confirmation. I \nsupported the PATRIOT Act. Not all Democrats did. I have worked closely \nwith this Attorney General. I have always tried to deal with them and \nreach out to them and have a constructive, positive relationship. I \nbelieve that is what the people in Arkansas want me to do, and that is \nexactly what I have done.\n  But on this issue, Attorney General Gonzales has broken faith with \nme, he has broken faith with the Senate, and he has broken faith with \nthe people of Arkansas. When an Attorney General of this country, who I \nbelieve should be held to a higher standard--not a political standard \nbut a high standard of integrity because he should be all about \njustice, not politics; he should be all about justice--when the \nAttorney General lies to a United States Senator, I think it is time \nfor that Attorney General to go.\n  Again, he not only lied to me as a person, but when he lied to me, he \nlied to the Senate, and he lied to the people I represent. For that \nreason I am asking him and demanding that he resign today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on a \ndifferent matter, but I want to compliment my colleague from Arkansas, \nwho is not only a colleague and a true Arkansan but a great leader. I \nappreciate the passion that he feels and the issue that he deals with \nand feel very blessed to have him as my colleague from the State of \nArkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Many of us believe that the events at the U.S. \nAttorney's Office and how they have been handled by the administration \nhave been a real disservice to the people of this country and to the \nprocesses that provide the transparency so that our great democracy can \nwork, so that the wheels of this great democracy can turn and the \npeople feel confident and trusting in their Government because these \nprocesses have worked and provided that transparency. To have \neliminated the processes, or to circumvent the process that provided \nthat transparency, the administration has presented a real disservice \nto the people of this country and to the justice system and what it \nrepresents. So I applaud my colleague for so many of his comments today \non that very issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3157-S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THANKING STEVE PATTERSON\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this morning \nwith a little bit of sadness but, more importantly, a tremendous amount \nof joy in my heart to salute an individual who has meant so much to me \nand to pay tribute and to say thanks to a very dear friend and longtime \nchief of staff of mine, Steve Patterson. For the better part of 12 \nyears, Steve Patterson, or as we call him in our office, ``Patterson,'' \nas he is known to me and to my staff, has faithfully served the people \nof Arkansas, as well as me.\n  He has been my most trusted adviser in both the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate. Words cannot fully describe the \nmeaningful impact Steve Patterson has had on both my personal and \nprofessional life. When I first decided to run for the Senate, my \nhusband said: We are in, but only if Steve Patterson is in. He has \nmeant so much to our entire family. I know the comfort and counsel he \nprovided my mother.\n  In so many ways, he has been one of those people who you know from \nyour professional side of life is so critically important, but from \nyour personal side of life now is an unbelievable individual in all he \nhas done and accomplished.\n  When I think of Steve Patterson, there are a few words that stand \nout: integrity, solid conviction, justice, fairness. All of the words \neach and every one of us strives for in our everyday life I see in this \nindividual, who has meant and continues to mean so much to me.\n  For the past 25 years Steve has been one of the most loyal and hard-\nworking servants in Government. He has been a team player as far as a \ncongressional team is concerned. He is big on team sports. But more \nimportantly, he is incredibly devoted to the team spirit the country \nhas and needs to be the success it is. I consider him a true confidant \nand will most assuredly miss him in that position.\n  Steve was born in Oklahoma City in 1950 but grew up in Alva, OK, \nwhere he graduated high school. He attended the University of Oklahoma \nin Norman but eventually transferred to Oklahoma State University where \nhe graduated with a degree in journalism, and I have to say, \nunfortunately for my colleagues in Oklahoma who have adopted him, he \nhas moved to Arkansas and he is one of our own now.\n  According to his wife Jean, Steve was always very interested in \npolitics. One of her first memories was when she and Steve were friends \nat Oklahoma State waiting to vote for the first time in the 1972 \nPresidential election. To give you an idea of how far we have come in \nthe issue of election reform in the last 35 years, Jean told me they \nwaited in line for what seemed like an eternity to cast their very \nfirst ever vote in, of all places, the laundry room of someone's home \non the top of a washer and dryer. Before they could even get to the \nballot box, they learned their candidate, George McGovern, was in the \nprocess of being defeated by Richard Nixon in a landslide. But you know \nwhat, they continued to wait in line. They voted despite the outcome \nthey knew was probable because of their true convictions.\n  The experience of that election crushed a lot of young people and it \ncaused them to turn away from the political process but not Steve \nPatterson. He has always wanted to make a difference and he has never \ncowered from any of the challenges that are faced when you have a \nconviction. He has got that conviction for many reasons, not because he \nloved this great country, not because he loves his family, not because \nhe loves his fellow man, but for all of those reasons.\n  Shortly before he moved to Washington, Steve served as political \nreporter for various newspapers in Oklahoma and was working for the \nLawton Constitution when newly elected Congressman Dave McCurdy asked \nSteve to become his press secretary. They had gone to college together, \nand there was a group of them, when Dave McCurdy was running for \nCongress, who all worked together to reach a common dream. The decision \nwas not an easy one, however. When Steve moved to Washington, he was a \nsingle father, a very devoted single father. Money was tight in those \ndays and the hours were long. He and my long-time systems \nadministrator, who is still with me, Thirise Brown, were both young \nsingle parents and would on occasion have to bring their children to \nwork. It is hard to imagine, or is it? Actually we see a lot of that \nthese days.\n  Steve's daughter Paige and Thirise's daughter Tiki would often be \noblivious to the major hard work that was being accomplished around \nthem, and would have a great time getting into all sorts of trouble, \nwatching as their two single parents worked desperately hard, not only \nin their conviction to provide for their children but also to make this \ncountry great.\n  Although Steve began as a press secretary, he quickly worked his way \nup to Chief of Staff. He was the Chief of Staff to my good friend \nCongressman Dave McCurdy and continued in that capacity until 1994. \nShortly after, Steve became my Chief of Staff, joined me in my House \ntimes when I was in the House of Representatives. We were there \ntogether for 2 short years until I retired from the House to be with my \nnewborn twins. Steve went to work for then Representative Jim Turner as \nhis Chief of Staff. But it was not long until I was back on my feet and \ndecided I was going to run for the Senate.\n  I begged Steve Patterson to move to Arkansas and to run my Senate \ncampaign. The rest, as they say, is history. During our time together, \nSteve taught me so much and helped me gain the necessary skills to \nsurvive and navigate the tough political environment.\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nWhen Steve came on, he quickly proved himself to be one of the most \ncapable and effective managers on Capitol Hill. I think that is \ncertainly in the proof today with the many friends he has, of staffers \nand consultants and others in this town who have tremendous respect \nboth for his opinion and his judgment.\n  You would be hard pressed to find a man with a greater drive, a \ngreater competitiveness, or a greater work ethic anywhere. He truly \nloved working, as he always puts it, to change America and to make it \nbetter. One of Steve's greatest assets that continually blessed me is \nhis ability to identify talented young people and give them the \nconfidence and the ability to become outstanding professionals.\n  He never approached the young staff on Capitol Hill with a \ncondescending attitude. It was always an attitude of empowerment: What \nis it you can do today with the talent you have, and how is it you can \ndevelop the new talents you need to take those next steps you need to \ntake to reach that ultimate goal.\n  How incredibly important to have people in our lives who empower us \nto reach our potential and to reach our goals, to reach for the stars, \nnot just for ourselves but for our great country, and for those whom we \nlove. There is no greater blessing than to see someone who gives of \nhimself to make sure others can reach their potential.\n  Steve has mentored young men and women on my staff who have gone on \nto become House and Senate Chiefs of Staff, congressional State \ndirectors, campaign managers, State party directors, and a multitude of \nother positions. Steve also encouraged those in my office who showed \ngreat aptitude to continually challenge themselves and take on new \nresponsibilities, never to shut a door or an opportunity they may have \nthought was too big or out of their realm, but encouraged them to do as \nmuch as they possibly could and to reach for those stars.\n\n  Nearly all of my current senior staff served me in some shape, form, \nor fashion, whether as an intern, a staff assistant, or a legislative \ncorrespondent before being promoted to their current position, and they \ndid so with the recommendations of Steve Patterson, who said: Learn all \nthe jobs in this office so you can talk about and know what it takes to \nmake this office tick and to make it great.\n  Steve left me in capable hands, and I truly believe Steve's ability \nto nurture so many of the best and brightest political minds our State \nhas to offer will be one of his lasting legacies.\n  But what also makes Steve special is he was more than a great boss to \nmy staff; he has been a tremendously great friend to me and to my \nfamily.\n  Steve is a self-described Green Bay Packers and Cincinnati Reds \nfanatic as well as an Oklahoma Sooner and Oklahoma State Cowboy \nsupporter. Steve was known to be commissioner or at least participated \nin fantasy football and baseball leagues with the staff. March was not \ncomplete without the famous Patterson annual March Madness pool. We \nthink about it now as we move into those basketball playoffs.\n  Steve was an avid Senate softball player in his earlier days and took \nup golf in his later days. He loved getting the staff, both male and \nfemale, outside the office for these kinds of great activities of \ncoming together in fellowship and fun and making sure our office was \ntight, not just in the responsibilities we had to accomplish but in the \nfriendships we could build and things we should share with one another \nin helping each other to grow in our stature and in our \naccomplishments.\n  It was his passion for those things that endeared him to them and \nbuilt bonds that went between the typical employer-employee \nrelationship. It is what also made our office strong and will continue \nto make our office strong as we see the quality in all of those \nattributes we build both professionally as well as the fellowship with \nour fellow man.\n  Lastly, I couldn't talk about Steve Patterson if I did not mention \nwhat a terrific family man he is. ``Punchy,'' as he is known in his \nfamily, was a wonderful son and is an exceptional husband and a father. \nIn 1984 Steve married Jean, and shortly thereafter, they had a daughter \ntogether, Megan. Steve was devoted to both Paige, his first daughter, \nand Megan.\n  While in Virginia, he was active as a soccer coach for almost 10 \nyears. Many of our staff remember this decked-out van he drove. He \nloved his van because he loved the time he spent in it traveling the \nState and the parameters of the State of Virginia with his girls on \nsoccer tournaments. He drove to work in the van, but on the trips his \ndaughters went on with the soccer tournaments, it was transformed. It \nwas a home unto itself and he loved it.\n  He was more than a loving father, he was also a caring son. I was \nable to see that. His parents came to live with his family in 1985 when \nhis mother was ill with breast cancer. Steve, Jean, and the girls cared \nfor his mom until she passed away in 1994. I talk oftentimes about my \nown family, my grandmother living with us when I was growing up and \nwhat an incredible experience it brought to me and to our family. I \ncould see Steve saw the value not only in what he could do and the love \nhe could share and provide for his mother and father but also what it \nmeant to his family to be a part of a larger giving in love.\n  When Steve moved to Little Rock in 2003 to run my Senate reelection \nbid, his father moved with them and they lived in Little Rock until he \npassed away in 2004. Steve's father had suffered from diabetes, and his \naffliction led to Steve's involvement as chairman of the Central \nArkansas American Diabetes Association.\n  Giving back to the community was always a tremendous priority for \nhim. As can you see, Steve Patterson is one of a kind. We will \ncertainly miss him in the office. But I take comfort in the fact he \nwill not be too far away--always an arm's reach or a phone call away--\nhe has guaranteed me that.\n  He has now chosen a new career path and has opened a political \nconsulting firm with two of my former staffers in Little Rock. They are \ndoing great things, working hard and enjoying life. In his new tenure \nhe will specialize in fundraising, strategic planning, and grassroots \ncoalition building, which is something he is unbelievably talented at.\n  Life's journey is a great journey and the road we travel is one, as \nwe look back, that provides us so many opportunities, so many \nblessings. I cannot think of a greater blessing than to be able to \ntravel that road with a great friend such as Steve Patterson, not only \nin the past but in the future, in the many years ahead.\n  I am enormously grateful, Steve. I wish you the best of luck in your \nnew endeavor. I know you will be successful as you embark on your new \npath. I cannot thank you enough for all you have done for me and so \nmany others throughout your career in service to Government. From the \nbottom of my heart, thank you for your faithful friendship, your \nservice to me, the great State of Arkansas, and without a doubt your \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, I rise to talk again to the resolution \npending on the floor. I look forward to having the debate continue on \nthe other options for the resolution.\n  I am against the resolution on the floor because I do not see a \npurpose. I do not see a purpose for a nonbinding resolution that makes \nAmerica look irresolute. What could we be thinking to try to take \nsomething across the floor of the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives that would give any signal to our allies or to our \nenemies that we cannot finish a job, that the war on terrorism is \nimportant but not important enough to see it through?\n  I think of the young men and women who have died in this war. They \nare giving their lives, the ultimate sacrifice, as part of their legacy \nto our country. They are leaving something for our children and \ngrandchildren and their children and grandchildren.\n\n  If we pass nonbinding resolutions that undercut the mission and the \npurpose for which they have given their lives, which is the war on \nterror, to keep freedom in America, we would be doing a great \ndisservice that is undeserved for those great patriots. Our young men \nand women throughout the years have been willing to go into the \nvolunteer service. The people who are fighting in this war are \nvolunteers.\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nWe have had volunteers and even people who didn't volunteer in past \nwars to make sure that America stood strong for freedom. I cannot \nimagine that the Congress during World War II would have passed a \nnonbinding resolution to say: We don't think our troops should be in \nEurope.\n  We are sinking to new lows. I hope we can resist the political winds \nthat have caused us to get to this point. The only reason we would pass \na nonbinding resolution is to send a political message. I don't think \nthe Senators who have stood on this floor for decades before us would \nhave passed resolutions that meant nothing except to send a message \nthat would undercut our troops in the field.\n  Do the people who want to pass a resolution such as this believe this \nisn't an important war? We are fighting for our children's futures \nevery bit as much as we have in any conflict in which we have been \nengaged. We are fighting to keep terrorists from coming back to America \nand threatening our way of life and the opportunity that America offers \nfor our children. If we look irresolute, if we look weak, if we look as \nif we can't be strong, we will put a blemish on the sacrifice that has \nbeen made already by so many of our young men and women, and we will \nundercut those who are serving right now in the theater in Iraq. I \ncan't imagine, when we think this through, that that would be the \ncourse that a deliberative Senate would take.\n  The President of the United States knows we have not achieved the \nsuccess we hoped to. For that reason, he is taking a different course. \nAny one of us in Congress might have done it a different way. There is \nno question that many in Congress are concerned about the mission. That \ndoes not mean we take the step of a nonbinding resolution that says we \ndon't support the Commander in Chief. The Constitution didn't provide \nfor Congress to command our military. The Constitution provides one \nCommander in Chief, not 535. It would be so wrong for 535 people to \nsecond-guess the Commander in Chief, who has announced that the plan he \nhas put forward is one that was made in the military.\n  Many of us talked to General Petraeus. We asked questions, because \nthere are questions about embedding our troops in the field outside the \nprotected zone. General Petraeus totally defends the plan. He takes the \nresponsibility for the plan. He believes it will work. In fact, there \nare signs things are getting better. There are signs the Iraqi \nGovernment is strengthening its measures to crack down on insurgents, \nmilitias, any of the groups that have been killing innocent people. \nThere are signs that there are ways this could succeed.\n  During one of the Senate Armed Services Committee hearings, Senator \nLieberman asked General Petraeus if a resolution such as we are voting \non today would give the enemy some encouragement, some clear expression \nthat the American people were divided. General Petraeus answered:\n\n       That is correct, sir.\n\n  We have been talking about this for the 2 months-plus that we have \nbeen in this session of Congress. We certainly talked about it all last \nyear. We will continue to talk about it. I hope what we say on the \nfloor is carefully crafted so we can disagree with people who do \nsupport this resolution, and we can do it based on the Constitution, on \nprinciples of war, on the relationship that Congress should have with \nthe President. All of these are legitimate. There can be disagreements \nabout what is the best approach for finding success, but what we cannot \ndisagree about is that we must win the war on terror, we must show \nAmerica's commitment, and we will not undercut our troops who are in \nharm's way today.\n  I have seen all the iterations of the resolutions that have been \nproposed by the majority. They have changed many times. Some of those \nresolutions even set deadlines for us to withdraw troops. What do my \ncolleagues think that does for the troops who are there right now? If \nour enemy knows we are going to start the withdrawal of troops on a \ncertain deadline, what does that do to their treatment of the people \nwho are on the ground right now? They would consider that we have put a \nbull's-eye on every one of our young men and women with boots on the \nground right now. It would be akin to saying: We are going to leave \nhere so whoever is here now is not going to have the support needed to \nfinish this job. If we are not going to finish the job, why wouldn't \nthey step up their efforts, which is exactly what they would do.\n  We have to look at the reality. No matter what kind of front we would \nput on a resolution that shows that we do not have the resolve, the \ncommitment to see this through, it will embolden the terrorists. When \nthe terrorists think we are going to leave or that we can't take it, \nthat we have to start an exit without regard to the success of the \nmission, then what would keep them from beginning to take over Iraq, \nmake it a terrorist haven, make it the training ground from which they \ncould proliferate weapons of mass destruction and terrorists all over \nthe world? We have already seen that in many specific instances. This \nwould give them a bigger field in which to train, one that is not going \nto be necessary to hide. It will give them more revenue to produce \nweapons that could hurt even more.\n  I have cosponsored S. Res. 70, the McCain resolution, which renews \nour commitment to defeating the terrorists in Iraq and winning the war. \nThat is a resolution that we should all support. Congress has the right \nto cut off funds, but I cannot imagine that responsible Members of this \nbody would vote for a resolution that would cut off funds and say we \nare not going to give the troops who are there the equipment, training, \nand protection they need to do the job. That would be unthinkable. That \nis one of the resolutions also pending for us to address.\n  Losing this war will not make America safer. This is a war that must \nbe fought. It must be won, not just for the sake of the Iraqi people. \nIt is for the sake of America. It is for the sake of freedom. It is \nwiping out terrorists where they are so they do not harm innocent \npeople in America again.\n  I hope cooler heads will prevail. I hope this deliberative body that \nhas a great history for our country and in the world will see we should \nnot be taking the political position. We should not be testing the \npolitical winds because what we say has consequences. What we say can \nbe used as propaganda against our troops who are in harm's way. Most \ncertainly, it can be used to embolden those who are training right now \nto attack America.\n  I hope, in the end, we will defeat the Reid resolution, that we will \ntake up some of the other resolutions, and we will keep in mind that \nwhat we say and the longer we talk about it, the more dangerous it can \nbecome for our troops and for the likely success of the mission that is \nbefore us. We want the Iraqi Government to take the responsibility for \nthe safety and security of the Iraqi people. What do Senators think the \nIraqi Government is going to do to make that happen, if they think \nAmerica's resolve is wavering, if they think we might set a deadline in \nwhich to leave, if they think we might start a graceful exit before \nthey have the ability achieve security?\n  We can't let the Iraqi Government think we are going to plan for an \nexit before we have won the war, secured Iraq, kept the terrorists from \nhaving a training ground and revenue to harm more innocent people in \nthe world or we will not be standing for the traditions and the spirit \nand the commitment to freedom that Americans have made throughout the \ngenerations of our country.\n  That is not a legacy I think any Member of the Senate would want to \nleave. I certainly do not want to leave that legacy for my children and \ngrandchildren, nor for the children and the next generation of the \nState I represent and love so much, the State of Texas, nor for the \nchildren and grandchildren of Americans, the country I am serving. I \nhope we will not forget exactly what our legacy will be if we do the \npolitical thing rather than the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, who is indispensable to the Senate.\n  Today we are confronted with a struggle that could very well define \nthe world in which our children and their children will live. Many will \nsay this statement is hyperbole or politically\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nexpedient and designed to disguise a troubled policy. I only wish that \nwere so.\n  Today we are fighting to prevent Iraq and Afghanistan from \ndisintegrating into failed states, where that chaos will be exploited \nby those who wish to undermine--and even destroy--mainstream Muslim and \nWestern civilization.\n  In the past, these terrorists used Afghanistan and other developing \nnations as safe havens from which attacks against Americans were \nplanned and executed throughout the world. One hardly needs to be \nreminded of the bombings of our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania or the \nattack on the USS Cole to see this is true, not to mention the events \nof September 11, 2001.\n  What would happen if we were to permit these terrorists, and others \nwho wish us ill, to have another such safe haven? Of what would they be \ncapable? Just today we have read in the papers of Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed's confession to many of the world's worst acts of terrorism. \nRemember that from Afghanistan, a country without significant \ninfrastructure or resources, these terrorists were able to orchestrate \nthe greatest attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor. Just imagine \nwhat their capabilities would be if they were able to control only a \nfraction of the oil wealth of Iraq. Is that the world in which we want \nour children and our grandchildren to live--a world in which \nuncertainty and fear become a part of everyday life?\n  As one prominent Democrat stated before he reversed his position and \nannounced his intention to run for President:\n\n        . . . we cannot and will not retreat. We will defend \n     ourselves and defeat the enemies of freedom and progress.\n\n  Were mistakes made in the conflict in Iraq?\n  In a word, yes. I am sad to say important errors were made. Perhaps \none of the greatest occurred over the past 30 years right here in our \nNation's Capital. Past and present administrations, Congresses, and \nDepartment of Defense leaders primarily concentrated on training and \nequipping our forces to fight what is called in military circles ``The \nBig War.''\n  In such a conflict, large formations of mechanized divisions, corps, \nand armies seek to fight decisive battles on a conventional \nbattlefield. This is not to say maintaining such a capability is no \nlonger vital to our national security. It remains an absolute \nnecessity.\n  However, in large part, due to the resolve of many of our military \nleaders not to fight ``another Vietnam,'' for the bulk of our Armed \nForces, the skills necessary to fight a counterinsurgency had withered \nand atrophied. This is exemplified by the fact that the Army-Marine \nCorps Doctrine for Counterinsurgency had not been updated for 20 years, \nuntil December of 2006.\n  As General Petraeus, our new commander in Iraq, wrote 1 year ago:\n\n       [T]he insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan were not in \n     truth the wars for which we were best prepared in 2001; \n     however, they are the wars we are fighting and they clearly \n     are the kind of wars we must master.\n\n  Other dire mistakes were made.\n  Many of those errors can be directly attributed to the decisions made \nby the Coalition Provisional Authority which originated from or were \nratified by the senior civilian leadership at the Pentagon at the time. \nThis includes the decision to disband the Iraqi Army without providing \nalternative means for the employing and sustaining of its former \nmembers. These former Iraqi soldiers went on to become the foundation \nof the initial insurgency. We might have been able to prevent that had \nwe chosen another route.\n  Another mistake was the decision to eliminate the first three levels \nof leadership, not only in Government ministries but hospitals, \nuniversities, and Government-run corporations. Managers, no matter how \njunior, who were members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist Party were \nremoved. The result was those who had the managerial experience best \nsuited to rebuild Iraq's institutions were arbitrarily dismissed, even \nif they had not played any role in Saddam's atrocities.\n  In sum, many of the problems we confront today are as a result of our \nown shortsightedness and the administration's failure to fully and \ncomprehensively develop and execute a plan for stabilization of Iraq \nafter the fall of the Saddam regime.\n  So how do we go forward? We do have options.\n  Some, such as the authors and supporters of S.J. Res. 9, argue that \nwe should unilaterally bring the bulk of our forces home from Iraq. Yet \nwe all know what would happen if that were to occur. Iraq would be a \nfailed state offering a safe haven for terrorists, not to mention the \nthousands and thousands of Iraqis who would be killed. Those who make \nthis argument forget--or perhaps they do not know--that unlike our war \nin Vietnam, we face an enemy who is religiously committed to bringing \nthe fight here to our shores. If the terrorists know we will withdraw \nthe bulk of our forces in 120 days, as this legislation calls for, all \nthe enemy has to do is husband its resources or ``lie low'' until that \ndate. Perhaps the terrorists will launch fewer attacks to lull us into \na false sense of security that this defeatist strategy is working. \nThen, with the cold calculation for which these terrorists have become \nnotorious, they will spring on the Iraqi people before their \nGovernment's institutions--which were completely destroyed in 2003--can \nmature and fully take over the reins of fighting and defeating this \ninsurgency.\n\n  These are not compelling options. At their core these ``solutions'' \ndo not have the goal of victory but consist of resignation to an \ninevitable defeat.\n  So how do we win? How do we defeat the terrorists and give the Iraqi \npeople a fighting chance to claim a destiny of their own, a destiny \nthat is based upon peace and the rule of law? The answer is not simple, \nbut what great endeavor ever was?\n  First, we must learn from our mistakes. Then we must implement a \nstrategy that harnesses the tactics and strategies that have defeated \nother insurgents in the past and apply those lessons to the conflict in \nIraq. That is what our new strategy, called Operation Fard al-Qanun--\nwhich is Arabic for ``enforcing the law''--sets out to achieve.\n  So what is this operation's strategic objective? Once again, I \nbelieve General Petraeus said it best at his confirmation hearing. He \nsaid:\n\n       [T]he mission . . . will be modified, making security of \n     the population, particularly in Baghdad and in partnership \n     with the Iraqi force, the focus of the military effort.\n\n  I could not agree more. Creating a secure environment is the \nessential task. This is accomplished not just by conducting operations \nto clear an area of insurgents but by maintaining an American/Iraqi \nsecurity force in cleared areas which assists in providing essential \nservices such as clean water and power to the local population and \nenforcing the rule of law. This, in turn, creates conditions where the \nIraqi people can begin to develop a growing economy and where families \nfeel safe to send their children to school. As these goals are \nachieved, more and more of the population will desire even greater \nstability and will support and work toward creating Iraqi Government \ninstitutions and security services that maintain and enhance this new \nsecurity environment.\n  How is this strategy different from past endeavors? Unfortunately, in \nthe past there were far too few American and capable Iraqi forces \navailable to provide adequate security once an area had been cleared \nand, frankly, there are cases where political impediments prevented us \nfrom providing adequate security. That is why the additional forces we \nare sending to Iraq are so important. It is not more for more's sake \nbut to maintain a secure environment for the Iraqi people.\n  This does not mean that our forces will be going it alone. Far from \nit. A key principle of the new strategy is to enhance and strengthen \nour efforts to advise and train the Iraqi military and police forces so \nthey may eventually take over primary responsibility for the defense of \ntheir own nation. We must also remember that training was one of the \nmajor recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. Indeed, one of the \nmembers of my own party, who has authored legislation disagreeing with \nthis new strategy--despite voting for the nomination of its \nimplementer, General Petraeus--stated that Iraqi forces:\n\n       . . . while they're not fully independently capable of \n     operating, they're excellent and trustworthy and fighting \n     hard with our troops today . . . I would be willing to serve \n     alongside those Iraqi forces.\n\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\n\n  I believe it is also important to add that, as of last week, three of \nthe four Iraqi battalions that recently entered Baghdad were at above \n100 percent troop strength. Another vital element is our new commander \nin Iraq, General David Petraeus. I can think of no better choice for \nimplementing our new strategy.\n  General Petraeus has long been a student of counterinsurgency \nwarfare. In the 1980s, when he received his Ph.D. from Princeton, he \nclosely studied counterinsurgency operations.\n  During the initial race to Baghdad, the General commanded the 101st \nAirborne Division, and he is largely credited with devising and \nimplementing a strategy that secured the city of Mosul immediately \nafter the initial combat phase.\n  Later, when he commanded our effort to train the Iraqi Army, General \nPetraeus implemented the Transition Team concept. A Transition Team is \ncomposed of a group of advisers, primarily officers and seasoned \nnoncommissioned officers, who serve with Iraqi units from those units' \ninception, including basic and advanced training and eventually combat \noperations. This is an important strategy, since experienced U.S. \nsoldiers learn firsthand the operational characteristics and \nrequirements of Iraqi units and tailor a training program to fit the \nunits' needs. It also provides a detailed analysis of the individual \nIraqi units' combat capabilities. General Petraeus was also one of the \nauthors of the updated Army/Marine Corps Field Manual on \nCounterinsurgency which was published in December of last year.\n  I do not know of any other officer with the intellect and experience \nnecessary to carry out successfully this new strategy and win the war \nin Iraq. He has my confidence and apparently the confidence of most \neveryone in the Senate since 100 percent voted for him and he clearly \narticulated this new strategy. But what he needs is our support and \ntime to carry out his new strategy.\n  One must also remember that all of the additional forces needed to \nfully implement this new strategy will not be in place until early \nJune.\n  As the General stated in a recent news conference:\n\n       We are, in any event, still in the early days of this \n     endeavor, an endeavor that will take months, not days or \n     weeks, to fully implement, and one that will have to be \n     sustained to achieve its desired effect. . . . I have been on \n     occasion bemused by people ``Hey, how's it going? Have you \n     won yet?'' And the answer is we've just started. Just the \n     second of five brigades [has arrived]. . . . Our soldiers are \n     resolute. They want to see this succeed, as do their Iraqi \n     counterparts, and that is exactly what we're endeavoring to \n     do.\n\n  So what do we offer him and the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \ncoastguardsmen under his command? We offer guaranteed defeat in the \nform of a joint resolution.\n  But with great respect for General Petraeus, I believe we have \nalready seen some preliminary success. For example, Richard Engel, an \nNBC News reporter who has lived in Iraq for the past few years covering \nthe war, responded just last month about our change in tactics. He \nsaid:\n\n       Night and day. There's a radically new war plan under way \n     in Baghdad right now. For the past four years, U.S. troops \n     have been on main bases, most of them outside the city \n     center, some of them in Baghdad itself, and then have been \n     effectively commuting to work. Now they live at work, they're \n     living in small forward operating bases. . . . It is a very \n     different strategy. We're seeing foot patrols again that we \n     haven't seen in Baghdad for a long time, more hearts and \n     minds campaign. . . . It's very much a new war. A lot of \n     people say that this feels like '03, that the war is starting \n     again and that this is a new battle plan. The battle plan to \n     end the war in Iraq and finally establish some sort of \n     stability.\n\n  I would also like to address a matter that, more than any other, has \nweighed on my heart over the past few years. That question is, Do we, \nnot just as a nation but as a people, have the will to see our \nobligations through? This has always been an important question. But \nnow, during an insurgent war, where the side with the greatest will, \nnot technological advantage, will generally emerge victorious, it has \nbecome the essential question.\n  So now we must ask ourselves: Do we have the will to see right \ntriumph? Do we as Americans believe in making sacrifices for the \ngreater good? History provides an answer.\n\n  Almost 230 years ago, the Continental Army began a retreat, or more \naccurately a route, from Brooklyn Heights over the island of Manhattan \ninto New Jersey and then across the Delaware River. General Washington \nhad fewer than 1,000 troops and was confronted by the greatest Army of \nthe day. The Continental's enlistments were up and many soldiers, \nlacking basic supplies and even food, were making plans to go home. For \nall intensive purposes, the American experiment in democracy, where all \nmen were to be treated equal, was about to end.\n  Then something miraculous happened. A writer named Thomas Paine wrote \na pamphlet entitled ``Crisis.'' But panic was not his essay's subject. \nHe wrote about commitment and faith that freedom would one day be \nvictorious. His words still echo today:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink \n     from the service of his country; but he that stands it now \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\n  Shortly, after the Continental Army heard these words, the morale, \nwhich had been crushed by the cold winters of New Jersey, was restored \nenough for General Washington to launch the raids on Trenton and \nPrinceton, thus saving the young Republic.\n  Commitment and faith had been restored--the faith that freedom is \nworth fighting for, that it is worth sacrificing for, and that is what \nwe as a Nation must remember now more than ever.\n  I see the leaders are on the floor, and I will not take any more \ntime, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say these few minutes Senator \nMcConnell and I have spent on the floor have been just a brief \ninterlude, but getting to this point has taken hours and hours of \npeople's time. I think we are at a point now where we have had a good \ndebate over the last several days and we will have one today. We are \nmoving into another contentious issue, which will be resolved Tuesday \nmorning. So I think we have made great progress. I think it speaks well \nof the Senate, in spite of the closeness of the margin between \nDemocrats and Republicans, that we are able to get things done. \nSometimes it is a slow process in getting things done, but I am \nconfident this is good for the body and the country.\n  Mr. President, also it is important that everyone be notified--we \nwere scheduled to have a vote Monday at 5:00 or 5:30--that it is not \nnecessary. We have a lot of work going on. We have the debate on the \nbudget that will take some time. We are going to complete this U.S. \nattorneys issue and we are going to complete three judges today. So in \nshort, there is no need to have a judge's vote, though we have two \nremaining on the calendar, and I think we will accomplish what we need \nto do. So there will be no votes on Monday night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority \nleader with regard to the painstaking process he and I have been \nthrough over the last day and a half trying to reach an agreement on \nthe Iraq debate. I think it is an agreement that is satisfactory to \nboth sides. It gives Senators an opportunity to express themselves on \nwhat is clearly, arguably, the most important issue on the minds of the \nAmerican people at this particular juncture in our history, and we look \nforward to the debate starting shortly. Senator Inhofe will be here to \ncontrol the time on our side, so let the debate begin.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final 20 \nminutes of the debate relating to matters regarding the Iraq \nresolutions, the first 10 minutes of the 20 minutes be for Senator \nMcConnell, the second 10 minutes right before the vote be under my \ncontrol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 4 hours of debate equally \ndivided between the parties.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding the debate will \nstart with our side. I encourage all Members who wish to be heard on \nour side on any of these resolutions to come to the floor and be heard.\n  Let me share some thoughts. This is a rather awkward situation we \nfind ourselves in because we are debating three resolutions \nconcurrently. Frankly, one of the three I have not even seen yet, so it \nis very difficult to debate something you have never seen. But I do \nknow from the past discussions the type of concerns people have, the \ndifferences between, quite frankly, the Republican side and the \nDemocratic side. I know it is not right down party lines, but let me \nshare some concerns I have and some thoughts I have.\n  We heard from several Senators who expressed their concern over our \nmicromanaging the war from this body and from the body of the other \nside. Five hundred and thirty-five people cannot be Commanders in \nChief. It seems as if that is what is happening. Also, I observe, and I \nam only speaking for myself, that this thing has become highly \npoliticized. When the war first started,\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nthe whole idea of weapons of mass destruction was the media trying to \nmake us believe that is what it was all about, but that isn't what it \nwas all about.\n  I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee during that time, both \nbefore and after 9/11, and I observed what was going on. I observed \nwhat was going on in Iraq for a long period of time. I had the honor \nback in 1991 of going to Kuwait on what they called at that time the \n``First Freedom Flight.'' There were Democrats and Republicans on that \nflight. We were the first ones to land in Kuwait. The Iraqis didn't \neven know the war was over at that time, and the oilfields were burning \nin Kuwait. I remember Tony Coelho was one of the Democrats who was on \nthe trip, and Alexandria Hague was one of the Republicans on the trip.\n  He also had the Ambassador from Kuwait to the United States and his \ndaughter on the trip, going back for the first time to Kuwait to see \nwhat damage was done by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait City. I remember so \nwell--I don't recall the age of the daughter; maybe she was about 8 \nyears old. I remember so well that when we landed, the oil fields were \nburning, Iraqis were still fighting, not knowing there had been an \nagreement and fires should have ceased by that time. They were still \nshooting at each other. When it calmed down, we went to their home.\n  Keep in mind the Ambassador to the United States from Kuwait was of \nnobility and he had a daughter with women. They had a mansion on the \nPersian Gulf, a beautiful place. We got there in time to see that their \nhouse had been used as one of the headquarters of Saddam Hussein. His \nyoung daughter wanted to see her bedroom, her stuffed animals and \nthings girls want to see. We found out her room had been used for a \ntorture chamber. There were body parts stuck to the walls, human hair \nand hands, where the torturing had been taking place.\n  I think sometimes people forget about how bad this guy was. We hear a \nlot about Adolf Hitler, and this guy was certainly the worst since the \nbrutality of Auschwitz and Hitler and, of course, the Holocaust. If you \nhad been there and looked down and seen the bodies in the open graves, \nif you heard the testimony from others whose daughters could not get \nmarried because they could not have weddings on the streets of Baghdad \nbecause, if they did, people would come in, the Iraqis, and Saddam \nHussein's sons would come in and mob everybody and they would kill \npeople and take the pretty girls and rape them and bury them alive. \nThese atrocities that took place were inconceivable to people.\n  You don't hear about this in the media. They say they didn't find \nweapons of mass destruction. Well, you know, that is a moot point. \nThere were weapons of mass destruction because they used weapons of \nmass destruction. They used them in the northern parts of Iraq. Saddam \nHussein brutally, painfully murdered his own people, and the types of \ngases used in these weapons of mass destruction were the most painful \nkind that would torture people to death, burn them from the inside out. \nAll the time this was happening, we heard testimonials about how Saddam \nHussein was treating his people he thought perhaps were his enemies and \ndidn't follow him after the war in 1991, and how they would put people \nto death, torture them, and drop them into vats of oil. The victims \nwould be praying that they would put them in head first because their \nlife would be over sooner. It was the same with the massive machines--\nlike what we call shredders in this country--where they would shred the \nlive bodies of these individuals. They used the most brutal types of \ntorture imaginable.\n  I thought once they get Saddam Hussein and once he is disposed of and \nis dead, people will realize this monster is not coming back. \nUnfortunately, there are other monsters who would take up the mantle. \nThese things have gone undiscussed, unnoticed. Even if there had not \nbeen weapons of mass destruction--which there were, because they used \nthem, either chemical or biological, which is just as cruel as nuclear, \nand effective, and it kills many people. Even if that had not been the \ncase, America could not stand by and watch that type of thing \nhappening.\n  I have had the honor of going back more times than any other Member \nof the Senate. I will be going next week. It will be my 13th trip to \nthe area of responsibility in Iraq. Each time I come back, after seeing \nthe progress that is being made, I read the newspapers, the press \naccounts, and there is no relationship between reality and the press \naccounts we get.\n  I had the honor of being in Fallujah during a couple of the \nelections. The Iraqi security forces--people are not aware of this, but \nthey allowed them to vote a day in advance of the normal voting that \ntook place. I was purposely at a couple of these elections in Fallujah \nbecause that was where the problems were supposed to exist. That is \nwhere our marines were. They conducted door to door and they did \nincredible and great work at that time. The Iraqi security forces were \nthe first to go down and vote. I remember one night having them come \nback and talk about the threats that had been made on their lives. Some \nwere shot during the process. They were willing to risk their lives to \nvote and then to help the people vote the next day. The next day, the \nother Iraqis came to vote. We all heard about the fingerprinting and \nholding up with pride their stained finger, which would be a death \nsentence on individuals. In this country, when such a small percentage \nof the people vote, and we look at those who are willing to risk their \nlives, I think how dear that privilege is and how we do not appreciate \nit as we should.\n  Anyway, they voted and, of course, they knew when they were going to \nvote, they would be in harm's way, and many were shot. There are heroic \nstories of Iraqis going to vote where they would lay down their lives \nand get in the line of fire to save somebody else. So these were \nexperiences that we had, the real reasons for being there.\n  As we approach these resolutions--I see my friend from Missouri is \nhere and I will soon yield to him whatever time he asks. As we discuss \nthe resolutions, I want people to keep in mind the one thing those of \nus who believe the generals are more capable of running this war than \nare the individuals in this body, the 535 Members of the House and \nSenate--and of the 535, many of them want to be Commander in Chief; \nmany are running. The generals make these decisions.\n  At this time, I ask my friend from Missouri how much time he wishes.\n  Mr. BOND. I would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield 15 minutes to Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I \nappreciate the opportunity to talk about this very important subject. \nSome have said we don't want to debate the war in Iraq, but we have \nbeen doing that and I am happy to debate it.\n  We are at war. One of the jobs of this body is to support our troops \nwhen we are at war. As such, we should be taking up the supplemental \nwar funding bill that will directly support and aid our service men and \nwomen and support the efforts underway in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I regret the Democratic leadership has chosen to delay acting on \nfunds our troops in the field need and must have by the 1st of May. \nHere we go, talking about resolutions. We are taking up nonbinding \nresolutions. The key one is nonsensical; it would serve only to \nundermine the morale of our service men and women and boost the morale \nof our enemies. S.J. Res. 9 has a clear message, if not to Americans \nreading the news, certainly to our enemy: America has been defeated. \nAmerica does not have the will to win. Or we cannot defeat American \ntroops on the streets of Iraq, but we can defeat America in the halls \nof Congress. That is what they will be saying.\n  Out of the 17 different resolutions the majority has worked with and \nintroduced, they have decided to debate S.J. Res. 9--one in a litany of \ndefeatist, micromanaging resolutions that have been offered by the \nother side.\n  Like so many of the others, it calls for a retreat and it ensures \ndefeat. Such a retreat, in its wake, would create a bastion of \ninstability, violence, regional conflict, and a launching point for \nfuture attacks on our allies and this Nation such as that witnessed \nafter 9/11. The intelligence community, in public testimony before our \ncommittee in January, publicly stated that the very real three-pronged \nthreat of turning Iraq over to the chaos is a serious challenge we all \nshould consider.\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\n  Fortunately, those of us who believe the generals ought to run the \nwar have the Constitution on our side, which specifies that the \nPresident--not those of us in the 535 Members of Congress--is Commander \nin Chief. The proponents of S.J. Res. 9 to set deadlines must now \nbelieve they are more equipped, better informed, and have better \njudgment than the leaders and military commanders they recently and \nunanimously confirmed.\n  Is the American public to believe that the legislators in these \nbeautiful halls, 8,000 miles away from the front, are better equipped \nto develop strategies than General Petraeus, whom this body confirmed \nunanimously to lead U.S. forces?\n  I think the Founding Fathers were right at the time and they are \nright now. We do not fight wars in the Halls of Congress. We cannot win \nthis war by resolutions we pass, but we can lose the war in the Halls \nof Congress. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to \ncite public opinion polls about Iraq as well as a reason why we should \npull out. What may be perceived to be popular in the short run, \nregrettably, will in the long run compound into an even bigger problem \nthat will end up costing us and our allies far more blood and treasure.\n  Further, when it comes to national security, we ought to be governing \non principles, not on public opinion polls.\n  The American people want victory, not defeat. They are demanding \nprogress, which the new security plan was designed to produce. \nIncidentally, this new plan fits almost exactly with the \nrecommendations of the Baker-Hamilton committee, which so many people \non both sides of the aisle said would be the ultimate solution. Well, \nGeneral Petraeus and the administration are carrying out the details of \nthe Baker-Hamilton plan, and now we are changing our mind. Why? Well, \nsome, I fear, may be inspired by a loathing of President Bush. But even \nto those of you who do, I appeal to you to recognize the President is \nnot the enemy. The enemy is ruthlessly chopping the heads off innocent \ncivilians in front of cameras, blowing up schoolchildren, blowing up \nplaces of worship. One Army officer recently e-mailed me and said:\n\n       I proudly served in Iraq. I know who the enemies of America \n     are. I have met them in person. Our President is not the \n     enemy.\n\n  This would not be George Bush's defeat or victory. It will be an \nAmerican defeat or victory, and the sooner we understand that, the \nsooner perhaps we can be united.\n  Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for \nInternational Peace and transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall \nFund, recently wrote a piece in the Washington Post describing the sad \nstate of current political affairs. It was entitled ``Grand Illusion.'' \nIn the piece he asserted:\n\n       Democratic and Republican members of Congress are looking \n     for a different kind of political solution: the solution to \n     their problems in presidential primaries and elections almost \n     2 years off.\n\n  This is coming, as he indicates in his article, just as ``American \nsoldiers are finally beginning the hard job of establishing a measure \nof peace, security and order in critical sections of Baghdad.''\n  He goes on to say that ``they've launched attacks on Sunni insurgent \nstrongholds and begun reining in Moqtada al-Sadr's militia.''\n  This is appropriate advice. He says:\n\n       Politicians in both parties should realize that success in \n     this mission is in their interest, as well as the nation's. \n     Here's a wild idea: Forget the political posturing, be \n     responsible, and provide the moral and material support our \n     forces need and expect.\n\n  Despite many people's dissatisfaction with the war, I don't think a \nmajority of Americans want us to withdraw, to retreat and admit defeat.\n  Throughout the debate, we have also heard references and comparisons \nmade to Vietnam, that this is a quagmire, that the war is unjust, \npoorly managed, it threatens our individual liberties, it is \nunwinnable, and the only option is to pull out. All of the very same \nthings were said during the campaign against President Lincoln in 1864, \nwith well over one-quarter of a million dead Americans; after the Union \nsuffered 7,000 casualties in 30 short minutes at Cold Harbor; and until \nSherman won in Atlanta.\n  If you look at our history, anybody getting 24-hour television news \nduring the battles Americans fought against the British in 1776, you \nwould have had to say we were in worse shape than we are now.\n  When you look at the conditions our troops were in before D-Day and \nall the things that went wrong, 24-hour news coverage would have \nconvinced an overwhelming majority of the American people to forget it, \npull the plug, let the Nazis have it. But if somebody used Vietnam as a \nmodel--and it should be used completely--I think it reminds people of \nthe image associated with Vietnam that too many ignore.\n  I suspect this is a historical photo that many of our murderous \nenemies dream would be superimposed over the rooftops of Baghdad. These \nare the people left behind. We left behind people. Some 2.5 million \nwere murdered after we pulled out of Vietnam.\n  This is, of course, the final, classic departure, people trying to \nget away. Those who didn't were slaughtered.\n  Our enemies throughout the radical Islamist world are all too \nfamiliar with immediate withdrawal and retreat. We withdrew from \nVietnam, we withdrew from Beirut, and we withdrew from Mogadishu.\n  These repeated withdrawals signaled to our enemies all over the world \nthat if they inflict enough damage on our most heroic citizens, the \nMarines will never surrender but Washington will.\n  And make no mistake about it, they are watching. They are watching to \nsee what we will do in Iraq.\n  These repeated withdrawals invited the 1993 World Trade Center \nattack, the bombings of our embassies in Africa, the USS Cole, the \nKhobar Towers, and eventually 9/11. None of these actions occurred \nbecause of our action to liberate Iraq. Five or six of these attacks \noccurred before President Bush took office, and George Bush did not \ninvent the danger from radical Islam.\n  Further, the notion of separating al-Qaida from the sectarian killers \ncan only be contemplated from as far away as Washington because al-\nQaida is targeting the mixed neighborhoods and has overtly promised \nsectarian violence to undermine the Iraqi Government and to weaken U.S. \nGovernment resolve.\n  The Democratic resolution before us now is precisely what our enemies \nwant to hear and, sadly, are expecting to hear.\n  Here are some quotes from one of the people we ought to be reading \nmore frequently, Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden said:\n\n       We found that out from our brothers who fought the \n     Americans in Somalia. They did not see it as a power worthy \n     of any mention. . . . God gave them and the mujahideen \n     success in Somalia and the United States pulled out, trailing \n     disappointment, defeat and failure behind it. It achieved \n     nothing. It left quicker than people had imagined.\n\n  That is what Osama bin Laden said on October 21, 2001.\n  In addition to that statement, he said on February 14, 2003:\n\n       It has been made clear during our defending and fighting \n     against the American enemy that this enemy's combat strategy \n     is heavily dependent on the psychological aspect of war . . . \n     which hides the cowardice and lack of fighting spirit of the \n     American soldier. . . . Likewise, let me remind you of the \n     defeat of the American forces in Beirut in 1982, soon after \n     the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, when the Lebanese resistance \n     was personified by a truck laden with explosives that struck \n     the main military base of the U.S. Marines in Beirut, killing \n     242 soldiers--towards hell was their destination and what an \n     evil destination that is.\n\n  This is what Osama bin Laden thinks of us. He stated many times that \nAmericans don't have the stomach for conflict and this Democratic \nresolution embodies that very notion.\n  What Osama bin Laden and the enemies we are fighting against expect \nto see is Vietnam. Let's give General Petraeus more confidence. General \nPetraeus was confirmed unanimously. He stated that the effort in Iraq \nwill have to be sustained to achieve its desired effect and that more \ntroops are vital to advancing security. We confirmed him unanimously. \nGive him a chance.\n  He reported last week that nine Iraqi reinforcement battalions have \nentered Baghdad. He pointed to a decrease in sectarian killings, the \ndiscovery of numerous weapons caches, and the capture of al-Qaida \nmembers. Al-Sadr has fled Sadr City, and al-Baghdadi was recently \nreported caught.\n  Associated Press reporter Robert Reid recently reported General\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nPetraeus walking through the streets of Hit, a Sunni city with a bloody \npast. Last month in the article, he reported:\n\n       Iraqi police backed by U.S. troops swept through the city \n     of about 120,000 people, arresting suspected insurgents and \n     establishing three new police stations in the downtown area. \n     Since then, the number of violent incidents has dropped from \n     an average of 5 per day to 1.3 per day.\n\n  Now that a relative level of security has been established, the \nimportant political and economic development work must begin.\n  In the past, the United States had claimed similar victories in Hit, \nbut those gains were lost because of lack of enough troops to sustain \nthe province.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n                      Walk Delivers a U.S. Message\n\n                          (By Robert H. Reid)\n\n       HIT, Iraq.--The top U.S. commander in Iraq strolled \n     Saturday through the streets of a dusty Euphrates River city.\n       Gen. David Petraeus was snacking on ice cream and promoting \n     cooperation between Americans and Iraqis in a Sunni Arab \n     community where insurgents have been driven out before, only \n     to return.\n       Petraeus visited Hit, scene of bloody fights with \n     insurgents for the last three years, to affirm U.S. support \n     for a nascent city administration and to deliver a message \n     that U.S. troops will remain here until Iraqi forces are \n     genuinely ready to provide their own security.\n       To demonstrate his confidence, Petraeus, accompanied by \n     dozens of armed U.S. troops and Iraqi policemen, strolled \n     down the main street, stopping to buy ice cream from a vendor \n     and wandering through the city market, where snipers were \n     taking potshots at U.S. patrols just months ago.\n       ``Iraq presents its own complex set of challenges, and you \n     have to do one city at a time,'' Petraeus said as he beamed \n     at hesitant crowds and delivered Arabic greetings to small \n     groups of young boys who stared at the entourage from the \n     curb.\n       Few of the Iraqis returned the greeting and most kept back, \n     perhaps intimidated by the stern-faced, gun-toting Iraqi \n     policemen who appeared keen to make sure nothing went awry \n     during the visit.\n       Nevertheless, the fact that a senior American general could \n     walk through the public market in a Sunni city with such a \n     bloody past indicated a degree of progress that U.S. \n     commanders are eager to exploit. It is key to the new U.S. \n     strategy of clearing areas of insurgents and then remaining \n     to promote economic and quality-of-life projects. In the \n     past, Iraqi forces have failed to maintain control once the \n     Americans were gone.\n       Last month, Iraqi police backed by U.S. troops swept \n     through the city of about 120,000 people about 100 miles \n     northwest of Baghdad, arresting suspected insurgents and \n     establishing three new police stations in the downtown area.\n       Since then, the number of violent incidents--mostly \n     bombings and shootings--has dropped from an average of five \n     per day to about 1.3 a day, the lowest level since March \n     2006, said Lt. Col. Douglas Crissman, commander of the \n     battalion that took part in the sweep.\n       The plan is for U.S. and Iraqi checkpoints around the city \n     to turn Hit into a ``gated community'' free of insurgents.\n       To convince the locals that better days are ahead, the U.S. \n     plans to fly in $15 million to float the local bank, which \n     will enable retired government employees and soldiers to \n     start receiving pensions and provide cash to bolster the \n     economy.\n       The Americans are also encouraging the Shiite-run \n     government in Baghdad to pay more attention to mostly Sunni \n     Anbar province, including authorizing funds to pay for the \n     extra police. But U.S. forces have claimed similar successes \n     in the past in Hit, only to see gains lost because of a lack \n     of enough troops in the province.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while it is far too premature to declare \nthat the new strategy has succeeded, it does indicate there is a \npossibility. As General Abizaid once testified, despair is not a \npolicy. It must be given a chance to succeed, and this resolution would \ndo nothing to achieve victory. The alternative of retreat and defeat \nwould be disastrous.\n  What are my colleagues who wish to see us leave Iraq thinking will \nhappen once we do? The arguments for retreating before relative \nsecurity is established because we grow tired of the war, because \nmistakes were made or because Americans allegedly want us to leave all \nignore what the consequences will be if we do leave precipitously on a \npolitical withdrawal timetable.\n  Those who are advocating for retreat and departure from Iraq \nabsolutely must address this very difficult question. In other words, \nwhat is ``Plan Bravo,'' plan B, for those mandating retreat? Are we to \nredeploy forces back home only to have to redeploy them in much larger \nnumbers 3, 4, 5 years from now, once Baghdad has turned into a base of \noperations and safe haven for al-Qaida? Will we endure the transfer of \nIslamofascist terrorism and violence occurring in the Middle East back \nto the homeland?\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, are we going to bear witness to a conflict \nbetween Sunnis and Shiites that would spread into a regional war \nthroughout the Middle East? Will we sit idly by while a regional \nconflict ensues that would result in the death of thousands of \ncivilians? What will happen when the price of oil goes up? Will we see \nradical Islam taking over more parts of the world? Will we hand them \nIraq on a silver platter? Will we have to again deploy troops to the \nMiddle East?\n  To ignore these considerations and questions simply because they are \nnot politically palatable is shortsighted at best and dangerous at the \nworst. Those who are attempting to end the war don't want to talk about \nthe fact that the war in Iraq will do anything but end. In fact, it \nwill only grow more dangerous.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that Mr. Kagan had it right. In his article, \nhe also said there ought to be a plan B for the Washington Post and \nothers who have projected and counted on defeat. What is your plan B if \nGeneral Petraeus's works and you predicted so successfully it won't \nwork?\n  We need to put the money behind our troops, give General Petraeus the \nsupport for the new plan with money and support that effort underway. \nOur 130,000 to 150,000 American troops and their families at home are \ndepending on us. They have a direct stake in this historic event, and I \nbelieve that fighting is necessary to prevail over evil.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. A lot \nof people don't know it, but his family has made a personal sacrifice \nin their efforts in this war. We appreciate that very much. The Senator \nfrom Missouri outlined the consequences of surrender in a very \narticulate way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any quorum calls during \nthe debate on the Iraq resolutions be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I see no speakers on the other side, so I \nwill elaborate on my remarks. I appreciate the fact that the Senator \nfrom Missouri talked about specifically what would be the consequences \nof timelines or withdrawal. I can speak from personal experience, \nhaving spent time in Iraq. As I mentioned before, I plan to take my \n13th trip to AOR in a couple of weeks. I believe what is not understood \nby people who are debating these resolutions is some of the good things \nabout the Iraqi security forces.\n  I had the honor of being in Iraq when some of the new leadership took \noffice. I remember Dr. Rubaie, who is the National Security Adviser, \nand Dr. Jassim--I believe he was the Minister of Defense at that time--\nthey articulated in a very effective way that most of the differences \nbetween the two major factors over there were Western concepts, were \nWestern ideas. It appeared to me that was the case.\n  As we debate these resolutions, we need to remember how we got in \nthere in the first place. Remember what happened prior to 1991, \nremember the monstrous commissions that were made by Saddam Hussein and \nthe number of people, the volumes of people who died tragic, painful \ndeaths.\n  As far as the Iraqi security forces are concerned, it is pretty \nobvious to me that these individuals want to be in charge. I get the \nidea, when I listen to some of the people on the other side, that the \nIraqi security forces somehow are inferior, somehow they don't have the \nknowledge and the capability, the potential to become great fighters. \nYet when I talk with them, they are the ones who are anxious to get \nthemselves in a position where they are going to be carrying the load \nfor us.\n  The whole idea of the embedded training is that we put our people in\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nthe rear to advise the Iraqis on what to do and to train them while \nthey are actually embedded and fighting with them. This has worked very \neffectively. It has been effective.\n  I happened to be there at a time when in one of the training areas \nfor Iraqi security forces, there was an explosion. Some 40 were killed.\n  What the people over here don't understand is the commitment the \nIraqis have to their own security. It happens that 40 families of those \nwho were killed in this blast all supplied another member of their \nfamily to go in and carry the load for the deceased trainee.\n  These individuals are committed. They are as anxious as we are to get \nto the point where they have the capability of offering the security \nagainst the terrorists. From time to time, they have gotten that way. \nThere was a time when the entire western one-third of Baghdad was under \nsecurity control by the Iraqis themselves. They were just not in a \nposition to sustain that control.\n  We saw the commitment the Iraqis had in Fallujah, when a general who \nhad been the brigade commander for Saddam Hussein--this guy hated \nAmericans; he was a brigade commander for Saddam Hussein, until we went \ninto Fallujah with our Marines and they started the embedded training, \nthe embedded training referred to by my friend from Missouri. It was so \nsuccessful and they enjoyed each other so much that this man, this \ngeneral, his name is Mahdi, he looked me in the eyes and said: I hated \nAmericans before all this happened. I certainly hated the Marines. When \nthey came in and started embedded training, I learned to love them so \nmuch that when they rotated out, we all got together and we cried.\n  This is the commitment the Iraqis have. When you get into one of the \nhelicopters and go from place to place, maybe 50 feet off the ground, \nand you see the commitment of these individuals in the small towns and \nthe kids who are down there--a lot of times the people who are \nsupporting our troops send over candy, cookies, and this type of thing \ndon't realize that when our troops get them, they normally repackage \nthem, and then as they are in these helicopters going across the \ntriangle and other places, you can see the little Iraqi kids out there \nwaving American flags and our troops are throwing them candy and \ncookies. This is the type of relationship we don't see in this country.\n  Mr. President, while we are calling to make sure that some of them \nget down to the floor from both sides, let me suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate is now engaged in a historic \ndebate about what the United States of America should do with respect \nto the conflict in Iraq. We are scheduled to vote on three resolutions \nat 3:45 this afternoon. I was advised early this morning, about 8 a.m., \nthat we would have four resolutions to vote on and that there would be \na time agreement of some 6 hours, with votes to occur late this \nafternoon. Two of the resolutions among the four were not in existence, \none of the resolutions has since been dropped, and the fourth \nresolution was made available less than an hour ago. This kind of a \ntimetable, it seems to me, is not conducive to the kind of deliberation \nand thought necessary to make intelligent decisions on the momentous \nquestions which we are facing.\n  We are asking the U.S. military to adopt a timetable to clear out of \nIraq no later than a year from now, and we have a tough time \nestablishing even a timetable as to what the Senate will do in the \ncourse of a single day.\n  As I review the proceedings, it seems to me that the Congress is not \nprepared to act on this subject on this state of the record. It may be \nthat the Congress is not competent to act on this kind of an issue. \nThere is a maxim that you can't manage effectively by committee, and \nwhat this concurrent resolution seeks to do is to have management by \ntwo committees--that is perhaps twice as bad as trying to manage by one \ncommittee--a committee of 435 in the House of Representatives and a \ncommittee of 100 here.\n  Yesterday, I spoke briefly about S. Res. 9, which has been \ncosponsored by 41 Democrats, no Republicans. I think it is regrettable \nthat there appears to be a partisan divide on this subject. This matter \nis too important to be determined by party loyalty. Perhaps a more \nimportant aspect of noting that the resolution is supported by 41 \nDemocrats is that it is not supported by 9 Democrats, with 50 Democrats \nin this body. So perhaps it is significant that it is not supported by \n9 Democrats.\n  I would be prepared to cross party lines, as I have done in the past \nwhen I thought it warranted, if I agreed with the thrust of the \nresolution. Seven of us joined with the Democrats in voting for cloture \nseveral weeks ago to move ahead with the debate and try to come to a \nresolution on the Iraqi issue, and I was one of the seven. I would not \nhesitate to do so again if I agreed, but I cannot agree with the \nproposal which would require that not later than 120 days after \nenactment to have phased redeployment of U.S. forces, with the goal of \nredeploying by March 31, 2008, all U.S. combat forces in Iraq except \nfor three conditions: to protect U.S. and coalition personnel, training \nand equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting targeted counterterrorism \noperations.\n  The thrust, however, is to leave Iraq in about 1 year, and that is to \nensure defeat. Setting a timetable simply enables our opponents to wait \nus out.\n  I think beyond that, the idea of having the Congress of the United \nStates micromanage the war is simply not realistic, and perhaps it may \neven be unlawful. As I noted yesterday, in the case of Fleming v. Page, \nin 1850, the Supreme Court said:\n\n       As Commander in Chief, he is authorized to direct the \n     movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at \n     his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem \n     most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy.\n\n  That is a fairly forceful statement that it is not up to the Congress \nto micromanage a war but that it is up to the Commander in Chief, the \nPresident of the United States.\n  That is not to say that the Congress does not have authority in the \npremises. Yesterday, I put into the Record a lengthy letter which I had \nwritten calling for additional hearings by the Judiciary Committee on \nthe relative powers, authority of the Congress under the Constitution, \nwith our power of the purse and our power to maintain and direct \narmies, contrasted with the President's power as Commander in Chief.\n  I believe, however, it is of questionable legal authority to \nmicromanage, and it is definitely impractical for us to seek to \nmicromanage if the consequences of giving an order to the President \nwould just enable the enemy to wait us out. That is not to say that at \nsome time in the future it may be necessary, and there may be a \nconsidered joint judgment by the Congress, to use the extraordinary \npower of the purse to implement our constitutional authority to \nmaintain armies to effectuate a withdrawal.\n  Yesterday, I commented on the Senate floor that it would be most \nhelpful to have an update from the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of State as to whether, since General Petraeus went to Iraq, \nimplementing a new strategy as he articulated it to many of us in the \nCongress in meeting with him, whether there have been improvements, so \nthat there was some realistic prospect of victory, which is what we \nwant. The consequences of defeat are disastrous, but that does not mean \nthat we can be in Iraq forever.\n  The President, in his State of the Union speech, set two objectives \nfor the Iraqis. One was to end the sectarian violence and, secondly, to \nsecure Baghdad as indispensable prerequisites for maintaining U.S. \nforces in Iraq. The Iraqis have shown neither the capacity nor the will \nto carry out those objectives. In evaluating the strategy of General \nPetraeus, it would be helpful to know if there have been any positive \nsigns or negative signs, giving us some clue as to the prospects of \nvictory.\n  Through staff, I made an inquiry of the Department of Defense for \nsome updated material, and none was available. Similarly, through \nstaff, I made an inquiry of the Department of State, asking if there \nhad been any results from the change in policy to negotiate\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nwith Iran and Syria, at least on a multilateral basis. One part of the \nresolution that is supported by 41 Democrats, calling for a \ncomprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy, has been \nimplemented by the Department of State, at least in the incipient \nstages. Even in the absence of any indication of any progress, it seems \nto me unwise, on this state of the record, to set a timetable which \nwould just embolden and empower the enemy to win by waiting us out.\n  The power of the purse is the ultimate constitutional authority of \nthe Congress. Even there, as I noted yesterday in the case of United \nStates v. Lovett, in 1946, the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot \nuse its appropriations power indirectly to accomplish an \nunconstitutional objective. That still leaves substantial parameters to \ndecide what to do.\n  The second resolution is the one submitted by Senator Gregg, and \nSenator Gregg articulates a resolution that all of us agree with:\n\n       That it is the sense of Congress that Congress should not \n     take any action that will endanger United States military \n     forces in the field. . . .\n\n  That would be unthinkable. No one disagrees with that. Then the Gregg \nresolution goes on to say:\n\n       . . . including the elimination or reduction of funds for \n     troops in the field.\n\n  That phrase could be interpreted to mean that Congress does not have \nthe authority to stipulate an elimination or reduction of funds for \ntroops in the field so that we couldn't say to the President to reduce \nthe troops by a certain date. Or perhaps it should be read in \nconjunction with taking no action to endanger to say you have to be \ndown to a certain number by a certain date, as Congress did in \nlegislation in 1974, saying that when the war in Vietnam was winding \ndown, there could be no more than 4,000 troops in the field in 6 months \nand no more than 3,000 troops in the field in a year. That \ncongressional legislation was signed by President Ford, although he \nexpressed some reservations. So perhaps the Gregg resolution does not \npurport to totally eliminate the authority of Congress to act by \ncutting off funding if it can be done in a way which does not endanger \nthe troops in the field. Certainly the thrust, the gravamen of the \nGregg resolution is one where there would be no disagreement, we simply \ncould not endanger the troops in the field or take any action which \nwould endanger them.\n\n  Then the third resolution--which was filed less than an hour ago by \nSenator Murray--sounds very much like the Gregg resolution. It is \nintended, I think, to provide an alternative to the Gregg resolution, \nbut it is very close. The Murray resolution provides:\n\n       The President and Congress should not take any action that \n     will endanger the Armed Forces of the United States and will \n     provide necessary funds for training, equipment and other \n     support for troops in the field as such actions will ensure \n     their safety and effectiveness in preparing for and carrying \n     out their assigned missions.\n\n  We all agree with that. Then it goes on to say:\n\n       The President, Congress and the Nation have an obligation \n     to ensure that those who have bravely served this country in \n     time of war receive the medical care and other support they \n     deserve.\n\n  No one could disagree with that. It is a reference to what has \nhappened at Walter Reed. Then the third clause in the resolution.\n\n       Resolved: The President and Congress should continue to \n     exercise their constitutional responsibilities to ensure that \n     the Armed Forces have everything they need to perform their \n     assigned or future missions.\n\n  We can't disagree with that. And then:\n\n        . . . review, assess and adjust United States policy and \n     funding as needed to ensure our troops have the best chance \n     for success in Iraq and elsewhere.\n\n  That also is apple pie, motherhood, and milk. There is a little \nimplication, on ``review, assess and adjust,'' perhaps a change in \npolicy, but it does not say anything definitive.\n  There was supposed to have been a fourth resolution offered by \nSenator Warner, who had an earlier resolution which was not taken up by \nthe Senate. Senator Warner is to be commended for his service to the \ncountry, heading the Armed Services Committee, 28 years in this body, \nSecretary of the Navy, served in World War II. He was searching for \nsome alternative. But in the absence of any resolution having been \nfiled, the inference arises that the search continues. That is where I \nthink we are on this issue.\n  The electorate spoke last November in disagreeing with United States \npolicy in Iraq. The House of Representatives has spoken, disagreeing \nwith United States policy in Iraq. The Senate is about to speak, but it \nis highly doubtful--virtually impossible that a forced withdrawal \nwithin a year will be approved by 60 Members of this body. The \nresolutions by Senator Gregg and Senator Murray are not twins, but they \nare first cousins. But we are still groping for what to do.\n  My own sense of the situation is we need to pursue some preliminary \nreports that things are improving and find out if in fact that is true. \nAs I look at Iraq--and I used the metaphor yesterday--it is a tunnel \nand we can't see the end of the tunnel. Certainly there is no \nindication that there is a light in the end of the tunnel. I don't like \nbeing in the tunnel, but I don't know where else to go at the moment.\n  I am not going to go with a resolution to leave Iraq, micromanage the \nwar, tell the President what to do when we frankly don't know what to \ndo. But we are groping. Just as we are unprepared to deal with these \nresolutions in a limited time, by 3:45, we are unprepared to tell the \nmilitary what to do in a year. So I think we need to go back to the \ndrawing boards and I think we need to find out more facts. It may be \nGeneral Shinseki was right in 2003, that job required a lot more \npersonnel, into the hundreds of thousands, under the Colin Powell \ndoctrine of overwhelming force. Maybe that was the course which should \nhave been followed. Certainly we don't want to deploy more troops now, \nin those quantities. For General Shinseki's brilliance, he got himself \nfired, ridiculed and fired. We are trying to find out what to do.\n  I had an opportunity to visit the Mideast and talk to President Assad \nof Syria last December. President Assad advanced the idea of having an \ninternational conference before the idea was advanced by Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice. I carried that message back and conveyed \nAssad's suggestion to Condoleezza Rice. Whether that had any impact on \nher idea, I don't know. But I do believe--and I said this in a lengthy \nspeech on the Senate floor last June, and in an article which appears \nin the current issue of the Washington Quarterly--that dialog should be \nundertaken with Iran and Syria. We have seen the multilateral dialog \nwith North Korea, supplemented by direct contracts, bilateral \nnegotiations, produce what appears to be an answer to diffusing North \nKorea's possession of nuclear weapons. We don't know for sure because \nthat is a very tentative basis, but we made a lot of progress and we \nappear to have an answer.\n  I think there is cause for hope that the multilateral talks with Iran \nand Syria, and perhaps bilateral talks, will produce something there. \nSo I am going to oppose S. Res. 9 and I am going to support the first \ncousins, the Gregg resolution and the Murray resolution. They say \nsomething which is obvious. We are not going to take any action to \nendanger the American troops. But that does not mean we are without \npower in the future to use the appropriations power, the power of the \npurse, to put Congress's imprimatur and decision on what is going on.\n  The President said for a long time he was the decider. I think he has \nwisely receded a little from that assertion. It is a joint, shared \nresponsibility between Congress and the President. There has been a lot \nof talk. I think the American people ought to know there has been a lot \nof--it is more than talk; there has been a lot of very serious thought \nwhich has been undertaken by the Members of the Congress, both the \nSenate and the House, trying to find a way to have a victory in Iraq. \nOur statements of disagreement with the President do not mean we ought \nto tell him what to do when in fact we do not know what to do.\n  For myself, I think we need to find out more about what is happening \nnow, both militarily and diplomatically; going back to the drawing \nboard and seeing if we can come up with a better answer than the one we \nare facing at the present time.\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, who is managing the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wish to inquire how much time we have remaining on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 64 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Fine. We are next going to hear from the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I wish to say, after the conclusion of the remarks, I \nam going to be trying to line up, by unanimous consent, several \nspeakers. It is my understanding Senator Byrd wants to come down and \nspeak. But between the next speaker and Senator Byrd, we are going to \ntry to get some lined up for a period of time. That will be our \nintention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think Senator Specter, has given a good \noverview of where the Congress finds itself, where it wants to go, and \nhow to get there. What I wish to do is give my view for people back \nhome and my colleagues about how what we do now, for the moment, could \naffect the overall war on terror, and throw out this proposition: Do we \nbelieve the outcome in Iraq affects the overall war on terror? Is Iraq \na central battlefront in the global struggle? I believe the answer is \nclearly yes. You could debate whether going into Iraq was the right \nthing. Clearly that is a debate that will be resolved by historians. We \nare there now. What are the consequences of a failed state in Iraq and \nhow likely is that to occur, based on what we do for the moment?\n  I would argue very strongly a failed state in Iraq is a tremendous \ndefeat in the overall war on terror on several fronts. No. 1, it means \nmoderate forces in Iraq were overwhelmed by the extremists. There are \nbasically three groups in Iraq trying to kill this infant democracy. \nThere is a Shia extremist group that has as its goal a theocracy for \nIraq where the Shias will dominate the Iraqi landscape and they will \nhave an Iranian style theocracy. It may be different in many ways, but \nit will be a religious state.\n  The Sunni extremists are trying to seize power and kill this infant \ndemocracy and rule by the gun, not by the rule of law. They were in \npower during the Saddam era and they want to get back in power. These \ntwo groups have different views of what to do with a future Iraq, but \nthey both come together believing a democracy hurts their agenda.\n  Then there is the rest of Iraq, the Sunnis, the Shia, and the Kurds, \nwhich I think are the overwhelming majority--and they are struggling to \ncreate a new democracy out of the ashes of a dictatorship. I want to \nassociate myself with some understanding of the struggle they are going \nthrough because our country went through this very same struggle. It is \nhard to create a democracy, but the benefits are enormous if we can \npull this off.\n  The third group is the most dangerous of all. They are in Iraq to \nkill this infant democracy, not for political power within the border \nof Iraq as their goal but to create a movement that will sweep the \nMideast. This is the al-Qaida organization within Iraq and associated \nIslamic extremist organizations that have a more regional view of what \nto do. All three groups, the Shia extremists, the Sunni extremists, and \nthe foreign fighters, namely al-Qaida, are threatened by democracy in \ndifferent ways.\n  Shaikh Mohammed has just admitted in open session in a military \ntribunal that he was in fact the mastermind of 9/11. He went on ad \nnauseam about all the activity he had been involved in for over a \ndecade. The point of his testimony was he believes he is at war with \nus. We need to understand we are at war with him. I think for years \nthey were fighting us and we did not quite understand they had declared \nwar upon us. But we all agree now that al-Qaida is a force that needs \nto be dealt with militarily and that there is a global struggle in \nwhich they are involved, and that Shaikh Mohammed is a warrior, an \nillegal warrior but nonetheless a warrior. He doesn't have a criminal \nagenda, he has a political agenda and religious agenda, and he \nconsiders himself a warrior.\n  What I hope we can do in Iraq is defeat extremism on all fronts; that \nwe could, in fact, defeat al-Qaida in Iraq, which would be a blow to \ntheir overall regional world agenda.\n  What to do? Senator Specter made a good point. Where do we go? \nCongress is trying to find its footing. Congress doesn't want to cut \noff funding. There are different reasons people don't want to cut off \nfunding. The polls clearly show that cutting off funding is not \npopular, by the American people. There are Members in the body who do \nwant to cut off funding. I respect their point of view because they \nhave concluded Iraq is not part of the war on terror in a traditional \nsense; that our involvement in Iraq is doing more damage in the war \nthan it is helping.\n  I just disagree. I think a loss in Iraq is a huge event in the war on \nterror. And they will come and cast a vote. They will vote against \nSenator Gregg's resolution saying the Congress should cut off funding. \nI respect them, but I think they are wrong.\n  Now as to Senator Reid. His motion is that we are going to try to \nsend a message to the Maliki Government and other political leaders in \nIraq by telling them: At a date certain, we are going to start leaving \nif certain things are not done. I understand the point, that they are \ntrying to get the moderate forces, the Democratic forces in Iraq, to do \nbetter and come together quicker.\n  My concern is pretty simple. I think Senator Specter expressed it \nvery well: The audience of this resolution is not a single audience, \nthat the world will be listening and watching what the Senate does.\n  If the Senate did pass a resolution setting a specific date--March of \nnext year--where we will begin to redeploy if certain things are not \ndone in Iraq, then I am convinced that in the Mideast it will be taken \nas a sign of weakness, not strength.\n  It will be not a message sent to the moderates alone, it will be a \nmessage sent to the enemies of democracy. We would be, no matter how \nwell intentioned, laying out a roadmap as to how to drive the United \nStates out of Iraq. The resolution would have two purposes, one well \nintended: to get the Iraqi Government to do more to expedite the \npolitical decisionmaking that is required to lead to a successful \noutcome.\n  The other consequence would be, we would be telling our enemies in \ngreat detail: Here is what you have to do to make sure we leave at a \ndate certain and that every benchmark we set as to a date becomes a \nbenchmark for the enemy. If you can achieve this benchmark, the United \nStates will leave. To me, if we ever do that, then we have made a huge \nmistake.\n  Senator Specter mentioned some of the mistakes. I think General \nShinseki was right, we never had enough troops to provide security. We \nplanned for the best, never assumed for the worst. On the economic \nprojections, in terms of the cost of the war, the military \nunderstanding of what would happen after the fall of Baghdad, we missed \nit by a mile. We are paying a heavy price for making those mistakes.\n  But the biggest mistake is yet to come. If we pass the Reid \nresolution, it would trump every mistake President Bush's team has made \nby a factor of many because it would be, in fact, destroying the last \nbest chance we have to salvage democracy in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus is our best hope. Reinforcements are needed in Iraq: \npolitically, economically, and militarily. Any resolution passed by the \nSenate declaring this operation lost before it is implemented cuts \nGeneral Petraeus's legs out from under him. It would be the biggest \nmistake Congress could make--I would say maybe in American history--to \na commander in the field. Eighty-one to zero, we sent the general off \nto fight in a war anew, and now we are about to send a message to the \npeople he is fighting that on a date certain you win if you do the \nfollowing things.\n  This resolution empowers our enemies. It gives them a roadmap of how \nto drive us out of the Mideast. It weakens the ability of General \nPetraeus to form coalitions to give the Iraqi politicians what they \nneed to do the things they need to do.\n  If you want to empower a moderate, which is key to victory in the \nMideast in the war on terrorism, the last thing you need to do, in my \nopinion, is make a public statement that our commitment ends at a \ncertain date if you do\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\nnot do certain things, because you are telling the enemy exactly what \nthey have to do to win out over the moderates and the United States. It \nwould be a huge mistake of monumental proportions. I hope this body \nwill not allow that to happen.\n  What happens if we have a failed state in Iraq? Who is the biggest \nwinner if Iraq breaks apart and democracy fails? Iran wins. In the \nsouth, the Shia south, a very oil-rich area, that most likely will \nbecome a puppet state of Iran. I cannot say for sure it will, but it is \nthe most likely outcome. Let's start, for a change, planning for the \nworst.\n  I wish people who were introducing these resolutions would understand \nthe consequences of a failed state and ask themselves: Does this \nresolution help create a democracy? Does it empower the enemy? Does it \nhelp create a failed State? What are the consequences?\n  Former Senator Edwards is saying we should draw 50,000 troops down \ntoday. They asked him the question: What would that mean for regional \nstability? I don't know. I am not sure.\n  Well, I can tell you what it means. It would tell the extremists we \nare leaving, you are winning. Every moderate in the Mideast would start \nhedging their bets because what kind of political solution are you \ngoing to come up with if you believe the American political and \neconomic aid to your young democracy will vanish? You start hedging \nyour bets.\n  The stronger we are, the bolder they become. The weaker we are, the \nbolder the enemy becomes. The stronger America, in a rational way, \nstands by moderate forces, the more likely they are to make the hard \ndecisions to bring the country together. The weaker we seem, the weaker \nwe portray ourselves, the stronger the enemy of democracy.\n  That is what I believe this is all about. You cannot kill the \nterrorists in numbers enough to win the war from an American \nperspective. This war will never be won by the American military \nkilling terrorists. They are doing a wonderful job, our military. This \nwar will be won when extremism is suppressed within the Mideast by the \npeople who live in the Mideast.\n  So we have to take sides. This war is a war of religion and origin. \nThe origin of this war is not Palestine-Israel, it is bin Laden, Shaikh \nMohammed, and others who have a view of religion that has no place on \nthe planet for the State of Israel or moderate Muslims, Christians, \nJews. They have said publicly their goal is to drive us out of the \nMideast, topple all moderate governments that do business with the West \nand essentially destroy Israel. I believe them.\n  Iraq is a test of us and our will versus their will. I do hope we \nunderstand the vote we are about to take will shape the fortunes in \nIraq in the coming months one way or the other. The decision we take in \nIraq will shape our national security interests for decades, will \nchange the Mideast for the better or for the worse, and will have \nmonumental consequences on the war on terrorism.\n  This is not about the political moment. This is about the decades to \nfollow. Leaving Iraq, from a national security perspective, is not the \nquestion for the country. We all want to leave sooner rather than later \nfor the good of our own troops, and eventually the stability of the \nworld, to allow the Iraqis to take over their own destiny.\n  The question for this country is what do we leave behind? I am \nconvinced if we leave behind a failed State, where moderates are \noverwhelmed by extremists, the problems in Iraq spill out to the \nMideast, and the war does not end when you leave Iraq, it just begins.\n  You need to look at Shaikh Mohammed and what he said a few days ago, \nand what they are saying now, al-Qaida. Understand that they believe \nthe outcome in Iraq is part of the war on terror. I believe it. These \nresolutions, in my opinion, do not understand that.\n  As to General Petraeus, I have a lot of confidence in this new plan. \nIt is not more of the same. It is trying to go at the problems in Iraq \nnew and differently. There are early signs of success. There is a long \nway to go, But please understand the General and those who are under \nhis command are affected by our actions in Washington. The world is \nwatching. Please do not send a message to the wrong people, no matter \nhow well intended.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, let me thank the Senator from South \nCarolina, who has been steadfast all the way through this, and who has \nmade such great contributions. In addition to what he said, I think it \nis worth observing that this is working.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, there is an article about the \nsuccesses that are taking place. The top U.S. military spokesman in \nBaghdad said the number of sectarian killings has dropped since the \noperation began in mid-February.\n  Then on the other side, GEN Qassim al-Mousawi, who is the Iraqi \nmilitary spokesman, also offered an upbeat assessment of the Baghdad \nsecurity plan and how well it is working now. So I think, frankly, this \nis sooner than I thought we would be getting some positive results.\n  Let me also make one observation before going on to the next \nspeakers. That is, after receiving rather late the resolution by \nSenator Murray, 107, in reading it, unless I misread it, it appears to \nme she is outlining some things that are pretty consistent with what is \nin the Gregg resolution. So I do not know--with the three resolutions \nwe have--the order. That is going to be determined, but right now we \nare not sure of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, be recognized for 20 minutes, followed by Senator \nEnsign for 7 minutes, followed by Senator Tester for 10 minutes, \nfollowed by Senator Kyl for 7 minutes, then any intervening Democrat, \nto be followed by Republican Senators Brownback, Warner, and Vitter for \n7 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, along with my Democratic colleagues, I \nintend to vote for the Reid resolution, S.J. Res. 9. I have some \nconcerns with the approach in this resolution--I firmly believe that \nthe Congress must address the open-ended 2002 authorization to use \nforce in Iraq, which is not dealt with in this resolution--but I \ncertainly agree with the Reid resolution's intent. There is a diversity \nof views in both parties about our policy in Iraq, but a majority of \nthe American people are united in the firm belief that a change of \ncourse is long overdue. Fifty-nine percent of Americans believe that \nthe United States made a mistake in sending troops to Iraq. Sixty \npercent favor withdrawing all U.S. troops by the end of next year. The \nAmerican people are speaking, and finally their Representatives in the \nCongress are listening.\n  Some of us may disagree about the best way to effect a change of \ncourse in Iraq, but this debate shows one thing--it is time for a new \nplan, time for a real discussion, not more empty rhetoric about ``stay \nthe course'' versus ``cut and run.'' This administration is fond of \nreferring to the powers of the Commander in Chief, but surely the most \nimportant responsibility of any Commander in Chief is to provide solid \nleadership. As President Harry Truman said: ``The buck stops here.'' \nBut we are entering the fifth year of this misbegotten war, and this \nPresident has failed time and time again to articulate a plan, a plan \nto give a clear reason for why we are in Iraq or to outline a strategy \nfor bringing our troops home. Stubbornly denying that Iraq is engaged \nin a civil war is not leadership. The White House has abdicated its \nleadership on this issue, so it is left to the Congress--that is us--to \nspeak for the American people.\n\n  The hue and cry raised from my colleagues across the aisle and from \nthe White House is that those who do not support this disastrous war do \nnot support the troops. Three thousand one hundred and eighty-nine \nsoldiers have now died in Iraq. Thousands more have been wounded and \nmaimed and have come home to find outrageous and dehumanizing \ntreatment. Truly supporting our troops means not putting them into \nharm's way without a clear plan for success and unless it is absolutely \nnecessary. It means not asking our sons and daughters, our best and our \nbrightest, to make the ultimate sacrifice without being able to \narticulate exactly why they are being asked\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nto do so and exactly what we will accomplish as a result. Supporting \nour troops means treating our wounded men and women with dignity. It \nmeans not sending them to recuperate in mold-filled rooms without \nsupervision and without assistance in a morass of paperwork. It means \nnot sending back to the front lines those too wounded to fight, as this \nadministration is doing.\n  I continue to receive letters and phone calls from service men and \nwomen, troops currently serving in Iraq, thanking me for my stand--yes, \nmy stand--against this war. The troops are not the ones criticizing our \nattempts to bring them home. The troops are the first to say there is \nno military solution to the situation in Iraq, only a political \nsolution. The Iraqis will have to assume leadership of their own \ncountry and start making political compromises to overcome the ethnic \nand sectarian divisions that are splitting the country apart. There is \nno military solution, none, no military solution for Iraq. A national \nreconciliation is the only solution for that war-torn country, and we \ndo not need another 3,000 young lives lost to learn that.\n  We were wrong--and I said so at the time--to invade. We were wrong to \nthink that victory would be quick and easy. We are wrong to stay on in \nan occupation which earns us only hatred with no end, no end, no end in \nsight. Our young men and our young women now find themselves in the \ncrossfire of a civil war. Nearly every one--nearly every one--except \nour Commander in Chief realizes that there is no military solution. To \ncontinue this ill-advised and demoralizing war only damages our \nwonderful country in the eyes of the world and chews up lives, both \nAmerican and Iraqi. I have said it before--yes, I will say it again, \nyes--democracy cannot be force-fed from the point of a gun.\n  Let this debate mark the beginning of a way out, out, out of Iraq. \nLet this Congress begin to understand why the Framers of this \nConstitution gave the power to declare war to the Congress, the \nrepresentatives of the people we send to fight and to die for our \ncountry. Let us begin to put some sanity--sanity--in our foreign policy \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about S.J. \nRes. 9 and the consequences of failure in Iraq.\n  I want to begin by reviewing just how Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida \nsee themselves achieving ultimate victory in Iraq.\n  You don't have to be a serious student of history to realize that as \nof late, America has not exactly demonstrated the kind of collective \nwill necessary to successfully complete military missions abroad.\n  As a nation, it seems easy, maybe too easy, to commit ourselves, \nthrough our military, into foreign lands in an attempt to accomplish \nwhat we believe is right, either to protect our vital national \ninterests or to free a people from bondage, or in the case of Iraq to \ntry to accomplish both.\n  Whatever the reason for committing ourselves to a noble cause \noverseas, America ventures into another country with only the best of \nintentions, and for a while the American people and her politicians \noverwhelmingly support our military and its mission.\n  Then, when we see that victory is not as easy or as immediate as we \nhad initially hoped, we start down a road of self doubt. We convince \nourselves that our military mission was probably not all that important \nin the first place. We somehow twist our values to accommodate an \nopinion that our military expedition is not worth the effort we need to \nexpend in order to be successful. We recoil once the realization hits \nus that lives and treasure are the ``coin of the realm'' when it comes \nto using our military to ensure our continued national security. And \nfor too long our adversaries have witnessed this reluctance, this lack \nof will, to finish the task at hand. In 1982, America deployed her \nmilitary to separate warring factions in Lebanon. We went in with only \nthe best of intentions. People were being killed and it was up to us to \n``do something'' about it.\n  Then, on October 23, 1983, two truckbombs detonated in buildings \nhousing American forces in downtown Beirut. Two hundered forty-one U.S. \nmarines, sailors, and soldiers lost their lives that day. Six months \nlater, America had had enough and we were out of Beirut.\n  The Lebanese civil war would rage on for another decade, and during \nthat time countless Lebanese, Palestinians, and Israelis would suffer \nas a result of our abdication of responsibility.\n  As had always been the case before, our adversaries did not pursue us \nback to our shores to do us harm. But they did observe and they did \nnote that the American public, led by her elected officials took the \neasy way out and departed before completing our intended mission.\n  In 1993, the United States once again sought to ``do something'' to \nend a humanitarian crisis that was taking place on the African \ncontinent. In a country with no functioning central government, \nwarlords ruled their individual pieces of territory within Somalia as \npersonal fiefdoms.\n  The Somali people were fodder as the warlords battled each other for \ncontrol of land and resources. People were being killed. If they were \nnot being killed by bullets, they were being starved to death.\n  Although the situation in Somalia did not directly affect our \nnational security, American leaders at that time answered the call to \n``do something'' to alleviate the human suffering Americans were \nwitnessing nightly as part of their television news shows and reading \nin the daily editorial columns of most big city newspapers.\n  Our leaders once again answered the call by sending our young men and \nwomen in uniform to a foreign land to ``fix things.'' Soon, our \nmilitary had its mission expanded beyond providing humanitarian \nassistance.\n  Part of this new mission involved capturing and/or killing the Somali \nwarlords responsible for the pain inflicted on their fellow citizens. \nAs part of this new mission, Army Rangers conducted an assault on \nSomali forces in what has come to be known as the ``Black Hawk Down'' \nincident.\n  Here, two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and 19 of our Rangers \nkilled. In the days following, film footage was broadcast over and over \nagain on television that showed the lifeless bodies of our soldiers \nbeing desecrated as they were dragged through the streets.\n  This footage both shocked and humbled us. The support for our mission \nto do good things in Somalia quickly evaporated. The costs had become \ntoo great to bear. It was no longer that important to do the right \nthing and we subsequently withdrew our forces from the region.\n  Once again, our adversaries watched as the world's superpower \nretreated from the fight. Today, Somalia continues to flounder as a \nfailed state and a haven for Islamic radicalism on the eastern coast of \nAfrica.\n  In a 1998 interview with ABC's John Miller, Osama bin Laden said that \nthe Clinton administration's decision to withdraw from Somalia had \nemboldened his burgeoning al-Qaida force and encouraged him to plan new \nattacks.\n  ``Our people realize[d] more than before that the American soldier is \na paper tiger that run[s] in defeat after a few blows,'' the terror \nchief recalled. ``America forgot all about the hoopla and media \npropaganda and left dragging their corpses and their shameful defeat.''\n  And those attacks promised by bin Laden did come.\n  On August 7, 1998, al-Qaida decided to test our mettle by \nsimultaneously bombing our Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and in the \nprocess killed 257 people and wounded over 4,000.\n  Our tepid response once again gave Osama bin Laden comfort.\n  Since the Clinton administration had chosen to treat terrorist \nattacks as law enforcement matters, America sought to prosecute in our \ncourts those responsible. Osama bin Laden was soon placed atop the \nFBI's Ten Most Wanted List.\n  Along with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1996 Khobar \nTowers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in \nYemen, the Embassy bombing were two of the major anti-American \nterrorist attacks that preceded 9/11.\n  The United States responded to the Embassy attacks by freezing \nfinancial\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nassets of related parties and by firing some missiles into al-Qaida \ntraining camps in Afghanistan.\n  The attack in Afghanistan destroyed some physical targets. However, \nthe operation did not accomplish the destruction of bin Laden and his \noperatives and did not lead to any significant changes in the al-Qaida \nnetwork and leadership.\n  Al-Qaida grew bolder, stronger, and more capable as we sat on our \nhands.\n  And so, here we are today, facing an embolden enemy bent on our \ndestruction who has convinced himself that he possesses the will to \nbreak our spirit. He has done it before and he is convinced he can do \nit again this time.\n  The sad part about all this is that Osama bin Laden may very well be \nright this time.\n  Today we stand here debating a resolution of appeasement that \ndirectly affects our military strategy in Iraq and, by default, our \noverall national security for years to come.\n  This resolution calls for imposing an artificial timeline to withdraw \nour troops from Iraq, regardless of the conditions on the ground or the \nconsequences of defeat; a defeat that will surely be added to what is \nunfortunately a growing list of American humiliations.\n  I agree with the President's assessment that this legislation before \nus would hobble American commanders in the field and substantially \nendanger America's strategic objective of a unified federal democratic \nIraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself and be an ally in the \nwar against Islamic fascism.\n  The unintended consequence of this resolution is to bring to reality \nOsama bin Laden's vision for Iraq; that after 4 years of fighting in \nIraq the U.S. Congress loses its will to fight. We precipitously \nwithdraw our forces and leave the fledgling Iraqi government to fend \nfor itself; Sunni and Shia factions rip the nation apart at a scale \npreviously unimaginable. There is a mass exodus of refugees out of \nIraq, and no mechanism in place to deal with them. Iran, Syria, Saudi \nArabia and other states in the region feel the need to get involved.\n  This is a terrible scenario, but it is not the worst of scenarios. \nBin Laden's nightmare vision also involves a chaotic Iraq with Sunni \ndominated areas like al-Anbar Province becoming a safe haven from which \nal-Qaida can launch attacks against the United States.\n  And we could see the Shiite dominated areas, with the help of Iran, \nand its own oil wealth, be used as a terrorist breeding ground, as \nwell.\n  Make no mistake. The Iraqi situation is vastly different from Beirut, \ndifferent from Somalia, and, different from the bombing of our African \nEmbassies.\n  Iraq has consequences that will surely be felt here at home and \naround the world. If we leave Iraq before the job is done, as surely as \nnight follows day, the terrorists will follow us home.\n  I believe this.\n  We will be sorry and we will regret having once again left unfinished \nour national security obligations. But by then it will be too late for \nregrets.\n  We will find that as strong and powerful and compassionate as we \nthink we are, we cannot ``unring'' the bell. The damage will have been \ndone.\n  Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida followers are convinced that America \nis weak and decadent and they can succeed in grinding down our resolve \nand forcing us to retreat.\n  Osama bin Laden has openly said: America does not have the stomach to \nstay in the fight.\n  He is a murderer. He is a fanatic. He is an Islamic fascist. He is \ndetermined to destroy us and our way of life.\n  Let us resolve today not to also make him a prognosticator of things \nto come.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided legislation. We cannot \nafford to leave this fight at this time. For the sake of America's \nfuture, we cannot afford to fail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I doubt I will use it all, but I thank the \nPresiding Officer very much.\n  Mr. President, I am here to address S.J. Res. 9. I am glad we have \ngotten to a point where we can debate this war in Iraq and vote. That \nis what we are all sent here to do. This war did not start yesterday. \nWe are 4 years into this bloody war, at a cost of $2 billion a week, \nmonetarily, and nearly $500 billion since we started 4 years ago. More \nimportantly, we have lost nearly 3,200 of our Nation's best people. \nSoldiers, sailors, and marines have made the ultimate sacrifice; 17 \nfrom my home State of Montana. Twenty-four thousand more have been \nseriously wounded. An entire generation in this country has been marked \nby the injuries in this battlefield.\n  Yesterday, the Pentagon admitted something we have known for a long \ntime: that our troops are caught in the midst of a civil war. The \nadministration has begun to escalate this war with 21,000 more troops. \nThis idea is not a new one. During this war, four previous surges have \nall failed. It is time for a different direction. It is time for a \ndrawdown of our troops.\n  As unclear as the President's plan for Iraq has been, our mission for \nour troops is more blurred. The original mission was to find weapons of \nmass destruction, to topple Saddam Hussein, to train the Iraqi troops, \nand to turn Iraq into a model to transform the Middle East.\n  Our troops have done an incredible job. They and their families have \ngiven far more than most of us can imagine. It truly is time now to \ntake a different direction. Our troops need a plan for success and a \nclear mission. The current plan of ``stay the course'' has failed. We \nnow have an open commitment with no end in sight. We need a new \ndirection, and we owe it not only to our troops but we owe it to the \npeople of this country.\n  I strongly support the legislation put forth by Majority Leader Reid. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure. It is a good first step--\nfinally--to put an end to this war. Also, it is a good first step to \nthe political and diplomatic solution this war needs to have happen to \nend this war.\n  This measure directly addresses my biggest concerns in Iraq. I \nsupport the legislation because it is a first step. We can begin \nredeployment of troops with the goal of removing most of those U.S. \ntroops by March 31, 2008. It requires Iraqis to take an active role in \ntheir future, which is critically important. Also, as was pointed out \nlast week, we cannot win every conflict with bullets. This forces Iraq \nto move forward toward a political and diplomatic solution.\n  This legislation focuses our mission and responsibly ends the war \nwithin 1 year, and after March 31, 2008, remaining American troops will \nstill be there to protect American and coalition interests, to still \ncontinue to train these Iraqi forces, and, most importantly, to seek \nout and bring the terrorists to justice.\n  The fact is, this war has taken our eye off the war on terror. Osama \nbin Laden still runs free. We do not know where he is. I wholeheartedly \nsupport this legislation and will vote for it. The combined effort of \nthis legislation will allow Iraq to stand on its own two feet. I urge \nmy colleagues to look beyond partisan politics and vote for a long \noverdue change of course for this 4-year-old war. We cannot afford this \nwar monetarily or from a people standpoint. It is time to pass S.J. \nRes. 9.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I, too, rise to talk about this very \nimportant matter we are debating and voting on today, the situation in \nIraq.\n  First, I want to say hallelujah, we are finally having a full, open \ndebate and a range of votes. That is exactly what I have been pushing \nfor, pleading for, asking for, along with so many of my colleagues on \nthe Republican side. I am very glad finally we do have a full and fair \nand open debate, with the ability to cast votes on measures we deem \nvery important, and specifically the Gregg resolution about supporting \nour troops in the field.\n  Secondly, I want to express real reservations about the Reid \nresolution, which we will also be voting on today.\n  The situation in Iraq is very tough. We need to make a final push, \nand certainly the biggest part of that push does need to be strong \naction by the Iraqi Government. We need benchmarks and pressure on the \nIraqis to do the right thing. I specifically talked\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nabout that. But the Reid resolution does some things I believe we \nabsolutely must not do. Specifically, it sets very precise and \ncomplicated and cumbersome dates certain. I believe that is much more \nuseful as a message to the enemy and a help to the enemy than a roadmap \nfor us.\n  In addition, I think the Reid resolution clearly micromanages the \nwar. It clearly oversteps our bounds as a legislative body by taking on \nthe responsibilities and the management and the function of the \nCommander-in-Chief. Therefore, for that reason, I think that aspect of \nthe Reid resolution is, No. 1, a bad idea, but, No. 2, very possibly \nunconstitutional.\n  I will be voting against that Reid resolution. But again, I thank \neveryone who finally, after weeks and weeks of talk--finally--gave us \nthe opportunity for these votes and for a vote on the Gregg resolution \nand other important matters.\n  The third and final point I want to make goes to the path, \nunfortunately, I think we are headed down with some of this language. I \nthink this is very unfortunate, and I think this path and where it is \nheaded, in my opinion, is something we must all work to avoid. Let me \nexplain what I mean.\n  Senator Reid has made it perfectly clear he will put forward his \nresolution today with all of those complicated dates and timetables and \nwhat-ifs and benchmarks. Again, I have problems with that; I will vote \nno. But Senator Reid has also made clear he will also put forward the \nexact same substance in the context of the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to fund our men and women in uniform in the field \nin Iraq.\n  Now, why is that a problem? Well, it is a problem for the following \nreasons: that emergency supplemental bill is needed, as I just said, to \nfund the men and women in uniform in the field right now, under fire, \nrisking their lives in Iraq.\n  We have all said over and over and over that no matter how we feel \nabout the war, no matter what we put forward as the proper policy on \nthe war effort, we would give our men and women in uniform in the field \nwhat they need to do their job and defend themselves. The problem is \nthis Reid language, particularly the threat to put it on the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, threatens to cut that funding off \nbecause that language, if it gets on the bill, will, first of all, \ndelay debate and implementation of the bill, and secondly, if it is in \nthe final version of that spending bill, it will absolutely--\nabsolutely--produce a veto by the President of the United States. He \ncannot agree to that language because of his position on the proper \npath forward, and no President can agree to that language because of \nthe constitutional power of the President as the Commander in Chief. \nThat will further delay this emergency spending bill and further delay \ngetting necessary funds and equipment to troops in the field.\n  The military has said very clearly we need to act by April 15 so \nthose funds and that equipment can get to the field starting in early \nMay. Our troops are counting on it. They are waiting for it. These are \nmen and women in uniform, in the field, under fire right now. But, \nagain, this strategy and this language of Senator Reid will make it \nvery likely that won't happen and will make it very likely this whole \nmatter and this whole spending to get to our troops in the field will \nbe significantly delayed. That is not funding men and women in uniform. \nThat is not supporting our troops in the field. What that is doing is \nrefraining from supporting them, slowly bleeding away the resources, \nthe equipment, and the money they need to do their job.\n  It is one thing to say: New troops, you are not going anywhere. You \nstay right here. We are having this debate. But it is quite another to \nslowly bleed and endanger troops in the field. Yet this is the path \nthat I am very afraid we are embarking on with the Reid language, \nparticularly if it is put on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  In closing, let me say, we have all said on this floor, virtually to \na person in the U.S. Senate, that no matter what we think about the \nwar, no matter what we think about the right path forward in the war, \nwe will not endanger our troops in the field. We better think long and \nhard about the path some would adopt because they are beginning to do \njust that. We can't have that. We need to give our brave, smart, \ncourageous men and women in the field already the money, the equipment, \nthe resources they need to do their job. They are literally under fire \nthere. We cannot bleed away what they need in the field, quickly, \nslowly, or anything inbetween.\n  Again, I am very concerned that is the path Senator Reid and some \nothers would put us on.\n  So, thankfully, we are having this full and open debate today. We \nwill be having votes today. I believe the most important vote is on the \nGregg resolution. I will proudly vote for that in support of our men \nand women in uniform in the field, and I will do everything I can to \navoid slowly, quickly, or anything inbetween bleeding resources, money, \nand equipment away from what those brave men and women whom we have \nalready put in the field need to defend themselves and to conduct their \nmission.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I spoke yesterday in favor of the \nresolution introduced by Senator Reid, S.J. Res. 9. By bringing the \ncurrent open-ended military mission to a close and requiring the \nfunding of U.S. troops, the Reid resolution takes a significant, \nbinding step toward ending our involvement in the war in Iraq. I am \npleased that the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on that \nresolution shortly.\n  The Senate will also be voting, as the Senator from Louisiana just \npointed out, on another resolution regarding Iraq sponsored by the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire. Unfortunately, this resolution is \nbadly flawed, and I strongly oppose it. My chief objection is simple. \nThe resolution rejects the idea of Congress using its power of the \npurse to safely redeploy our troops from Iraq. Moreover, it does so in \na manner that can only be described as inaccurate and almost \nintellectually dishonest. By warning against ``the elimination or \nreduction of funds for troops in the field,'' the resolution fully \nembraces the misleading rhetoric the White House has used to try to \nprevent serious discussion of Congress ending the war. Those who engage \nin such rhetoric pretend that cutting off funds for the war is the same \nas cutting off funds for the troops. They raise the specter of troops \nsomehow being left on the battlefield without the training, equipment, \nand resources they need.\n  Obviously, nothing could be further from the truth. Every Member of \nCongress agrees we must continue to support our troops and give them \nthe resources and support they need. Not a single Member would ever \nvote for any proposal that would jeopardize the safety of our troops. \nUsing our power of the purse to end our involvement in the war can and \nwould be done without in any way impairing the safety of our brave \nservicemembers. By setting a date after which funding for the war will \nbe terminated, as I have proposed, Congress can safely bring our troops \nout of harm's way.\n\n  How can I say this with such confidence? There really is plenty of \nprecedent for Congress exercising its constitutional authority to stop \nU.S. involvement in armed conflict.\n  I recently chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing entitled \n``Exercising Congress's Constitutional Power To End a War.'' Without \nexception, every witness--those called by the majority and those called \nby the minority--did not challenge the constitutionality of Congress's \nauthority to end a war. Lou Fisher with the Library of Congress, one of \nthe foremost experts on separation of powers issues, pointed out that \nCongress does not simply have the power, it has a responsibility, to \nexercise it when it is needed. He said:\n\n       The question to me, always remember, Congress, is the \n     continued use of military force and a military commitment in \n     the Nation's interest? That is the core question. Once you \n     decide that, if you decide it is not in the national \n     interest, you certainly do not want to continue putting U.S. \n     troops in harm's way.\n\n  The argument that cutting off funding for a flawed policy would hurt \nthe troops, and that continuing to put U.S.\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\ntroops in harm's way supports the troops, makes no sense. By ending \nfunding for the war, we can bring our troops safely out of Iraq.\n  Walter Dellinger of the Duke Law School made this point when he \ntestified about my proposal:\n\n       There would not be one penny less for the salary of the \n     troops. There would not be one penny less for the benefit of \n     the troops. There would not be one penny less for weapons or \n     ammunition. There would not be one penny less for supplies or \n     for support. Those troops would simply be redeployed to other \n     areas where the armed forces are utilized.\n\n  So instead of allowing the President's failed policy to continue, \nCongress can and should use its power of the purse to end our \ninvolvement in the Iraq war, safely redeploying the troops while \nensuring, as I do in my bill and as the Reid resolution permits, that \nimportant counterterrorism and other limited operations are still \ncarried out.\n  Now, for those who don't believe this has ever been done or for those \nwho say it can't be done, let me cite an example from not that long \nago. In October of 1993, Congress enacted an amendment sponsored by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia cutting off funding--cutting off \nfunding for military operations in Somalia effective March 31, 1994, \nwith limited exceptions. Seventy-six Senators voted for that amendment. \nMany of them are still in this body, such as Senator Cochran, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Hutchison, Senator Lugar, Senator McConnell, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Stevens, and Senator Warner.\n  Now, did those eight Senators and many Democratic Senators who joined \nthem act to jeopardize the safety and security of U.S. troops in \nSomalia? By cutting off funds for a military mission, were they \nindifferent to the well-being of our brave men and women in uniform? Of \ncourse not. All of these Members recognized that Congress had the power \nand the responsibility to bring our military operations in Somalia to a \nclose by establishing a date after which the funds would be terminated.\n  Now, on that same day with regard to Somalia, several Senators, \nmyself included, supported an even stronger effort to end funding for \noperations in Somalia. The amendment offered by Senator McCain on \nOctober 15, 1993, would have eliminated funding for Somalia right away, \nexcept for funds for withdrawal, or in the case of American POWs, MIAs \nnot being accounted for. Thirty-eight Senators opposed a measure to \ntable that amendment. I was joined by many Republican Senators in \nsupporting the amendment, including none other than the current sponsor \nof S. Con. Res. 20, Senator Gregg. Senator Gregg suggests in that \nresolution that eliminating funds for troops would undermine their \nsafety. Was he voting 14 years ago to do that? Obviously, he would not \ndo that. In 1993, was he committing the same egregious offense that he \nso strongly opposes in 2007? Could he have been so cavalier about the \nsafety of our troops? Not the Senator I know. He would never have been \nindifferent to their need for guns or ammunition or food or clothing, \nnor would I, nor would any other Member of this body. Of course not.\n  Senator Gregg knew, as did I, that Senator McCain was proposing an \nappropriate, safe, responsible way to use our power of the purse to \nbring an ill-conceived military mission to a close without in any way \nharming our troops.\n  Unfortunately, the new Gregg resolution seems to have forgotten this \npoint. I hope that my colleagues will think better of efforts such as \nthat proposed by Senator Gregg today. All Senators, including the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire, are, of course, \nentitled to their opinions, and all Senators are certainly entitled to \noppose my efforts to end funding for a disastrous war. But by putting \nforth misleading and baseless arguments, by suggesting that ending \nfunding for the war is tantamount to ending funding for the troops, \nthey are making it that much harder to have the open, honest, and \nessential debate about the Iraq war that this body and the American \npeople so badly need.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we are debating a serious proposal with \nrespect to the future of our involvement in Iraq and the future of Iraq \nand, indeed, that region of the world. I believe the proposal Senator \nHarry Reid of Nevada advanced is a sensible way to begin to change our \npolicy, so it can be sustained over time and it can lead to a \nsuccessful termination of our operations in Iraq but, more importantly, \ngive the Iraqis the opportunity to establish a stable government in a \nvery difficult part of the world.\n  The elements of the proposal that Senator Reid has advanced, are \nright on target. First, to define the mission in a way that they can be \nfully supported by the United States and also that they are congruent \nwith our best interests in the region and the world. Next, obviously, \nis force protection. We have to be able to assure our forces that they \ncan protect themselves at all times. Third, to continue to develop the \nIraqi security forces--not just to put guns in their hands but to \ndevelop their capacity to do other things, such as civil affairs, \nintelligence operations, those critical military skills that will allow \nthem to be an effective force in their country, to bring not just \nstability but a sense of competence, coherence to the operation of \ntheir Government.\n  The next mission is the constant attention to counterterrorism. This \nis a mission that I believe transcends every border in the world. \nWherever there are those elements that are actively plotting to attack \nus or our allies, we should be prepared, together with local \nauthorities, if they are cooperative, to take these elements out very \ndramatically, preemptively. That is essentially what we did in Somalia, \nwithout the presence of hundreds of thousands of American troops in \nSomalia. But we had the special operations capacity, intelligence, and \nthe cooperation of local parties so we could do that.\n  Those are the three critical missions I believe we have in Iraq that \nwill be longer term. But I think, also, when recognizing those \nmissions, we can begin to recognize and begin to redeploy our combat \nbrigades that are there. They are essentially now engaged in a civil \nwar, a sectarian battle between the Sunnis and Shia in Baghdad, but not \njust there. These forces we have to begin to redeploy away from Iraq. \nInitially, they could be redeployed within the country, to adjacent \ncountries, and at some time back to their home stations. I think this \nis the wisest course.\n  I hope, as the legislation suggests, we could at least have as a goal \nMarch of 2008 for the redeployment of these combat brigades, \nunderstanding that these residual missions--force protection, training \nIraqi security forces, and counterterrorism--will endure. That is a \nwise policy that is consistent with our national security objectives \nand also consistent with our ability and the ability of the American \npeople to sustain these efforts over many months.\n  The continued course of simply adding more troops and hoping for the \nbest, which is the President's strategy, is not going to work. More \nimportantly, I cannot see it being sustained indefinitely by the \nAmerican people or supported by a terribly overstretched military \nforce, particularly our Army and Marine Corps.\n  This whole approach to Iraq, I believe, from the very beginning, was \na flawed strategy. It disregarded fundamental aspects of any coherent \nstrategy--identify the most serious threat and apply adequate, very \nrobust resources to the threat. Iraq wasn't the most serious threat in \nthat region. Iran is much more powerful and much more potentially \ndangerous and, also, at that juncture, the most serious threat, and \nstill lingering are the international terror cells.\n  But this administration, against my judgment, entered into this \nconflict in Iraq. Not only did they have a flawed strategy, but the \nexecution has been horrific, incompetent. Today, we are left with very \nfew good choices. One of the most revealing aspects of why the \nstrategic decisions made by the administration were so faulty was given \na few weeks ago when I asked Admiral\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\nMcConnell, the Director of National Intelligence: What is the most \nlikely source of an attack on the United States, groups in Iraq or \ngroups in Pakistan? His answer, without any delay, immediately, was: \n``Pakistan, of course.'' So we have invested billions and billions of \ndollars, 140,000-plus troops, over 3,000 Americans killed in action, \nmany more seriously wounded, and yesterday, the highest intelligence \nofficial in the country says the most serious potential threat to our \nhomeland, an existential attack on the order of 9/11, is from our ally \nPakistan. That is because, once we focused on Iraq, we took our focus \noff Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have allowed the Taliban to \nrehabilitate itself. The Pakistanis have been unable to deny a safe \nhaven to bin Laden, Zawihiri, and other key elements of al-Qaida's \nleadership who are not only surviving but beginning to reorganize and \nreassert themselves as directors or aspirers or at least coconspirators \nwith other terror groups around the world. That is a stunning \nindictment of the strategy that this administration has unveiled.\n  There are other costs to this strategy. You will recall the ``axis of \nevil.'' The President boldly announced that it was Iraq, North Korea, \nand Iran. Well, frankly, after ignoring the North Koreans for many \nyears, now the administration is seeking to cut a deal with them with \nrespect to their nuclear weapons. But this is a much worse deal than \nthe administration had when it stepped into office. In 2000, their \nplutonium was capped by international inspectors on the ground. But \nthrough a series of miscues, the administration allowed the North \nKoreans to take away their plutonium, create up to 10 nuclear devices, \nwe think, test long-range missiles and, in a shocking act, detonate a \nnuclear device, becoming part of the nuclear club. Now we are offering \nthem essentially the same terms that could have been had, without all \nthis damage, many years ago.\n  With respect to Iran, we know one of the consequences, one of the \ncosts of our operations in Iraq is that Iran is in a much more secure \nstrategic position today. They have colleagues and cohorts who are \nintegral parts of the Government in Baghdad. The people we rely on, the \nMaliki Government, has huge support from people who have spent years, \nwho have fought alongside the Iranians against the Iraqis. Yet we are \nsupporting, as we must, the Maliki Government. But we should all \nrecognize the huge influence Iran has today as a result of this \nstrategy.\n  Now, these costs are strategic costs, but there are some obvious \ncosts in terms of dollars and cents. We are spending in Iraq about $8.4 \nbillion a month. That level of effort is difficult to sustain. In \nAfghanistan, we are spending less but still significant dollars. All \nthese costs are being funded from the supplemental. We are borrowing \nthe money from the next generation of Americans to pay for these \nefforts.\n  The President already set up another supplemental request that will \nbe pending in a few days. It includes $93 billion for operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. It will bring the total for this fiscal year--\nwhat was in the original budget, together with the supplemental--to \n$145 billion. We will likely see totals such as that in succeeding \nyears.\n  In the 5 years the United States has been engaged in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--Iraq particularly--we have spent about $530 billion. That \nis a huge sum of money. That is very difficult to sustain. We can also \nsee the cost in terms of supplying the Army. We have a situation where \nunits are without equipment. Our National Guard is in disarray. Now we \nare going to, once again, put a huge demand on our military forces to \nsupport this escalation. It has been suggested to me that, shortly, \nupward of nine brigades of National Guard and Reserve forces will be \nnotified for redeployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. Once again, our \ncitizen soldiers will be taken from their homes and sent overseas. When \nthey go this time, they will not have quite the same equipment as they \ndid the last time because National Guard equipment is in disrepair, \neven worse than the regular forces. Their training will likely not be \nas authentic because of the difficulty in getting out to the national \ntraining centers. They might do most of the training at their home \nstations. We are beginning to see this accumulation of costs reflected \nin many ways.\n  A few days ago, the Boston Globe published a story in which it showed \nthat because of the retirement and resignations of captains in the \nArmy, senior NCOs in the Army, promotion rates have been going up \nastronomically to fill these vacancies. That is probably the worst \npotential trend for any military force, because without those capable \ncompany grade leaders, we will not be able to assure the American \npublic we have the same level of professional skill that we have today.\n  I believe, for all these reasons, the resolution proposed by Senator \nHarry Reid is the right course of action. But there will be an \nalternative approach, and that is a proposal by Senator Gregg with \nrespect to funding. A few points can be made about that. The Gregg \nresolution misinterprets the Constitution by saying the Congress's only \nrole is simply to rubberstamp what the President does--or worst case, \nthey can only take funds away. That is not the case at all.\n  As I mentioned on the floor yesterday, way back in 1799, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States clearly said that Congress had the right to \nmake decisions with respect to national policy involving foreign \naffairs. In fact, their decision essentially said the Congress could \npass a law that would allow the President to stop ships going into \ncertain ports but not leaving certain ports.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side came down and talked about us \nmicromanaging. That is micromanaging. It is constitutionally \npermissible, perhaps, but it is not something we will do. It is not \nsomething we would want to do. We want to give the President the latter \ntwo that he needs but for missions that are consistent with our \nnational security.\n  Under the Gregg resolution's interpretation of the Constitution, \nCongress's only responsibility seems to be to fund whatever the \nPresident asks.\n  That I don't think is appropriate constitutionally or with respect to \nour obligations as thoughtful participants in the policy process along \nwith the President.\n  Senator Murray will offer an alternative, and that alternative \nstrongly supports our troops but also properly interprets the \nConstitution by stating the President and the Congress have shared \nresponsibilities for the decisions involving our Armed Forces.\n  I suspect if you took the Gregg logic to the extreme, if the \nPresident sent up a funding bill and we thought it was inadequate, then \nI suspect we couldn't do anything because, after all, all we can do is \neither agree with the President or cut off the funds. That is not the \ncase at all.\n  I can recall the President sending up to the Senate budgets that did \nnot have enough resources for armored humvees, body armor, et cetera. \nIt was this Congress that put more money in because we have a role when \nit comes to funding the operations of the military.\n  When it comes to Presidential policy, it is not simply accepting it \nor taking away the money; it is altering that policy if it is wrong, it \nis redefining missions, and it is fully resourcing those missions which \nare the product of this interaction between the President and the \nCongress.\n  A quote from Senator Murray's resolution:\n\n     . . . the President and Congress should not take any action \n     that will endanger the Armed Forces of the United States, and \n     will provide necessary funds for training, equipment, and \n     other support for troops in the field, as such actions will \n     ensure their safety and effectiveness in preparing for and \n     carrying out their assigned missions.\n\n  That I think is a much more accurate, appropriate, and sensible \napproach to the issue of shared responsibility.\n  In addition, the Murray resolution makes it clear that the \nConstitution gives Congress the responsibility to take actions that \nhelp our troops and our veterans. We have had a lot of talk about not \nfunding the troops. But wait a second, it was the President who sent in \nforces without a plan. It was the President who sent in forces without \nadequate armored humvees. It was the President who sent in forces \nwithout body armor. It was the President and his Department of Defense \nwho weren't aware of the travesties that were taking place at Walter \nReed when it comes to veterans. It is the President's Veterans \nAdministration that refused a\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nfew years ago to ask for adequate money for the Veterans Administration \nhospitals because of the new demand from veterans.\n  If anyone over the last several years failed to fund the troops \nproperly, it is the President. So our concerns should be directed at \nhis failures to fund the troops rather than that of Congress.\n  This is a collaborative process that both the White House and the \nCongress have to ensure our forces have the resources they need, but we \nalso have to make sure they are performing the missions most important \nto the United States. By endorsing the Murray resolution, we are \nsending a clear message of our joint responsibility to fully fund our \nsoldiers in the field, and by supporting Majority Leader Reid's \nresolution, we are sending a signal that the right policy, phased \nredeployment, carefully defined missions, providing a stable regional \napproach to Iraq and, in the long term, redeploying troops so we can \nface with more flexibility the challenges of a North Korea, of an Iran, \nof places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and places perhaps at this \nmoment we are not aware of but will suddenly burst onto the front page \nbecause of the presence of terrorists or other destabilizing \nactivities.\n  I urge strong support of the resolution supported by Majority Leader \nReid and the resolution supported by Senator Murray.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, there is an old joke about the definition \nof retreat, which is a strategic withdrawal. I note that is the phrase \nused in the resolution, S.J. Res. 9, to describe the process of leaving \nIraq. The language effectively is: ``The President shall commence the \nphased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq not later than \n120 days,'' and then says:\n\n     . . . with the goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008, all the \n     United States combat forces from Iraq. . . .\n\n  Except for the limited purposes of protecting forces, training Iraqi \nforces, and conducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  That is a very bad idea. We shouldn't be playing politics with this \nwar, and we shouldn't be trying to micromanage the war from Congress. \nBut setting specific dates by which the commanders are to make certain \ndecisions, including how troops are deployed, is clearly micromanaging \nthe war effort.\n  The fact there have been 17 resolutions--I believe this is the 17th \nresolution--on the Democratic side of the Congress, and the fact that \nnone of those other 16 were adopted I think demonstrates the confusion \non the other side as to what exactly ought to be done and the \ndifferences of opinion by Members on the other side of the aisle.\n  Thank goodness we didn't adopt any of the other 16, and we shouldn't \nadopt this one either. This one is particularly pernicious. It actually \nbegins the withdrawal. It sets a date, ``shall commence the \nphased redeployment . . . not later than 120 days.\n\n  Then it uses a goal of completing that withdrawal by March 31, 2008. \nSome have tried to hide behind the word ``goal.'' I think Senator \nFeingold said it right, however, on March 8 of this year when he said:\n\n       For the first time, it--\n\n  ``It'' meaning the resolution--\n\n     has a timetable in place, as I called for in August of 2005. \n     It's not as early as I would like, but is a timetable not \n     only to begin to get the troops out but to get the troops out \n     except for very limited purposes.\n\n  It didn't always used to be this way. A lot of our Democratic \ncolleagues understood that setting timetables and deadlines was \nabsolutely the wrong thing to do.\n  The distinguished majority leader, for example, said:\n\n       But as far as setting a timeline, as we learned in the \n     Balkans, that's not a wise decision, because it only empowers \n     those who don't want us there, and it doesn't work well to do \n     that.\n\n  Another one of the supporters of the resolution said 2 days ago:\n\n       I don't believe it's smart to set a date for withdrawal. I \n     don't think you should ever telegraph your intentions to the \n     enemy so they can await you.\n\n  Another cosponsor of the resolution said 3 days ago:\n\n       I, for example, am not in support of circling a date on a \n     calendar and saying, ``No matter what, we're out on that \n     date.''\n\n  One of the most thoughtful people in the Senate on matters of foreign \npolicy has spoken a lot on this issue, and I think what he said a \ncouple of years ago makes a lot of sense. This is the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He was talking about the \noptions. He said:\n\n     . . . we call it quits and withdraw, I think that would be a \n     gigantic mistake for the reasons I stated earlier. Or we can \n     set a deadline for pulling out, which I fear will only \n     encourage our enemies to wait us out, equally a mistake. . . \n     . I mean, the idea of setting a timetable to leave generally \n     means that you have to set and train the process of leaving. \n     It is not an easy process. And I think once that is smelled \n     as the option, then I think you find it will degenerate \n     quickly into sectarian violence, every man for himself. And \n     the conclusion that will be achieved will be, I think, \n     Lebanon in 1985, and God knows where it goes from there.\n\n  Recently, the distinguished chairman said this, unfortunately:\n\n       We should withdraw our combat troops by early 2008, except \n     for a limited number necessary to keep training Iraqis and to \n     deny terrorists a sanctuary.\n\n  As I said, it used to be that most Senators understood that setting a \ntimetable in a war, a date for withdrawal was a very bad idea, not just \nbecause it tried to micromanage the conduct of the war from the \nCongress but because it signaled to the enemy precisely what the enemy \nhad to do, to wait us out and then prevail in the conflict.\n  That is precisely what this resolution does and is the key reason why \nevery Senator should be voting against this resolution and why those \nwho spoke against a timetable before should remember what they said and \nthe wisdom of those words and follow that same advice today.\n  This is especially pernicious because at the very time this \nresolution is being adopted, there continues to be news from Iraq that \nsuggests the new strategy, the Petraeus plan, is actually beginning to \nwork. Nobody is claiming any victory. There are going to be bad days as \nwell as good.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the close of my remarks to print in the \nRecord an article from the Associated Press in my hometown newspaper: \n``Baghdad's terror death counts are falling.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the article points out the fact that the \ndeath squad deaths are falling substantially, the militia activity is \ndown substantially. While our commanders there are being cautious about \ndeclaring the operation a success, nonetheless, there are many \ndifferent descriptions of events happening in Iraq that give us a lot \nof hope.\n  I was there a couple of weeks ago, and our commanders and Iraqis both \nwere cautiously optimistic this would work.\n  The point is, at the very time the new plan is underway and it seems \nto at least show early signs of success, why would we want to declare \nit a failure and start the process of withdrawing at the very time \nthese additional troops seem to be making a difference?\n  One of the chairmen of the Baker-Hamilton study commission, former \nDemocratic Congressman Lee Hamilton, was testifying before the Congress \nabout a month ago. He said we should give this plan a chance. We should \ngive it a chance to succeed. That is exactly what we ought to do. We \nstart by rejecting the resolution that is pending because it \nmicromanages the war and sends a horrible signal.\n  We also try to support the troops by adopting as quickly as possible \na supplemental appropriations bill that funds this effort without tying \nthe strings of our commanders and without imposing so many other \nconditions that the President is constrained to veto it. We have to get \nthat funding to our troops as soon as possible. That is the other \nmessage the commanders on the ground, both in Kuwait and Iraq, gave to \nme when we were there. They said: Please adopt the supplemental \nappropriations bill without strings.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the resolution when it comes up \nfor a vote later this afternoon.\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 15, 2007]\n\n               Baghdad's Terror Death Counts are Falling\n\n                          (By Robert H. Reid)\n\n       Baghdad.--Bomb deaths have gone down 30 percent in Baghdad \n     since the U.S.-led security crackdown began a month ago. \n     Execution-style slayings are down by nearly half.\n       The once frequent sound of weapons has been reduced to \n     episodic, and downtown shoppers have returned to outdoor \n     markets, which are favored targets of car bombers.\n       There are signs of progress in the campaign to restore \n     order in Iraq, starting with its capital city, according to a \n     Pentagon report released Wednesday.\n       But although many Iraqis are encouraged, they remain \n     skeptical how long the relative calm will last. Each bombing \n     renews fears the horror is returning. Shiite militias and \n     Sunni insurgents are still around, perhaps just lying low or \n     hiding outside the city until the operation is over.\n       U.S. military officials, burned before by overly optimistic \n     forecasts, have been cautious about declaring the operation a \n     success. Another reason it seems premature: Only two of the \n     five U.S. brigades earmarked for the mission are in the \n     streets, and the full complement of American reinforcements \n     is not due until late May.\n       The report even used for the first time the term ``civil \n     war'' to describe some of the violence. But it stressed that \n     the term does not capture Iraq's complex situation, and its \n     assessment was based on the final three months of 2006, which \n     it said was the most violent three-month period since the \n     U.S.-led invasion.\n       U.S. officials say the key to the security crackdown's \n     long-term success is the willingness of Iraq's sectarian and \n     ethnic political parties to strike a power- and money-sharing \n     deal. That remains elusive: A proposal for governing oil, the \n     country's main source of income, is bogged down in \n     parliamentary squabbling.\n       Nevertheless, there are encouraging signs.\n       Gone are the ``illegal checkpoints,'' where Shiite and \n     Sunni gunmen stopped cars and hauled away members of the \n     rival sect, often to a gruesome torture and death.\n       The rattle of automatic-weapons fire or the rumble of \n     distant roadside bombs comes less frequently. Traffic is \n     beginning to return to the city's once-vacant streets.\n       ``People are very optimistic because they sense a \n     development. The level of sectarian violence in streets and \n     areas has decreased,'' said a 50-year-old Shiite, who gave \n     his name only as Abu Abbas, or ``Father of Abbas.'' ``The \n     activities of the militias have also decreased. The car bombs \n     and the suicide attacks are the only things left while other \n     kinds of violence have decreased.''\n       In the months before the security operation began Feb. 14, \n     police were finding dozens of bodies each day in the capital, \n     all victims of Sunni and Shiite death squads. Last December, \n     more than 200 bodies were found each week, with the figure \n     spiking above 300 in some weeks, according to police reports \n     compiled by the Associated Press.\n       Since the crackdown began, weekly totals have dropped to \n     about 80, which is hardly an acceptable figure but clearly a \n     sign that death squads are no longer as active as they were \n     in the final months of last year.\n       Bombings also have decreased in the city, presumably due to \n     U.S. and Iraqi success in finding weapons caches and to more \n     government checkpoints in the streets that make it tougher to \n     deliver the bombs.\n       Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, made a show of \n     confidence Tuesday by traveling out of Baghdad for meetings \n     with Sunni tribal leaders and government officials in Ramadi, \n     a stronghold for Sunni insurgents.\n       ``I would caution everybody about patience, about \n     diligence,'' Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, a U.S. spokesman, \n     said Wednesday. ``This is going to take many months, not \n     weeks. But the indicators are all very positive right now.''\n       Sunni militants, meanwhile, are believed to have withdrawn \n     to surrounding areas such as Diyala province, where they have \n     safe haven. The U.S. command sent an extra 700 soldiers \n     Tuesday to protect the highways leading into the capital from \n     there.\n       If militants from both sects are indeed lying low, that \n     suggests they may have adopted a strategy of waiting until \n     the security operation is over, then re-emerging to fight \n     each other for control of the capital.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in November, the American people sent a \nclear message to Washington. They said: Change the course in Iraq. A \nfew weeks later, the Iraq Study Group issued its bipartisan report \ncalling for a change of course in Iraq. Even the President's new \nSecretary of Defense, Robert Gates, during his confirmation hearing, \nacknowledged that the current course in Iraq was not working. But \ninstead of developing a new strategy, the President has stayed on his \nfailed course, plunging American troops deeper and deeper into a civil \nwar on the streets of Baghdad and relying on the promises of Iraqi \npoliticians who have not delivered on previous promises.\n  The question for us today is whether we will accept that failing \nstrategy or whether we will change it. The President's deepening \nmilitary involvement will not lead to a stable Iraq because it has a \nfundamental flaw. It tries to impose a military solution on a political \ncrisis.\n  Listen to the assessment of Iraq Prime Minister Maliki of the \nsituation in his country. This is what he said:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of bloodletting of innocents are the Iraqi politicians.\n\n  Outside the White House is a consensus that a political solution \namong the Iraqis is required, but President Bush persists on a military \ndeepening involvement.\n  The President claims that Iraqis will meet the political benchmarks \nthat they have put forward, but the track record of Iraqi politicians \nindicates otherwise. On issue after issue, the Iraqi politicians have \nfailed to keep their word, and Iraq is worse off because of those \nfailures.\n  The President's course of action--deeper and deeper military \ninvolvement--sends a signal that the Iraqi leaders can continue to \nbicker without consequence. If the Iraqis fail to meet their own \nbenchmarks, the President will presumably continue to bail them out by \nsending American troops to police an Iraqi civil war. Unless failure to \nmeet benchmarks has consequences, those benchmarks have little meaning. \nWe must change the course if there is going to be any hope of success \nin Iraq.\n  The best leverage we have is the presence and mission of American \nforces. As long as our presence is open-ended, the dynamic in Iraq will \nremain the same: Insurgents will target our troops, militias will cause \nmayhem, and the Iraqi politicians will sit in relative safety in the \nGreen Zone, unwilling to make the compromises so essential to reaching \na political settlement that can save their country. But if we send a \nclear message that we are ending the open-ended commitment, that will \nshift responsibility to the Iraqis, both politically and militarily, \nfor their own future.\n  By requiring the President to change the mission of American forces \nto the three missions specified in the Reid resolution, by beginning a \nphased redeployment of American forces in 4 months, the resolution \nbefore us would force the Iraqi leaders to face reality and to \nunderstand that their future as a nation is in their own hands, not \nours. The Iraqis will finally be forced to decide if they want a civil \nwar or they want a nation. They will then understand we cannot save \nthem from themselves.\n\n  The President and his supporters ask for patience. But asking for \npatience now, after all these years of asking for patience without \nsuccess, is a little like Lucy asking Charlie Brown to try to kick the \nfootball one more time. We ought to be wise enough by now to know that \nincreased military involvement won't achieve the political settlement \nthat is needed.\n  General Peter Chiarelli, Commanding General of the Multi-National \nCorps in Iraq, said the following:\n\n       We need a commitment by all Iraqis of all the ethno-\n     sectarian groups to commit first to nonviolence and to \n     resolving their differences through the political process. I \n     happen to believe that we have done everything militarily we \n     possibly can.\n\n  General Casey made a similar point in early January when he said:\n\n       The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main \n     burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the \n     government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about \n     reconciliation and dealing with the militias.\n\n  The real battle for Baghdad is a political battle. Maximizing success \nin Iraq requires us to change course and to shift responsibility to the \nIraqi political leaders for the future of Iraq. To paraphrase British \nPrime Minister Tony Blair, the next chapter of Iraq's history needs to \nbe written by the Iraqis.\n  Our vote today will decide whether we will begin changing course to \nmaximize chances of success in Iraq or whether we will remain mired in \nthe status quo of sending more and more American troops into the middle \nof an Iraqi civil war.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we are brought back to the floor again \nthis week to continue the debate on Iraq and whether the United States \nshould begin to pull our troops out of Iraq. Yet again the majority \nleader has\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nbrought legislation to the floor of the Senate that will set arbitrary \ntimelines for U.S. withdrawal, sending a signal to the Iraqi people \nthat we are poised to abandon them; while at the same time sending a \nstrong message to our enemies that to defeat the United States, all \nthey need to do is wait us out. That kind of policy will allow our \ncurrent and future enemies to dictate our foreign policy for us, not \nthe other way around.\n  General Petraeus has now only had weeks to implement his new strategy \nfor stabilizing Baghdad. After a unanimous vote of confirmation, the \nmajority party now wants to send a signal to General Petraeus that we \nnot only have no confidence in his abilities to stabilize key parts of \nIraq but that we have no faith in our soldiers ability as well. That is \nnot a statement I am willing to send to our soldiers in combat. The \nmajority would rather see 535 generals leading the way towards \nstability and security in Iraq and the greater Middle East, and I do \nnot see that strategy as an effective way to run a war.\n  I cannot stress enough that our conflict in Iraq does not stop at the \nborders. Iraq is a central country in a very dangerous region of the \nworld. Bordered by Iran and Syria, which are both contributing to the \nviolence in Iraq, will clearly see a premature U.S. troop withdraw in \nIraq as a symbol that our resolve is not strong enough to stop their \nambitions for regional dominance.\n  A premature withdrawal from Iraq will almost certainly lead to a \nmassive humanitarian crisis, which would leave hundreds of thousands of \nIraqi civilians at the hands of murderous militias. I would ask of my \ncolleagues who favor immediate withdrawal from Iraq, are they willing \nto stand idly by as hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are raped, beaten \nand murdered? I would assume the answer would be no, paving the way for \nan even greater peacekeeping force to be deployed to Iraq, and making \nthe work to stabilize that country infinitely more difficult.\n  I think it is important for the American people to know that the \nroadblocks put up in the Senate regarding nonbinding votes on Iraq were \nnot put up by the Republican minority. I have stood on this floor on \nmore than one occasion debating the war this year. We have had, and \nwill continue to have, full debates on the floor of the Senate \nregarding Iraq, but it is up to the majority leader whether those \ndebates will be fair debates. I was pleased to see that an amendment \noffered by Senator Gregg will be allowed an up-or-down vote. This \nresolution clearly states that the Congress will not cut off any \nfunding for soldiers we send into combat. An overwhelming majority of \nboth the House and Senate voted to send these troops into war, and we \nall the responsibility to ensure that any American soldier in harm's \nway will have the full support of their government.\n  The majority party continuously denies planning or calling for \ndefunding this war, and thus the troops, but several Democratic \nSenators and Congressmen have spoken publicly about their desire to \neliminate funding for our soldiers. That is a very dangerous game to \nplay, when Members will allow antiwar politics to convince Members of \nCongress that they should cut off funding for American troops on the \nbattlefield.\n  Now, it is very clear that there is no single military operation that \ncan bring stability to Iraq by itself. We need the Iraqi government to \nstand up on its own two feet and lead their country. We need an Iraqi \neconomy to be strong and viable on its own in order to give the Iraqi \npeople a choice between turning towards insurgent militias and \nterrorist organization, but instead to start new businesses and make \nconstructive contributions to their society. However, without stability \nin the capital city, there can be no stable government and there can be \nno economic stability. The reinforcements called for by General \nPetraeus, which will assist in stabilizing Baghdad, are working to \nlower the levels of violence, and will pave the way for economic and \ngovernment stability.\n  I, like all of my colleagues, want nothing else but to have our \ntroops home and out of harm's way. That said, we should not be in such \na rush to leave Iraq that we leave that country in shambles, creating a \nhaven for terrorism and a humanitarian crisis that could rival or \nsurpass any we have seen before.\n  We are at a critical juncture in this war. The American people are \nquestioning our policies in Iraq, mistakes have been made over the \nthree plus years we have been in Iraq, and I will readily admit that. \nBut I do not believe that we are at a point of failure. The majority \nparty is frustrated with our progress in Iraq, but I firmly believe \nthat Congress micromanaging this war is the most detrimental policy our \ncountry could pursue. The Congress should not be in the business of \nsetting arbitrary withdrawal timetables, setting troop levels, \nthreatening funding for our soldiers, or sending messages to our \nsoldiers that we have no faith in their mission.\n  The Senate is yet again going to be voting on a series of binding and \nnonbinding resolutions that will send a strong message to our soldiers, \nthe American people, and to our enemies. I hope that my colleagues will \nspeak in a loud voice of support to our soldiers; a resolute voice to \nthe American people that we will not be defeated by radical insurgents \nand terrorist groups; and a firm voice to our enemies that we will not \nbe defeated. Our national security, and that of our allies, is at \nstake, and I will not cast a vote to pull our troops out of Iraq \nprematurely and allow Iraq to become a base of operations for strikes \nagainst this country.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today the Senate confronts the tragic \nsituation facing us in Iraq. No Member of the Senate, the \nadministration, or our Armed Forces is happy with where we stand in \nIraq. A mission that began with the great success of our men and women \nin uniform has bogged down through no fault of theirs. With heavy \nhearts the Congress, after hearing the people speak in November, must \nnow force a change in our policy in Iraq. We can no longer allow an \nopen-ended commitment to Iraq that endangers our forces while allowing \nIraqi politicians to delay the difficult choices they must make.\n  S.J. Res. 9, which I support, calls on the President to begin the \nredeployment of our troops out of Iraq. After 4 long years they have \nbeen stretched to the breaking point. They now referee a bloody civil \nwar that bears no resemblance to the original conflict we authorized \nthem to engage in. The time for military solutions is over, and the \ndifficult work of political compromise lies before the Iraqis with \nlittle our soldiers can do to help.\n  The resolution does not require a rapid pullout, however, but gives \ntime for a measured withdrawal that will protect our troops while \nproviding support to the new Iraqi government. It sets March 2008 as a \ngoal for our combat troops to be gone from Iraq--5 years after they \nfirst entered the country--but it provides flexibility if that is not \npossible. The March withdrawal goal is also in line with what the Iraq \nStudy Group believed was appropriate.\n  This reasonable goal will give Iraq's politicians time to make the \ndifficult decisions they need to make about power sharing and dividing \noil revenues. It will also give our troops time to complete the \ntraining and equipping of additional Iraqi police and security forces. \nFive years is plenty of time to help a new nation toward democracy--or \nprove that democracy cannot be imposed from the outside. Either way we \ncannot ask our military to continue their mission indefinitely.\n  Critics of the resolution believe that withdrawing from Iraq will \ndamage our national security, but I disagree. The ongoing conflict in \nIraq is hurting our image in the world, it is hurting our economy, and \nit is hurting our military. This war is no longer protecting us, but \naccording to our own intelligence community it is encouraging \nterrorists to take up arms against us. Our presence has kicked off a \nvicious circle of violence that makes us less secure--not more. We need \nto close the circle and end this cycle of violence.\n  We all want a stable and peaceful Iraq, but it is time to recognize \nthat the U.S. alone cannot achieve that goal. We need the help of the \nIraqi people and the assistance of Iraq's neighbors. If we work \ntogether Iraq can get on its feet and repair the sectarian divide. But \nif we continue on our current path, bearing the burden by ourselves, \nthe cycle of violence will erode our good efforts. It is time for a \nchange. It is time for us to shift the burden to the Iraqis and help \nthem carry it forward.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, there are many statements in the \nresolution by the Senator from New Hampshire that are true. It is a \ntrue statement that the President has the power to ``deploy troops and \ndirect military campaigns during wartime.'' But that presupposes that a \nwar has been properly authorized by Congress because that power exists \nonly in wartime, or in certain emergency circumstances. The President \ndoes not, however, have the power under the Constitution to initiate a \nwar.\n  It is literally true that Congress has the power of the purse, and in \nthat capacity has the moral responsibility to adequately support the \ntroops in the field, once we are at war. This administration has failed \nin that responsibility in not equipping our soldiers in Iraq with \nadequate armor, in not having an adequate plan to stabilize Iraq after \nthe initial invasion, and in not caring for our soldiers properly when \nthey return home.\n  But this resolution is not balanced. It does not set forth a \nstatement about Congress's powers under the Constitution to authorize \nthe use of force under article I. Nor does it say anything about the \nauthority of Congress to change the mission of U.S. forces, once a war \nhas commenced. This silence about Congress's power might be interpreted \nto suggest that the President's powers as Commander in Chief to \ninitiate war are unlimited, and that Congress's sole responsibility is \nto fund a war that the President initiates. That is not what the \nConstitution says, and I cannot vote for anything that might be so \nread.\n  Because the Gregg resolution lacks balance, I cannot vote for it. I \nwill vote instead for the resolution by Senator Murray, which presents \na more complete statement about the allocation of powers under the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madan President, I rise today to discuss the S.J. Res. 9 \ndealing with troop withdrawals from Iraq.\n  While this nonbinding resolution is different from the resolution we \ndebated last month, its purpose is still the same. It will micromanage \nthe war and send a detrimental message to both our troops and our \nenemies.\n  That is why I voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nresolution and why I will vote no on its final passage. I believe that \nwe must give the President's new strategy for Iraq a chance to work \nbefore we begin criticizing it.\n  At this time, we ought to be sending a clear message of support for \nour troops and for ensuring that they have the necessary supplies and \nresources to carry out their mission. Unfortunately, we cannot seem to \nsee beyond our political differences to do this and instead want to \nattack the President's Iraq plan no matter what the consequences of our \nactions would be.\n  Jut a few weeks ago on January 26, the Senate unanimously--\nunanimously--confirmed GEN David Petraeus to be commander of the \nmultinational forces in Iraq. General Petraeus supports the President's \nnew strategy in Iraq and has embarked on a mission that both the \nPresident and the Senate selected him to do.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues the irony, as well as the \ninconsistency, in the choice this resolution is presenting to this \nbody. With the newest Iraq resolution, we are once again being asked to \ndisapprove of the very mission we unanimously confirmed General \nPetraeus to execute. This resolution asks Senators and not General \nPetraeus to direct the activites in Iraq. But Congress is not the \ncommander in chief, and we should not be dictating military strategy.\n  The resolution sets a specific date for the beginning of the \nwithdrawal of our troops from Iraq. This withdrawal would occur even if \nthere is progress on the ground in Iraq or our allies believe our \npresence is still necessary. This resolution allows politics to be the \ndeciding factor of how we manage a war.\n  Passage of this resolution would show to the world that our will can \neasily be stripped by terrorists if they just wait it out.\n  If General Petraeus, who is a friend of mine, comes back to Congress \nand tells us that the President's new strategy is not working, then I \nam prepared to change our course. But we need to give it a chance to \nwork.\n  We have already begun to see some successes based on recent events \nand reports from General Petraeus. Sectarian killings have been lower \nin Baghdad over the past several weeks than in the previous months. \nThere is less sectarian displacement in Baghdad neighborhoods allowing \nfamilies to return home and Sunni insurgent leaders have renewed talks \nwith top U.S. officials about political accommodation.\n  I realize these successes are small and it is too early to tell \nwhether they will lead to significant changes in the future, but we now \nhave proof that this strategy could work if given the chance.\n  We have also begun to see a positive response from the Iraqi people. \nJust 2 weeks ago, the Iraqi council approved the foundation of a \nhydrocarbon bill which is a oil revenue-sharing measure with the Iraqi \npeople and the provinces of Iraq. The legislation is soon going to the \nassembly. For the first time in the history of their country, the \npeople of Iraq are on the doorstep of having equity in oil \ndistribution.\n  Despite these successes and unanimously confirming our new commander \nin Iraq, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to \ndeclare failure. They would like to tie General Petraeus's hands in a \nway that would make achieving his mission impossible. I do not believe \nthat pulling the rug out from underneath our top commander in Iraq is a \nplan for success. Rather, I believe that we should focus the current \ndebate on what we can do to support General Petraeus and the brave \nyoung men and women in Iraq to accomplish this critical mission. I will \ncontinue to do whatever I can to ensure that our troops and mission \nsucceeds.\n  Failure in Iraq is not an option. It would not only jeopardize our \nown national security but that of the region as a whole.\n  When this motion to micromanage the war in Iraq comes to vote, I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose it. Remember, we have only one commander in \nchief, not 535 generals who make war plans from the floor of the \nCongress.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, as I begin my comments on the resolutions \nwe have under consideration, I want to first make very clear my strong \nsupport for the members of our Armed Forces and the vital work they are \ndoing around the world every day. I have the greatest admiration for \nthem all for their heartfelt commitment to preserving our freedoms and \nmaintaining our national security. They are all true heroes and they \nare the ones who are doing the heavy lifting and making great \nsacrifices in our country's name so that we might continue to be the \nland of the free and the home of the brave.\n  Over the years, I have been to Iraq and I have met with the members \nof our Armed Forces there and, later, here in the United States when \nthey have returned home. These remarkable men and women exemplify the \nbest qualities of our Nation. They volunteered to serve in the best \ntrained force in the world and they deserve our complete and unwavering \nsupport. If it were possible, I would like to have each and every one \nof our troops back home with their families and friends immediately. We \ncannot, however, pull our troops out of Iraq at this point without \nfacing extremely dire consequences for a long time to come. I have \nspoken at length to our troops about their mission and they understand \ntheir mission.\n  I was thinking about them, and all of the members of our military who \nare presently serving around the world as I began to prepare my \nremarks. I thought back to the days, years ago, when I was first \nelected to serve as the Mayor of Gillette, WY. I made a habit of \ncarrying around a copy of the United States Constitution with me \neverywhere I went. I kept it in my coat pocket, next to my pen, and \nwhenever I looked at it, it reminded me of two things--the Government I \nwas a part of, and the people I was elected to serve.\n  Then, when I came here to the Senate, the Constitution took on an \neven greater, deeper meaning for me. I see it as my job description. \nThat is why I make sure to always keep it handy so it can continue to \nserve as a reminder of the detailed portrait it contains of our Federal \nGovernment and how it was designed to work by our Founding Fathers. \nToday, it provides us with a\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\ngood starting point for our debate and it provides some of the answers \nto the issues before us.\n  The relevant parts of the our country's Constitution are quite clear. \nCongress must be consulted before any large scale military operation is \nbegun. But once that has been done, the Commander in Chief of our Armed \nForces, the President, is to direct the effort that we have approved.\n  The Founding Fathers had a good reason for establishing the President \nas the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces and the one who is \nresponsible for making the decisions affecting the actions of our \nNation's military.\n  That does not mean that Congress does not have a play in these \ndecisions. We all have an important role to play when it comes to \nmatters like these. Again, in their great wisdom, the drafters of our \nConstitution knew that Congress could--and should--influence policy--\nbut they knew it would be impossible for us to have all the information \navailable to the President to debate and assess before making a \ndecision on the viability of every military operation. The process of \ndetermining military strategy would be a nightmare if we were to be \nexpected to debate all of the intricacies of every policy and, by so \ndoing, publicly reveal some of the information obtained by our \nintelligence agencies on the House and Senate floor before reaching a \ndecision. Our procedure on the Senate floor is a good process for \ndebating and considering legislation, but it is a process that does not \nlend itself well to producing a quick and informed military decision at \na time of crisis.\n  Those thoughts were on my mind when the President put forward a new \nstrategy for us to pursue in Iraq, recognizing that what we are \ncurrently doing is not working. General David Petraeus, our U.S. \nCommander in Iraq, testified before us about that policy. He is \nconsulting with highly educated and trained members of the military, \nmany from universities where criticism of U.S. efforts in Iraq has \nflourished. It is evident that the President and his advisors are \nseeking analysis and recommendations from people who recognize the fact \nthat the road ahead will be complicated and difficult.\n  Listening to the debate, I have heard many of my colleagues sum up \nthe President's new strategy as just increasing the number of American \ntroops in Iraq. I do not believe it is a matter of numbers. The real \nquestion should be what the placement of these troops is designed to \naccomplish. There is no question that there must be a clearly defined \nmission for them on the ground. By having more forces on the ground, we \nmay be able to decrease the vulnerability of our troops as they move \nfrom place to place. That will provide them with the backup and \nprotection they need to more safely pursue their mission.\n  In the months to come, it is clear that there are several things the \nnew policy must do if it is to be successful. First and foremost, the \nnew campaign must provide the security the people of Iraq must have to \nfeel safe at home. If they do not feel secure under the protection of \nthe United States, coalition, and Iraqi forces, they will turn toward \nterrorist organizations that will prey on their fears and provide a \nfalse sense of security. America's long-term security interests and the \npossibility of world peace will be best served by an Iraq that can \nsustain, govern, and defend itself, while serving as an ally in the war \nagainst the terrorists.\n  Looking long term, I think we would all agree that the future of Iraq \nwill directly affect the balance of power in the Middle East. That is \nwhy countries throughout the region are watching to see what action we \nwill take in Iraq. An immediate withdrawal of United States and \ncoalition forces will leave our allies in the region forced to prepare \nfor additional conflicts.\n  Our mission in Iraq has not been easy, and it will not get easier in \nthe days to come. After all, we are facing centuries-old difficulties \nas we work with the people of Iraq to help them overcome their \nreligious and ethnic differences to form a nation that will work to \nbenefit and protect all their people.\n  Ultimately, what the future of Iraq will be is up to the Iraqi people \nthemselves. Iraq must put together a working coalition of its three \nmajor groups, the Kurds, Sunnis, and Shia, as well as other ethnic and \nreligious minorities. They must work for national reconciliation \nthrough shared responsibilities as well as shared oil revenues that \nwill be used to solve the problems that exist in their own backyard. \nSuch a reconciliation will not only be good for Iraq, but the Middle \nEast as a whole.\n  We have set forth benchmark requirements for the Iraqis to make. Our \nfirst benchmark has been met. Their parliament has approved an \nequitable split of oil revenues between the three factions. This is \nprogress.\n  Looking back, the record is clear. Like many Members of the United \nStates Senate, I supported the original decision in 2002 to take action \nagainst Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The vote I cast that day was not an \neasy decision. The tough ones are like that. You make the best decision \nyou can, based on the information you have on hand at the time you have \nto make it. Those are the decisions that make us all lose sleep for \nyears afterward. Anytime you vote to put our Nation's young men and \nwomen in harm's way, it stays with you long after the fighting is over \nand our troops are on their way back home.\n  Today, I remain concerned about the safety of the people on the \nground: Americans, coalition allies, and the Iraqi people. And there is \ngood reason for my concern. With today's rapid communication made \npossible by the Internet, cell phones, and other technologies, what we \nsay here can almost instantaneously find its way around the world and \nstraight to the camps of both friends and foes--and they are both \nwatching. In fact, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the \nwhole world is watching to see what we will decide to do.\n  That leads me to ask, what do we hope to accomplish through this \ndebate? We have already approved the nomination of General Petraeus by \na unanimous vote. Now we are considering a resolution condemning a plan \nhe has not had a chance to put into action yet. What sort of message \nwill we send our troops with our vote on that?\n  As Members of the United States Senate, we have the opportunity to \nvoice our opinions to the President and our constituents. But the fact \nthat we are even going through this debate at this point in time may \ngive those who wish to do us harm hope and embolden them--and once \nemboldened they will pose an even greater threat to our troops.\n  As we continue with our consideration of these resolutions, I want to \nbe clear that I do not want to cut funding for the troops. Their safety \nand their very lives depend on that funding. When you are in a war, you \ndo not do that to the troops.\n  Looking ahead, in the months to come, Congress must continue to \nclosely monitor the actions of the new Iraqi government, our military \nleaders, and our civilian leaders. We should continue to express our \nopinions, and take whatever actions are necessary to ensure our troops \nare provided the best support possible so that they can come home soon. \nWe should not, however, further endanger the lives of Americans and \nIraqis simply to make a statement and take a stand against the \nPresident.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, the Senate will vote on whether \nAmerica is on the right course in Iraq, or the wrong one.\n  I have spent the past two years traveling all over Rhode Island, \nlistening to people from my state who were angry and frustrated at this \nPresident's refusal to see that his policies in Iraq were wrong from \nthe start, and remain wrong today. Last November, they and millions of \nAmericans cast their votes for a new direction.\n  They sent us here to hold this President accountable: for distorting \nintelligence to serve his policy goals; for failing to give our troops \nthe equipment they needed to do their jobs overseas, and failing to \ntake adequate care of them when they return home; for telling our \ncountry the mission was accomplished when, as we've seen, the war has \nnow stretched on for five long years; for now proposing to send tens of \nthousands more American soldiers into harm's way, against the wishes of \nthe American people, and without a plan to bring the conflict to an \nend.\n  Americans know the truth: escalating the war in Iraq will not make \nthat nation more secure, or bring Iraq\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nand its people any closer to a lasting peace. It will not make our \nnation more secure. And it is not the new direction Americans demanded.\n  There is a way to change course in Iraq. If we announce clearly that \nthe redeployment of American troops will begin, and begin soon, that \nopens up diplomatic opportunities in Iraq, in the Middle East, and \naround the world.\n  When it is evident to the insurgents that America is not an army of \noccupation, the factions within the Iraqi government will be obliged--\nand better able--to assume responsibility for the security and \ngovernance of their own nation. Iraq's neighbors will be newly \nmotivated to take steps that will encourage a peaceful and secure Gulf \nregion.\n  This binding resolution makes it clear that the situation in Iraq has \nchanged since Congress authorized the use of force in Iraq in 2002. It \nstates the President must begin the phased redeployment of American \ncombat troops in no later than four months, with that redeployment \ncompleted by March 31, 2008.\n  The President failed to show America a new direction, and so the \nSenate will step forward to lead where he will not. I will vote yes to \na change of course in Iraq, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nexplain why I will vote against S. Res. 107.\n  First, I must applaud Senator Murray for what I believe was the \noverall premise of her amendment, to show the entire Congress's resolve \nin supporting our troops.\n  I fully agree with the portion of the amendment that reaffirms the \nSenate's commitment to providing the ``necessary funds for training, \nequipment, and other support for troops in the field, as such actions \nwill ensure their safety and effectiveness in preparing for and \ncarrying out their assigned duties.''\n  This is a policy to which I have dedicated my entire Senate career.\n  However, as a lawyer, I believe that it is also my duty to evaluate \nand work toward ensuring that all legislation which the Senate passes \nis strictly within the limits of our constitutional powers. As the \npreamble states, ``Under the Constitution, the President and Congress \nhave shared responsibilities for decisions on the use of the Armed \nForces of the United States, including their mission, and for \nsupporting the Armed Forces, especially during wartime.''\n  Unfortunately, S. Res. 107 does not meet that test. While at first \nglance the passage I just cited may seem innocuous, the phrase ``shared \nresponsibilities'' raises important separation of powers questions.\n  As we all know, the Constitution does not speak of shared powers, it \nspeaks of the different branches of government having separate and \ndistinct powers--a point which is at the core of the debate on our \nnation's policies toward Iraq.\n  Under article II, section 2 of the Constitution, the President is the \n``Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.'' \nHowever, Congress's role is limited in article I, section 8 which, in \npart, reads ``. . . The Congress shall have power to . . . provide for \nthe common defense and general welfare of the United States. . . To \ndeclare war . . . to raise and support armies . . . to provide and \nmaintain a navy . . . to make rules for the government and regulation \nof the land and naval forces; . . . to provide for calling forth the \nmilitia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and \nrepel invasions . . . to provide for organizing, arming, and \ndisciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may \nbe employed in the service of the United States . . .''\n  These are very different powers; they are not shared. The \nConstitution provides for only one Commander in Chief. Our troops are \nfacing enough challenges in the weeks and months ahead--they do not \nneed to worry if there will be 435 commanders in chief.\n  It is important that we remember this point now more then ever. And \nso, it is my analysis that the ``shared powers'' reference in S. Res. \n107 clearly raises constitutional concerns, and that is why I voted \nagainst S. Res. 107.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, before the Senator leaves, as it is \nright now, we have 10 minutes left on this side. There is 1 hour left \non the Senator's side. We want very much to get some speakers down \nhere, if we could. I understand we are trying to reserve 20 minutes for \nleadership time and 10 minutes on each side. If the Senator has \nspeakers, this would be a good time to have them down here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I believe one Senator is on his way right \nnow, and the Senator's notice should produce some other Senators as \nwell.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, rather than to speak myself, since there \nis going to be equal time coming off for both sides until a speaker \ngets down here, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the last \nquorum call time be taken from the Democrats' time, and that future \nquorums come from the Democrat side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what I wish to do at this moment is address \none of the arguments I have heard many of my colleagues make over the \npast 2 days of this debate. The argument I have heard when I was on the \nfloor yesterday, and again I have heard it today, is that the joint \nresolution we are debating is an effort to micromanage the war by \nfocusing the mission of U.S. Armed Forces on training Iraqis, denying \nterrorists a safe haven in Iraq, and force protection.\n  If you listen to my colleagues who oppose this, you hear them recount \nthat as if somehow that is exceeding the power of the people to speak, \nthrough their Congress, as to what role American military forces are \npermitted to play. Many of my colleagues on the other side go on to \nargue we are somehow overstepping our constitutional boundaries in \ndefining the purpose for which U.S. forces can be used in Iraq.\n  Well, that argument, I respectfully suggest, is dead wrong. Defining \nthe overall mission of U.S. troops is entirely within the power of the \nCongress under the U.S. Constitution. Indeed, not doing so would be an \nabdication of our fundamental duty under the Constitution, which \nclearly manifests war power in the hands of the Congress.\n  Now let me give you a few illustrations, if I may. In 2002, when we \nvoted to authorize the use of force against Iraq, we defined the \npurpose. We defined the purpose for which the President was permitted \nto use American forces against Iraq. It was to defend the national \nsecurity of the United States against the continuing threat posed by \nIraq, and, further, to enforce all relevant U.N. Security Council \nresolutions regarding Iraq.\n  During the course of the negotiations on that resolution, in which I \nwas deeply involved, Congress made it clear, at least on this side--as \none of the several people speaking for the Democrats at the time in the \nSenate--we specifically and clearly rejected the Bush administration's \ninitial proposal for using force in Iraq. President Bush sought what I \nbelieve to be, and the majority of the Senate eventually did, an overly \nbroad authority to use force: to restore international peace and \nsecurity in the region.\n  I read that at the time as a grant of authority to the President that \nfar exceeded what arguably was necessary at all in Iraq. The function \nof our military force was not to restore international peace and \nsecurity in the region. We struck that and said: The use\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\nof force is to defend the national security of the United States \nagainst a continuing threat from Iraq, not the region; not the region.\n  After the President's attempted overreach here, we narrowed the \ngeographic scope of the authority the Congress, under the Constitution, \nwas willing to grant the President, and we narrowed the purpose for \nwhich he was allowed to use force. We did two things. We not only said, \nMr. President, this is not about the region. You can only use force, if \nnecessary, dealing with Iraq being a threat to the United States.\n  I remind everybody what we were being told at the time. We were being \ntold by the Vice President that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear \nprogram. Simply not true. It was not true when he stated it. Our \nintelligence community not only said he did not reconstitute the \nnuclear program, it said he had no nuclear program. That is not what we \nwere told.\n  So we gave him authority, I remind everyone, to negotiate at the \nUnited Nations, to keep the pressure of the world on Iraq, to bring \nback the U.N. people, to determine what nuclear program or weapons of \nmass destruction he had, to get the inspectors back in, and to \nnegotiate to do that, because at the time the argument taking place in \nthe world was, was the U.S. embargo, was the world embargo, were the \nU.N. inspectors causing pain for innocent Iraqis?\n  Do you remember how many times we heard the argument that the reason \nwhy there was not enough medicine, the reason why children were dying, \nthe reason why they did not have enough food, was because of this awful \nthing the United States was leading, the embargo on Iraq, the Food for \nOil Program?\n  So to put this in context so everybody remembers, there were a lot of \nus on the floor willing to give deference to the President, who we \nthought was responsible in the exercise of power at the time, because \nhe appeared responsible immediately after 9/11; he proceeded correctly \nrelative to al-Qaida and the Taliban. He did not go off willy-nilly and \nstart bombing people. He built the case. He sent his envoys all over \nthe world. He made a compelling case for the right for us to invade \nAfghanistan. He even went so far as to worry about whether the Arab \nstreet would rise up if we attacked Muslims in Afghanistan. He engaged \nin public diplomacy. He did a fine job.\n  That was the context in which we gave him this power. But even then, \nas much as he had done well relative to Afghanistan at the time, we \nquite frankly did not trust him or any President to have this broad \nreach of authority which he asked for, which was to maintain peace, \ninternational peace and security in the region.\n  So we cut back the authority we gave him to negotiate at the U.N. \nRemember what he tried to do. He came and made the argument: There has \nto be a demonstration that all of the Nation support him in that we \nmust keep pressure on Saddam. All Democrats and Republicans support \nhim. That was the argument made to us. He did not come up here and make \nthe argument to the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee: We need to be able to attack. He argued we needed to be able \nto give him the moral authority to go to the United Nations and keep \nthe pressure on, because the French were wavering, the Europeans were \nwavering, some Arab countries were wavering. And then as time went on, \nhe built this argument about they reconstituted their nuclear weapons \nand the like. But even then we did not give him the authority he asked \nfor.\n  Why am I dwelling on this? Well, we made a clear judgment as a Senate \nand as a House, as a Congress, that he did not have the geographic \nscope for the extended purpose he wanted. We said: Here is your writ, \nMr. President. Here is the region you are allowed to, if need be, use \nforce--in this constrained area called Iraq. Because you are telling \nus, Mr. President, it is a threat to the United States of America, not \na threat to the region, it is a threat to the United States of America. \nSo you have the authority to deal with that, if necessary.\n  Secondly, even within Iraq, you can only use the force to enforce all \nrelevant U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. If memory \nserves me, there were 16, including resolutions relating to weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  So that was the rationale. We severely limited the authority he \nwanted because we thought it was an overreach. Now we know there were \nno weapons of mass destruction. Now we know--I will speak and say what \nI believe--hopefully the Intelligence Committee will show--not only did \nwe have bad intelligence, but the good intelligence we had was misused \nby the administration, in my opinion. We will find out whether that \nturns out to be true.\n  In 2002, when we offered the authorization to use force, we defined \nthe purpose. So I ask those who argue that we are now overstepping our \nbounds with this resolution, did we overstep our bounds in 2002 when we \nauthorized the use of force against Iraq, when we limited what the \nPresident wanted to do? If, in fact, we do not have the constitutional \nauthority today to limit what the President wants to do, how did we \nhave the authority to do it in 2002? As I said, what is the rationale \nfor the continued authority under the 2002 resolution? There are no \nweapons of mass destruction. All the U.N. resolutions are in \ncompliance. And nobody argues the Iraqi Government is a threat to the \nUnited States of America. Are they going to invade us?\n  To those who have a problem with the mission we defined in this joint \nresolution before the Senate, I also say, listen to Prime Minister Tony \nBlair in announcing last month the redeployment of British forces from \nIraq. Last month the mission the British Government assigned to those \nBrits who will remain in Iraq is precisely what we prescribed in our \nresolution. The new mission of the British forces in Iraq is the \nfollowing: to transfer responsibility to the Iraqis; to train and \nsupport Iraqi forces; to help secure the border and supply routes; and \nto conduct operations against extremist groups, i.e., Al-Qaida. It is \nnot to fight in the Iraqi civil war. It is not to be in the lead role \nin security operations in Basra, where they had authority, or in \nBaghdad, where they did not. In short, with the exception of denying \nterrorists sanctuary and training of Iraqis, the British forces are \nmoving from the driver's seat to the backseat. This resolution proposes \nthat very transition for our forces in Iraq.\n  So I ask again, rhetorically, does the Vice President think Prime \nMinister Blair's announcement of a ``redeployment,'' as the Vice \nPresident said, ``validates the al-Qaida strategy''? That is what he is \naccusing the Congress of. That is what he accuses me and Carl Levin of \nwhen we came up with this idea, that is now a leadership amendment; we \nare validating al-Qaida's strategy.\n  Are the British validating al-Qaida's strategy? Is he saying Tony \nBlair is validating Osama bin Laden? It is ridiculous. It is a \nridiculous argument. It flies in the face of the facts. It comes down \nto this: Do we want American troops fighting an Iraqi civil war? Is \nthat what we want these troops for? Is that why we sent them? Do you \nthink, when we voted back in 2002, if we knew there were no weapons of \nmass destruction, if Saddam were gone, if they were in compliance with \nother U.N. resolutions, but if there were a raging civil war, do you \nthink we would have voted on the floor of this body to send 150,000, \n160,000, 170,000, 180,000 American troops to Iraq to help them settle \ntheir civil war? What do you think? I don't think so. We might have \nsent troops to Jordan. We might have done what we are trying now in \nAmman and the emirates. We might have beefed up Turkey. We might have \naccepted to go after al-Qaida sites. But I doubt very much we would \nvote now to get in the midst of a self-sustaining cycle of sectarian \nviolence, which is what it is. If you want American troops fighting a \ncivil war in Iraq, if you want that, then vote against this resolution, \ndo not vote for it. Do not vote for it.\n  You say that is not fair; we are not engaged in fighting in a civil \nwar. Has anybody asked themselves the rhetorical question: Why is it \nthat Sadr, who has been responsible for killing a lot of Americans, and \nhis Mahdi army, which has been responsible for killing a lot of \nAmericans, why is it that the Shia-led Mahdi army, particularly in Sadr \nCity, has taken off their uniforms, hidden their weapons, and as of \nyesterday--I have not checked today--there were rumors that Sadr is no \nlonger in Iraq?\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nMaybe he is back now. We do not know for sure where he is. Why is it \nthat they took down the blockade? Is it because all of a sudden they \nturned peace loving?\n  I respectfully suggest, because inadvertently the 17,500 troops we \nare surging into the middle of Baghdad, we are surging them into 20-\nsome neighborhoods that are Sunni.\n  They are bad guys, these former Saddamists, these former Baathists--\nthis insurgency--who were referred to until recently by the Secretary \nof Defense as ``a bunch of dead enders.'' I respectfully suggest the \nreason all of a sudden the Shia in Sadr City are lying low is because \nthey are very happy the United States is doing their job for them, \nkilling their enemy, killing the bad guys who are Sunnis. Does anybody \nthink if we succeed in that mission that all of a sudden we are not \ngoing to see all those weapons come out of hiding in Sadr City? Does \nanybody think that all of a sudden it is going to be safe for Americans \nin that region? Does anybody think the uniforms aren't going to come \nback on and the roadblocks aren't going to go back up? These folks \naren't dumb. It is not our purpose, but the effect is, we are engaged \nin this civil war.\n  The question is, What is the plan to responsibly end our \nparticipation in this war without leaving behind chaos, without having \ntraded a dictator for chaos, without having left behind a cycle of \nself-sustaining sectarian violence that metastasizes in the \nfragmentation of Iraq and metastasizes in the region--Turkey, Iran, \nSyria, Saudi Arabia? What is the answer?\n  So far, I don't hear a plan. Notice, by the way, now the surge is \nreally getting bumped up, as some of us predicted on this floor when he \nannounced the surge and predicted in our committee, 17,000 people to \n22,500, whatever the actual number was initially. Now they are saying \nthey are going to need 30,000 people for the surge. Why? Because it is \nlike squeezing a water balloon. The bad guys have left this area in \npart, and they have now gone to the province directly outside of \nBaghdad.\n  General Keane is a very bright fellow, an honest guy, a former four-\nstar general, who testified before our committee. He came up with the \noriginal plan about surging. He said: In order for this to work, you \nare going to have to surge well beyond Baghdad. You are going to have \nto go into Anbar Province and beyond. He predicted what would happen.\n  They said: No, we are only talking about 22,500 troops.\n  What is the purpose of the surge? The purpose of the surge, we are \ntold--in a humanitarian sense, it makes a lot of sense, except for the \nhumanitarian interest of our troops--is to bring order to Baghdad, stop \nthe killing and the chaos. Why? Because when that happens and they \nhave--I think the phrase used is ``breathing room''--when they have \nthat breathing room, what is going to happen? Then they can negotiate. \nThen they will sit down and negotiate an agreement among themselves. \nHas anybody asked the question, What will be the basis of that \nnegotiation? What is the idea? What is the element? What is the \npolitical solution?\n  The President continues to insist on a well-intended but \nfundamentally flawed strategy. The flawed strategy is, it is possible \nto have a strong central democratic government. Before we went to war, \nI believed, and so stated, that there is not going to be a democracy \nthere in any of our lifetimes, including the Presiding Officer, who is \nconsiderably younger than most of us. It is not going to happen. It is \npossible that we could leave behind a country secure within its \nborders, loosely federated, not a threat to its neighbor and not a \nhaven for terror, but that is as good as it is going to get.\n  At least one and probably both of my colleagues in the Chamber were \nhere during the Balkan crisis in Bosnia. What does history teach us and \nwhat does recent experience teach us? Wherever there is a cycle of \nself-sustaining genocide, self-sustaining sectarian violence, when in \nmodern history has it ended other than any one of four ways:\n  One, a victor. They wipe out the other two sides or three sides or \none side, and one of the ethnic groups prevails militarily on the \nbattlefield.\n  Two, occupation by an outside force--the Ottoman Empire, the Persian \nEmpire, the British Empire.\n  We can't afford the first to happen because that would have a \ndevastating impact on the region because everybody knows the Sunni \nstates will get more involved. If it goes the other way, the Shia \nstates will be involved in Iran beyond what they are now. That is not a \nreal option. We are not an occupying force. It is not in our DNA. We \nare not an empire.\n  The third option historically is a dictator, a strongman. Wouldn't \nthat be the ultimate irony--us going to Iraq to take down Saddam and \nrestoring a strong man, which, I respectfully suggest, we should \nconsider might happen because eventually we are going to leave and the \ndysfunctional circumstances in Iraq are as likely to produce a strong \nmilitary leader to take over as anything else, although there is no \nindividual in sight right now. That is not an option available to us.\n  What is the fourth historical option? Federation, a federal system, a \nweak central government within the defined borders of a country that, \nin fact, gives the warring sectarian parties some control over the \nfabric of their daily lives, their local police force for their public \nsafety, rules relating to marriage, education. That is the only other \noption which has ever worked. It doesn't work perfectly.\n  What does recent history tell us? Like many here, I was deeply \ninvolved in our Balkan policy. As my friend from Kansas may remember, \nI, to use the vernacular, beat President Clinton up and about the head \nto use force in the Balkans. I argued, after encountering Milosevic 2 \nyears before he acted in his office--when he asked me what I thought of \nhim, I said: I think you are a damn war criminal, and I am going to \nspend my career seeing you tried as one. I came back and wrote report \nafter report, after close to a dozen visits. I saw what was happening \nin Brcko, in Tuzla, in Sarajevo, in Srebenica, more sectarian violence \nin the Balkans from Vlad the Impaler to Milosevic than ever occurred in \nwhat is now called Iraq.\n  So how did we end it? We ended it after they killed several hundred \nthousand people, mostly women and children. We ended it after we \ngathered all the neighbors, including Russia, a pro-Serbian force, \nFrance, all the nations in the region. We gathered in a room. We \nbrought in the parties who were warring, including Milosevic, Tudjman, \nCroats, and other leaders representing the Bosniaks. What did we do? We \nthen called the Dayton Peace Accords. What did we do there? We gave \nmuch more autonomy to each of those groups than ever was envisioned by \nwhat I am proposing.\n  We set up a thing called the Republic of Serbia in Bosnia with its \nown President. We had a Bosnian President and we had a Croatian \nPresident. For over 10 years, as my friend from Oklahoma can attest, \nwho knows more about force structure than most of us know, there have \nbeen over 20,000 on average NATO forces there. To the best of my \nknowledge, none has been killed in anger with a shot fired.\n  What is going on in Bosnia today? Was everyone who was ethnically \ncleansed able to come back to their neighborhoods? No. A lot have. Is \nthere still injustice? Yes. Is genocide continuing? No. What are they \ndoing now? They are debating amending their Constitution to become part \nof Europe so they can join the EU down the road. We don't have to go \nvery far for an example.\n  Let me ask the rhetorical question again: Can anybody name me a time, \nwithout empire, dictator or expiring, that self-sustaining sectarian \nviolence within the borders of a country has resulted in a central \nfederal control that is democratic? With all due respect to the \nPresident, arguably his dream at the outset made sense. That is why I \ncalled 3 years ago for 60,000 to 100,000 additional American forces. \nThat is why I called for the need for at least 5,000 to 6,000 \nparamilitary police to be sent, because I believed--and I wrote at the \ntime--if the genie ever gets out of the bottle, if we don't establish \norder quickly, there is no possibility of stopping a vicious civil war.\n  Senator Hagel and I got smuggled across the Turkish border before the \nwar began, and went up to Arbil and met with the Brazani and Talabani \nclans to discuss with them whether\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\nthey would actually be with us if force was used. They had us each \nspeak before the Kurdish Parliament, and they had already written a \nconstitution that was the minimum they would, in fact, insist upon \nwhich allowed for significant Kurdish autonomy. They wanted a federal \nsystem.\n  A year ago January, my distinguished colleague from South Carolina \nand I went to Iraq for what was my sixth time. I have been there since. \nI don't know how many times it was. We went around and proudly put our \nfingers in the ink well, demonstrating that this was a free election. \nWe came back and spoke to the President. We were debriefed by the \nPresident and his war cabinet. The President said it was a great \ndemocratic effort. I presumed to suggest it wasn't a democratic effort, \nit was a free election. It was a sectarian election. It turns out 92 \npercent of the vote cast was a sectarian vote. Kurds voted for Kurds. \nShia voted for Shia. Sunni voted for Sunni. That is not democracy. \nElections do not a democracy make. They are a necessary and ultimate \ncondition to democracy. Democracy is about giving up things, about \ncompromise.\n\n  I will never forget what Senator Graham, who has a great facility for \nwords, said as I was trying to explain to the President about the \nmilitias--not that he did not know there were militias. After we got \nfinished, the President turned to Senator Graham and Senator Graham \nsaid, with a bit of humor: Mr. President, it is kind of like when the \nrecount was taking place in Florida, if the Republicans had their own \narmy and the Democrats had their own army. That is the better analogy.\n  The genie was out of the bottle, and the genie came roaring out of \nthe bottle when that shrine in the Shia area was devastated and ripped \noff the Earth.\n  Let me conclude by saying, it comes down to a simple proposition: Why \ndo we want our troops in Iraq? Is it to fight a civil war or is it to \nprovide a circumstance whereby we do the only thing that can help our \ninterest, to prevent al-Qaida from occupying territory, to train the \nIraqi forces, and to protect our troops. To do that we need a lot fewer \ntroops.\n  Do we want to end this war responsibly? If we do, I respectfully \nsuggest we vote for this resolution. If you prefer the President's \nplan, which offers no end in sight, I respectfully suggest you should \nvote against it. But, ultimately, there are a lot of proposals put \nforward, including the President's, and you have to ask yourself the \nrhetorical question, I believe: After it is implemented, then what? \nThen what?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding on this side we \nhave 18 minutes. I am going to reserve 10 minutes for leadership time. \nThat leaves 8 minutes I yield to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nthe time for debate.\n  I thank my colleague from Delaware, whom I enjoyed listening to and \nwith whom I enjoyed serving on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I say at the outset, I have been endorsing and speaking often around \nthe country about this notion of a federated system in Iraq, of the \nneed for a three-state, one-country solution, with Baghdad as a federal \ncity, where we have a Sunni area, a Shia area, and a Kurdish region.\n  I have been in Irbil as well. In the middle of January, I was there. \nI agree with his analysis of history. When you look at these \nsituations, and you take a big military apparatus off the top of a \nplace such as the former Yugoslavia, or now in Iraq, and then you have \nthese old, ancient hatreds that sit there, how do you deal with them? \nThat is why I think this is a political solution that is right. I agree \nwith my colleague from Delaware about that.\n  I wish he had not left the floor yet so we could have some discussion \non that point because I think, though, that issue would then bode to \nvoting against this resolution because what we are going to need to \nhave is a period of time to get that political machination in place. We \nare going to need some time and space for Kurds, Sunnis, and Shias to \nbe able to talk together, to be able to talk in an environment where \nthere are not these mass car bombs and assaults and attacks taking \nplace on a sectarian basis--such as took place in Bosnia--so that you \ncan be able to allow the political system to work.\n  These are not mutually exclusive objectives of having a military \napparatus in operation and in place in Iraq while you are pushing \nforward a very sensible and probably the only political solution that \ncan take place, having an area for Sunnis, Shias, and a Kurdish \nregion--which already exists. I might add this is in the Iraqi \nConstitution now. This sort of sectarian division of areas is allowed \nin the Iraqi Constitution. They have even taken the first steps of \nimplementation. The Kurdish area is being operated by the Kurds. The \noil revenues, which are being equally--by the last agreement--divided \nup around the country, are the glue to hold this system together.\n  This can and should take place. I urge the administration to push \nthis, and even to bring these leaders together in-country or outside of \nthe country to push this form of political solution. But I would add on \ntop of that, that form of political solution would then say: Do not \nvote for this resolution that sets a timetable under which this must \nhappen because these are things that are going to take some period of \ntime. As my colleague from Delaware noted, we have been in Bosnia for \nthe last 15 years putting this in place and holding this in place.\n  That is the requirement of this, then, so the passions can calm down, \nthe sectarian passions can cool. You are going to need a force in place \nto see this political solution on through. That is the long-term \nobjective I think we need to look at, this form he is on track to, but \nthat would be in opposition to this resolution that sets a timetable.\n  I respect his discourse and I respect my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who may look at it differently, but I think we have to \nlook at recent history to tell us this is a logical way that would take \nplace.\n  Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces at the \npresent time--with pressure from Turkey, with pressure from the Gulf \nStates, with pressure--that is not constructive--from a couple of other \nneighbors, particularly Iran and Syria.\n  I think we need to recognize that political solution that is there, \nthe exterior forces, and push this political solution in the \nenvironment of a more stable military apparatus and military operation.\n  This resolution, it seems to me, is clearly not a call for victory. \nTherefore, it must be seen as a call for retreat. Even its supporters \ndo not contend it is a plan for victory. We need to win. They talk \nabout the problems we face, not the solutions we need. But yet there is \na middle road here, even, of engaging the Senator from Delaware, his \npolitical solution with this military rationale, the military needs \nthat are going to be there that is still in place in Bosnia and is \ngoing to be in place for some time in Iraq. We will need a military \npresence in Iraq for some time to come even to get to that political \nsolution.\n  We cannot predict how long that presence will be\n   necessary or exactly what type of presence will be required. At the \nDayton Accords, did we predict at that point in time it would be for a \nperiod of 5 years and no more? No. We said: We are going to help \nprovide the stability so the political solution can take place. We did \nnot put a set date: OK, in 1 year, we will have this few troops; and in \n2 years, we will not have any of these types of troops; and in 3 years \nwe will be out. We did not say that. We said: OK, here is a political \nsolution, and we are going to help stabilize this militarily for \nwhatever time necessary to be able to do that.\n\n  These solutions need to be brought together, not to be argued \nseparately. I am not calling for an open-ended commitment to Iraq. I am \nsuggesting that our commitment be driven by the mission. We must \ncomplete it. We must get this done. We can express opposition to the \nsurge, which I have certainly done. But after doing so, I think we \nshould oversee the implementation of it, not to try to undercut it, nor \nshould we attempt to interrupt a mission just getting underway.\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n  We are looking at this right now. I cannot vote for a plan that would \nbegin a withdrawal of U.S. troops before the surge forces are even \nfully deployed at this point in time. The 4th Brigade of the 1st \nInfantry Division, based at Fort Riley, KS, recently arrived in \nBaghdad. I do not think it would be wise for us to tell those soldiers \nthey should prepare to leave Iraq even before they get their gear \nunpacked.\n  Not only do I believe it is inappropriate for us to legislate a \ntimetable for withdrawal, I also believe it is bad policy for us to do \nthis in Iraq.\n  First, supporters claim the resolution continues the fight against \nthe terrorists by leaving a minimal force in place for counterterrorism \noperations. But apparently the terrorists are not getting that message. \nTwo days ago, one of the al-Qaida leaders in Iraq used a jihadist Web \nsite to discuss the very resolution we are now debating in the Senate. \nHe said:\n\n       The democratic majority in the American Congress announced \n     that the security plan must produce its fruits in the middle \n     of this summer or else they would expedite the departure of \n     the forces at the end of this year.\n\n  Can there be any clearer evidence that al-Qaida is ready to wait us \nout?\n  In fact, al-Qaida not only approves of a timetable for withdrawal, it \nis working feverishly to expedite our departure. In the last few weeks, \nal-Qaida bombings have stood out as obstacles to stemming the cycle of \nsectarian violence in and around Baghdad. Sunni leaders have become so \ntired of al-Qaida violence against their own communities that they are \nturning to U.S. forces for protection. A timetable for withdrawal \nserves al-Qaida's interests.\n  For many years now, several of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have rejected the idea that Iraq is a part--a central part--of \nthe war on terrorism. I believe the statement I just read and others by \nal-Qaida leaders, the recent al-Qaida-inspired violence, and the Sunnis \nrejection of that violence should end this discussion. Iraq is \nunquestionably a key front in the war on terror, and it is essential we \nprevail against the terrorists in Iraq. If my colleagues are serious \nabout fighting the war on terror, they should frustrate al-Qaida by \nvoting against--against--this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I urge for political purposes of \nstabilizing Iraq, as Senator Biden talked about, this resolution be \nrejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I understand we have 10 minutes. I wish \nto retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield myself 6 minutes from the \nleader's time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious agreement be modified to provide that if any of the \nresolutions receive 60 votes, the preamble be considered agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, America's troops deserve our Nation's \nfull support every step of the way--from when they enlist, to when they \ntrain, to when they deploy, to when they return home.\n  Tragically, this administration has failed our troops every step of \nthe way. Today, Democrats are saying enough is enough. We are going to \ngive our troops everything they need, and we are not going to be a \nrubberstamp for the President's war without end.\n  I am very proud today to offer the Murray resolution in support of \nour troops, and I am pleased our majority leader, Senator Reid, \nstrongly supports this resolution.\n  We have been fighting to finally have a debate in the Senate for \nmonths. Now we are having that debate, and today we have to do three \nthings: We need to adopt the Murray resolution that says we support our \ntroops every step of the way. We need to reject the Gregg resolution \nthat blindly follows the President. And I hope we pass the Reid \nresolution that sets a new direction in Iraq.\n  The Murray resolution I have offered affirms we will provide our \ntroops with everything they need to be safe and to complete their \nmissions. We will provide everything they need in terms of training, \nequipment, logistics, and funding, and we will provide everything they \nneed when they return home.\n  Now, some here have a different idea. The Gregg resolution will tie \nthe hands of Congress and would, importantly, leave all decisions to \nPresident Bush.\n  Well, we know how that has turned out. If Congress--we who are \nelected by our constituents at home--surrenders its voice, we could see \nour troops being stuck with more of the same--more Americans being \nstuck in the middle of a civil war and more veterans coming home \nwithout the care they need.\n  We do not need more of the same, in my opinion. We need a new \ndirection. The Murray resolution shows we can have a new direction in \nIraq, and we can give our troops all the support they need.\n  So shortly we will all have a choice: Either you can blindly follow \nthe President or you can say: We--here--are going to stand up to our \nown responsibility to support our troops, and we can also push for a \nnew direction in Iraq.\n  Now, the Gregg resolution says we have to support the President. The \nresolution I have offered says: We--here--have to support our troops.\n  The Gregg resolution would simply make Congress a rubberstamp for a \nfailed policy. The resolution I have offered says that Congress--us, \nthose of us elected here in the Senate--have a voice, and we have to \nuse that voice to help our troops.\n  I suggest to my colleagues if you are happy with the war in Iraq, go \nahead and vote for the Gregg resolution. It will keep us locked on the \nsame path.\n  If you are OK with returning troops waiting months in a crumbling \nmilitary hold unit--or waiting years for their benefits--then vote for \nthe Gregg resolution and keep us locked on the same path. But if you \nthink our troops do deserve our support and do deserve better, vote for \nthe Murray resolution. If you agree our troops deserve equipment to \nkeep them safe, vote for the Murray resolution. If you agree our troops \ndeserve the training that will help them succeed in their missions, \nvote for the Murray resolution. If you believe our troops deserve \nbetter when they come home, importantly, vote for the Murray \nresolution. If you believe Congress needs to use its voice and its \npower to give our country a direction in Iraq, vote for the Murray \nresolution.\n\n  Our troops deserve better than what they have been provided so far. \nThis President sent our troops into battle without the lifesaving armor \nand equipment they need. This President left our troops on the \nbattlefield without a plan, without a clear mission, and without being \nhonest about the costs--all costs--of the war. This President \nshortchanged health care and benefits for our returning servicemembers, \nleaving brave Americans, as we now know, to languish in squalor at \nWalter Reed and facilities across our country.\n  Haven't we had enough of that? Didn't Americans send us a clear \nmessage last fall that enough is enough? It is time, I believe, for a \nnew direction.\n  The resolution I have offered recognizes that Congress has a role to \nplay in supporting our troops. We have a voice also to push for a new \ndirection, and we are going to use our power we were elected to use to \nhelp the brave men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  I would say to all of my colleagues today, if you vote against the \nMurray resolution, you don't really support our troops. Don't vote \nagainst our military and don't vote to tie our own hands. Use this \nopportunity today to tell our troops: We are all here for them and \ntheir families; from the time they head off to battle through the rest \nof their lives, we are there for them. Most of all, I hope the Senate \nvotes to support the Reid resolution so we can change the direction in \nIraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to express my strong \nopposition to the Reid resolution, S.J. Res. 9.\n  This is a dangerous piece of legislation. It is constitutionally \ndubious, and it would authorize a scattered band of Senators to \nliterally tie the hands of the Commander in Chief at a moment of \ndecisive importance in the fight\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nagainst terrorism in Iraq. I would never doubt the patriotism of my \ncolleagues across the aisle, but I have become increasingly troubled \nover the last few weeks as this debate has taken shape.\n  When the President prepared a solution to the growing violence in \nBaghdad, he had good reason to expect the support of at least some of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle. The democratic whip, \nSenator Durbin, said in late December:\n\n       If we need initially some troops in Baghdad to quiet the \n     situation, to make it more peaceful so that our soldiers \n     start coming home, then I would accept it.\n\n  That is the assistant Democratic leader not years ago but 3 months \nago. Yet as details of the President's proposal to do so became clear, \nour friends on the other side circled the wagons, and Senator Durbin \ngot in line. Just 2 weeks--2 weeks--after saying he would support \nreinforcements as a way of stabilizing Iraq, the Senator from Illinois \nsaid:\n\n       The proposed surge in troops is a sad, ominous echo of \n     something we have lived through in this country.\n\n  Then later on that day he added:\n\n       I don't believe that a surge is the answer to our challenge \n     in Iraq.\n\n  That is 2 weeks after announcing that it might be a good idea. Would \nour friend from Illinois have felt the same way if one of his \nDemocratic colleagues had proposed the surge? Increasingly, the \ntroubling answer to this question appears to be yes. Indeed, it is \nincreasingly clear that the only principle guiding our colleagues on \nthe other side is this: If the President proposed it, we oppose it. \nThis is a bad principle in good times. It is an outrageous principle in \ntimes of war.\n  Two months after many Democrats said they would support a surge in \ntroops if it meant stabilizing Baghdad, and incredibly 1 month after \nsending General Petraeus on his mission to do so, Democrats are now \ncalling for the very thing they have consistently opposed: setting a \ntimetable for withdrawal. This is beyond silly. It is a chaotic \nembarrassment that threatens to shake the confidence of our commanders \nand of our troops, and to embolden an enemy that predicted and longed \nfor nothing less. Of course, at some point it is not enough to simply \nsay: If the President proposed it, we oppose it. The principle begs for \na counterproposal: What would the Democrats propose instead? We all saw \nthe answer: Seventeen different proposals, many of which contradicting \nthe last, and then finally this, a proposal everyone could get behind, \na proposal that sets a date certain for America's withdrawal from Iraq.\n  This resolution is a clear statement of retreat from the support that \nthe Senate recently gave to General Petraeus; as I have said, its \npassage would be absolutely fatal to our mission in Iraq.\n  Senator Clinton put it well. She said:\n\n       I don't believe it's smart to set a date for withdrawal. I \n     don't think you should ever--ever--telegraph your intentions \n     to the enemy so they can await you.\n\n  That was Senator Clinton. Well, ``ever'' is here, and our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle apparently now think it is a good idea to \ntelegraph our intentions to the enemy. Osama bin Laden and his \nfollowers have repeatedly said that the United States does not have the \nstomach for a long fight. Passage of this resolution will prove Osama \nbin Laden, regretfully, was right. This is the vote he has been waiting \nfor.\n  Setting a date certain for withdrawal will please a vocal group of \nDemocratic Presidential primary voters, but it would discourage many \nothers, including many Democrats, who agree that timetables are foolish \nand dangerous. More importantly, it would discourage our own troops--\nand this is the most important part about this--who wonder whether we \ntruly support their mission, and it will discourage our allies and the \nmillions of brave Iraqi men and women who have dared to stand with \nAmerica in this fight.\n  I will proudly vote against a resolution that sets a timetable that \nactually announces the date for our withdrawal from Iraq. I will do so \nfor the same reason that many prominent Democrats opposed it up until \nthe day President Bush announced his plan for securing Baghdad 2 months \nago.\n  Republicans have a message for our allies and for our troops, and it \nis this: We will continue to fight a timetable for withdrawal that has \nno connection to events or circumstances on the ground. We will give \nGeneral Petraeus's mission a chance to succeed. We are proud of the \nwork the general has done, and we stand with him until the job is done. \nWe will send this message today when we vote in favor of the Gregg \nresolution. This resolution pledges us to support the troops and their \nmission. The Republicans proposed a month ago that we be allowed a vote \non this resolution, but we were denied. We are being allowed that vote \ntoday, and just as proudly as we will vote against S.J. Res. 9, we will \nvote in favor of the Gregg resolution.\n  In one sense, this debate has been academic. Senators will have a \nchance to show their support for the mission in Iraq when we vote on \nthe supplemental appropriations bill later this month. That is the bill \nthat matters. That is the one that funds the operation in Iraq. But in \nanother sense, this debate was worthwhile because it exposed the \nprinciple that appears to guide the opposition: If the President \nproposed it, we will oppose it. This is no principle at all; it is pure \npolitics. It is unworthy in good times. It is shameful at a time of \nwar.\n  Meanwhile, the fighting in Iraq continues, and General Petraeus's \nmission is showing early signs of success. We are told that bomb deaths \nare down one-third in Baghdad since the new plan took effect last \nmonth. Execution-style slayings are down by nearly half. Traffic has \nreturned to the once empty Baghdad streets.\n  No one is foolish enough to say this will last. This is not a \nprediction, but it is a sign of hope, the kind of sign that everyone in \nthis country--Democrat and Republican--has been waiting for. We in this \nChamber have a choice: We can fan this flame or we can smother it. By \nvoting on a timetable for withdrawal, we are very decidedly doing the \nlatter. Republicans take the hopeful path today.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, whatever time I have left I will add to \nthat leader time.\n  Madam President, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of this \nprotracted war in Iraq, the Senate finally considers important \nlegislation to direct President Bush to change the course of this civil \nwar. S.J. Res. 9, which is a joint resolution to revise U.S. policy in \nIraq, is one I offered. The second vote will be on the Murray \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that no action be taken \nto undermine the safety of the Armed Forces. Finally, S. Con. Res. 20 \nis the Gregg resolution on funding for American troops in the field. I \nwill discuss at some length at a later time this afternoon the \ndifference between Murray and Gregg. Suffice it to say the Murray \nresolution takes care of the troops after battle in addition to while \nthey are in Iraq. It takes care of the situation so we don't have \nanother Walter Reed situation. The Gregg resolution does not cover the \ntroops after battle.\n  As it relates to S.J. Res. 9, Members will have to consider a choice: \nWill we continue to support President Bush's failed policy that has our \ntroops bogged down in the middle of a civil war while the enemy who \nattacked us on September 11 grows stronger or will we stand with the \nAmerican people in demanding a new direction for this war? This new \ndirection maximizes our chances for success in Iraq and in that part of \nthe world, a new direction that recognizes the current policy has \npushed our troops and their families to the breaking point, a new \ndirection which sends a signal to the President that this Congress will \nhold him accountable and no longer will we rubberstamp his failed \npolicies; a new direction that restores U.S. standing in the world and \nrefocuses our resources on our most imminent threats. My hope is we \nwill stand with the American people, because they are standing with \nthis resolution, S.J. Res. 9. We must have a new direction in Iraq.\n  Monday will be the beginning of the fifth year of this war, the fifth \nyear of\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nthis war our troops are now mired in, a war in this faraway country. \nFive years of war, of the President's approach to Iraq, and it is clear \nit is not working. The country is in a state of chaos. Iraq is in a \nstate of chaos. There literally is no stability. U.S. troops are \npolicing a civil war, a protracted civil war, not hunting and killing \nthe terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. Five years. Five years of war.\n  The mission has changed. Saddam is gone. There are no weapons of mass \ndestruction. The original mission no longer exists. Five years of war \nwith 3,200 dead Americans, 25,000 wounded Americans, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars spent, $4 billion a week, a couple of hundred \nmillion dollars a day and still no end in sight, according to this \nPresident. The American military, the finest in the world, cannot and \nshould not police an Iraqi civil war. General Petraeus's name has been \nthrown around here as if it is his war. It is not his war. It is \nPresident Bush's war. General Petraeus, the commander in Iraq today, \nrecently observed there is no military solution in Iraq. The war must \nbe ultimately won through diplomacy, politically, by forcing Iraq's \npolitical factions to resolve their differences.\n  The key to success in Iraq is not to escalate the conflict by adding \ntens of thousands of additional troops to march down the same road. \nSome of these troops have been down the same road as many as four and \nfive times. It is time to find a new way forward and a new way home \nthat gives our troops a strategy to complete the mission and, I repeat, \ncome home.\n  The Reid resolution will give our troops the best chance to succeed \nin Iraq and to succeed in the larger war on terror. It will direct the \nPresident to change course in Iraq by changing the mission in Iraq. \nThis resolution immediately transitions the mission to training, force \nprotection, targeting counterterrorist operations, and beginning the \nredeployment of our troops in the next 120 days.\n  Similar to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, the goal in my resolution \nis to remove all combat forces not associated with these missions by \nthe spring of 2008. My resolution also recognizes a comprehensive \nstrategy in Iraq. Phased redeployment shall be implemented as part of a \ncomprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that \nincludes Iraq's neighbors and the international community.\n  S. Res. 107, the Murray alternative to the Gregg resolution, strongly \nsupports our troops but also properly interprets the Constitution by \nstating that the President and the Congress have shared \nresponsibilities for decisions involving our Armed Forces.\n  Quoting from the resolution:\n\n       The President and the Congress should not take any action \n     that will endanger the Armed Forces of the United States, and \n     will provide necessary funds for the training, equipment, and \n     other support for troops in the field, as such actions will \n     ensure their safety and effectiveness in preparing for and \n     carrying out their assigned missions.\n\n  In addition, the Murray resolution makes it clear that the \nConstitution gives Congress the responsibility, in addition to the \nPresident, to take actions to help our troops and veterans. The Murray \nresolution says that our responsibility to our troops doesn't begin and \nend when they are deployed. Supporting the troops means giving them the \nproper training before they are deployed and ensuring they receive the \nproper medical and other support when they return home.\n  Madam President, I suggest that voting no on the Murray resolution is \nvoting to condone what has taken place at Walter Reed. The Murray \nresolution recognizes that the troops must be taken care of not only \nwhen they are in battle but when they get out of battle. If there were \never a picture of what is wrong, look at what happened at Walter Reed. \nThe Murray amendment underscores that.\n  The people voting against the Murray amendment will be voting against \nchanging what took place at Walter Reed.\n  The Department of Defense said yesterday in a report they issued--the \nPentagon issued--that there is a civil war going on in Iraq now, as we \nspeak. The Pentagon, in their report yesterday, said violence is up, \nnot down. Three soldiers a day are being killed. February was the month \nof more attacks than at any time during this 5-year war.\n  Al Maliki, when he met with the President face to face, said get the \nAmerican troops out of Baghdad. He is the leader of Iraq. General \nCasey, who was a commander at the time the President suggested the \nsurge, said the surge won't work. This is not General Petraeus's war, \nit is President Bush's war, and we must change course.\n  In our resolution, there is a 120-day redeployment, and there will be \nwork on counterterrorism, force protection, and training. Yes, they \nwill also do political and economic strategy, and certainly diplomacy. \nOur goal is the spring of 2008.\n  It is easy to talk about sending the troops into battle and \nsupporting the troops. I support the troops. I support the troops, but \nI don't think that we should spill another drop of American blood in \nIraq--not another drop of blood.\n  I spoke to the mother of LCpl Raul Bravo a week ago today. She is the \nmother of that 21-year-old boy who was killed in Iraq. It was his \nsecond tour of duty. She said that ``he is the only man in our \nfamily''--her and his three sisters. She said that he was an angel. Her \nson did his best to learn to speak the language of the Iraqis. She said \nhe said prayers with the Iraqis. His blood should not have been left in \nthat faraway place.\n  The war has gone on too long. We must change direction in Iraq. We \nhave given the President chance after chance. We hear that things are \ngetting better. His own Pentagon says it is a civil war. His own \nPentagon says it is getting worse. That is what these resolutions are \nabout today.\n  The Reid resolution says let's change direction in Iraq. The Murray \nresolution says support the troops at all times. The Gregg resolution \ntakes Congress out of the equation and doesn't do a thing for the \ntroops when they come home.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following these votes, \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider en bloc the \nfollowing nominations:\n  Calendar No. 36, John Preston Baily of West Virginia, to be a \ndistrict judge.\n  Calendar No. 37, Otis D. Wright, II, of California, to be a district \njudge.\n  Calendar No. 42, Thomas M. Hardiman, of Pennsylvania, to be a circuit \ncourt judge for the Third Circuit.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that there be 20 minutes for debate, \nequally divided, under the control of Senators Leahy and Specter or \ntheir designees on the three nominations; that when the time is used or \nyielded back, the Senate proceed to vote on the confirmation of each of \nthe nominations in the above order; that the motions to reconsider be \nlaid on the table, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nam certainly not going to object, is the majority leader expecting \nrollcall votes on all three of the judges?\n  Mr. REID. At the moment, yes, but that can change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of S.J. Res. 9.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on passage of the joint resolution.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on Senate Resolution 107, and the Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senate is about to vote on the \nMurray resolution. There should be no question that the Members of the \nSenate support our troops. We all do. In this resolution, we want to \nmake sure we go on record saying we support our troops from the time \nthey go to battle and are sent on their missions to the time they come \nhome.\n  We make very clear in the Murray resolution that this Senate will go \non record saying the support of our troops extends far beyond their \nmission in the field. It means when they come home and are sent to \nWalter Reed or one of our other medical facilities, we will support \nthem with what they need. It says we will support their families \nthroughout their lifetime, if that is what it takes, for their service \nto this country.\n  I hope this is passed on a strong, loud, bipartisan vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, ironically, I agree with the Senator \nfrom Washington, although I disagree with the characterization of this \nresolution.\n  First of all, the resolution does essentially the same thing the \nGregg resolution does. No. 1, the Gregg resolution uses the language \nthat ``Congress should not take any action that will endanger United \nStates military forces in the field.'' That is exactly the same \nlanguage that is in the Murray resolution: ``Congress should not take \nany action that will endanger the Armed Forces.''\n  The Gregg resolution talks about article II, section 2, of the \nConstitution, in terms of the President's constitutional powers, and \narticle I, section 8 of the power of Congress; and the Murray \nresolution does essentially the same thing, except it doesn't cite it. \nIt merely says Congress and the President should continue to exercise \ntheir constitutional responsibilities.\n  So I am going to vote for the Murray resolution and vote for the \nGregg resolution. I don't see any difference in them. I think we are \nsupporting the President, and this is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Res. 107\n\n       Whereas under the Constitution, the President and Congress \n     have shared responsibilities for decisions on the use of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, including their mission, \n     and for supporting the Armed Forces, especially during \n     wartime;\n       Whereas when the Armed Forces are deployed in harm's way, \n     the President, Congress, and the Nation should give them all \n     the support they need in order to maintain their safety and \n     accomplish their assigned or future missions, including the \n     training, equipment, logistics, and funding necessary to \n     ensure their safety and effectiveness, and such support is \n     the responsibility of both the Executive Branch and the \n     Legislative Branch of Government; and\n       Whereas thousands of members of the Armed Forces who have \n     fought bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan are not receiving the \n     kind of medical care and other support this Nation owes them \n     when they return home: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President and Congress should not take any action \n     that will endanger the Armed Forces of the United States, and \n     will provide necessary funds for training, equipment, and \n     other support for troops in the field, as such actions will \n     ensure their safety and effectiveness in preparing for and \n     carrying out their assigned missions;\n       (2) the President, Congress, and the Nation have an \n     obligation to ensure that those who have bravely served this \n     country in time of war receive the medical care and other \n     support they deserve; and\n       (3) the President and Congress should--\n       (A) continue to exercise their constitutional \n     responsibilities to ensure that the Armed Forces have \n     everything they need to perform their assigned or future \n     missions; and\n       (B) review, assess, and adjust United States policy and \n     funding as needed to ensure our troops have the best chance \n     for success in Iraq and elsewhere.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 20\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding there is a minute \non each side. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Gregg amendment has been changed since \nit was originally filed. It is still imperfect. I still think, at least \nfrom my observation, it is not good, especially in light of the fact \nthat the Murray amendment so clearly defines the necessity of taking \ncare of the troops when they come home. But there is no caucus position \non this issue. Senators on this side of the aisle should vote however \nthey feel comfortable. I personally am not going to vote for it because \nI don't feel comfortable. I believe the resolution leaves a lot to be \ndesired. It can be construed many different ways. It is wrong that we \ndo not take into consideration the injured troops when they come home. \nMy caucus can vote any way they feel appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am just wondering what the parliamentary situation is. \nDo I have a minute or was the minute on the other side just used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. That was a minute on the other side that was used or was \nthat leadership time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds was used.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think it is important Members understand what this \namendment says, so I am going to read it:\n\n       That it is the sense of Congress that Congress shall not \n     take any action that will endanger United States military \n     forces in the field, including the elimination or reduction \n     of funds for troops in the field, as such action with respect \n     to funding would undermine their safety or harm their \n     effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n\n  It is very simple. If you support the troops, you have to support \nthis amendment. In fact, if you supported the Murray amendment, you \nhave to support this amendment unless you changed your mind in the last \n30 seconds.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.

Con Res. 20\n\n       Whereas under Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of \n     the United States, the President is the ``commander in chief \n     of the Army and Navy of the United States'', and in such \n     capacity the President has the command of the Armed Forces, \n     including the authority to deploy troops and direct military \n     campaigns during wartime;\n       Whereas under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution of \n     the United States, Congress has the power of the purse \n     specifically as it relates to the Armed Forces, and in such \n     capacity Congress has the responsibility to fully and \n     adequately provide funding for United States military forces, \n     especially when they are at war and are defending the Nation; \n     and\n       Whereas when United States military forces are in harm's \n     way and are protecting our country, Congress and the Nation \n     should give them all the support they need in order to \n     maintain their safety and accomplish their assigned missions, \n     including the equipment, logistics, and funding necessary to \n     ensure their safety and effectiveness, and such support is \n     the responsibility of both the Executive Branch and the \n     Legislative Branch of Government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that Congress \n     should not take any action that will endanger United States \n     military forces in the field, including the elimination or \n     reduction of funds for troops in the field, as such action \n     with respect to funding would undermine their safety or harm \n     their effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3188-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3188-S3190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF JOHN PRESTON BAILEY TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                   NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF OTIS D.

Judge Hardiman was nominated during \n     the last Congress, and a hearing was held on November 14, \n     2006. The Senate, however, did not act on his nomination \n     prior to adjournment of the 109th Congress. President\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\n     Bush re-nominated Judge Hardiman on January 9, 2007 and his \n     nomination was reported out of Committee favorably on March \n     8, 2007.\n       Judge Hardiman has an impressive resume and strong \n     bipartisan support in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He \n     received his B.A. from the University of Notre Dame in 1987 \n     and his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1990. \n     He served on the Georgetown Law Journal as an Associate \n     Editor and as a Note and Comment Editor.\n       After law school, Judge Hardiman joined the Washington, DC, \n     office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom as an \n     associate in their litigation group. In 1992, Judge Hardiman \n     moved to Pittsburgh and joined the litigation group of \n     Cindrich & Titus, which later became Titus & McConomy. In \n     1996, he was elected partner. In 1999, Judge Hardiman joined \n     the law firm of Reed Smith, also in Pittsburgh, as a partner.\n       In 2003, Judge Hardiman was nominated to be a U.S. District \n     Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On October 22 \n     of that year, the Senate confirmed him to that position by \n     voice vote. Throughout his legal career, he has taken time to \n     give back to the people of Pennsylvania, most notably through \n     his active involvement in Big Brothers and Big Sisters of \n     Greater Pittsburgh, of which he is a past president.\n       The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge \n     Hardiman ``well qualified.'' The vacancy to which Judge \n     Hardiman is nominated has been designated a ``judicial \n     emergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the \n     Courts.\n       Lawyers and judges who know Judge Hardiman best believe he \n     is the right choice to succeed for Judge Richard L. Nygaard. \n     Timothy Lewis, a Pittsburgh native and former Third Circuit \n     judge, recently praised this nomination. Judge Lewis, who \n     considers himself pro-choice and a civil rights activist, \n     emphasized the consensus nature of this nomination: He said \n     ``[t]his is the perfect opportunity--gift wrapped, signed, \n     sealed and delivered--for both [parties] to work together.'' \n     He reiterated his belief that ``[t]here is absolutely no way \n     anyone is going to find a more moderate candidate who is \n     completely noncontroversial'' and that Judge Hardiman ``is \n     the quintessential perfect judicial nomination for the 3rd \n     Circuit.''\n       I urge all my colleagues to join me and Senator Casey in \n     supporting this fine nominee.\n\nStatement of Senator Arlen Specter on the Nomination of Otis D. Wright, \n  II to the United States District Court for the Central District of \n                               California\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition today to support the \n     nomination of Judge Otis D. Wright, II of California to be a \n     district court judge in the United States District Court for \n     the Central District of California.\n       Judge Wright was nominated to the District Court for the \n     Central District of California during the last Congress; \n     however, the Senate did not act on his nomination prior to \n     adjournment of the 109th Congress.\n       President Bush re-nominated Judge Wright on January 9, \n     2007. A hearing was held on his nomination on February 6 and \n     the Judiciary Committee favorably reported him to the floor \n     on March 1.\n       Judge Wright has dedicated much of his life to public \n     service. He is a veteran of the Marine Corps and served for \n     eleven years in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. \n     He also has considerable experience as a prosecutor.\n       Judge Wright received his B.S. from California State \n     University of Los Angeles in 1976 and his J.D. from \n     Southwestern School of Law in 1980.\n       Prior to receiving his B.S., he served as a sergeant in the \n     U.S. Marine Corps from 1963-1969. From 1969 to 1980, \n     including his time in law school, Judge Wright served as a \n     deputy sheriff in Los Angeles.\n       After law school, Judge Wright took a position as Deputy \n     Attorney General in the Criminal Appeals Section of the \n     California Department of Justice. During his three years in \n     the office, he handled approximately 200 appeals before the \n     Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court.\n       In 1983, Judge Wright joined the Los Angeles office of \n     Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman and Dicker LLP.\n       As a partner in the firm, he handled all aspects of \n     insurance law including, drafting of policies and reinsurance \n     treaties, providing coverage options, auditing insurance \n     company claims departments, defending insurance companies in \n     direct actions by insureds for bad-faith, and defending \n     insureds on a wide variety of matters.\n       On October 28, 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger \n     appointed Judge Wright to the California Superior Court for \n     the County of Los Angeles. Judge Wright is assigned to the \n     Substance Abuse Court where he handles driving under the \n     influence (DUI) arraignments, pre-trial, motions, and \n     sentencing. He also monitors three drug diversion programs \n     for felony drug possession offenders, including probation \n     violation sentencing hearings.\n       The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Judge \n     Wright ``qualified.''\n       The vacancy to which Judge Wright is nominated has been \n     designated a ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan \n     Administrative Office of the Courts. The people of California \n     will be grateful to see this vacancy filled so that litigants \n     do not suffer from unnecessary delays.\n       I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this fine \n     nominee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement of Senator Arlen Specter on the Nomination of John Preston \n Bailey to be a United States District Judge for the Northern District \n                            of West Virginia\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition today to support the \n     nomination of John Preston Bailey to the United States \n     District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia.\n       Mr. Bailey was nominated during the last Congress, but a \n     hearing was not held on his nomination in the Judiciary \n     Committee prior to the adjournment of the 109th Congress.\n       President Bush re-nominated Mr. Bailey in the 110th \n     Congress on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on the \n     nomination on February 6, 2007 and it was unanimously \n     reported out of the Judiciary Committee on March 1, 2007.\n       Mr. Bailey is a highly regarded attorney in his home state \n     of West Virginia where his qualifications are well known. He \n     received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College \n     in 1973 and received his Juris Doctorate degree from the West \n     Virginia University College of Law in 1976.\n       Upon graduating from law school, he clerked for two years \n     in the chambers of Judge Charles H. Haden, II, on the U.S. \n     District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.\n       Following his clerkship, Mr. Bailey returned home to \n     Wheeling, West Virginia, to join the law firm Bailey, Riley, \n     Buch & Harman, where he remains today.\n       Mr. Bailey has had an impressive career as a general \n     practitioner. He has handled a diverse civil caseload ranging \n     from personal injury and mass toxic tort defense to complex \n     construction litigation and bankruptcy matters.\n       In addition to his civil docket, he has served as the Ohio \n     and Marshal County Assistant Prosecutor. In that capacity he \n     has handled the full spectrum of criminal matters.\n       The American Bar Association has rated unanimously Mr. \n     Bailey ``Qualified.''\n       The vacancy to which Mr. Bailey is nominated has been \n     designated a ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan \n     Administrative Office of the Courts, underscoring how \n     pressing it is that we act to fill the vacancy.\n       I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this fine \n     nominee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania said we are \nconsidering the nomination of Thomas Hardiman to a seat on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit that has been designated a \njudicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  In 2003, the Senate confirmed Judge Hardiman to the District Court \nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania at the age of 37. Four years \nlater, and now 41 years old, Judge Hardiman is before the Senate for \nconfirmation to lifetime tenure on the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit. Out of deference to the home state Senators, \nSenator Specter and Senator Casey, I support this nomination.\n  I only wish President Clinton's nominees, many of whom had a long \nrecord of accomplishment, had received the treatment we are according \nthis nominee. Instead, highly qualified nominees, such as Elena Kagan, \nnow Dean of the Harvard Law School, and Allen Snyder, who served as a \nclerk to Justice Rehnquist and was an experienced and respected \nlitigator, were left without consideration for years. No questions were \nraised about their qualifications, as there have been for so many of \nPresident Bush's nominations. The fact is that during President \nClinton's last two years, Senate Republicans refused to consider more \nthan half of his appellate court nominees. They were just blocked, \npocket filibustered with impunity.\n  Last Congress, we wasted enormous time and energy with controversial \nnominees. Now, a Democratic Congress has taken a better path and the \nhigh road.\n  Judge Hardiman has been nominated to a seat on the Third Circuit \nafter serving as a Federal district court judge for four years. Before \narriving on the bench, Judge Hardiman was a lawyer in private practice, \nwhere he worked for 13 years. In 1990, Judge Hardiman began his legal \ncareer as an Associate at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher \n& Flom in Washington, DC. From 1992 to 2003, he engaged in the private \npractice of law in Pittsburgh, PA, first as a partner at the law firm \nof Titus & Cindrich--now Titus & McConomy, LLP--and later as a partner \nat Reed Smith, where he specialized in real estate, contracts, \nsecurities, and constitutional law.\n  Judge Hardiman graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1987, \nand received his law degree from my alma mater the Georgetown \nUniversity Law\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\nCenter, in 1990, where he served on the Georgetown Law Journal as a \nNotes and Comments Editor.\n  I thank both home State Senators for their support of this nominee. I \nknow Senator Specter, who has been a strong advocate for Judge Hardiman \non the Committee, will welcome his confirmation. I also thank Senator \nCasey for his support, and for considering and approving this nominee \nso quickly after taking office.\n  With this confirmation, the Senate continues to make significant \nprogress in this Congress on nominations for lifetime appointments to \nthe Federal bench. We continue to put the lie to the alarmist rhetoric \nof some on the other side of the aisle by proceeding promptly and \nefficiently.\n  This session of Congress, the Senate has already confirmed 10 \njudicial nominations, including the nomination of Norman Randy Smith to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And now the Senate stands \npoised to confirm a Second Circuit court nomination and will likely \nhave confirmed 13 judges by the end of the day.\n  The treatment of President Bush's judicial nominees in a Democratic \nCongress stands in stark contrast to the fate of many of President \nClinton's nominees, who were blocked and delayed by the Republican \nmajority. In the 1996 session, a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed \nonly 17 of President Clinton's nominees--this year, we have already \nreported 15 nominees out of committee in just 3 months. In 1996, not a \nsingle judge was confirmed to the circuit courts--not one. This \nnomination is already the second confirmed this year. In all, more than \n60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were defeated in Senate \ncommittees through pocket filibusters and practices that Republicans \nthen abandoned as soon as there was a Republican in the White House.\n  Regrettably, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 50 \njudicial vacancies, yet the President has sent us only 20 nominations \nfor these vacancies. Thirty of these vacancies-more than half-have no \nnominee. Of the 22 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be \njudicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 16 \nof them. That means more than two-thirds of the judicial emergency \nvacancies are without a nominee.\n  I would rather see us work together in the selection of nominees so \nthat we can confirm judges rather than spend time fighting about them.\n  I congratulate Judge Hardiman, and his family, on his confirmation \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3190-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3190-S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NOMINATIONS OF JOHN PRESTON BAILEY AND OTIS D. WRIGHT\n\n  Mr. President, now the Senate will consider and, I believe, confirm \nthe nominations of John Preston Bailey for the Northern District of \nWest Virginia and Otis D. Wright II for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n  With these two confirmations, both to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies, the Senate will have confirmed 13 lifetime appointments to \nthe Federal bench so far this year. There were only 17 in the entire \n1996 session. I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides \nof the aisle on our committee and in the Senate to move quickly to \nconsider and confirm these judicial nominations so that we can fill \nvacancies and improve the administration of justice in our Nation's \nFederal courts.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 remaining \njudicial vacancies, yet the President sent us only 18 nominations for \nthese vacancies. Thirty of these vacancies--more than half--have no \nnominee. Of the 20 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be \njudicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 16 \nof them. That means four-fifths of the judicial emergency vacancies are \nwithout a nominee.\n  Each of the nominations before us today has the support of their home \nState Senators. And I thank Senators Byrd, Rockefeller, Feinstein, and \nBoxer for their support of these nominations.\n  John Preston Bailey has been nominated to the Northern District of \nWest Virginia, a seat deemed to be a judicial emergency by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Mr. Bailey is a graduate of \nDartmouth College, and he obtained his law degree from West Virginia \nUniversity where he graduated with honors as a member of the Order of \nthe Coif and the West Virginia Law Review. After law school, Mr. Bailey \nserved as a law clerk to Judge Charles H. Haden II, a U.S. District \nJudge of the Northern and Southern Districts of West Virginia.\n  In his legal career, Mr. Bailey has worked as an assistant \nprosecuting attorney for Ohio County, WV, and special assistant \nprosecuting attorney for Marshall County, WV. He currently is a partner \nat the Wheeling, WV, law firm of Bailey, Riley, Buch and Harman, L.C., \nwhere he has worked since 1978.\n  Judge Otis D. Wright II has been nominated to the Central District of \nCalifornia, another seat designated a judicial emergency. Judge Wright \nis a judge on the Superior Court of California, a court with one of the \nlargest caseloads in the country. Before coming to the bench, Judge \nWright worked for 22 years as a civil litigator at the Los Angeles law \nfirm of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman and Dicker LLP, and 3 years \nas a deputy attorney general for the California Department of Justice. \nHe graduated from California State University and received his law \ndegree from Southwestern School of Law.\n  Judge Wright's story has been a march toward the American dream. As \nan African American born in Tuskegee, AL, Judge Wright rose above the \ntravails and barriers posed by a Jim Crow segregated society to serve \nhis country as a U.S. marine, a deputy sheriff in the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff's Department, a State government attorney, a partner at \na Los Angeles law firm, and a judge on the State bench. Today this \ngreat American story includes confirmation to a lifetime appointment on \nthe Federal bench.\n  I am pleased one of the two nominations before us is an African \nAmerican. I have urged, and will continue to urge, the President to \nnominate men and women to the Federal bench who reflect the diversity \nof America. Racial diversity remains a pillar of strength for our \ncountry and one of our greatest natural resources. Diversity on the \nbench helps ensure that the words ``equal justice under law,'' \ninscribed in Vermont marble over the entrance to the Supreme Court, are \na reality and that justice is rendered fairly and impartially. Judicial \ndecisions should reflect insight and experiences as varied as America's \ncitizenry. A more representative judiciary helps cultivate public \nconfidence in the judiciary which strengthens the independence of our \nFederal courts.\n  A more representative judiciary also strengthens the fabric of our \ndemocracy. As we were reminded earlier this year, while honoring the \nlife of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the promise of our democracy lies \nin building a nation more inclusive of all Americans.\n  The nomination before us today represents an important step toward \nachieving that promise. I am pleased that, if confirmed, Judge Wright \nwould become the 90th African-American judge currently on the Federal \nbench.\n  But there is still much work to be done. In 6 years, President Bush \nhas nominated only 18 African-American judges to the Federal bench, \ncompared to 53 African-American judges appointed by President Clinton \nin his first 6 years in office. He has yet to appoint an African-\nAmerican judge from Mississippi even though that State has the highest \npercentage of African-American residents of any State.\n  Our Nation has highly qualified individuals of diverse heritages who \nwould help to unify our Nation while adding to the diversity of our \ncourts. I hope the President will send us more consensus nominees that \nreflect the rich diversity of our Nation.\n  I congratulate the nominees, and their families, on their \nconfirmations today.\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF OTIS D. WRIGHT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support Judge \nOtis Wright, a distinguished nominee to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California.\n  Judge Wright is nominated to a seat that has been designated as a \njudicial emergency. The Central District of California, based in Los \nAngeles, is the largest and busiest Federal judicial district in the \nNation.\n  When this Congress began, there were five vacancies on this court \nmore than twice as many as in any other judicial district in the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\n  I am pleased that the Senate has already confirmed two new judges for \nthe Central District this year, and I thank Chairman Leahy for moving \nthe California judicial nominees quickly.\n  Judge Wright is a graduate of California State University at Los \nAngeles and of the Southwestern School of Law.\n  After graduating from law school, Judge Wright was a deputy attorney \ngeneral in the California Department of Justice for 3 years. During \nthat time he specialized in criminal appeals.\n  He went on to join the law firm of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman \n& Dicker, where he became a partner during a career that spanned more \nthan 20 years. He practiced civil litigation in many areas, with a \nparticular focus on insurance coverage litigation.\n  While in private practice, Judge Wright was a volunteer attorney with \nthe HIV AIDS Legal Services Alliance. His work on behalf of those with \nHIV and AIDS included housing and employment discrimination cases, as \nwell as preparing wills for the terminally ill.\n  Judge Wright's public service has not been limited to his legal \ncareer: he was a deputy sheriff in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's \nDepartment while attending college and law school, and before that he \nserved in the U.S. Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Reserves.\n  He is one of only 16 African Americans who have been nominated to be \nfederal judges in the 6 years that President Bush has been in office. \nDuring the first 6 years of the Clinton presidency, by contrast, 53 \nAfrican Americans were nominated. Judge Wright will be a welcome \naddition to the bench.\n  In California we have developed a bipartisan process known as the \nParsky Commission for selecting Federal district court nominees. Under \nthis system, a committee of lawyers, including Democrats and \nRepublicans, recommends qualified applicants to the President.\n  I am proud of this system and pleased to say that Judge Wright was \nrecommended by the Parsky Commission. This gives me confidence that he \ncomes to the bench without an ideological agenda and prepared to serve \nall the people of California.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Judge Wright's nomination.\n\n\n                   nomination of john preston bailey\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support of an \nesteemed colleague, a fine West Virginia lawyer named Mr. John Preston \nBailey. Mr. Bailey hails from the beautiful city of Wheeling, WV. John \nBailey has been nominated by the President for a seat on the Federal \nbench in the Northern District of West Virginia.\n  Mr. Bailey is a splendid choice for this judgeship. He is senior \npartner at the firm of Bailey, Riley, Buch and Harman. Not only is Mr. \nBailey well-versed in administrative law, he is also a successful \nlitigator, competent in both civil and criminal litigation.\n  John Bailey graduated from West Virginia University's College of Law \nin 1976, where he was a member of the West Virginia Law Review. He was \nadmitted to the State Bar of West Virginia that same year and clerked \nfor 2 years thereafter with the Honorable Charles H. Haden II, who, at \nthat time, was the U.S. district judge for both the Northern and \nSouthern Districts of West Virginia.\n  Mr. Bailey is extremely well qualified to be confirmed as a Federal \njudge. He worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in the mid-1980s, \nand he served as chairman of the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board in \nWest Virginia from 1985 to 1991. He sat on the executive council of the \nWest Virginia Bar Association for 6 years and was elected to be \npresident of that association in 1992. He was thereafter elected and \nserved as president of the West Virginia State Bar from 2003 to 2004. \nBefore that, he served as vice president of the state bar and as a \nmember of the bar's Board of Governors.\n  More recently--in fact, just last year--he was also bestowed the \nhonor of ``Fellow'' by the West Virginia Bar Foundation. In bestowing \nthat honor upon Mr. Bailey, Tom Tinder, the executive director of the \nWest Virginia Bar Foundation, stated that Mr. Bailey is a ``true \nleader'' of his community. John Preston Bailey has been a member of the \nOrder of the Coif, the Order of the Barristers, a member of the Moot \nCourt Board, the Ohio County Bar Association, the West Virginia Trial \nLawyer Association, and a member of the National Association of \nCriminal Defense Attorneys.\n  I can attest to the fact that Mr. Bailey comes highly recommended by \nWest Virginians of varying legal viewpoints. He is a smart, independent \nthinker. He is hard working. He has had over 30 years of experience as \na licensed attorney. As a result, he recognizes the solemn \nresponsibility with which a Federal judge is charged. He must \ninterpret--impartially,  and with proper contemplation of, and respect \nfor, the three, separate branches of our Government--provisions that \nhave been approved by the Congress and signed into law the President.\n\n  Mr. Bailey has an excellent reputation and a keen intellect. Based on \nmy understanding of Mr. Bailey's character and impressive credentials, \nI believe that he will make a fine Federal judge. For all of the \nreasons that I have mentioned, I am pleased to urge my colleagues to \nsupport his nomination to be a U.S. district court judge for the \nNorthern District of West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nmoving expeditiously to move the confirmation for John Preston Bailey \nto be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nWest Virginia. I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy and Ranking \nMember Specter for reporting this nomination to the full Senate, and I \ncommend Mr. Bailey to my colleagues as exactly the type of nominee we \nshould all support for seats on the Federal bench.\n  John Bailey did something somewhat unusual after he earned his degree \nfrom Dartmouth College. He came back. He defied a longstanding trend of \nour best and brightest young men and women leaving to seek their \nfortunes and not returning. He went on to earn his law degree from the \nSchool of Law at West Virginia University and then served as a law \nclerk for the Honorable Charles Haden II. Judge Haden was a Republican \nand a Ford appointee but was also a good friend to this Senator. He was \na fair and decent man widely respected for his intellect and his \ndiligent efforts to arrive at the correct outcome. I can only hope that \nJohn Bailey chooses to emulate his former mentor, Judge Haden. Knowing \nwhat I know of John Bailey, he will, and West Virginians will benefit.\n  Lawyers in West Virginia have a great deal of respect for John \nBailey. He has served the West Virginia legal community as president of \nthe West Virginia State Bar and the West Virginia Bar Association and \nwas a member of the Board of Governors of the West Virginia Trial \nLawyers Association. Some West Virginia lawyers and judges I have known \nfor many decades believe John Bailey will be a very capable judge \nbecause he is a great lawyer. He takes the facts as he finds them and \ndoes not come to the table with preconceived notions as to what the \noutcome should be. Those traits, along with a first-rate intellect and \nsolid educational and work credentials, make up the formula for the \nkind of judicial nominee we all hope to see come to the Senate from \nPresidents of both parties.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays \non the Hardiman nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, substance abuse continues to claim \nvictims, destroy families, and eat away at communities. Today, many \ncommunities in Illinois and across the country are struggling with the \nmethamphetamine epidemic. Drug treatment centers in Illinois report an \nexplosion in the number of people entering treatment for meth \naddiction. Public drug treatment providers have seen a 73 percent \nincrease in meth treatment admissions in the last decade. Meth is \nhaving a particularly dire effect on families, tearing them apart and \noverwhelming our child welfare network. In 2004, more than half of the \nchildren entering foster care in some areas of rural southeastern \nIllinois were forced into the program because their caretakers were \nmeth abusers. Meth use among adult women has very real and tragic \nimplications for child safety, foster care, and family breakups.\n  It is the stories of these mothers that paint the real picture of the \ndisease of addiction. Last week, I met an amazing woman and mother \nwhose story clearly represents the need for family-based treatment \nservices. Imani has been in recovery from drug addiction for over 5 \nyears. Before that, she was in and out of treatment programs, making \nsix consecutive attempts to break the addiction. She fought to find a \ntreatment program that would meet her needs as a mother of three young \nchildren. While she was using and bouncing between failed attempts, she \nbecame pregnant with a fourth child. With four children and dwindling \nhope, she made one more stab at sobriety.\n  Imani found an addiction and treatment center that offered a family-\nbased approach to treatment services. Five years later, Imani is sober, \nliving happily with her children, including her fourth child who is now \na healthy young boy and is currently on his school's honor roll. Today, \nshe advocates on behalf of other recovering mothers and the importance \nof family-based treatment services.\n  As we identify new methods to combat the disease of addiction, we \nmust consider the specific needs of families. When mothers seek out \ntreatment to heal from their addiction, they face a difficult battle. \nThe world of substance abuse treatment is not designed with the needs \nof families in mind, and though the general programs may be successful \nfor single men and women, families struggling with substance abuse \nissues find few opportunities to find treatment and recovery.\n  Family-based treatment centers combine substance abuse recovery with \nmental health counseling, medical treatment, parenting, education, and \nlegal services. These programs provide essential assistance to the \nentire family, rather than just the parent, and have proven to be \nextremely effective. Studies consistently show that family-based \ntreatment increases long-term sobriety, educational enrollment, and \ngainful employment, along with decreased criminal activity and child \ndevelopment delays. Addressing the meth crisis through a comprehensive \nfamily-treatment approach provides a cost-effective alternative to \nincarceration and foster care and yields consistently positive outcomes \nin child well-being, family stability, and lower recidivism rates. A \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, \nevaluation of family-based treatment programs in 2003 revealed that 60 \npercent of the mothers remained sober 6 months after discharge.\n\n  Family-based treatment acknowledges the important connection between \na mother and her child. Many\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nwomen cannot successfully go through substance abuse and mental health \ncounseling if their children are excluded. More importantly, no woman \nshould ever be forced to make that choice.\n  This is why I am proud that yesterday, Senator Coleman and I joined \nto introduce the Family-Based Meth Treatment Access Act of 2007. This \nbill will expand, intensify, and coordinate efforts to provide \ncomprehensive, family-based substance abuse treatment for \nmethamphetamine addiction. Our bill will provide additional funding for \nthe Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to award grants to programs \nthat provide comprehensive, family-based substance abuse treatment for \npregnant and parenting women. Throughout our entire Nation, there are \nonly about 80 known family-based treatment centers. Two, the Women's \nTreatment Center and the program at Haymarket Center are in the State \nof Illinois. These grants will strengthen the work of these centers and \nprovide opportunities for other centers to extend their services to \nadditional mothers and their children.\n  The Family-Based Meth Treatment Access Act also gives priority to \nprograms serving rural and mental health professional shortage areas \naffected by high rates of meth addiction. The State of Illinois knows \nfar too well the impact that the meth epidemic has had on our \ncommunities, especially those in rural areas. We need to strengthen \nservices where the epidemic has made the biggest impact on the health \nof women and their children and where family-based treatment services \nare not readily available.\n  Finally, the bill provides assistance to organizations that help \nnonviolent offenders overcome their drug addiction. Many organizations \nprovide comprehensive, family-based substance abuse treatment services \nto nonviolent offenders as an alternative to incarceration. These \nservices are a successful model for the road to recovery and give \nfamilies hope for the future. They are cost-effective and they yield \nconsistently positive outcomes.\n  Family-based treatment services are a proven method for recovery for \nwomen with children, and we should make these programs available \neverywhere. Imani is just one example of the success of family-based \ntreatment. I invite my colleagues in the Senate to support the Family-\nBased Meth Treatment Access Act and to make this successful reality \npossible for other recovering mothers and their children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3193-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3193-S3194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMERCE PROVISIONS IN S. 4\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins \nfor working with the Commerce Committee to include important security \nmeasure in the bill that passed the Senate yesterday. And, I thank my \nlongtime friend Senator Inouye for his willingness to work in committee \nand on the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis to develop and pass these \nmeasures.\n  We have made tremendous strides to secure our Nation since the \nhorrific attacks of September 11, particularly with respect to the \nsecurity of our Nation's transportation systems, and ensuring \ninteroperable communications needed most during times of crisis.\n  As the debate over this bill demonstrates, our job is far from over, \nfor there are still more improvements to be made and gaps to close. In \nmatters of security, we must not become complacent; as our enemies \nadapt, so must we.\n  The Commerce Committee's aviation and surface transportation \nlegislation, which have been included in S. 4 will significantly \nenhance the ability of the Department of Homeland Security DHS, and the \nTransportation Security Administration TSA, to fulfill their missions. \nThese provisions were developed by the Commerce Committee while Mindful \nof the delicate balance between implementing tough security measures \nand the effect such regulations may have on the Nation's economy and \nthe movement of goods.\n\n  The aviation provisions incorporated into S. 4 were reported by the \nCommerce Committee on February 13 as S. 509, the Aviation Security \nImprovement Act of 2007. The provisions incorporate aviation-related 9/\n11 Commission recommendations, and provide TSA with additional tools to \ncarry out its layered approach to security.\n  To do this, the aviation security provisions dedicate continued \nfunding for the installation of in-line explosive detection systems \nutilized for the enhanced screening of checked baggage at our Nation's \nairports.\n  We all recognize the importance of screening 100 percent of cargo \ntransported to and within the United States. Last Year, in the Safe \nPort Act, Congress acted to ensure that all cargo arriving in the U.S. \nby sea be screened. In S. 4, we ensure that 100 percent of air cargo \nalso is screened. The U.S. air cargo supply chain handles over 50,000 \ntons of cargo each day, of which 26 percent, is designated for domestic \npassenger carriers.\n\n  Screening is particularly important in Alaska. Anchorage is the No. 1 \nairport in the U.S. for landed weight of cargo, and it is No. 3 in the \nworld for cargo throughput. Our provision requires TSA to develop and \nimplement a system to provide for the screening of all cargo being \ncarried on passenger aircraft.\n  To address on-going concerns about passenger prescreening procedures, \nthe legislation requires DHS to create an office of appeals and redress \nto establish a timely and fair process for airline passengers who \nbelieve they have been misidentified against the no-fly or selectee \nwatchlists.\n  TSA's layered approach to security relies not only upon equipment and \ntechnological advances, but also upon improved security screening \ntechniques employed by the TSA screeners, as well as the use of very \neffective canines. This legislation calls for TSA's national explosives \ndetection canine team to deploy more of these valuable resources across \nthe Nation's transportation network.\n  Mr. President, the bill passed by the Senate today also contains the \nprovisions of S. 184, the Surface Transportation and Rail Security Act \nof 2007, which also was developed and reported on a bipartisan basis by \nthe Commerce Committee.\n  While the aviation industry has received most of the attention and \nfunding for security, the rail and transit attacks in Britain, Spain, \nand India all point to a common strategy utilized by terrorists. The \nopenness of our surface transportation network presents unique security \nchallenges. The vastness of these systems requires targeted allocation \nof our resources based on risk.\n  Most of the surface transportation security provisions in the bill \nbefore the Senate today have been included previously as part of other \ntransportation security bills introduced by Senator Inouye, Senator \nMcCain, and myself. Many of the provisions in the substitute amendment \npassed the Senate unanimously last Congress, as well as in the 108th \nCongress. Each time, however, the House of Representatives has not \nfound the need to address rail, pipeline, motor carrier, hazardous \nmaterials, and over-the-road bus security. The time has come to get \nthese provisions to the President's desk.\n  The substitute also contains the provisions of the Commerce \nCommittee-reported measure, S. 385, the Interoperable Emergency \nCommunications Act. Since 2001, we have heard the cries of public \nsafety officials that the police, firefighters and emergency medical \nresponse personnel throughout the country need help achieving \ninteroperability.\n  With this $1 billion program that helps every State, public safety \nwill be able to move forward with real solutions and begin addressing \nthe problems that have plagued our Nation's first responders for too \nlong.\n  The legislation addresses the public safety issues that have been \nbrought to the Commerce Committee's attention. It also creates a $100 \nmillion fund to establish both Federal and State strategic technology \nreserves that will restore communications quickly in disasters equal in \nscale to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Added as amendments to the bill were a number of additional Commerce \nCommittee items, for which I thank the managers of the bill, as well as \nChairman Inouye for their support.\n  Included among those provisions was a measure that represents an \nimportant step forward for public safety because it approved the 9-1-1 \nmodernization Act, which was reported last month by the Commerce \nCommittee. I\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\noffered this measure with Senators Clinton, Inouye Hutchison, Snowe, \nSmith, and Vitter.\n  The amendment provides advanced borrowing authority so that $43.5 \nmillion can be made available for 9-1-1 upgrades which are desperately \nneeded throughout the country--especially in rural America. Congress \npreviously allocated these funds in the digital television transition \nlegislation, but without the borrowing authority language, public \nsafety would have to wait until after the digital transition auction \nbefore they could receive these important funds.\n  Also added was an amendment sponsored by Chairman Inouye that I \ncosponsored that establishes a national registered armed law \nenforcement program for law enforcement officers who need to be armed \nwhile traveling by air. This law enforcement provision builds upon \nmandates in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.\n  An additional amendment was sponored by Chairman Inouye with my \ncosponsorship that enhances the canine provisions in the underlying \nbill by expanding the national explosives detection canine team \ntraining program. Beyond increasing the training capacity at the \ncurrent facility at Lackland Air Force Base as provided in the \nunderlying bill, the amendment adopted would require DHS to explore \noptions of creating a standardized TSA-approved canine program that \nprivate sector entities could utilize to meet the ongoing need for \ncanines.\n  We must not politicize national security. The Commerce Committee \ninitiatives included in the pending bill were achieved only because of \nbipartisanship. I am pleased that the development and passage of the \nbill was conducted by the bill managers in that same spirit. And while \nsome provisions contained within the bill need to be further \ndeveloped--as many of our colleagues have highlighted over the past few \nweeks--I voted in favor of the bill as I support the preponderance of \nits contents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3194-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL AWARD FOR PASSING MOST LOCAL SMOKEFREE LAWS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the great State of \nIllinois for receiving the National Award for Passing Most Local \nSmokefree Laws in 2006. This honor was awarded to Illinois by the \nnational organization Americans for Nonsmokers Rights.\n  Last year, a recordbreaking 36 Illinois cities and counties enacted \nsmokefree laws, more than any other State in the Nation. In doing so, \nIllinois has taken a firm stance against the devastating consequences \nthat smoking has on our communities.\n  The 2006 Surgeon General's report, ``The Health Consequences of \nInvoluntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke,'' concluded that smoking rooms \nand ventilation systems cannot protect people from secondhand smoke. \nThe report reaffirmed previous health findings that secondhand smoke \ncauses heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems, and even death.\n  I am honored to acknowledge the tireless efforts of public health \nadvocates and State legislators who helped make it possible. Before \n2005, Illinois communities were preempted from passing local laws. Now, \nthe local community has the right to deal with this important issue and \nhelp improve the health of millions of Illinoisans. The following \ncommunities have enacted smokefree laws in the State: Arlington \nHeights, Barrington, Bedford Park, Bloomington, Buffalo Grove, Burr \nRidge, Champaign, Chicago, Cook County, Deerfield, DeKalb, Elk Grove \nVillage, Evanston, Hawthorn Woods, Highland Park, Hinsdale, Hoffman \nEstates, Lake Forest, Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Lindenhurst, Long \nGrove, McLean County, Mt. Prospect, Normal, Northbrook, Oak Forest, Oak \nPark, Orland Park, Palatine, Park Ridge, Rolling Meadows, Sangamon \nCounty, Schaumburg, Skokie, Springfield, Tinley Park, Urbana, Vernon \nHills, Wheaton, and Wilmette.\n  Again, I extend my deepest congratulations to the citizens of \nIllinois, who now can breathe a little easier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3194-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3194-S3195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \nthe need to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self \nDetermination Act of 2000.\n  This act expired September 30, 2006, and now over 700 counties and \n4,400 school districts in 39 States are in financial limbo.\n  In simple terms, this means that 8 million kids in rural America are \ngoing to be impacted by Congress's inaction.\n  This is simply unacceptable.\n  I have been joined by several of my colleagues in introducing, S. \n779, a simple one year reauthorization. This measure would provide some \ncertainty to the impacted counties and schools while Congress works to \naddress the larger issue of a multiyear reauthorization.\n  It is clear to me that the safety net payments need to continue, but \nin a manner that encourages and focuses on building collaboration--one \nof the cornerstones of this act.\n  For my colleagues who are unfamiliar with this issue, let me quickly \nreview how the Congress got to this point.\n  In 1992, Congress provided some counties in the Pacific Northwest \nwith a temporary financial ``safety net'' to help them transition from \nthe timber boom years of the 1980s.\n  The safety net was scheduled to gradually phase out over a 10-year \nperiod, but demands for a more inclusive program resulted in its early \ntermination and the enactment of another temporary program, the Secure \nRural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.\n  This act was designed to allow counties an opportunity to transition \nback to the traditional revenue sharing programs.\n  The temporary safety net was originally recommended to Congress by \nthe National Forest County Schools Coalition.\n  One of the Coalition's principles States that special payments to \nStates under this legislation will provide a short-term safety net with \na specific termination date.\n  The county payments program dramatically broadened the geographical \nand substantive scope of the original safety net payment.\n  The large majority of the funds still were focused on the Pacific \nNorthwest, but the new national program permitted most States and \ncounties across the country to participate and benefit from it thus, \nproviding a measure of financial certainty to all counties that rely on \nrevenues from Federal forest lands.\n  The act has been an enormous success, not just achieving but \nsurpassing the goals of Congress.\n  This act has restored programs for students in rural areas and \nprevented the closure of numerous isolated schools. It has been a \nprimary funding mechanism to provide rural school students with \neducational opportunities comparable to those enjoyed by suburban and \nurban students.\n  Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts to address the \nsevere maintenance backlog. Snow removal has been restored for \ncitizens, tourists, and school buses. Bridges have been upgraded and \nreplaced, and culverts that are hazardous to fish passage have been \nupgraded and replaced.\n  In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs, have been \nformed.\n  Nationally, these 15-person diverse RAC stakeholder committees have \nstudied and approved more than 2,500 projects on Federal forestlands \nand adjacent public and private lands.\n  These projects have addressed a wide variety of improvements \ndrastically needed on our public lands. Projects have included fuels \nreduction, habitat improvement, watershed restoration, road maintenance \nand rehabilitation, reforestation, campground and trail improvement, \nand noxious weed eradication.\n  RACs are a new and powerful partnership between county governments \nand the land management agencies.\n  They are rapidly building the capacity for collaborative public land \nmanagement decision making in over 150 of our largest forest counties \nin America and are reducing the gridlock over public land management, \ncommunity by community.\n  In the future, I feel the RACs will be providing the leadership to \nbuild consensus for projects that will keep our\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nforests healthy and as a result generate revenue for future projects, \ncounties, and schools.\n  The achievements of this act over the last few years are positive and \nsubstantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit \nthe forest counties, their schools, and continue to contribute to \nimproving the health of our public lands.\n  If we do not work to reauthorize this act, all of the progress of the \nlast 6 years will be lost.\n  Schools in timber dependant communities will lose a substantial part \nof their funding. These school districts will have to start making \ntough budget decisions such as keeping or canceling after school \nprograms, sports programs, music programs, and trying to determine what \nis the basic educational needs of our children.\n  Next, counties will have to reprioritize road maintenance so that \nonly the essential services of the county are met because that is all \nthey will be able to afford.\n  Congress needs to act now in order to ensure a future for rural \nschools and counties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3195-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the events of the last few days in Zimbabwe \nare outrageous and warrant universal condemnation. It is time for the \ngovernment of Robert Mugabe to cease its repressive and divisive \nactions and to allow Zimbabweans to pursue their hopes for legitimate \npolitical change and opportunity.\n  Since Sunday, the world has watched with horror and outrage as the \nMugabe government has cracked down on legitimate opposition, detained \n50 Zimbabweans attending a peaceful prayer meeting outside of Harare, \nand brutalized opposition leaders and ordinary citizens alike.\n  A protestor was shot and killed. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the \nMovement for Democratic Change, has been badly beaten and suffered \nsevere head injuries. Lovemore Madhuku, the leader of the National \nConstitutional Assembly, reportedly has a broken arm and numerous other \nwounds. Many of their colleagues in opposition remain in Harare \nhospitals.\n  The Government has responded to the outrage prompted by these attacks \non human rights and legitimate expression with characteristic bluster. \nOnce again, we are told that the opposition is to blame. Once again, we \nhear ominous warnings that the opposition is ``set to pay a very heavy \nprice, regardless of who they are.'' Meanwhile, the true cause of the \nstrife--President Mugabe's disastrous rule--remains unaddressed. To the \ndismay even of his own party, he has declared his intention to run for \na new term in office in 2008.\n  These events are shocking, but sadly they do not come as a surprise. \nFor years, it has been increasingly apparent that the Mugabe government \nis interested only in its own survival and enrichment, not the welfare \nof the people of Zimbabwe. International observers--including the \nUnited States--concluded that the Presidential election of 2002 and the \nparliamentary elections of 2005 were not free and fair.\n  The State Department reported just last week in its country report on \nhuman rights in Zimbabwe that: ``The government engaged in the \npervasive and systematic abuse of human rights. The ruling party's \ndominant control and manipulation of the political process through \nintimidation and corruption effectively negated the right of citizens \nto change their government.''\n  Meanwhile, the Government's corruption and mismanagement has brought \nthe Zimbabwean economy to the brink of ruin. Estimates place inflation \nat a world high of 1,700 percent, and the IMF forecasts that this could \npass 4,000 percent by the end of the year. Unemployment stands at 80 \npercent. Poverty rates are soaring. Zimbabwe's economy is shrinking \nfaster than any other country in the world that is not at war.\n  I am heartened, though, that this political and economic \ndeterioration has been met with growing calls for change.\n  Within Zimbabwe, the opposition to Mugabe is showing resilience and \ncourage. Factions of Mugabe's own party have indicated that they want a \ntransition in 2008, and ordinary citizens are increasingly voicing \ntheir hopes for a new chapter.\n  Beyond Zimbabwe, frustration with the Mugabe government is mounting. \nThe head of the African Union has expressed his embarrassment at the \nsituation in Zimbabwe. South Africa and the Southern African \nDevelopment Community, which have been slow to criticize Zimbabwe in \nthe past, seem to be losing patience. The United States, European \nUnion, and the United Nations were swift in condemning this latest \noutrage and have been consistent in their calls for change.\n  The United States must continue to stand strongly against the Mugabe \ngovernment's abuses of power in Zimbabwe. We must join with our \nEuropean allies, the United Nations, and--most importantly--the \ncountries and institutions of the region to press for positive change \nin Zimbabwe. That means a peaceful democratic transition in 2008 and \nsupport for economic growth and opportunity--including the lifting of \nsanctions--once the dark cloud of Mugabe's rule is lifted and \nZimbabweans are able again to reach for the new horizon they deserve.\n  I call on President Mugabe to immediately release all political \ndetainees and repeal the ban on political rallies, to end the use of \nviolence and torture in the jails, permit a free media and abide by the \nrule of law. His government must also urgently address the humanitarian \ncrisis that has put the mass of his population in dire need of \nassistance.\n  Zimbabwe is a nation rich in history and rich in resources. Its \ntalented people have known great hardship just as they have achieved \ngreat heights. When Robert Mugabe became President over a quarter \ncentury ago, there was great hope. Zimbabwe had emerged from British \nrule, claiming its freedom and its future for itself.\n  Sadly, the freedom and opportunity for which Zimbabweans fought have \nbeen eclipsed in the last decade by repression and uncertainty. Instead \nof peaceful self-determination, we see Zimbabweans intimidated and \nbeaten in the streets. Instead of the responsible management of \nZimbabwe's state institutions, we see state-sanctioned corruption, \nviolence, and property seizures. Instead of economic self-sufficiency, \nwe see what was once one of Africa's most promising economies in a \nfree-fall.\n  Yet I am confident that the people of Zimbabwe will once again claim \nfor themselves a better future. As they seek to hold their leaders \naccountable, as they try to rebuild their lives and their country, they \nmust know that they have a strong and steady friend in the United \nStates. The events of the last few days--and the Mugabe regime--must \nbelong to the past, and the United States must work with the \ninternational community to help all Zimbabweans forge a better future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3195-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3195-S3196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING MAUI ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, INC.\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

STEPHEN JOEL TRACHTENBERG\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to an \nexceptional man who is retiring in July, after 19 years of impeccable \nservice to the George Washington University, GW.\n  Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, 68, became the 15th president of GW on \nAugust 1, 1988. A native of Brooklyn, NY, President Trachtenberg earned \na bachelor of arts degree from Columbia University in 1959, the juris \ndoctor from Yale University in 1962, and the master of public \nadministration degree from Harvard University in 1966. In 1968, he was \nselected as a Winston Churchill Traveling Fellow for study in Oxford, \nEngland.\n  He came to GW from the University of Hartford, Connecticut, where he \nhad been president for 11 years. Before assuming the presidency of \nHartford, President Trachtenberg served for 8 years at Boston \nUniversity as vice president for academic services and academic dean of \nthe college of liberal arts. Earlier, in Washington, DC, he was a \nspecial assistant for 2 years to the U.S. Education Commissioner, \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare. He has been an attorney \nwith the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a legislative aide to former \nIndiana Congressman John Brademas.\n  Just a few of the highlights in his career include the following: \nPresident Trachtenberg was named one of the top 100 leaders in the \nAmerican Academy in a 1978 Change magazine poll. He received a 1987 \nHuman Relations Award from the National Conference of Christians and \nJews. In 1988, the Connecticut Bar Association honored him with its \nDistinguished Public Service Award, and he was recognized by the \nHartford NAACP for his contributions to the education of minority \nstudents. In 1992, he received the Hannah G. Solomon Award from the \nNational Council of Jewish Women. In 1993, the Washington, DC, Urban \nLeague named him ``Father of the Year.'' And in 1992 and 2007, he \nreceived the Martin Luther King, Jr. Awards.\n  President Trachtenberg has served the GW community as a drum major \nfor change and has lead by example a commitment to public, civic, and \npersonal service. Throughout the years, he has worked tirelessly in \nhonoring and enhancing the symbiotic relationship between the \nUniversity and the District of Columbia, supporting and mentoring \nstudents, and leading and advocating for reinvention, change, and civic \nengagement. He has worked successfully for almost two decades to propel \nGW further into the first ranks of world-class institutions of higher \nlearning.\n  As a result of President Trachtenberg's efforts, the number of \napplications for undergraduate admission more than tripled, from 6,000 \nin 1988 to almost 20,000 in 2006, while the university's acceptance \nrate of these applicants was reduced by two-thirds. President \nTrachtenberg made financial aid for students a priority so that today \nthe university offers nearly nine times, $113 million, as much \nfinancial aid to incoming students as was offered in 1988.\n  It can confidently be said that the university's faculty now \ncomprises experts on topics ranging from administrative law to zoology \nand contribute to scholarly journals, law reviews, and media outlets on \na regular basis. The university's sponsored research enterprise has \nquadrupled from $33 million in expenditures in 1988 to $132 million in \nexpenditures in 2006. Through President Trachtenberg's efforts, GW has \nsignificantly upgraded its information technology and library system \nwhich now contains more than 2,000,000 volumes and is a member of the \nprestigious Association of Research Libraries.\n  Under President Trachtenberg's unprecedented leadership, the \nuniversity robustly developed academic, residential, and recreational \nfacilities on campus--including the opening of the Media and Public \nAffairs Building and the establishment within of the Luther W. Brady \nArt Gallery in 2001, the Annette and Theodore Lerner Health and \nWellness Center in 2001, GW Hospital in 2002, 1957 E Street, the new \nhome of GW's Elliott School of International Affairs and Geography \nDepartment in 2002, and Ric and Dawn Duques Hall, the new home of GW's \nBusiness School in 2006--in a way that served the institution's \nscholarly and other programmatic needs while respecting the interests \nof its Foggy Bottom neighbors.\n  President Trachtenberg's commitment to the enhancement of academic \nand other space on campus supported the renovation and expansion of the \nlaw school complex, begun in 2000 and completed in 2006, the renovation \nof Morton and Norma Lee Funger Hall, dedicated in February 2006, and \nimprovements of the Cloyd Heck Marvin Center including the addition of \nthe Marc C. Abrahms Great Hall, dedicated in December 2002, and the \nrenovation of J Street dining facilities, opened August 2004.\n  President Trachtenberg also spearheaded a campus beautification \neffort that transformed a series of city streets into a cohesive and \nvibrant urban campus with the addition of the Mid-Campus Quad, Kogan \nPlaza, pocket parks, and outdoor sculptures.\n  President Trachtenberg presides over the District of Columbia's \nlargest private employer. And to support all the foregoing, President \nTrachtenberg oversaw two decades of balanced budgets, and the increase \nin the university endowment from $200 million in 1988 to more than $1 \nbillion in 2007.\n  In 1989, President Trachtenberg created the 21st Century DC Scholars \nProgram, now the Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Scholars, which has granted \nalmost 100 full scholarships, representing over $13 million, to \nstudents from the DC Public Schools to attend GW. Under Trachtenberg's \nleadership, GW's Multicultural Student Services Center was named and \nhas become a strong center for cultural awareness and celebrations, \nstudent development, and diversity training. Additionally, the Office \nof Community Service was created in 1992 and has become a focal point \nfor civic engagement for the Washington DC community. His dedication to \ncivic service is reflected throughout the university, which was named a \n``college with a conscience'' in 2005 by Princeton Review, and most \nrecently in the top 10 schools sending students to the Peace Corps.\n  His passion and demonstrated commitment to DC--the city, the schools, \nthe business community and its residents--are unparalleled and have \nbeen recognized on several occasions by the District of Columbia Mayor, \nCity Council and Chamber of Commerce. President Trachtenberg has \nreceived numerous accolades from across the Nation and abroad for his \nservice, vision, intellect, wit, and compassion. Thanks to President \nTrachtenberg, GW went from being one of the best kept secrets in town \nto being one of the best known and most admired global \nuniversities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3196-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3196-S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING GILAD JANKLOWICZ\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I wish today to share with my \ncolleagues the winners of the 2006-2007 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/\nFarm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for eighth grade students in my home State. The purpose of this \ncontest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft \nan essay responding to the assigned theme. I, along with my friends at \nthe Indiana Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau Insurance Companies, am pleased \nwith the annual response to this contest and the quality of the essays \nreceived over the years.\n  I congratulate Courtney Larson, of Bartholomew County, and Chad \nVanLiew, of Jackson County, as winners of this year's contest. I ask \nthat the complete text of their respective essays be printed in the \nRecord. Likewise, I would like to include the names of all of the \ndistrict and county winners of the 2006-2007 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm \nBureau/Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.\n  The material follows.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Feeding Our Bodies, Fueling the Future\n\n                          (By Courtney Larson)\n\n       Throughout the world there are many farmers working in \n     their fields to provide people in America and other countries \n     with food and alternate forms of fuel. Students in Indiana \n     would like to thank the farmers in Indiana and other states \n     for the sacrifices that they make in order to provide these \n     goods for us. Without this supply of food and fuel, America \n     would be different from what it is today.\n       Farmers in the United States feed over three-hundred \n     million people in the United States every year, along with \n     millions of people in other countries. The major crops that \n     are grown in Indiana consist of beans, corn, and wheat. \n     Besides converting the crops into food, they can also be used \n     to make alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n       Alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel can be used \n     to power farmer's equipment along with cars and trucks. These \n     fuels reduce emissions and make the United States less \n     dependant on foreign oil. One of the popular alternative \n     fuels produced in Indiana is soy diesel. This type of fuel is \n     a little more expensive than regular diesel, but it is a \n     cleaner product and it is more expensive because the amount \n     of soybeans that can be converted into fuel is limited. This \n     is not the only alternative fuel farmers have come up with, \n     but is one of the cleanest and will help keep us from \n     destroying the earth by reducing pollution.\n       Overall, Indiana farmers will play a role in the future of \n     America whether it's feeding them or providing a source of \n     fuel. With all the crops farmers are now producing, America \n     will not go hungry in the near future and will have a cleaner \n     environment by using alternative fuels.\n\n                 Feeding Our Bodies, Fueling the Future\n\n                           (By Chad VanLiew)\n\n       For hundreds of years Indiana farmers have been feeding the \n     minds and bodies of Americans. Additionally, Indiana farmers \n     are now being called upon for another equally important \n     purpose--fueling the future. Indiana farmers are now being \n     asked to play a huge part in the push to help the United \n     States gain energy independence from foreign countries.\n       Just as American automakers are producing more fuel \n     efficient vehicles, Americans need to switch to more \n     environmentally friendly fuels, like biodiesel and ethanol, \n     to run these resourceful automobiles. Indiana farmers can \n     serve as a primary source of corn and soybeans, which will be \n     used to produce these renewable fuels.\n       These two emerging fuel sources will increase the market \n     for corn and soybeans, enabling Indiana farmers to see higher \n     profits. This will in turn allow farmers to re-invest in new \n     techniques for increased production of these important \n     Indiana crops. Increased crop production will lead to an \n     improvement in the Indiana economy due to the increasing \n     demands for food and energy production by the American \n     people. Indiana farmers are in this unique position because \n     they can provide the products needed both to feed our \n     citizens and fuel our means of transportation.\n       Because biodiesel is the cleanest alternative fuel \n     available, the United States needs to switch. Indiana is \n     fourth in the nation in soybean production. Indiana farmers \n     will play a major role in the production of renewable \n     biodiesel and ethanol. America needs to switch to home grown \n     fuel, so we can become energy independent. Indiana farmers \n     will then be not only feeding our bodies, but fueling our \n     future.\n\n                    2006-2007 District Essay Winners\n\n\n                               District

A bill to amend section 1091 of title 18, United States Code, \nto allow the prosecution of genocide in appropriate circumstances; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genocide Accountability Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GENOCIDE.\n\n       Section 1091 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Required Circumstance for Offenses.--The circumstance \n     referred to in subsections (a) and (c) is that--\n       ``(1) the offense is committed in whole or in part within \n     the United States;\n       ``(2) the alleged offender is a national of the United \n     States (as that term is defined in section 101 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101));\n       ``(3) the alleged offender is an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence in the United States (as that term is \n     defined in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101));\n       ``(4) the alleged offender is a stateless person whose \n     habitual residence is in the United States; or\n       ``(5) after the conduct required for the offense occurs, \n     the alleged offender is brought into, or found in, the United \n     States, even if that conduct occurred outside the United \n     States.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today as the lead Republican \nsponsor of the Genocide Accountability Act of 2007. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, for introducing this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Senator Durbin serves as the chairman and I serve as the ranking \nmember of the new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. We held our first hearing, entitled \n``Genocide and the Rule of Law,'' on February 5, 2007. There could not \nbe a more appropriate way to begin examining the law as it relates to \nhuman rights than to determine what we can and must do to prevent and \nstop genocide. The United States is a signatory of the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This convention \nprovides that the contracting parties must ``undertake to prevent and \nto punish'' the crime of genocide. We have also passed a law \nimplementing the Genocide Convention.\n  However, our hearing demonstrated that there are changes that need to \nbe made in law and foreign policy to respond to the ongoing genocide in \nSudan and to any genocide that may occur elsewhere in the future. \nFortunately, two of these changes can be accomplished right now.\n  The first change can be accomplished through a bill Senators Durbin \nand Cornyn introduced last week, of which I am a cosponsor. That bill, \nthe Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007, will allow State and \nlocal governments to prohibit the investment of State assets in the \nGovernment of Sudan or companies with certain business relationships \nwith Sudan, while the Government of Sudan is subject to sanctions under \nU.S. law. The second change can be accomplished through the bill we are \nintroducing today, the Genocide Accountability Act of 2007. This act \nwill ensure that our justice system has the authority to prosecute \nsomeone who has committed genocide if that person is found or brought \ninto the United States.\n  Under current law, the United States can deny admission to and \nexclude aliens from the United States on human rights grounds. The \nAttorney General can also consider avenues for the prosecution of \naliens who have committed certain crimes, including genocide. However, \nthe Attorney General can only prosecute a perpetrator of genocide if he \ncommitted his crimes within the United States or is a U.S. national.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n  What does this mean? It means that if a person who plans or \nparticipates in the genocide occurring right now in Darfur travels to \nthe United States on vacation, business, or even to live here for an \nextended period of time--as a refugee or student, for instance--a court \nin the United States cannot touch him. The best our justice system can \ndo is deport him once his crime is discovered.\n  Without question, it may be more appropriate in some cases to \nextradite someone who commits genocide to his home country or turn him \nover to an international tribunal. However, there are also times when a \nperson's home country may not be willing to prosecute him and there is \nno viable alternative for prosecution. In these cases, extraditing a \ncriminal would be no different than setting him free. This bill will \nnot force our justice system to prosecute those who commit genocide \njust because they are found on our soil--it simply gives us the option. \nNonetheless, in America we are blessed with great resources and the \nmost effective and just legal system in the world. With these blessings \ncomes great responsibility. It is contrary to our system of justice to \nallow perpetrators of genocide to go free without fear of prosecution.\n  It simply makes no sense to withhold from our justice system the \nauthority to prosecute someone who is found in the United States and \nwho committed a crime as atrocious as genocide just because he is not \nAmerican and did not commit the crime here. We have passed tough laws \nthat ensure that we can prosecute anyone found in the United States who \nhas committed terrorist acts or supports terrorism. We do not want to \nbecome a safe haven for terrorists, so I ask: Do we want to be a safe \nhaven for those who have committed genocide? The answer should be \nclear.\n  Fundamentally, we must decide if genocide is a bad enough crime, no \nmatter where it happens, that it warrants the same treatment as \nterrorism-related crimes. I deeply believe that it is, and that is why \nI am proud to cosponsor this bill today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. \n        Hagel):\n  S. 890. A bill to provide for certain administrative and support \nservices for the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission was \ncreated by the U.S. Congress in 1999 as a bipartisan commission for the \npurpose of considering and formulating plans for the location, design \nand construction of a permanent memorial to President Dwight D. \nEisenhower to perpetuate his memory and his contributions to the United \nStates. Since being fully appointed in 2001, the Commission considered \ntwenty-six different sites in the District of Columbia. In 2005, it \nselected a site between the Department of Education and the National \nAir and Space Museum, two institutions resulting from and greatly \ninfluenced by President Eisenhower's leadership.\n  In 2006, Congress approved the memorial's location within Area I, in \ncompliance with the Commemorative Works Act. The Commission secured \nfull approval for the selected site following extensive review by the \nNational Park Service, the National Capital Memorial Advisory \nCommission, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the \nCommission of Fine Arts. Since its inception, the Commission has also \ntaken great care to study and analyze President Eisenhower's legacy. It \nproduced a report by leading scholars and experts on President \nEisenhower that provides a definitive statement on the transcending \nelements of President Eisenhower's enduring legacy. He ranks as one of \nthe preeminent figures in the global history of the 20th century.\n  The Eisenhower Memorial Commission now needs to move into the design \nphase. As design begins, the Commission's organization, specifically \nwith regard to contracting and staffing, needs to be updated and \nrevised to enable efficient management and responsible stewardship. The \nproposed legislation which I introduce today provides for the necessary \nreorganization. I am joined by Senators Stevens, Roberts, and Hagel as \noriginal cosponsors of the bill.\n  The legislation enables the Commission to retain the services of \nfull, part-time, and volunteer staff as government employees, without \nthe restrictions of the competitive service requirements. It also \nprovides the authority for the Commission's Executive Architect to \nmanage technical and administrative aspects of design and construction. \nIt provides for staff to be released on the completion of the memorial \nand enables the Commission to work in collaboration with federal \nagencies.\n  President Eisenhower spent his entire life in public service. His \nextraordinary contributions include serving as Supreme Commander of the \nAllied Expeditionary Forces in World War II and as 34th President of \nthe United States, but President Eisenhower also served as the first \ncommander of NATO and as President of Columbia University. Dramatic \nchanges occurred in America during his lifetime, many of which he \nparticipated in and influenced through his extraordinary leadership as \nPresident.\n  Although President Eisenhower grew up before automobiles existed, he \ncreated the Interstate Highway System and took America into space. He \ncreated the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. He added the State of Hawaii and the State of Alaska to \nthe United States and ended the Korean War. President Eisenhower \ndesegregated the District of Columbia and sent Federal troops into \nLittle Rock, Arkansas, to enforce school integration. He defused \ninternational crises and inaugurated the national security policies \nthat guided the nation for the next three decades, leading to the \npeaceful end of the Cold War.\n  A career soldier, President Eisenhower championed peace, freedom, \njustice and security, and, as President, he stressed the \ninterdependence of those goals. He spent a lifetime fulfilling his duty \nto his country, always remembering to ask: What is best for America?\n  President Eisenhower once said, ``I know that the American people \nshare my belief that if a danger exists in the world, it is a danger \nshared by all; and equally, that if hope exists in the mind of one \nnation, that hope should be shared by all.'' President Eisenhower's \nlegacy provides hope to all of us--like him, through education and \npublic service, we, as a nation and individually, can rise to meet any \nchallenge. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect children and their parents from being \ncoerced into administering a controlled substance in order to attend \nschool, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, Tom \nCoburn, to proudly reintroduce the Child Medication Safety Act, a bill \nto protect children and their parents from being coerced into \nadministering a controlled substance or psychotropic drug in order to \nattend a school.\n  Parents today face many challenges when raising their children, one \nof which is ensuring that their children receive the best education \npossible. My views on education come from a somewhat unique perspective \nin that my wife, Kay, was a teacher at Edison High School in Tulsa for \nmany years and now both of our daughters are teachers. I can assure you \nthat I am one of the strongest supporters of quality education. \nHowever, it has come to my attention that schools have been acting as \nphysicians or psychologists by strongly suggesting that children with \nbehavioral problems be put immediately on some form of psychotropic \ndrugs. Schools and teachers are not equipped to make this diagnosis and \nshould not make it mandatory for the student to continue attending the \nschool. This is clearly beyond their area of expertise. Therefore, I am \nintroducing this legislation to ensure that parents are not required by \nschool personnel to medicate their children.\n  The Child Medication Safety Act requires, as a condition of receiving \nfunds from the Department of Education, that States develop and \nimplement polices and procedures prohibiting school personnel from \nrequiring a child to obtain a prescription as a condition of attending \nthe school. It should be noted that this bill does not prevent teachers \nor other school personnel from sharing with parents or guardians \nclassroom-based observations regarding a student's academic performance \nor regarding the need for evaluation for special education. \nAdditionally, this bill calls for a study by the Comptroller General of \nthe United States reviewing: (1) the variation among States in the \ndefinition of psychotropic medication as used in public education, (2) \nthe prescription rates of medication used in public schools to treat \nchildren with attention deficit disorder and other such disorders, 3) \nwhich medications listed under the Controlled Substances Act are being \nprescribed to such children, and 4) which medications not listed under \nthe Controlled Substances Act are being used to treat these children \nand their properties and effects. This GAO report is due no later than \none year after the enactment of this Act.\n  I believe this is an extremely important bill that protects the \nrights of our children against improper intrusion regarding health \nissues by those not qualified. If a parent or guardian believes their \nchild is in need of medication, then they have the right to make that \ndecision and consult with a licensed medical practitioner who is \nqualified to prescribe an appropriate drug. Please join us in support \nof this legislation that protects the freedoms of our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 892. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the indexing of certain assets for purposes of determining gain or \nloss; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Capital \nGains Inflation Relief Act of 2007. The taxation of inflation is one of \nthe most unjust practices of the tax code. This simple improvement will \nnot only enhance the basic fairness and efficiency of the tax code, but \nwill also immediately increase the net return on capital investment.\n  Under current law, a taxable capital gain occurs whenever a capital \nasset is sold at a price higher than the original purchase price. \nHowever, the timing of capital gains taxation sets it apart from other \ntypes of income. While wages are generally taxed on a yearly basis, the \ntaxation on capital assets occurs at the time the capital asset holder \nchooses to sell his asset and realize\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nhis gains. The gains on capital assets accrue over the course of the \nasset's life, which is usually many years. This is generally favorable \nto the capital asset holder, because he can defer taxation on his gains \nto a future year. This tax deferral is often cited as the primary \nreason for holding assets long term.\n  However, the value of tax deferral is often times overstated because \ncurrent tax policy taxes the capital asset holder not only on real \ngains, but also on gains due to inflation. This creates a situation \nthat is patently unfair to the American taxpayer. For example, an \nAmerican who purchased a share of stock for $10 in 1950 and sold it for \ntwice that amount today would be subject to capital gains taxes on the \nnominal gain of $10, though the transaction was a clear loss when one \naccounts for inflation. Why should an American taxpayer, who invested \nin a capital asset in his youth, be forced to pay capital gains taxes, \non what can only be viewed as a loss, in his later years? In spite of \nall our efforts to curb inflation, it will remain a fact of life. This \ndoes not mean we should tax hard-working Americans with long-term goals \non gains that are due to inflation, gains that they will never actually \nrealize.\n  Without an inflation index, the tax code incentivizes short-term \nspeculation and discourages long-term capital investment. The current \nturmoil in the subprime lending market is an example that demonstrates \nthe perils of emphasizing short-term speculation over long-term capital \ninvestment. Though inflation has remained relatively modest recently, \nthere is no guarantee of future stability. Inflation indexing would \ninstantly increase the net return on capital investment and \nconsequently encourage more of it. Inflation indexing would also \nrestore core principles of sound tax policy such as ``horizontal \nequity,'' wherein two taxpayers in identical situations are treated \nidentically by the tax system. Indexing capital gains would improve the \nbasic fairness of the tax code with only a minor increase in \nadministrative costs and a single step of simple multiplication for \ntaxpayer compliance.\n  The need for indexing is clear. It would help average Americans and \nimprove tax policy by enhancing both the basic fairness and the pro-\ngrowth incentive of the tax code. The merits of the capital gains tax \nare themselves debatable, but if we are to tax capital gains let us \nmake sure they are taxed fairly. Please join with me in supporting this \nlegislation to free the American taxpayer from the unfairness of the \ncurrent tax policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 895. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto ensure that every child in the United States has access to \naffordable, quality health insurance coverage, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I was proud to help create the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration. \nIt has provided health insurance for 6 million children, including more \nthan 425,000 in New York. SCHIP was the biggest expansion in providing \nhealth insurance coverage in more than 30 years--a big first step to \nproviding quality health care coverage for all children.\n  And now it is time to take the next step. Today, I am introducing new \nlegislation with my colleague from the House of Representatives, \nChairman Dingell: a plan to make quality affordable health care \navailable to every child in America.\n  The Children's Health First Act will make quality, affordable health \ncare available to all children, and will pave the way to cover the more \nthan nine million children in our country without health coverage.\n  Our bill cuts red tape to allow States to provide affordable \nhealthcare options for all families to cover their children. It gives \nStates the financial incentives and resources to expand--existing State \ncoverage and find and enroll the 6 million children who are currently \neligible for health coverage but are not enrolled. And it provides \nincentives to expand employer sponsored coverage for children.\n  As individuals and as a Nation, an ounce of prevention is truly worth \na pound of cure. Health care accessible and affordable for all children \nwill keep kids healthy, save lives, control costs, and end heartache \nand worry for so many parents. This plan is practical and fiscally \nresponsible--it will honor our values and prevent kids from needing \nmore costly healthcare in the future.\n  Our bill will provide incentives for States to expand SCHIP to more \nchildren and provide health coverage for children up to 400 percent of \npoverty, about $70,000 for a family of three.\n  Parents whose incomes are above their State's SCHIP eligibility \nlevels and employers who want to provide coverage to dependents will \nalso have the option to buy-in to the SCHIP program. This will ensure \nthat all families have access to affordable coverage and aren't forced \ninto the private insurance market where affordable options for their \nchildren are often out of reach.\n  And while expanding coverage is critical, enrolling children who are \nalready eligible must also be part of our efforts to ensure every child \nhas health insurance.\n  Currently, there are 6 million uninsured children who are eligible \nfor public programs but not enrolled. In order to receive expanded \nFederal funding under our bill, States must undertake strategies \ndesigned to enhance outreach and enrollment of currently eligible \nchildren.\n  In addition, the Children's Health First Act would prevent funding \nshortfalls like those that 14 States are currently facing. Unlike the \noriginal SCHIP bill our legislation would determine funding based on \nState spending and indexed to medical inflation and child population \ngrowth so that states will get the funds they need.\n  Every child deserves a healthy start in life. This goes to the heart \nof our values, our responsibility to one another, the promise of our \ncountry. Far too many children in our Nation--more than 9 million--do \nnot have health care. And, for the first time in nearly a decade, \nbetween 2004 and 2005, the number of uninsured children in New York \nincreased by 61,000--part of a trend nationally.\n  It's simply wrong that there are working parents who worry about \ntheir children playing sports because they can't afford a doctor if \ntheir child gets hurt. I've met parents who when their children get \nsick fret and worry about their children's illness--but have the added \nanxiety of wondering how they are going to pay for the doctor visit. \nThat just shouldn't happen.\n  No child in America, the greatest, richest Nation on Earth home to so \nmuch promise, should lack for the care he or she needs to grow up to be \na healthy, happy adult.\n  We can tackle this challenge--and provide access to quality, \naffordable health care for all children in America. It's the right \nthing to do, and it's the smart thing to do.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation. It will help us honor our \nvalues, protect our children. We can meet this challenge and that's \nwhat I'll be working with Chairman Dingell and my Senate colleagues to \nachieve this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. \n        Sanders):\n  S. 896. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Social \nSecurity Act to increase the number of primary care physicians and \nmedical residents serving health professional shortage areas, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise again this evening to speak \nabout a growing crisis in rural America. This crisis is found in rural \nNew England, throughout Appalachia, spans the Great Plains, crosses the \nWestern deserts, and reaches the mountains of the great Northwest. It \nimpacts the seniors, children, the women, and the men of rural America. \nWhat I am speaking about today is a lack of access to quality health \ncare.\n  In rural America, patients have long gone without care. Despite the \nfact that one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural America, only \n9 percent of the Nation's physicians are practicing in these areas. \nOver 50 million of these rural Americans live in areas that have a \nshortage of physicians to meet their basic needs.\n  Now, physician recruitment to rural America is a big problem. Part of \nthis problem comes about through high student debt, which often forces \nmany students away from a rural practice and\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\ninto urban specialty medicine where they can probably command higher \nsalaries.\n  I recently held a Senate HELP Committee field hearing in Alaska. This \nwas during the February recess. I held this field committee hearing on \nthe physician shortage crisis in rural America. At that hearing, I had \na young woman come up and speak. She is a medical student who is \ncurrently part of the WAMI Program, the Western States medical program. \nThis young woman, Melissa Howell, is 26 years old. She stated the \nstudent debt she has accumulated is a huge concern that hangs over the \ndecisions she makes as she decides where she is going to practice. \nSimply put, she said that the $100,000 student debt she faces is ``kind \nof scary.'' I have to admit, that is kind of scary.\n  A dozen States already report severe physician shortages. These \nshortages exist in the areas of cardiology, radiology, neurology, to \nname a few. But the greatest shortages persistently have been in \nprimary care. In fact, the shortage of primary care physicians in rural \nareas of the United States represents one of the most intractable \nhealth policy problems of the past century.\n  It will only worsen. In 20 years, 20 percent of the U.S. population \nwill be 65 or older, and this is a percentage larger than at any other \ntime in our Nation's history. Just as this aging population places the \nhighest demand on our health care system, we have some experts who \npredict a national shortage of close to 200,000 physicians. If that \nbecomes a reality, 84 million patients could be potentially left \nwithout a doctor's care.\n  So the question has to be asked, where are the doctors going? We are \nlosing some of our doctors through attrition. One-third of physicians \nare 55 years old and older and are likely to retire as this baby boom \ngeneration moves into its time of greatest medical need. Additionally, \nfor the last quarter of a century, medical schools have kept their \nstudent enrollments virtually flat.\n  We are also losing a lot of our doctors, quite simply, through \nfrustration. Low Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, coupled \nwith complex regulations and paperwork, leave physicians aggravated, \nleave them disappointed with the practice of medicine.\n  In Alaska, we have lived with provider shortages since statehood. I \ngrew up in a part of the State down in the southeastern area where you \ndid not have doctors who were available to deliver babies except on \nTuesdays and Thursdays. You hoped you could give birth on a Tuesday or \na Thursday. Still, in many parts of our State, we do not have providers \nwho can deliver. If you are out in the Aleutian chain, you are told by \nyour physician's attendant to come to Anchorage, some 600 miles away, \nto wait out the remaining month of your pregnancy because they do not \nhave the facilities, do not have the doctors available to take care of \nyou in the event of an emergency.\n  So we have lived with provider shortages for a long time. Because our \nState is larger than Texas and California and Montana combined, \n``rural'' brings on a new meaning and the physician shortage crisis is \neven more amplified, as I have given in my two examples. But we have \nhad some recent events in the State that have created a situation far \nworse than Alaska has known in the past. Currently, in the State, we \nhave the sixth lowest ratio of physicians to population in the United \nStates. That is when you take into account Anchorage, which is our \nlargest population center. In rural Alaska, it is the worst physician-\nto-population situation in the Nation. Alaska needs nearly 400 more \ndoctors to provide the same level of care as elsewhere in the country.\n  One of our problems is we do not have a medical school, and we are \nnot likely to be getting a medical school in the near future. We also \nhave the lowest per capita number of medical school slots in the \ncountry and the lowest number of residency slots. We have two small but \nvery successful programs; this is the University of Washington Medical \nSchool Partnership and the Alaska Family Residency Program. These two \nprograms help train Alaskans as physicians and also help us bring \ndoctors to Alaska. But despite the success of these programs, each is \nfar too small to meet our population's needs.\n  Each week, without fail, I receive faxes, phone calls, letters, and \ne-mails from Alaskan seniors who simply cannot find a doctor to treat \nthem. I wish to read a few excerpts from recent e-mails we have \nreceived. The first one is from a gentleman in Anchorage. Keep in mind, \nAnchorage is our largest population center; about half the population \nof the State is here.\n\n  He writes:\n\n       My mother . . . has had difficulty in the extreme in \n     getting a doctor who will take her on as she is a medicare \n     patient . . . doctors are telling potential patients that \n     they are no longer taking medicaid. My mother has made in \n     excess of 100 calls to physicians in Anchorage.\n\n  Another constituent writes--and this is also from Anchorage:\n\n       During the past year, I've tried to find a doctor that \n     accepts Medicare. I used the Anchorage Yellow pages and \n     called over 100 doctors, only to be told that they won't \n     accept any more Medicare patients.\n\n  She then writes to say:\n\n       I'll tell you ahead of time, we'll be going to the hospital \n     emergency rooms, to receive, even the basic medical care, \n     i.e.: colds, flu, and other basic medical care, that could \n     have been treated through seeing a doctor, at their \n     established practice. This doesn't sound like good fiscal \n     management.\n\n  Another constituent--and this was actually in a letter to the editor \nin the Anchorage Daily News--says:\n\n       My friends telephoned more than 80 doctors recently, and \n     not one was accepting new Medicare patients.\n\n  A third gentleman from Kenai, AK, writes:\n\n       My mom has Medicare and she had to wait 5 months to be seen \n     by a Neurologist because she had been put on a waiting list \n     to be seen due to the fact she was a Medicare patient.\n\n  Another woman from Anchorage says:\n\n       I just got through trying to find a physician for an \n     elderly Medicare-dependent friend. At this time I have found \n     no one who will take her. Most physicians take no Medicare \n     patients or have a quota which is full. The Providence health \n     care provider list has no one who takes Medicare.\n\n  The last e-mail was from Anchorage stating:\n\n       Almost no family practice office in Anchorage is accepting \n     new Medicare patients.\n\n  This is just a sample of what we get from constituents around the \nState of Alaska saying: I don't have anyone who can see my mother. I \ncan't get in to see anyone myself.\n  I mentioned in my comments this is a crisis that is growing. In \nAlaska, we don't often think of it as being a State where we have a \nlarge senior population. We think of some of the Southern States as \nbeing the ones that attract our seniors. But the fact is Alaska has the \nsecond fastest-growing senior population in the Nation, second only to \nNevada.\n  So again we ask the question: Why aren't Alaska's doctors able to \nprovide care to our seniors? Why are they saying: No, we are not \naccepting any new Medicare patients? Well, a lot of it has to do with \nthe reimbursement rates. Recent Federal reductions in Alaska Medicare \nreimbursement rates have been so severe that primary care physicians \nreport that Medicare pays them only 37 cents--it is actually between 37 \ncents to 40 cents--for every dollar that it costs to treat a patient. \nSo the doctor is spending a dollar in the care provided but is getting \nreimbursed about 40 cents to every dollar. We had one physician testify \nat the field hearing, and he said that in order for him to basically \nbreak even with his medical practice, he would have to see one Medicare \npatient every 7 minutes in order for him not to lose money. For those \nof us who go into our doctor's office, if we only had 7 minutes in \nthere with our medical provider, I don't think we would feel we were \ngetting the care and the attention our medical issues deserve.\n  Losing money by seeing Medicare patients has meant that many of our \nphysicians have stopped accepting Medicare patients entirely. They are \nmaking a decision not to accept any new Medicare patients. Or if you \nhave been a patient of a particular physician and you turn 65, you may \nhave had a good relationship with that physician, but if he tells you: \nI am sorry, I am not accepting any new Medicare patients, that date of \nyour birthday comes and all of a sudden you don't have the care that \nyou had relied on for some period of time.\n  During this committee field hearing, we had testimony that revealed \nthat\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nonly one neighborhood health clinic in the entire city of Anchorage--\nand again, this is a city that has half the State's population--only \none neighborhood health clinic is still accepting new Medicare \npatients.\n  So if you are lucky enough to find a physician, it often takes weeks \nor months for an appointment. So when you are faced with this kind of a \ndelay, you have one of two options. You either go to the emergency room \nif the conditions are severe enough or you go without care entirely, \nputting it off until perhaps it becomes even more complicated down the \nroad.\n  We had testify at the field hearing one gentleman who is from the \ncity of Bethel. Bethel is in the western part of the State. He said he \nwas willing to fly the 500-some-odd miles from Bethel to Anchorage if \nonly he could find a primary care doctor who would accept him. He kind \nof joked because he said he counted himself lucky because he had a \nheart condition, and he was at least able to get in to see a specialist \nonce in awhile.\n  The chairman of the Alaska Commission on Aging, Mr. Frank Appel, \ncalled the lack of access to health care for seniors ``the most \ncritical problem facing Alaska's seniors.''\n  I know Alaska is not alone. The crisis is not just Alaska. It is \nnationwide. We as a body, as a Congress, should find this situation \nintolerable.\n  I haven't been in the Senate for as long as many of my other \ncolleagues, but I have been here long enough to know that we fight a \nlot about health care. We debate the solvency issues, the funding \nissues, the insurance, the benefit coverage, universal coverage, health \nsavings accounts, the prescription drug benefit. We debate and argue \nabout a lot of these issues as they relate to health care, and each and \nevery one of these issues is certainly worthy of great debate. But I \nwould submit that not one of those very worthy debates matters in the \nleast to one of the seniors I have mentioned in these letters who can't \nfind a primary care doctor after making 100 phone calls.\n  So instead of this body debating how health care is delivered, it is \ntime we focus on the fact that it is not delivered in much of America. \nWe have a crisis that, simply put, cannot wait. We have to do two \nthings. We have to help current physicians stay in the practice of \nmedicine, and we must vastly increase our health care work force.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Stevens and I introduced the Rural \nPhysician Relief Act, and this is a bill that provides tax incentives \nfor physicians to practice in our most rural and frontier locations in \nthe country. Today, along with my colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator \nStevens, and Senator Sanders, we are introducing legislation entitled \nthe ``Physician Shortage Elimination Act.'' This legislation will \ndouble the funding for the National Health Service Corps, a program \nthat is dedicated to meeting the needs of the underserved. Despite its \nsuccess over the years, it has been vastly underfunded. We understand \nthat 85 percent of the applicants to this worthy program have to be \nturned away each year because we don't fund it.\n  This legislation will also allow rural and underserved physician \nresidency programs to expand by removing barriers that prevent programs \nfrom developing rural training programs.\n  We will also double certain title VII funding to create programs that \ntarget disadvantaged youth in rural and underserved areas and nurture \nthem to create a pipeline to careers in health care. We need to get \nmore people interested in the field.\n  Finally, we must bolster the cornerstone of rural health care, which \nis the community health center, through additional grants and by \nallowing them to expand their residency programs.\n  I would suggest that the prognosis for the quality of health care in \nAmerica is poor. Fifteen million Americans in underserved areas across \nthe Nation already do without care. Soon, with even greater physician \nshortages, it could mean that potentially another 84 million patients \nwill be left without a physician's care.\n  The time for Congress to act is now. In fact, it is past time. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue that again is not \njust Alaska-specific. I think the facts on the ground up North perhaps \nmake the arguments more accentuated, but I think it points to a \nsituation in this Nation that we must deal with now before the crisis \nis felt throughout the country.\n  I appreciate the attention of the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bond, Mrs. \n        Clinton, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 897. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nmore help to Alzheimer's disease caregivers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring the \nAlzheimer's Family Assistance Act of 2007 introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Mikulski.\n  As much as we all would like to think that we will remain healthy and \nstrong throughout our lifetimes, many of us will need long-term care. \nThe cost of that care, whether provided in a nursing home, assisted \nliving facility, or in one's own home with the assistance of health \naides, can quickly add up. That is why we should do everything we can \nto make people aware of long-term care insurance and to ensure that \npolicies are affordable.\n  We need to encourage people to include long-term care insurance in \ntheir planning, especially when people are younger and premiums would \nbe lower. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, DRA, made good progress in \nthat regard by expanding State long-term care partnership programs. In \naddition, the DRA established an information clearinghouse to help \nindividuals learn about long-term care insurance options in their \nstates.\n  We also need to encourage older individuals to purchase long-term \ncare insurance. By establishing a deduction for long-term care \ninsurance premiums, this legislation will help accomplish that goal. In \norder to qualify for the deduction, the policy must include several \nimportant consumer protections recommended by the National Association \nof Insurance Commissioners, NAIC. The DRA incorporated the same \nprotections plus some additional NAIC consumer protections into the \nState long-term care partnership policies. As this bill moves forward, \nI look forward to working with Senator Mikulski to ensure consistency \nin the application of these consumer protections to long-term care \npolicies. Specifically, I hope we can expand the consumer protections \nin this bill so they are in line with those included in the DRA.\n  Finally, this legislation recognizes that individuals and their \ncaregivers may need assistance in paying for medical supplies, nursing \ncare, and other long-term care expenses. The tax credit called for in \nthe bill, which increases from $1,000 to $3,000 in 2011 and beyond, \nwill help defray these costs.\n  Mr. President, I have long supported the policies included in this \nlegislation and commend my colleague for her work on this important \nissue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 899. A bill to amend section 401(b)(2) of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 regarding the Federal Pell Grant maximum amount; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues \nSenators Mikulski, Murray, Sanders, Durbin, Lieberman, Cantwell, Akaka, \nand Levin, to introduce legislation to amend the Higher Education Act \nto improve access to college for low- and moderate-income students by \nraising the authorized maximum Pell grant to $11,600 within 5 years. \nThis bill has the strong support of the American Association of \nUniversities, American Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges, the National Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities, the American Council on \nEducation, and The Higher Education Consortium for Special Education.\n  Pell grants were first established in the early 1970s by our former \ncolleague, Senator Claiborne Pell. Pell grants are the largest source \nof Federal grant aid for college students and make it possible for \nmillions of low- and moderate-income students to attend college. The \nbenefits of Pell grant aid cannot be overstated. Pell grants are \nbeneficial\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nto individual students as well as our society as a whole. Often, our \nNation's great innovators and creative minds sharpen their skills on \ncollege campuses. By increasing the Pell grant, we make a college \neducation more affordable, and thus, make it more likely that qualified \nand hard working low- and moderate-income students will attend. It \nwould be a significant loss to this great Nation if a generation of \nindividuals were not able to earn a college degree simply because they \ncould not afford to pay for it.\n  In 1975, the maximum appropriated Pell grant covered 80 percent of \nthe average student's tuition, fees, room, and board at 4-year public \nuniversities. In 2005-2006, the average Pell grant covered 33 percent \nof the total charges at 4-year public universities. That's not just a \ndrop in aid, it's a free-fall. For low- and moderate-income families, \nthe cost of college has also increased as a percentage of income. In \n1999 it took 43 percent of a low-income family's income to pay for a \ncollege education. In 1972, it only took 27 percent. The cornerstone of \nAmerican democracy is providing all citizens with access and \nopportunities so that through hard work they can achieve the ``American \ndream.'' We must keep that dream alive by providing students the \nfinancial opportunity to attend college.\n  In order to meet the cost of attending college, many low- and \nmoderate-income students are forced to take out an exorbitant amount in \nstudent loans. Upon graduation these students are often faced with an \nunmanageable debt load. Surveys tell us that students with a \nsignificant amount of debt are postponing marriage and having children. \nOthers are choosing their jobs based on where they think they can \nafford to work. Clearly, we do not want student loan debt to solely \ndrive our young people's goals and aspirations.\n  Over the past several years, the administration has not raised the \nmaximum Pell grant. On top of leaving millions of children behind by \nunderfunding K-12 education, they are also leaving students behind who \nhave done well in school and want the chance to go on to college. If we \nare serious about leaving no student behind--if we are serious about \nhaving a society where equal opportunity for all is more than just \nrhetoric--then we must increase the Pell grant.\n  It has been said that investing in a student's future is investing in \nour Nation's future. We can start investing in our Nation's future by \nsupporting this bill to increase the maximum appropriated Pell grant to \n$11,600. This bill won't bring the Pell grant's purchasing power back \nto where it was in 1975, but it is a critical first step. I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in taking this important step toward \nensuring all that have the ability to excel in college are given that \nopportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FEDERAL PELL GRANT MAXIMUM AMOUNT.\n\n       Section 401(b)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1070a(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C);\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of \n     the Federal Pell Grant for a student eligible under this part \n     shall be--\n       ``(i) $7,600 for academic year 2007-2008;\n       ``(ii) $8,600 for academic year 2008-2009;\n       ``(iii) $9,600 for academic year 2009-2010;\n       ``(iv) $10,600 for academic year 2010-2011; and\n       ``(v) $11,600 for academic year 2011-2012,\n     less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the \n     expected family contribution with respect to that student for \n     that year.''; and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (A) (as amended by \n     paragraph (2)) the following:\n       ``(B) If the Secretary determines that the increase from \n     one academic year to the next in the amount of the maximum \n     Federal Pell Grant authorized under subparagraph (A) does not \n     increase students' purchasing power (relative to the cost of \n     attendance at an institution of higher education) by not less \n     than 5 percentage points, then the amount of the maximum \n     Federal Pell Grant authorized under subparagraph (A) for the \n     academic year for which the determination is made shall be \n     increased by an amount sufficient to achieve such a 5 \n     percentage point increase.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 900. A bill to authorize the Boy Scouts of America to exchange \ncertain land in the State of Utah acquired under the Recreation and \nPublic Purposes Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. .HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Boy Scouts \nof America Land Transfer Act of 2007. This important legislation will \nallow the exchange of two small parcels of land between the Utah Parks \nCouncil of the Boy Scouts of America and Brian Head Ski Resort.\n  In 1983, the Bureau of Land Management granted the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica roughly 1,300 acres in Parowan, Utah. The land patent was \ngranted with the stipulation that it be used exclusively for purposes \nof a Boy Scout camp. The Scout camp, known as Camp Thunder Ridge, is \nsituated in the mountains adjacent to Brian Head Ski Resort and near \nCedar Breaks National Monument.\n  When the land was given to the Scout Camp, a local rancher owned a \nparcel of land adjacent to the camp and another parcel in the middle of \nthe camp. Upon his retirement, the rancher turned over his parcels, \ntotaling 120 acres, to Brian Head Ski Resort. Thus, the ski resort now \nowns land in the middle of a Boy Scout Camp.\n  The Boy Scouts and the Resort agree that the land previously owned by \nthe rancher would best be used as part of Camp Thunder Ridge, while \ncertain parcels of the Scout Camp would be of more use to the Ski \nResort.\n  The Boy Scouts of America Land Transfer Act would allow the Boy \nScouts to exchange 120 acres of their land on the south end of the camp \nwith Brian Head for 120 acres on the eastern side of the camp, \nincluding the 40 acres located in the middle of the camp. Because of \nthe stipulations of the original BLM patent given to the Scout Camp, \nlegislation is required to authorize this exchange.\n  While Camp Thunder Ridge is located in a steep, rough, mountainous \narea, much of the land the Boy Scouts seek is flat, making it \nparticularly important for the camp. Obtaining the land would make it \npossible for the Scouts to make the camp shooting area and archery \nrange safer and would allow them to improve and expand their camping \nfacilities. It would also allow for the installation of much-needed \nseptic tanks.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Boy Scouts of America. Scout camps, \nsuch as Camp Thunder Ridge, give young men the opportunity to learn \nvital skills, fulfill merit badge requirements, and otherwise improve \nthemselves. This small land exchange will allow Camp Thunder Ridge to \ndo a better job in helping these young men learn and grow.\n  For its part, Brian Head Ski Resort is seeking to expand their \noperations and have received preliminary approval from local officials. \nThe local Planning Commission, however, has required them to build an \nemergency exit for their property. The only place to build such a road \nis through land owned by the Boy Scouts. The exchange will allow Brian \nHead to construct the access road and comply with county fire safety \nregulations.\n  The Boy Scouts have been working for more than 20 years to secure the \nlands in question, and Brian Head needs to build on lands currently \nowned by the Scouts. Therefore, it would be in the best interest of \nboth parties to authorize this land exchange. In fact, the exchange is \ndesperately needed by both parties, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bond, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Reed, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Obama, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 901. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nadditional authorizations of appropriations for the health centers \nprogram under section 330 of such Act, tot he Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor to join Senator Hatch and \nmy\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nHELP Committee colleagues today in introducing this bill to reauthorize \nthe community health centers program. The Health Centers Renewal Act \nextends the program through 2012, it authorizes the funds needed to \nstabilize existing centers and enable them to increase their capacity \nand funds for new centers in underserved areas that have no existing \ncenter.\n  The community health centers program has been a success story by any \nmeasure over the past 40 years. It began as a two-site demonstration \nproject for ``neighborhood health centers'' in 1965, with funds for \nColumbia Point in Massachusetts and Mound Bayou in Mississippi. The \nhealth center model was the brainchild of two young physicians and \ncivil rights activists, Dr. H. Jack Geiger and Dr. Count Gibson. Their \nmodel was intended to address both health care and the roots of \npoverty, by giving communities a voice in their health care through a \npatient-majority community board, by creating jobs and investments in \nlocal communities, and by focusing on primary care and reducing health \ndisparities among income groups.\n  Today, more than 1,000 health centers provide good health care to 16 \nmillion patients each year. They provide safety nets in their \ncommunities for the most vulnerable Americans, and bring care to 1 of \nevery 4 Americans living in poverty. Nearly 70 percent of health center \npatients have incomes below the poverty line, and two-thirds are \nmembers of racial and ethnic minorities. Health centers give those who \nare so often disenfranchised in our society a voice in their own health \ncare and in the care available in their community. Health centers are \nalso an incentive for economic growth, providing 50,000 jobs across the \ncountry for residents in their communities.\n  As the number of uninsured and underinsured persons grows each year, \nthe need for health center services increases. More than 40 percent of \nhealth center patients have no health insurance and their number is \nincreasing. Another 36 percent of patients have coverage through \nMedicaid or CHIP, and cuts in these programs affect health centers as \nwell. As the number of patients who rely on health centers continues to \ngrow, we must provide the funds needed to open new centers in areas \nthat are underserved and to provide additional funds to enable existing \ncenters to meet the growing demand for care.\n  The funding authorized in this bill will provide stability and \nexpanded services in existing centers, and enable new centers to open \nin areas that have no centers today. The legislation will keep health \ncenters on track to serve 20 million patients by 2010 and more than 23 \nmillion patients by 2012. It also provides the funds needed to expand \nexisting health centers to reach more uninsured and underinsured \npatients, open new centers in underserved areas with no current \ncenters, expand coverage of mental health, dental, and pharmacy \nservices to all centers, invest in information technology, and take \nother steps to improve health outcomes. Our goal in the bill is to make \nsure that health centers can provide high-quality care to their \npatients for years to come, and I look forward to its enactment into \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous request that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Community, migrant, public housing, and homeless health \n     centers are vital to thousands of communities across the \n     United States.\n       (2) There are more than 1,000 such health centers serving \n     more than 16,000,000 people at more than 5,000 health \n     delivery sites, located in all 50 States of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, Guam, the \n     Virgin Islands, and other territories of the United States.\n       (3) Health centers provide cost-effective, quality health \n     care to poor and medically underserved people in the States, \n     the District of Columbia, and the territories, including the \n     working poor, the uninsured, and many high-risk and \n     vulnerable populations, and have done so for over 40 years.\n       (4) Health centers provide care to 1 of every 8 uninsured \n     Americans, 1 of every 4 Americans in poverty, and 1 of every \n     9 rural Americans.\n       (5) Health centers provide primary and preventive care \n     services to more than 700,000 homeless persons and more than \n     725,000 farm workers in the United States.\n       (6) Health centers are community-oriented and patient-\n     focused and tailor their services to fit the special needs \n     and priorities of local communities, working together with \n     schools, businesses, churches, community organizations, \n     foundations, and State and local governments.\n       (7) Health centers are built through community initiative.\n       (8) Health centers encourage citizen participation and \n     provide jobs for 50,000 community residents.\n       (9) Congress established the program as a unique public-\n     private partnership, and has continued to provide direct \n     funding to community organizations for the development and \n     operation of health centers systems that address pressing \n     local health needs and meet national performance standards.\n       (10) Federal grants assist participating communities in \n     finding partners and recruiting doctors and other health \n     professionals.\n       (11) Federal grants constitute, on average, 24 percent of \n     the annual budget of such health centers, with the remainder \n     provided by State and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, \n     private contributions, private insurance, and patient fees.\n       (12) Health centers make health care responsive and cost-\n     effective through aggressive outreach, patient education, \n     translation, and other enabling support services.\n       (13) Health centers help reduce health disparities, meet \n     escalating health care needs, and provide a vital safety net \n     in the health care delivery system of the United States.\n       (14) Health centers increase the use of preventive health \n     services, including immunizations, pap smears, mammograms, \n     and HBa1c tests for diabetes screenings.\n       (15) Expert studies have demonstrated the impact that these \n     community-owned and patient-controlled primary care delivery \n     systems have achieved both in the reduction of traditional \n     access barriers and the elimination of health disparities \n     among their patients.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR \n                   HEALTH CENTERS PROGRAM OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE \n                   ACT.\n\n       Section 330(r) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     254b(r)) is amended by amending paragraph (1) to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--For the purpose of carrying out this \n     section, in addition to the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under subsection (d), there are authorized to be \n     appropriated--\n       ``(A) $2,188,745,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       ``(B) $2,451,394,400 for fiscal year 2009;\n       ``(C) $2,757,818,700 for fiscal year 2010;\n       ``(D) $3,116,335,131 for fiscal year 2011; and\n       ``(E) $3,537,040,374 for fiscal year 2012.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Centers \nRenewal Act with my colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Roberts, Dodd, Bond, \nHarkin, Snowe, Mikulski, Domenici, Bingaman, Murkowski, Reed, Bennett, \nClinton, Grassley, Obama, Burr and Brown.\n  The Health Centers program, created over 40 years ago, has an \noutstanding record of providing quality health care services to many \nAmericans who do not have adequate health insurance. This ranges from \nchildren to parents and grandparents, in virtually every comer of the \nUnited States. In fact, Health Centers are a necessary component of our \nnation's health care safety net--they supply health services to over 15 \nmillion people in our country.\n  Health Centers include community health centers, which are local, \nnot-for-profit 50l(c)(3) corporations that give community-oriented \nhealth care and are governed by Boards of Directors that are made up of \nat least 51 percent health centers patients, to ensure that the \npatients and their communities are well represented.\n  From my work in Utah, I know how important Health Centers are. They \nhave made a tremendous difference for Utah's citizens with insufficient \nhealth coverage--Utah community health centers serve close to 85,000 \npatients. Whenever I come home to Utah, I always hear wonderful things \nabout the work of Community Health Centers.\n  Since 2001, Congress has consistently increased funding for Community \nHealth Centers to meet President Bush's goal of having 1,200 new or \nexpanded centers. The new dollars have provided services to four \nmillion new patients and have added facilities in over 750 communities \nacross the country. By reauthorizing this program, Health Centers will \ngive low-cost health care to many more deserving individuals.\n  S. 901 I will reauthorize the Health Centers program for 5 more \nyears; it includes funding levels of: $2,188,745,000\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nin fiscal year 2008; $2,451,394,400 in fiscal year 2009; $2,757,818,700 \nin fiscal year 2010; $3,116,335,131 in fiscal year 2011; and \n$3,537,040,374 in fiscal year 2012. These numbers are based on the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers; NACHC, growth plan--\nNACHC's goal is for Community Health Centers to serve 20 million \npatients a year by 2010 and 30 million patients a year by 2015.\n  I believe that Community Health Centers are worth every dime that our \ngovernment invests in them.\n  Utah Health Centers have made a tremendous difference in the lives of \nmany Utahns--66 percent of patients come from Utah's urban areas and 27 \npercent are from the rural parts of the state. Ninety-six percent of \nUtah Health Center patients' incomes are below 200 percent of the \nFederal Poverty Level. Utah Health Centers have literally changed these \npatients' lives, serving as a link to the health care safety net system \nfor the medically underserved and uninsured. In rural areas, Health \nCenters are often the only health care provider.\n  Community Health Centers have made a huge impact on people's lives. I \nam pleased and proud to support them by introducing this legislation \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important bill, which not only \nprovides people with essential health care services, but also ensures \nthat the Health Centers will continue to have the funding necessary to \nprovide these services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Landrieu, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 902. A bill to provide support and assistance for families of \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve who are undergoing \ndeployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr President, Americans are divided over the Iraq war, \nbut we are 100 percent united in our determination to support the \ntroops in the field and their families back home.\n  But just as we have seen shortcomings in the treatment of wounded \nwarriors at Walter Reed, it is clear to me that we are falling short in \nsupporting the families of Guard and Reserve personnel who serve in \nIraq and Afghanistan. These families are especially vulnerable because \nof their isolation, their distance from military bases, and their lack \nof access to the services that active-duty military families can draw \nupon.\n  This is a new era for our National Guard and for the Reserves. They \nare shouldering a huge share of the combat burden in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, plus a stepped-up role in homeland security. More than \nfour times as many Guard members have been killed in Iraq as during the \nentire Vietnam war.\n  With many Guard and Reserve members on their third or even fourth \ndeployment, and with some deployments being stretched out to 16 months, \nthe stresses on their families are acute. Their children are at greater \nrisk for depression, behavioral disorders, or academic problems. And \nlong family separations often result in financial difficulties and \ntroubled marriages.\n  To address this quiet crisis, today I am introducing legislation \ntitled the Coming Together for Guard and Reserve Families Act. This \nbill does several things.\n  First, it expands and strengthens the existing family assistance \nprogram. We need to ensure that there is adequate professional staff to \nwork with Guard and Reserve families and meet their special needs at \nevery point of the deployment cycle--as they prepare for deployment, \nduring the long absence, and during reunification and readjustment.\n  I am especially concerned that there are few resources for the \nfamilies of Guard and Reserve members who are wounded or experience \nmental illness. My bill expands the VA's Disabled Transition Assistance \nprogram to ensure that family members have access to family counseling \nand mental health services during this critical time.\n  Children of deployed service members often react to parental \nseparation with acting-out behaviors, anxiety, or depression. My bill \ncalls for outreach to professionals who serve children--including \nschool administrators and teachers--to alert them to the special needs \nof kids in military families, especially those with a parent deployed \nin a war zone.\n  Forty-one percent of Guard members and Reservists report symptoms of \nmental illness--including post-traumatic stress disorder--within 6 \nmonths of returning home from deployment. Currently, mental health \ninformation is distributed to service members when they return from \ndeployment--and often that's it. But symptoms of PTSD may not appear \nfor months after return. My bill will ensure that families receive \nmental health information 6 months post-deployment.\n  Finally, my bill creates a family-to-family mentoring program to \nenable military spouses to serve as peer counselors to other spouses \nand family members. It can be extremely valuable for a military spouse \nto consult with someone who has gone through a similar experience.\n  The role of our Guard and Reserve members in defending our national \nsecurity abroad has significantly increased. In turn, we have an \nexpanded obligation to care for their spouses and children, who are \nfacing tremendous stresses, often alone and with no one to turn to.\n  The aim of my bill is to address the unmet needs of Guard and Reserve \nfamilies before this becomes the kind of full-fledged crisis we \nwitnessed at Walter Reed. I urge my colleagues to support this urgent \nand important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 903. A bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Muhammad \nYunus, in recognition of his contributions to the fight against global \npoverty; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Muhammad Yunus \nfor his contributions to the fight against global poverty.\n  Today, joined by my colleague Senator Bennett of Utah as well as \nSenators Clinton, Kerry and Harkin, I introduced the Muhammad Yunus \nCongressional Gold Medal Act.\n  This bipartisan bill would award Dr. Yunus a Congressional Gold Medal \nin recognition of his efforts to fight poverty and promote economic and \nsocial opportunity.\n  Along with the Grameen Bank, which he founded, Dr. Yunus was awarded \nthe Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for developing the concept of \nmicrocredit. Through the Grameen system, Dr. Yunus created an \neconomically sound model of extending very small loans, at competitive \ninterest rates, to the very poor. Through this system, he has been \ntransforming lives, one loan at a time.\n  He began in 1976 with a loan of just $27, out of his own pocket, to \n42 village craftspeople in Bangladesh. Over the past 30 years, his \nmodel has been emulated around the world.\n  I met Dr. Yunus on my first trip to Bangladesh, and there I saw \nfirsthand the economic miracle that microcredit can help create.\n  Nearly half the world's population lives on less than $2 a day. We \ncan not hope to achieve lasting global peace and stability until we \nfind a means by which the world's poorest can begin to lift themselves \nout of poverty.\n  The microcredit movement that Dr. Yunus pioneered has made enormous \nstrides towards that goal. Over 125 million households have already \nbeen transformed by microcredit loans, and more are joining them every \nday.\n  Dr. Yunus' work has had a particularly strong impact on improving the \neconomic prospects of women. Women disproportionately shoulder the \nburden of poverty. They also make up over 95 percent of microcredit \nborrowers.\n  I have long believed that if you want to predict the economic \nprospects of a country, ask how it treats its women. If a country sends \nits daughters to school, if its wives and mothers have economic and \npolitical rights and opportunities, then it is likely to prosper. But \nif it treats its women as second-class citizens, its chances for \ndevelopment diminish dramatically. Microcredit opens doors for women \nand in so doing it creates new opportunities for their sons and \ndaughters alike.\n  Muhammad Yunus's work has also affected the lives of millions of \nAmericans. Although Dr. Yunus launched his movement in 1976 in \nBangladesh--a long time ago and a long way away--it\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\nhas come home to us here in America and is still relevant today.\n  There are now an estimated 21 million microentrepreneurs in the U.S., \naccounting for approximately 16 percent of private employment in the \ncountry. Over $318 million worth of microloans have been made to \nAmerican entrepreneurs in the past 15 years.\n  Culminating with his Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Yunus has been recognized \naround the world as a leading figure in the effort to fight poverty and \npromote economic and social opportunity.\n  It is time that we properly recognize him here in Congress with our \nmost distinguished honor.\n  Dr. Yunus would join a long and illustrious line of Congressional \nGold Medal recipients that stretches back to 1776, when the award was \ncreated. Although most of the recipients have been American, many have \nnot: Prime Minister Tony Blair, Pope John Paul II, and His Holiness, \nthe Fourteenth Dalai Lama, are just a few. We hope that Dr. Yunus will \njoin them.\n  I want to thank Senator Bennett and my other colleagues for joining \nme today in honoring Dr. Yunus. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a great man who \ndeserves our admiration and our thanks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Dr. Muhammad Yunus is recognized in the United States \n     and throughout the world as a leading figure in the fight \n     against poverty and the effort to promote economic and social \n     change;\n       (2) Muhammad Yunus is the recognized developer of the \n     concept of microcredit, and Grameen Bank, which he founded, \n     has created a model of lending that has been emulated across \n     the globe;\n       (3) Muhammad Yunus launched this global movement to create \n     economic and social development from below, beginning in \n     1976, with a loan of $27 from his own pocket to 42 crafts \n     persons in a small village in Bangladesh;\n       (4) Muhammad Yunus has demonstrated the life-changing \n     potential of extending very small loans (at competitive \n     interest rates) to the very poor and the economic feasibility \n     of microcredit and other microfinance and microenterprise \n     practices and services;\n       (5) Dr. Yunus's work has had a particularly strong impact \n     on improving the economic prospects of women, and on their \n     families, as over 95 percent of microcredit borrowers are \n     women;\n       (6) Dr. Yunus has pioneered a movement with the potential \n     to assist a significant number of the more than 1,000,000,000 \n     people, mostly women and children, who live on less than $1 a \n     day, and the nearly 3,000,000,000 people who live on less \n     than $2 a day, and which has already reached 125,000,000 \n     households, by one estimate;\n       (7) there are now an estimated 21,000,000 \n     microentrepreneurs in the United States (accounting for \n     approximately 16 percent of private (nonfarm) employment in \n     the United States), and the Small Business Administration has \n     made over $318,000,000 in microloans to entrepreneurs since \n     1992;\n       (8) Dr. Yunus, along with the Grameen Bank, was awarded the \n     Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to promote economic \n     and social opportunity and out of recognition that lasting \n     peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find \n     the means, such as microcredit, to break out of poverty; and\n       (9) the microcredit ideas developed and put into practice \n     by Muhammad Yunus, along with other bold initiatives, can \n     make a historical breakthrough in the fight against poverty.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design, to \n     Dr. Muhammad Yunus, in recognition of his many enduring \n     contributions to the fight against global poverty.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3, under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority to Use Fund Amounts.--There are authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund, such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs \n     of the medals struck pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 4 shall be \n     deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Muhammad \nYunus. For those who don't already know, Dr. Yunus is a modest man of \ngreat ideas, now revered around the world, as the father of microcredit \nand the founder of the Grameen Bank. His concept of microcredit has \nhelped thousands of people work their way out of poverty. For his work \nto beat global poverty, I am very proud to join my colleagues, Senators \nDurbin and Bennett, in introducing a bill to honor Dr. Yunus with a \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  When I look at the success of Dr. Yunus's idea and the \nmicroenterprise programs it has inspired over the past 30 years, one \nthing that amazes me the most is that it all began with a loan of 27 \nU.S. dollars. The beauty of microcredit is that such a small amount of \nmoney can have such tremendous and lasting effects to foster \nentrepreneurship among those who would not qualify for typical bank \nloans. By offering loans at competitive interest rates, or no interest, \nDr. Yunus's Grameen Bank has been able to give individuals suffering \nfrom poverty the power to determine their own futures.\n  Last year, Dr. Yunus and his Grameen Bank were honored with a Nobel \nPeace Prize for his economic imagination. Dr. Yunus's innovation and \nentrepreneurship are certainly commendable and worthy of such an honor, \nas well as the distinction of a Congressional Gold Medal. In accepting \nhis Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Yunus challenged the world to think of an \nentrepreneur as not only being motivated by profit, but also by ``doing \ngood to people and the world.''\n  The effectiveness of microcredit programs is evident by the success \nstories they have inspired all around the world. As chairman of the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I have seen first hand \nthe power of microcredit in this country, through the SBA's--Small \nBusiness Administration's--microloan programs. In my home State of \nMassachusetts, Thondup and Dolma Tsering, two Tibetan refugees in the \nUnited States, were able to start their own restaurant in 2005, with \nassistance from the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center and \nfinancing from the Western Massachusetts Enterprise Fund. Through \nfinancing and support, otherwise not available to them from the banking \ncommunity, they are now the successful owners of Lhasa Cafe in \nNorthampton. As small business owners, the Tserings are socially \nresponsible and support local farmers and their community.\n  From Dr. Yunus's first microloans to 42 entrepreneurs in Bangladesh \nin 1976, the concept of microcredit has come a long way. Here in the \nUnited States, where SBA has had a similar program since 1992, more \nthan $328 million in microloans have been made to deserving \nentrepreneurs.\n  I have long been a supporter of funding microloan programs, which \noffer current and potential small business owners the opportunity to \nachieve financial independence, financial security, and dignity through \nwork. Sometimes they use it to work their way out of poverty, but \nsometimes they use it to patch together income when they need more \nmoney, lose a job, want to buy a house or car, or maybe pay for college \nor send a child to college. These entrepreneurs create jobs, provide \nservices and products to our communities, and generate tax revenue to \nbenefit the economy. Funding microloan programs not only makes economic \nsense; it makes social sense as well.\n  In spite of growing support for microloan programs, and in spite of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nreturn on investment to our economy, microenterprise does not get the \nsupport in this country that it does in other countries. In 2005, the \nadministration provided approximately $211 million for the development \nof foreign microenterprise programs through the Agency for \nInternational Development, USAID. In fiscal year 2006, we are told that \nthe administration provided more than $54 million for microloans in \nIraq:\n\n        The efforts of the U.S. government in its assistance to \n     Iraq have been broad based. . . For example, over $54 million \n     in micro-loans have been disbursed, resulting in 26,700 loans \n     in twelve cities, and the program is set to expand to even \n     more areas. Also, a Loan Guarantee Corporation is currently \n     being established to encourage private banks to make loans to \n     small businesses.--Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S. \n     Ambassador to Iraq, May 9, 2006.\n\n  And for fiscal year 2007, we are told that the administration is \nrequesting supplemental funding for Iraq that includes at least $160 \nmillion for microloans.\n\n       We will help local leaders improve their capacity to govern \n     and deliver public services. Our economic efforts will be \n     more targeted on specific local needs with proven records of \n     success, like micro-credit programs. And we will engage with \n     leading private sector enterprises and other local \n     businesses, including the more promising state-owned firms, \n     to break the obstacles to growth.--Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza Rice, Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the \n     administration's plan for Iraq, January 11, 2007.\n\n  At the same time, the President has proposed for fiscal years 2005, \n2006, 2007, and 2008 eliminating all funding for the SBA's microloan \nprograms.\n  Today I not only honor and recognize the genius of Dr. Yunus, but \nalso call attention to President Bush's lack of support for U.S. \nmicroloans and call on the administration to reverse its policy. If we \ncan support microloans in Baghdad, we should support microloans in \nBoston, and every other city that's home to a would-be entrepreneur.\n  I am honored to add my name in support of Dr. Muhammad Yunus, and I \nam gratified to see the support he has received among my colleagues. \nBut I also implore my colleagues to pay tribute to American \nentrepreneurs and to fund the SBA's microloan program. We must honor \nDr. Yunus's ingenuity with more than words; we must honor him with our \nactions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 904. A bill to provide additional relief for small business owners \nordered to active duty as members of reserve components of the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nSmall Business Opportunity Act of 2007. Senators Pryor, Craig, and I \nare introducing this legislation to assist veterans and small \nbusinesses that employ Guard and reservists. Our bill improves the \nSmall Business Administration's, SBA's, Military Reservist Economic \nInjury Disaster Loan, MREIDL, program. Additionally, this bill \nincreases procurement opportunities, capital access, and other types of \nbusiness development assistance for veterans and service-disabled \nveterans.\n  We all know today's small business men and women play a vital role in \nthe economic stability and prosperity of our Nation. Quite often, these \nsame entrepreneurs are the veterans who have protected our Nation in \nyears past, or who serve in the Armed Forces today. When our Nation's \npatriotic men and women are called to duty, they often leave behind \nthriving small businesses, and as a result, many of these businesses \nexperience production slowdowns and lost sales, or incur additional \nexpenses to compensate for an employee's absence.\n  In recent years, the Department of Defense has placed a greater \nreliance on our country's Guard and Reserve Forces. In fact, since \nSeptember 2001, nearly 600,000 Guard and Reserve members have been \ncalled up in support of current operations, comprising nearly one-third \nof deployed service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. Furthermore, Guard \nand Reserve members were charged with assisting recovery efforts in the \ngulf coast region in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  In my 4 years as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and now as ranking member, I have fought to support \nour patriotic small businesses affected by the Guard and Reserve call-\nups. My home State of Maine has one of the highest Guard and Reserve \ndeployment levels in the country--over 50 percent have been deployed to \nIraq and Afghanistan. In response to this I commissioned a \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, study which found that 35 percent of \nGuard and reservists work for small busineses or are self-employed. In \naddition, the small businesses that employ them may be ``paying'' a \ndisproportionate and unfair share of the burden of increased Guard and \nReserve member call-ups. The burden is further magnified when it is the \nsmall business owner or a key employee who is deployed.\n  Our legislation will raise the maximum MREIDL amount from $1,500,000 \nto $2,000,000. A maximum military reservist loan amount of $2,000,000 \nis the same level as many of the SBA's other loan programs, including: \n7(a) loans, international trade loans, and 504 Certified Development \nCorporation loans that serve a public policy goal.\n  Currently, some of the SBA's contracting and business development \nprograms have defined time limits for participation. If the firm's time \nfor participation expires prematurely, then competitive opportunities, \ninvestments, and jobs become lost. Today, small business owners who get \ncalled-up to active duty in the National Guard or Reserve are \neffectively penalized because their active duty time is counted against \nthe time limitation participation in the SBA's programs. The Veterans \nSmall Business Opportunity Act amends the Small Business Act by \nallowing small businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled \nveterans to extend their SBA program participation time limitations by \nthe duration of their owners' active duty service after September 11, \n2001.\n\n  Additionally, this bill will allow the SBA Administrator, either \ndirectly or through banks, to offer loans up to $25,000 without \nrequiring collateral from a loan applicant. Currently, the SBA offers \nmilitary reservist loans up to $5,000 without collateral. This \nprovision would increase that level to eligible small businesses.\n  The bill will also require the Administrator to give military \nreservist loan applications priority for processing and ensure that \nGuard and Reserve members are adequately assisted with their loan \napplication by incorporating the support and expertise of SBA \nentrepreneurial development partners, such as Small Business \nDevelopment Centers and Veterans Business Outreach Centers.\n  This legislation increases the authorization of appropriations for \nthe SBA's Office of Veteran Business Development to $2 million for \nfiscal year 2008, $2.1 million for fiscal year 2009 and $2.2 million \nfor fiscal year 2010. Increased funding for SBA's Office of Veterans \nBusiness Development help them better assist our Nation's veterans and \nprovide the business services they need.\n  This legislation will also strengthen the access of veterans and \nservice-disabled veterans to Federal contracts and subcontracts. Under \nthe Small Business Act and the President's Executive Order 13360, \nProviding Opportunities for Service-Disabled Veteran Businesses To \nIncrease Their Federal Contracting and Subcontracting, Federal agencies \nmust award at least 3 percent of prime contracts and subcontracts to \nsmall businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The order states \nthat, to achieve these goals, Federal agencies ``shall more \neffectively'' use the authorities in the Small Business Act to reserve \nand award contracts to service-disabled veterans. During the Senate \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee hearing held in January, \nit became very clear that Federal agencies have been short-changing \nservice-disabled veteran-owned small businesses to the tune of over \n$7.5 billion a year in government contracts during fiscal year 2003 \nthrough fiscal year 2005. To remedy this unacceptable situation, our \nlegislation puts the force of a congressional statute behind the \nrequirements of the President's Executive order.\n  In addition, our legislation ensures that veterans and service-\ndisabled veterans do not face confusing and duplicative red tape before \nthey can be eligible to access the Federal procurement market. \nCurrently, the Department of\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nVeterans Affairs and the SBA both operate registration databases for \nsmall businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans. A \nveteran must often register in both databases to be properly considered \nfor bidding. Surely, in this information age, we can have a better \nprocess. Registration data can easily be made to migrate from one \ndatabase to the other. Our legislation requires that a single \nregistration point for both of these databases be established within a \nyear. Such one-stop registration must be reliable and compliant with \nstatutory provisions concerning veteran and service-disabled veteran \nstatus certifications for small businesses.\n\n  To increase the capacity of service-disabled veteran-owned firms, my \nlegislation permits the SBA, in cooperation with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, to develop a business development assistance program, \nincluding mentor-protege assistance, to be administered by the SBA. Our \nlegislation contains a strict fairness requirement that any such \nprogram must be developed in such a way as to ensure success of other \nsmall business contracting programs. Within a year, the SBA is required \nto submit a report to Congress on its proposals for this program. In \n2004, I succeeded in amending the Department of Defense Mentor-Protege \nProgram statute by expanding it to service-disabled veterans. Since \nthen, over $204 million in contracts and subcontracts have been awarded \nto service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses as a result of the \n$17 million in mentor-Protege assistance. This represents a stunning \n$12 return for every $1 in assistance investment. I believe the success \nof this initiative should be replicated. The SBA is already \nadministering a Mentor-Protege Program as part of the 8(a) business \ndevelopment program for small disadvantaged businesses, and both the \nSBA and the DOD programs would provide useful examples for helping our \ndisabled veterans succeed.\n  Finally, our legislation creates an interagency task force among \nFederal agencies charged with improving procurement opportunities for \nservice-disabled veterans. The scope of this task force will, in \naddition to procurement, include franchising, capital access, and other \ntypes of business development assistance. In examining the \nimplementation of Executive Order 13360 and other veterans business \ndevelopment initiatives, our committee found that the responsible \nagencies were not talking to each other on a regular basis, and that no \noverall ``game plan'' was in place to coordinate various Federal \nefforts.\n  I would like to thank Senators Pryor and Craig for working with me on \nthis critical issue and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to comment on a bill that is being \nintroduced by Senator Snowe today, the Veterans Small Business \nOpportunity Act of 2007. I am proud to join with Senator Snowe and \nSenator Pryor as an original cosponsor of this important bill.\n  This legislation will benefit patriot ``citizen-soldiers'' who are \ncalled from their employment at America's small businesses to serve our \ncountry in uniform. In States across the Nation, small businesses are \nbeing affected by the mobilization of our Guard and Reserve personnel. \nIn my home State, the Idaho National Guard's 116th Brigade Combat Team \nreturned in 2005 from an 18-month deployment to Iraq. I visited members \nof the 116th while they were in Iraq and discovered that a good number \nhad left jobs at small businesses across Idaho. I also held a hearing \nin Idaho during the 109th Congress to examine the reemployment rights \nof returning Guard and Reserve members.\n  At that hearing, it was emphasized that, although legal rights to \nreemployment are critical, they do little for those who have no \nemployer, or no small business, to return to. To me, it was clear that \nwe should do more to help small businesses in coping with the financial \nhardships of frequent and lengthy mobilizations of its employees or \nowners during the war on terrorism. I believe we can provide some of \nthat needed assistance with this legislation, which includes key \nprovisions from The Patriot Loan Act of 2006, a bill that Senator Snowe \nand I introduced last year.\n  This bill would enhance the U.S. Small Business Administration's \nMilitary Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or MREIDL, Program. \nThat program provides loan assistance to small businesses to help them \nmeet ordinary and necessary operating expenses after essential \nemployees are called to active duty in their roles as citizen-soldiers.\n  This bill would raise the maximum military reservist loan amount from \n$1.5 million to $2 million. It would also allow the Small Business \nAdministration, by direct loan or through banks, to offer unsecured \nloans of up to $25,000, an increase from the current $5,000 limit. In \naddition, this bill would ensure proactive outreach to Guard and \nReserve members about the MREIDL Program and other small business \nprograms by requiring SBA and the Department of Defense to develop a \njoint Web site and printed materials with information about those \nprograms.\n  For the brave men and women who serve our Nation in the Guard and \nReserve, we must do what we can to ensure that their sacrifices do not \nplace them in financial harm's way when they return home. I urge my \ncolleagues to support these measures, and I thank Senator Snowe for her \nleadership in introducing this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 905. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and \nnatural gas produced from marginal properties; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the independent producers of oil and gas \nare the backbone of our domestic supply of energy. They have played and \ncontinue to play a critical role in meeting our domestic needs, \nespecially as the big oil companies' focus mainly offshore. In fact, \nindependents develop 90 percent of our Nation's wells. According to the \nDepartment of Energy, independent producers supply 68 percent of \nAmerican oil production and 82 percent of overall American natural gas.\n  Therefore, I rise today to introduce legislation that eliminates the \ntaxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and natural gas \nproduced from marginal wells; wells producing 15 barrels of day and \nless than 90 thousand cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Under current law, the percentage depletion method is limited to only \nindependent producers and royalty owners. It is a form of cost recovery \nfor capital initially invested toward production of oil and gas wells. \nGenerally, the percentage depletion rate is 15 percent of the \ntaxpayer's gross income from an oil and gas producing property and is \nlimited to a daily average of 1,000 barrels of oil or 6,000 thousand \ncubic feet of natural gas. However, under the net income limitation, \npercentage depletion is limited to 100 percent of the net income from \nan individual property. In the case of marginal wells, where total \ndeductions often do exceed this net-income, this limitation discourages \nproducers from investing in the continued production from marginal \nwells.\n  As a result Congress has suspended the net-income limitation for 1998 \nthrough 2005; and again for 2006 and 2007, with the passage of the Tax \nRelief and Health Care Act of 2006, H.R. 6111.\n  My bill would simply clarify the policy by doing away with the \ntaxable net income limitation altogether.\n  In my own State of Oklahoma, it is the small independents, basically \nmom-and-pop operations, producing the majority of oil and natural gas, \nwith 85 percent of Oklahoma's oil coming from marginal wells.\n  Because marginal wells supply such a significant amount of our oil \nand gas, it is vital we keep them in operation. According to the Energy \nDepartment, between 1994 and 2003, we lost 110 million barrels of crude \noil due to plugged marginal wells. Thus, when we lose marginal wells, \nwe become more dependent upon foreign sources of energy, at a time when \nvirtually all agree that U.S. policies should encourage reliance upon \ndomestic sources. Furthermore, we lose domestic jobs to foreign \nnations.\n  My bill would allow independents the necessary capital to continue to \nproduce from these existing marginal wells--which is critical to the \nNation's overall energy security. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the sale, distribution, transfer, and \nexport of elemental mercury, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \nesteemed colleague from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, in introducing the \nMercury Market Minimization Act of 2007.\n  As most of us in this Chamber know, elemental mercury is a poisonous \nneurotoxin that can cause serious disability or death if ingested. \nUnfortunately, many people in the United States, and many millions more \nworldwide, do indeed ingest mercury--unintentionally, however, as a \nresult of industrial emissions or practices, or poor waste management \nand storage techniques. When mercury enters into the environment, it \noften shows up in plants and animals, and that means a major source of \nmercury ingestion for humans comes as a result of eating certain types \nof fish. That, in turn, causes serious developmental problems in half a \nmillion children in our country, and similar health problems in adults, \nespecially women at childbearing age.\n  Last year, an investigative report published in the Chicago Tribune \noutlined the extent of mercury contamination in fish. After concluding \nthat the fish sampling efforts conducted by the Federal Government were \nlimited and outdated, the Tribune conducted its own sampling, and the \nresults showed surprisingly high levels of mercury concentrations in \nfreshwater and saltwater fish purchased by consumers in the Chicago \nregion--higher levels than had been documented by the Federal \nGovernment. Mercury was found in both freshwater and saltwater \nspecies--tuna, swordfish, orange roughy, and walleye, to name a few \nexamples. The Tribune also reported on how existing programs at the \nFood and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency \nhave failed to adequately test and evaluate mercury levels in fish.\n  For those of us who like fish, it causes us to pause when we first \nlearn of the range of species with high mercury levels. For pregnant \nwomen and other at-risk groups, however, this doesn't just cause pause, \nit creates serious concerns about health consequences. Meanwhile, \nexperts tell us that fish is an excellent source of critical nutrients \nand other compounds indispensable for good health. More of us should \neat more fish.\n  So the real long-term solution is not to eat less fish, or to \ncriticize those who commercially provide us with fish as food. It's not \nabout issuing advisories, or printing labels on tuna cans, or posting \nplacards at the supermarket, or creating inspection bureaucracies, or \ncollecting statistics. If we're serious about eliminating mercury from \nfish, we need to reduce mercury in the environment.\n  Half of mercury settles where it is emitted, and the other half gets \ntransported around the globe where we lose track of it, and it winds up \nin oceans, lakes, and rivers nowhere near mercury sources. From there, \nup it goes, through the food chain. If mercury is both local, and \nglobal, then the solution is not up to one state, or one nation, but up \nto all states and nations. The bill we introduce today was crafted \nbased on that premise.\n  The Mercury Market Minimization Act, or M3 Act, establishes a ban on \nU.S. exports of mercury by the year 2010. Such a ban, when coupled with \ngoal of the European Union to ban mercury exports by 2011, and the \ninsufficient capacity in the world's mercury mines to respond, will \nresult in a tightening of the global supply of commercially available \nelemental mercury in sufficient quantities that developing nations that \nstill use mercury will be compelled to switch to the affordable \nalternatives that are already widespread in industrialized nations.\n  The M3 Act also requires those Federal agencies that now hold mercury \nin stockpiles to keep that mercury. Right now, the Department of \nEnergy, and the Department of Defense, possess tons of mercury left \nover from various operations over the years. While it is the policy of \nthese agencies to keep this mercury--not to sell it, not to transfer \nit, not to release it from their possession--it is not the law. The M3 \nact codifies these policies. In December of 2006, it was widely \nunderstood that the Department of Energy was considering the sale of \nits mercury stockpiles. After various inquiries into the matter, the \nDepartment of Energy ultimately announced that it would not sell its \nstockpiles. That underscores why a prohibition of stockpile sales must \nbe enacted into law by the M3 act if we are to be assured that mercury \nremains safely stored, away from the environment, and not sold overseas \nto places where tracking and emissions and waste disposal laws may be \ninadequate.\n  Finally, the M3 Act calls for the creation of a committee to explore \nand make recommendations on the issues associated with the development \nof a permanent repository of mercury collected as a result of an export \nprohibition. Mercury is not like spent nuclear fuel, or other \nsubstances that may create community concerns, in that when mercury is \nstored in stainless steel containers in refrigeration, it remains \nbenign. Every community must be provided the opportunity to evaluate \nfor themselves if and when mercury is stored nearby in secure and \nstable storage. I do believe, however, that when mercury is safely and \npermanently stored, it means less microscopic mercury on one's dinner \nplate, less mercury in our kids' tuna fish sandwiches, and less mercury \nin the air we breathe.\n  Last month, a United States delegation, led by the State Department, \nparticipated in an international meeting in Kenya, sponsored by the \nUnited Nations Environmental Programme, where world representative \ndiscussed how to reduce mercury pollution. Two years ago, the U.S. \nGovernment could have taken a bolder stance, and did not. This time, \nwith the decision of the E.U. to ban mercury exports, the United States \nhad an opportunity to partner with its allies to eliminate a major part \nof worldwide elemental mercury contamination. Again, the State \nDepartment did not.\n  It is not often that policy options, such as this, might be \nconsidered ``low-hanging fruit''--in that a small act of international \nleadership by the United States government could have far reaching \nbenefits for the health of our kids, as well as millions of low-income \nhardworking artisanal gold miners whom we will never meet. But the \nUnited States, so far, has not acted. This bill, the M3 bill, is \ndesigned to change that course and the mark the beginning of the end of \na global market of an outdated and obsolete poison. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this bill, and I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 906\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Market Minimization \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to \n     humans, ecosystems, and wildlife;\n       (2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of \n     childbearing age have mercury in the blood at a level that \n     could put a baby at risk;\n       (3) as many as 630,000 children born annually in the United \n     States are at risk of neurological problems related to \n     mercury;\n       (4) the most significant source of mercury exposure to \n     people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-\n     contaminated fish;\n       (5) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, as of \n     2004--\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\n       (A) 44 States have fish advisories covering over 13,000,000 \n     lake acres and over 750,000 river miles;\n       (B) in 21 States the freshwater advisories are statewide; \n     and\n       (C) in 12 States the coastal advisories are statewide;\n       (6) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to \n     minimize global mercury use and releases to eventually \n     achieve reduced contamination levels in the environment, \n     rather than reducing fish consumption since uncontaminated \n     fish represents a critical and healthy source of nutrition \n     worldwide;\n       (7) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant, \n     depositing locally, regionally, and globally, and affecting \n     water bodies near industrial sources (including the Great \n     Lakes) and remote areas (including the Arctic Circle);\n       (8) the free trade of mercury and mercury compounds on the \n     world market, at relatively low prices and in ready supply, \n     encourages the continued use of mercury outside of the United \n     States, often involving highly dispersive activities such as \n     artisinal gold mining;\n       (9) the intentional use of mercury is declining in the \n     United States as a consequence of process changes to \n     manufactured products (including batteries, paints, switches, \n     and measuring devices), but those uses remain substantial in \n     the developing world where releases from the products are \n     extremely likely due to the limited pollution control and \n     waste management infrastructures in those countries;\n       (10) the member countries of the European Union \n     collectively are the largest source of mercury exports \n     globally;\n       (11) the European Union is in the process of enacting \n     legislation that will prohibit mercury exports by not later \n     than 2011;\n       (12) the United States is a net exporter of mercury and, \n     according to the United States Geologic Survey, exported 506 \n     metric tons of mercury more than the United States imported \n     during the period of 2000 through 2004; and\n       (13) banning exports of mercury from the United States will \n     have a notable affect on the market availability of mercury \n     and switching to affordable mercury alternatives in the \n     developing world.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish an Advisory Committee on Gestational \nDiabetes, to provide grants to better understand and reduce gestational \ndiabetes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nGestational Diabetes Act of 2007 with my colleague Senator Collins, to \nbring attention to an important health issue facing women and children.\n  I don't need to tell anyone that we have an obesity epidemic in the \nUnited States. Many of us realize that as parents, it is our \nresponsibility to pass on good nutritional habits to our children. But \nmany women may not realize that watching what you eat, exercising \nregularly, and having control of your blood sugar levels are serious \nhealth considerations during pregnancy. In fact, these factors are \nserious enough that they can affect both the health of the mother and \nthe life of the child into adulthood.\n  More women than ever are entering their pregnancies overweight but \nwithout an understanding of how their own weight and nutritional habits \ncan trigger gestational diabetes--a type of diabetes that only occurs \nduring pregnancy. Women who are overweight before pregnancy are not \nonly at greater risk of having gestational diabetes but are also more \nlikely to have a c-section and are at an increased risk for other \nserious pregnancy complications.\n  In New York, gestational diabetes is on the rise. In New York City \nalone, gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in about 10 \nyears. This means that gestational diabetes affects 1 in 25 women, \nabout 400 women per month. But across the Nation, between 4 and 8 \npercent of pregnant women in the United States are affected by \ngestational diabetes. Infants of women who have gestational diabetes \nare at increased risk for obesity and developing type 2 diabetes as \nadolescents or adults.\n  As women, we need to pay attention to our health. We are always \nworrying about the health of our children, our husbands, and our \nparents, but we often forget to take care of ourselves.\n  Today, I am introducing the Gestational Diabetes Act, also known as \nthe GEDI Act. This legislation will increase our understanding of \ngestational diabetes by determining the factors that contribute to this \ncondition and help mothers who had gestational diabetes reduce their \nrisk of developing type 2 diabetes post-pregnancy.\n  The GEDI Act will provide funding for projects to assist health care \nproviders, as well as for communities to find ways to reach out to \nwomen so that they understand how their own good health during \npregnancy can decrease serious health risks for their children.\n  The GEDI Act would expand research to determine and develop \ninterventions to lower the incidence of gestational diabetes. We need \nto alert women to the risk before this condition becomes an epidemic \nand, as we have seen so many times before, education is critical.\n  We should be doing everything we can to address the impact of obesity \nduring pregnancy and to reduce the prevalence of gestational diabetes \nin pregnant women. The GEDI Act is an important step in assuring that \nwomen understand this critical issue and that we fully understand how \nto equip pregnant women to make the best choices for their health.\n  The GEDI Act is supported by the American Diabetes Association, \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Research \nCenter for Women & Families, International Community Health Services, \nAmerican Association of Diabetes Educators, and the American \nAssociation of Colleges of Pharmacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 909. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States, at their option, to require certain individuals to \npresent satisfactory documentary evidence of proof of citizenship or \nnationality for purposes of eligibility for Medicaid, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nis designed to make several very important changes to current law to \nensure that U.S. citizens receive the Medicaid to which they are \nentitled.\n  Since July 1, 2006, most U.S. citizens and nationals applying for or \nrenewing their Medicaid coverage face a new Federal requirement to \nprovide documentation of their citizenship status. Recent reports \nindicate that tens-of-thousands of U.S. citizens, and in particular \nchildren, inappropriately are being denied Medicaid benefits simply \nbecause they don't have access to newly required documentation. The \narticles below and report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nhighlight this very serious problem. Hospitals, physicians, and \npharmacies may not be willing to treat these individuals until they \nhave a source of payment, but they cannot qualify for Medicaid until \nthey produce a birth certificate and ID.\n  This new Federal requirement was added to Medicaid by the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, DRA, enacted February 8, 2006. The Tax Relief \nand Health Care Act of 2006, TRHCA, signed into law December 20, 2006, \nincluded some amendments to the DRA citizenship documentation \nrequirement, primarily to exempt certain groups. Prior to enactment of \nthe DRA, States were permitted to use their discretion in requiring \nsuch citizenship documentation.\n  Under Section 6036 of the DRA, citizens applying for or renewing \ntheir Medicaid coverage must provide ``satisfactory documentary \nevidence of citizenship or nationality.'' The DRA specifies documents \nthat are acceptable for this purpose and authorizes the HHS Secretary \nto designate additional acceptable documents. No Federal matching funds \nare available for services provided to individuals who declare they are \ncitizens or nationals unless the State obtains satisfactory evidence of \ntheir citizenship or determines that they are subject to a statutory \nexemption.\n  It is important to note that citizenship documentation requirements \ndo not affect Medicaid rules relating to immigrants--they apply to \nindividuals claiming to be citizens. Most new legal immigrants are \nexcluded from Medicaid during their first 5 years in the U.S. and \nundocumented immigrants remain eligible for Medicaid emergency services \nonly.\n  The legislation I am introducing would make several very important \nchanges to current law to ensure that U.S. citizens receive the \nMedicaid to which they are entitled.\n  First, the legislation would restore citizenship verification to a \nState option. Specifically, States would be permitted to determine when \nand to what extent citizenship verification is required of U.S. \nCitizens. States would also be permitted to utilize the standards most \nappropriate to the their population as long as such standards were no \nmore stringent than those currently used by the Social Security \nAdministration and includes native American tribal documents when \nappropriate.\n  Second, the legislation would ensure that individuals are afforded a \nreasonable time period to provide citizenship documentation utilizing \nthe same reasonable time period standard that is available to legal \nimmigrants to provide satisfactory evidence of their immigration \nstatus.\n  Third the legislation protects children who are U.S. citizens by \nvirtue of being born in the United States from being denied coverage \nafter birth because of citizenship verification requirements.\n  Fourth, the legislation also clarifies ambiguities in federal law to \nensure that these citizen children, regardless of the immigration \nstatus of their parents, are treated like all other low-income children \nborn in the United States and are deemed eligible to receive Medicaid \nservices for one year.\n  Finally, the legislation also ensures that the thousands of citizen \nchildren and adults, who were erroneously denied Medicaid coverage, may \nreceive\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nretroactive Medicaid eligibility for coverage they were inappropriately \ndenied because of citizenship verification requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this critical \nlegislation, which protects low-income U.S. citizens from being \ninappropriately denied Medicaid coverage because of lack of \ndocumentation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and supporting \ndocumentation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Kathleen Sebelius said \n     Wednesday.\n       Sebelius said she's worried the state will have to pick up \n     the full cost of caring for some poor, frail and elderly \n     Kansans who are living in nursing homes, instead of sharing \n     the cost with the federal government. Also, she said, she \n     will propose adding state employees to verify the citizenship \n     status of Medicaid recipients and applicants.\n       The governor told reporters she hopes Congress reviews the \n     issue and other attempts to prevent illegal immigrants from \n     obtaining social services or using driver's licenses as \n     identification.\n       ``There was no input from the states on how realistic these \n     were or what the cost was,'' Sebelius said during a brief \n     news conference following an unrelated meeting.\n       Under Medicaid requirements that took effect July 1, \n     recipients must provide either a passport or two other \n     documents, such as a birth certificate and a driver's \n     license, to verify citizenship.\n       While the measure is targeted at illegal immigrants, some \n     advocates for the needy have worried that citizens will \n     either lose or be denied services because they have trouble \n     finding the necessary documents.\n       State officials say the number of Kansans covered by \n     Medicaid dropped almost 7 percent since July 1, down to \n     253,000 from 271,000. They believe much of the decline can be \n     attributed to the new requirements.\n       Typically, every $1 the state spends on Medicaid is matched \n     by about $1.50 from the federal government. If someone loses \n     their coverage, then the state faces paying the entire bill \n     for their services, Sebelius said.\n       ``You're at 100 percent state dollars or push them out the \n     door,'' she said.\n       Also, Sebelius said, the state needs to ``ramp up'' its \n     staffing to handle the additional verification work. The \n     governor is working on the budget proposal she'll submit to \n     the 2007 Legislature, which convenes Jan. 8.\n       ``We're certainly going to put some of them in place,'' she \n     said. ``We're trying to make a careful analysis of how many \n     we need.''\n       She said that if the state refuses to comply with the law, \n     it could face the loss of all federal health care dollars.\n       ``We don't have a lot of latitude to say we're not going to \n     do this,'' she said. ``There are literally hundreds of \n     millions of dollars at stake.''\n       Meanwhile, Sebelius expressed concern about a federal law \n     on driver's licenses passed last year.\n       Starting in 2008, federal agencies won't treat a state's \n     licenses as valid ID unless a state requires license \n     applicants to document that they're living in the United \n     States legally. Lack of ID could prevent someone from \n     entering a federal building or boarding a plane.\n       Sebelius said the law will require local driver's licenses \n     offices to certify that someone has the proper documentation \n     and to store the information.\n       ``Exactly how that's going to happen, we're not quite \n     sure,'' Sebelius said. ``We don't basically have any of the \n     equipment that's required to do that in any of the rural \n     areas.''\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n               [From the Associated Press, Nov. 29, 2006]\n\n    KS: Thousands In Kansas Off Medicaid Following Citizenship Rules\n\n       Thousands of low-income Kansans have lost or been denied \n     state health care coverage because of new rules requiring \n     them to prove they are American citizens, state officials \n     say.\n       Since the federally mandated rules took effect July 1, the \n     number of Medicaid recipients in Kansas has decreased by \n     about 18,000, to 253,000. While officials can't determine \n     exactly how much of the 7 percent drop can be attributed to \n     the new rules, they believe much of it can.\n       ``The impact to the consumer has been severe,'' said John \n     Anzivino, a vice president for MAXIMUS, a Reston, Va., \n     company that helps administer the joint federal-state \n     Medicaid program in Kansas. ``From our perspective, this has \n     possibly been the most dramatic change and challenge to the \n     Medicaid program since its inception.''\n       The new rules were included in last year's federal deficit \n     reduction law and were designed to prevent illegal immigrants \n     from enrolling in the state programs providing health \n     coverage.\n       But consumer advocates said many vulnerable people who \n     legitimately were eligible for assistance would lose coverage \n     because they couldn't produce the necessary documentation.\n       ``We expect that many of these that have lost coverage will \n     regain coverage once they have gathered and provided the \n     necessary documentation,'' Marcia Nielsen, executive director \n     of the Kansas Health Policy Authority, told the Lawrence \n     Journal-World. ``They will, however, experience a gap in \n     coverage that could prove to be significant for some.''\n       Medicaid applicants can prove their citizenship by \n     providing a passport. Or they can provide other documents \n     that verify both their citizenship, such as a birth \n     certificate, and their identities, such as a driver's \n     license.\n       Anzivino said most people seeking benefits don't have a \n     passport and are left scrambling to find birth certificates \n     and other documents.\n       The number of calls each month to a Kansas Medicaid \n     clearinghouse has more than doubled to 49,000 from 23,000, \n     official said.\n       Meanwhile, Rep. Dennis Moore, a Democrat whose district is \n     centered on the state's portion of the Kansas City area, said \n     federal officials were aware of states' problems with the new \n     rules and probably would work on it when the new Congress \n     takes office in January.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 22, 2007]\n\n  MD: Medicaid Called Harder for Poor; Health Advocates Fear Document \n                   Rules Cause Many To Lose Coverage\n\n                         (By Kelly Brewington)\n\n       Public health advocates fear that a new federal regulation \n     requiring Medicaid applicants to supply proof of identity and \n     citizenship has resulted in thousands of poor Marylanders \n     losing their health insurance.\n       The requirement, part of the federal Deficit Reduction Act \n     that went into effect in Maryland in September, was designed \n     to prevent illegal immigrants from fraudulently receiving \n     Medicaid, the nation's premier health insurance program for \n     the poor.\n       But advocates and health officers in some Maryland counties \n     insist the rule has burdened citizens who need health care \n     the most and is likely responsible for thousands of \n     Marylanders being kicked off the Medicaid rolls.\n       ``It's a completely unnecessary law and Congress made a big \n     mistake in passing it,'' said Laurie Norris, an attorney with \n     the Public Justice Center. ``The people who are on Medicaid \n     in Maryland are supposed to be on Medicaid.``\n       The announcement of the regulations last June sparked an \n     uproar among advocates and state health officials, who were \n     given a July 1 deadline to enforce the mandate or risk losing \n     federal funding. The officials complained they were not given \n     enough time to train staff and inform Maryland's \n     approximately 650,000 affected Medicaid recipients that they \n     must furnish such identification as birth certificates, \n     driver's licenses and passports.\n       Nationwide, advocates feared huge enrollment declines, \n     saying many of Medicaid's neediest recipients don't possess \n     the necessary documents and would have to struggle to come up \n     with the money to obtain them. Maryland, for instance, does \n     not automatically issue birth certificates, which may be \n     ordered for $12.\n       Last summer, the federal government exempted from the \n     requirement elderly and disabled Medicaid recipients who \n     receive Supplemental Security Income from Social Security, \n     and last month it extended the exemption to foster children. \n     Still, states such as Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin and New \n     Hampshire noted plunging Medicaid enrollment figures and \n     backlogs related to the regulation, according to a report \n     released earlier this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation's \n     Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. In Virginia, 12,000 \n     children have been dropped from Medicaid rolls in the \n     requirement's first four months of implementation, the report \n     stated.\n       In Maryland, Medicaid enrollment numbers are down overall, \n     but state health officials say they are unsure whether the \n     drop is due to the new rule, a point that has frustrated \n     county health officers eager for evidence of the regulation's \n     impact that they could use to push for change.\n       From August through December 2006, the state Department of \n     Health and Mental Hygiene recorded about 6,000 fewer Medicaid \n     enrollees statewide compared with the same period in 2005. \n     Maryland officials say the enrollment computer system is not \n     configured to determine the exact cause of the decline.\n       ``It is imperative that the state disclose data to \n     demonstrate the impact of this law,'' said Dr. Joshua \n     Sharfstein, Baltimore health commissioner. ``There are \n     warning signs that a major erosion in health coverage could \n     be happening as a result of this new law. This is really \n     concerning. . . .''\n       Charles Lehman, who oversees eligibility issues in the \n     state's Medicaid office, said the agency has concentrated its \n     limited resources on ``keeping people on Medicaid rather than \n     tracking the people going off.''\n       ``It may not sound like we are doing everything we can, but \n     really, we are, with the resources we have,'' he said. ``It's \n     not just the clients, not just the caseworkers, everyone has \n     been impacted by this.''\n       Officials said while applicants are typically allowed a 30-\n     day grace period, caseworkers will not discontinue the \n     insurance if applicants are ``making a good-faith effort'' to \n     obtain the documents.\n       ``I think we have done a good job applying the law \n     appropriately but not in a way that arbitrarily cuts people \n     off,'' said Lehman. ``We have made our best effort to keep \n     people on.''\n       The department has spent $1 million for a toll-free number \n     to help applicants, 866-676-5880.\n       The state health department has also partnered with other \n     state databases to verify the citizenship and identity of \n     beneficiaries, without requiring recipients to hand over \n     documents. In July, the agency searched birth certificate \n     records for about 600,000 Medicaid enrollees at the cost of \n     $12 per search, said Lehman.\n       But the effort has not gone as smoothly as hoped, said \n     Norris, with the Public Justice Center. For instance, the \n     databases are not automatically synched--staff must print out \n     the information and check it by hand.\n       ``The state has been severely hampered in information \n     technology,'' she said.\n       Norris alerted state lawmakers to the problem at a briefing \n     in Annapolis last week. The problems come during a push by \n     advocates and some lawmakers and business groups to expand \n     Medicaid and help about 780,000 uninsured Marylanders.\n       Officials with local agencies have increased outreach and \n     said they have allowed people extra time to provide the \n     documents they need.\n       Nevertheless, in Anne Arundel County, for example, denial \n     rates for the state's Medicaid program for pregnant women and \n     children have jumped from an average of 18 percent from June \n     through December 2005 to 42 percent for the same period in \n     2006.\n       ``It's really shocking,'' said Frances Phillips, the \n     county's health officer. ``This is so serious because the \n     people we are talking about are either children with no \n     insurance and no way to access health care, or pregnant \n     women.''\n       Many applicants eventually produce the documents and get \n     back on Medicaid, Phillips noted. But for vulnerable \n     populations, any discontinuation in coverage can be harmful, \n     she said.\n       A health department program in which nurses make home \n     visits to women with at-risk pregnancies has focused on \n     educating women on the documentation. ``We just feel that \n     this is so critical,'' said Phillips. `` . . . We touch base \n     with the women, find out what is going on with them and make \n     sure they get insurance.''\n       In Baltimore, outreach workers with Baltimore HealthCare \n     Access Inc., which assists some of the city's estimated \n     200,000 Medicaid enrollees, are making home visits and \n     contacting state agencies on applicants' behalf.\n       The agency received $5,000 from the Abell Foundation to \n     help applicants cover the cost of documents.\n       ``We are plowing away that money pretty quickly,'' said \n     Kathleen Westcoat, the organization's president.\n       The funding helped Brenda Kent, 36, pay for her birth \n     certificate last month. She lost her wallet two months before \n     she was due to apply for Medicaid benefits for herself, her \n     twin sons and a daughter.\n       ``I didn't know how I was supposed to get it,'' said Kent, \n     who does not work. ``If they didn't help me with the cost, it \n     would have taken me longer to do it.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Sept. 1, 2006]\n\n        NC: U.S. Citizenship Proof Required for Medicaid in N.C.\n\n       A requirement that Medicaid recipients in North Carolina \n     prove they hold U.S. citizenship probably won't uncover a \n     large amount of fraud, a state official says.\n       Starting Sept. 1, new Medicaid applicants and nearly every \n     current beneficiary must provide documentation of their \n     citizenship as part of a new federal law designed to prevent \n     illegal immigrants from receiving the health care coverage.\n       ``I would be very surprised if we had a problem in our \n     state with any large number of people receiving benefits who \n     were not entitled to receive them,'' said Mark Benton, senior \n     deputy director for the state Division of Medical Assistance.\n       The law was to have taken effect nationwide July 1, but \n     North Carolina delayed its start while it prepared for the \n     changes.\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\n       Under the old rules, social services workers were supposed \n     to ask applicants about their citizenship status.

Beginning July 1, state \n     officials say, an unprecedented slide began.\n       Over the following five months, about 12,000 children \n     dropped off the state's Medicaid rolls.\n       ``An entire year's growth has been wiped out,'' said \n     Cynthia Jones, chief deputy director for the state's \n     Department of Medical Assistance Services.\n       The drop-off, Jones points out, began about the time a new \n     federal law took effect. The law states that U.S. citizens \n     applying for Medicaid or renewing their participation must \n     present proof of their citizenship and identity. The law \n     emerged out of concern that illegal immigrants were obtaining \n     access to health insurance coverage sponsored by the \n     government.\n       But some officials say that's not who is losing coverage.\n       Besides Virginia, some other states are also reporting \n     declines in children enrolled in Medicaid or a decline in \n     applications. They include Iowa, Louisiana, New Hampshire and \n     Wisconsin. Health researchers say they don't know if the \n     states are representative of a nationwide pattern.\n       The states singled out as experiencing enrollment declines \n     were included in a report issued Tuesday by the Kaiser Family \n     Foundation, which conducts health research, and by the Center \n     on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\n       The states experiencing declines are adamant that U.S. \n     citizens and certain legal immigrants are dropping off the \n     Medicaid rolls, not illegal immigrants.\n       ``There is no evidence that the decline is due to \n     undocumented aliens leaving the program,'' said Anita Smith \n     of the Iowa Department of Human Services. ``Rather, we \n     believe that these new requirements are keeping otherwise \n     eligible citizens from receiving Medicaid because they cannot \n     provide the documents required to prove their citizenship or \n     identity.''\n       Medicaid is a health insurance program serving about 55 \n     million people that is financed by the federal government and \n     the states. The declines cited would indicate that just a \n     fraction of the people enrolled in the program have dropped \n     out as a result of the documentation requirements, but they \n     do represent vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women \n     and children.\n       ``We've delayed coverage for those children, and if those \n     children need medical care, there's going to be ramifications \n     for them,'' said Donna Cohen Ross, outreach director for the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n       But the agency that oversees Medicaid questioned claims \n     that would link enrollment declines to the new documentation \n     requirements.\n       ``We believe we've given the states tools they need to both \n     implement the law and provide sufficient flexibility to \n     assist individuals in establishing their citizenship,'' said \n     Jeff Nelligan, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services. ``We continue to monitor state \n     implementation and are not aware of any data that shows there \n     are significant barriers to enrollment.\n       ``If states are experiencing difficulties, they should \n     bring them to our attention as we certainly want to \n     understand why they are not using the flexibilities we have \n     provided.''\n       After Congress passed the documentation requirements, \n     Medicaid officials released rules that established which \n     documents would suffice in meeting the law.\n       Primary evidence, namely a U.S. passport or a certificate \n     of U.S. citizenship, is considered the ideal. Secondary \n     evidence or lower-tier evidence must be accompanied by a \n     document showing identity. Such evidence includes birth \n     certificates, insurance records, and as a last resort, \n     written affidavits.\n       Original documents or copies certified by the issuing \n     agency are required by the regulation. Copies are not \n     acceptable. The federal government excluded millions of \n     seniors and disabled people from the new documentation \n     requirements. In December, Congress also approved an \n     exception for foster children.\n                                  ____\n\n\n New Medicaid Citizenship Documentation Requirement Is Taking a Toll: \n    States Report Enrollment Is Down and Administrative Costs Are Up\n\n                         (By Donna Cohen Ross)\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       A new federal law that states were required to implement \n     July 1 is creating a barrier to health-care coverage for U.S. \n     citizens--especially children--who are eligible for health \n     insurance through Medicaid. The new law, a provision of the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, requires U.S. citizens to \n     present proof of their citizenship and identity when they \n     apply for, or seek to renew, their Medicaid coverage. Prior \n     to enactment of the law, U.S. citizens applying for Medicaid \n     were permitted to attest to their citizenship, under penalty \n     of perjury.\n       In the six months following implementation of the new \n     requirement, states are beginning to report marked declines \n     in Medicaid enrollment, particularly among low-income \n     children. States also are reporting significant increases in \n     administrative costs as a consequence of the requirement.\n       This analysis presents the data available so far on this \n     matter. The available evidence strongly suggests that those \n     being adversely affected are primarily U.S. citizens \n     otherwise eligible for Medicaid who are encountering \n     difficulty in promptly securing documents such as birth \n     certificates and who are remaining uninsured for longer \n     periods of time as a result.\n       The new requirement also appears to be reversing part of \n     the progress that states made over the past decade in \n     streamlining access to Medicaid for individuals who qualify, \n     and especially for children. For example, to improve access \n     to Medicaid and reduce administrative costs, most states \n     implemented mail-in application procedures, and many states \n     reduced burdensome documentation requirements. The new \n     Medicaid citizenship documentation requirement now appears to \n     be pushing states in the opposite direction, by impeding \n     access to Medicaid. Families must furnish more documentation \n     and may be required to visit a Medicaid office in person to \n     apply or renew their coverage, bypassing simpler mail-in and \n     on-line enrollment opportunities, because they must present \n     original documents such as birth certificates that can take \n     time and money to obtain. This is likely to cause the most \n     difficulty for working-poor families that cannot afford to \n     take time off from work to visit the Medicaid office and for \n     low-income families residing in rural areas.\n       The new citizenship documentation requirement--which the \n     Bush Administration did not request and the Senate initially \n     did not adopt, but which the House of Representatives \n     insisted upon in conference--was presented by its proponents \n     as being necessary to stem a problem of undocumented \n     immigrants securing Medicaid by falsely declaring themselves \n     to be U.S. citizens. The new requirement was adopted despite \n     the lack of evidence that such a problem existed. In response \n     to a report in 2005 by the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, Mark McClellan, then \n     the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services at HHS, noted: ``The [Inspector General's] report \n     does not find particular problems regarding false allegations \n     of citizenship, nor are we aware of any.\n\n\nImpact of the Citizen Documentation Requirement on Medicaid Applicants \n                 and Beneficiaries: The Early Evidence\n\n       Medicaid enrollment figures for all states for the period \n     since the new requirement was implemented on July 1 are not \n     yet available. By contacting several individual states that \n     do have such data, however, we were able to secure enrollment \n     information from Wisconsin, Kansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Virginia \n     and New Hampshire. The data show the following:\n       All six states report a significant drop in enrollment \n     since implementation of the requirement began.\n       Medicaid officials in these states attribute the downward \n     trend primarily or entirely to the citizenship documentation \n     requirement.\n       Two types of problems are surfacing:\n       Medicaid is being denied or terminated because some \n     beneficiaries and applicants cannot produce the specified \n     documents despite, from all appearances, being U.S. citizens; \n     and\n       Medicaid eligibility determinations are being delayed, \n     resulting in large backlogs of applications, either because \n     it is taking time for applicants to obtain the required \n     documents or because eligibility workers are overloaded with \n     the new tasks and paperwork associated with administering the \n     new requirement.\n       Some states have designed mechanisms specifically to track \n     enrollment changes resulting from the new procedures. \n     Wisconsin, for example, has established computer codes to \n     distinguish when Medicaid eligibility is denied or \n     discontinued due to a lack of citizenship or identity \n     documents. In other states, a comparison of current and past \n     enrollment trends strongly suggests that the new requirement \n     is largely responsible for the enrollment decline. For \n     example, in many states aggressive ``back to school'' \n     outreach activities conducted in August and September usually \n     result in increased child enrollment in September and \n     October. In 2006, however, states such as Virginia and \n     Louisiana reported that child enrollment declined despite \n     vigorous promotional campaigns, indicating that the new \n     requirement undermined the value of the outreach efforts.\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n       The Medicaid enrollment declines identified in this memo do \n     not appear to be driven by broader economic trends or a \n     change in the employment of low-income families. If that were \n     the case, parallel enrollment decline trends would appear in \n     the Food Stamp Program, which is the means-tested program \n     whose enrollment levels are most responsive to such \n     developments. Instead, Food Stamp caseloads have been \n     increasing slightly in recent months. Moreover, each of the \n     states identified in this memo as having sustained a drop in \n     Medicaid enrollment saw its food stamp caseload rise during a \n     similar period.\n       Both Medicaid and the Food Stamp Program serve similar \n     populations of low-income families and are often administered \n     by the same agencies and caseworkers. A key difference is \n     that the citizenship documentation rules were applied to \n     Medicaid but there were no such changes in the Food Stamp \n     Program. It thus appears that the changes in Medicaid \n     enrollment are a result of changes in Medicaid policies--\n     particularly citizenship documentation--that do not affect \n     eligibility for food stamps.\n       The following states have documented declines in Medicaid \n     enrollment since the implementation of the Medicaid \n     citizenship documentation requirement:\n       Wisconsin: In five months--between August and December \n     2006--a total of 14,034 Medicaid-eligible individuals were \n     either denied Medicaid or lost coverage as a result of the \n     documentation requirement. The loss of Medicaid coverage \n     occurred despite Wisconsin's efforts to minimize the impact \n     of the requirement by obtaining birth records electronically \n     from the state's Vital Records agency. Obtaining proof of \n     identify, rather than proof of citizenship, was the major \n     problem for people in Wisconsin who were otherwise eligible \n     during this period: 69 percent of those who were denied \n     Medicaid or who lost Medicaid coverage due to the new \n     requirement did not have a required identity document, as \n     compared to 17 percent who did not provide the required \n     citizenship documents and 14 percent who were missing both a \n     citizenship and identity document. This indicates that most \n     of those who were denied were, in fact, U.S. citizens.\n       Kansas: The Kansas Health Policy Authority (KHPA) reports \n     that between 18,000 and 20,000 applicants and previous \n     beneficiaries, mostly children and parents, have been left \n     without health insurance since the citizenship documentation \n     requirement was implemented. About 16,000 of these \n     individuals are ``waiting to enroll'' or ``waiting to be re-\n     enrolled;'' the state says these eligibility determinations \n     are being delayed because of a large backlog of applications \n     related to the difficulties confronting individuals and \n     eligibility workers alike who are attempting to comply with \n     the new rule. Documents on the KHPA website state that the \n     ``majority of  families with pending applications will \n     qualify for coverage under the new requirements when we \n     are able to complete processing.'' In the meantime, these \n     children and parents are barred from getting the health \n     coverage for which they qualify and are, in most cases, \n     uninsured.\n       Iowa: Iowa has identified an unprecedented decline in \n     Medicaid enrollment that state officials attribute to the \n     Medicaid citizenship documentation requirement. Prior to July \n     1, 2006, overall Medicaid enrollment had steadily increased \n     for the past several years. While sporadic declines occurred \n     in rural counties, no county in the state's larger population \n     centers experienced a decline in the months leading up to the \n     implementation of the new requirement. However, between July \n     and September 2006, Medicaid enrollment sustained the largest \n     decrease in the past five years; this also was the first time \n     in five years that the state has experienced an enrollment \n     decline for three consecutive months.\n       Although other factors may contribute to the recent \n     decrease in enrollment, state officials point out the state \n     is now experiencing a more severe effect on enrollment than \n     it has following any of the Medicaid changes that have \n     occurred over the past several years. The state's conclusion \n     that the citizenship documentation requirement is driving the \n     decline is supported by the fact that enrollment has dropped \n     among the populations subject to the requirement (children \n     and families) but has remained steady among groups not \n     affected by the requirement (individuals receiving Medicare \n     and SSI).\n       Louisiana: In two months--September and October of 2006--\n     Louisiana experienced a net loss of more than 7,500 children \n     in its Medicaid program despite a vigorous back-to-school \n     outreach effort and a significant increase in applications \n     during the month of September.\n       According to state officials, the enrollment decline is not \n     driven by population loss from Hurricane Katrina and \n     contrasts dramatically with enrollment spikes that usually \n     occur in September and have reached up to 13,000 in the past. \n     The reason for the drop-off is two-fold, according to the \n     state: for some people, Medicaid is being denied or \n     terminated because they have not presented the required \n     citizenship or identity documents. In addition, the \n     additional workload generated by the new requirement is \n     diverting the time and effort eligibility workers normally \n     would spend on activities to ensure that Medicaid \n     beneficiaries do not lose coverage at renewal.\n       Virginia: Since July, enrollment of children in the state's \n     Medicaid program has declined steadily each month. By the end \n     of November, the total net decline stood at close to 12,000 \n     children. During the same period, enrollment of children in \n     the state's separate SCHIP program, not subject to the new \n     requirement, increased. Virginia also reported a substantial \n     backlog in application processing at its central processing \n     site, with 2,600 cases pending approval for Medicaid in \n     September, when normally no more than 50 such cases are \n     pending at the end of a month.\n       After the plunge in children's Medicaid enrollment over \n     several months, a small increase occurred in December 2006 \n     (although Medicaid enrollment for children then began \n     dropping again in January). State officials say the December \n     ``up-tick'' suggests that some families are finally ``getting \n     over the hurdles'' imposed by the new law and children (who \n     were eligible at the time they applied but lacked the \n     required documentation) are getting health coverage after a \n     significant delay during which they were without coverage.\n       New Hampshire: Data from the New Hampshire Healthy Kids \n     Program, a private organization that processes mail-in \n     applications for the state's Medicaid and SCHIP programs, \n     indicate that the percentage of applications submitted with \n     all necessary documents in September of this year dropped by \n     almost half compared to the percentage of complete \n     applications submitted in September 2005. If applicants do \n     not supply missing documentation within 28 days, New \n     Hampshire closes the application. The percentage of \n     applications closed due to missing documents has also \n     increased significantly: from around 10 percent of \n     applications before the new requirement to 20 percent in \n     August 2006. In addition, New Hampshire Healthy Kids reports \n     that between June 2006 and September 2006, enrollment \n     of children in Medicaid dropped by 1,275.\n\n\n                  Impact on State Administrative Costs\n\n       Data on state Medicaid administrative costs for the months \n     since July 1 are not available from CMS or any other national \n     source. Several states, however, have examined the impact of \n     the new Medicaid citizenship documentation requirement on \n     their administrative expenditures. Their findings are as \n     follows:\n       Illinois: Illinois is projecting $16 million to $19 million \n     in increased staffing costs in the first year of \n     implementation of the requirement.\n       Arizona: The Arizona legislature has allocated $10 million \n     to implement the citizenship documentation requirement. This \n     included the costs associated with staffing, training and \n     payments for obtaining birth records.\n       Colorado: The FY07-08 budget request for the Colorado \n     Department of Health Care Policy and Financing includes a \n     request for an additional $2.8 million for county \n     administration costs. This request is based on an assumption \n     by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that \n     it will take an additional 5 minutes per application for a \n     caseworker to process citizenship and identity documents. The \n     Department stated in a Joint Budget Committee Hearing that \n     this amount ``may not be sufficient for Colorado counties and \n     special record storage needs.\n       Washington: Washington State is projecting additional costs \n     associated with hiring 19 additional FTEs in FY07 due to the \n     new requirement, and retaining seven of them in FY08 and \n     FY09. The state estimates that the costs will be $2.7 million \n     on FY07 and $450,000 in each of the succeeding two years.\n       Wisconsin: Wisconsin is expecting increased costs of $1.8 \n     million to cover the increased workload associated with \n     administering the requirement in FY07 and $600,000 to \n     $700,000 per year for the two years after that.\n       Minnesota: Minnesota is estimating that it will spend $1.3 \n     million in FY07 for new staff, birth record fees and other \n     administrative expenses.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Based on these findings and reports, and strong anecdotal \n     evidence, it seems increasingly clear that the new Medicaid \n     citizenship documentation requirement is having a negative \n     impact on Medicaid enrollment, especially among children. \n     Insufficient information is available to determine the \n     precise extent to which individuals whose Medicaid \n     eligibility has been delayed, denied or terminated are U.S. \n     citizens, eligible legal immigrants, or ineligible \n     immigrants. However, the fact that significant numbers of \n     individuals are being approved for Medicaid after delays of \n     many months, during which they were uninsured, demonstrates \n     that the requirement is adversely affecting substantial \n     numbers of U.S. citizens, especially children who are \n     citizens. Moreover, a large body of research conducted over a \n     number of years has conclusively shown that increasing \n     documentation and other administrative burdens generally \n     results in eligible individuals failing to obtain coverage as \n     a result of the enrollment and renewal processes having \n     become more complicated to understand and more difficult to \n     navigate. Regarding the Medicaid enrollment declines, Anita \n     Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Medical Supports for the Iowa \n     Department of Human Services, has stated: ``There is no \n     evidence that the [enrollment] decline is due to undocumented \n     aliens leaving the program. Rather, we believe that these new \n     requirements are keeping otherwise eligible citizens from \n     receiving Medicaid because they cannot provide the documents \n     required to prove their citizenship or identity.''\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\n       A number of governors across the nation are announcing \n     their intentions to push new initiatives to cover the \n     uninsured, particularly children. These proposals are being \n     designed to build upon existing public coverage programs, of \n     which Medicaid is the largest, and invariably these proposals \n     call for the enrollment of individuals who are currently \n     eligible for existing programs but remain uninsured. Success \n     will depend, in large measure, on policies and procedures \n     that facilitate rather than frustrate such efforts so that \n     eligible individuals can obtain the benefits for which they \n     qualify. The Medicaid citizenship documentation requirement, \n     which appears to be an extremely blunt instrument, stands to \n     undercut such efforts by placing a daunting administrative \n     obstacle in the way of many low-income U.S. citizens who \n     otherwise have shown that they qualify or by discouraging \n     potentially eligible citizens from applying because the \n     process appears too complex or intimidating. The requirement \n     also appears to be deflecting state human and financial \n     resources away from activities designed to reach eligible \n     children and families and to enroll them in the most \n     efficient and effective manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Biden, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. \n        Casey):\n  S. 910. A bill to provide for paid sick leave to ensure that \nAmericans can address their own health needs and the health needs of \ntheir families; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President day in and day out across America, \nmillions of men and women go to work in jobs that are the backbone of \nour economy. They make our country great and prosperous. They work hard \nto provide for their families and care for them.\n  Often, however, they have to miss days of work because of illness. \nEvery parent knows what it's like to care for a sick child, and every \nchild knows the importance of a parent taking care of them when they \nare ill. Yet, every day, countless Americans find their paychecks or \neven their jobs at risk when illness strikes.\n  As Members of Congress, we don't lose our pay or risk our jobs if we \nstay home because of illness. But millions of our fellow citizens are \nnot so fortunate.\n  Mr. President, 57 million Americans--nearly half of all private-\nsector workers in the United States--do not have paid sick days. \nSeventy percent don't have paid sick days they can use to care for \nfamily members. They can't take a day off to recover from the flu. They \ncan't leave work to care for a child who is running a fever.\n\n  Among workers in the lowest income quarter, the numbers are even \nworse--percent do not have the right to take time off for illness \nwithout losing their payor even their jobs.\n  This lack of protection is especially difficult for working women \nwith children. Women have moved into the workforce in record numbers, \nbut they continue to have primary responsibility for their children's \nhealth. Nearly 80 percent of mothers say they are solely responsible \nfor their children's medical care. Yet they can't take a day off to \ncare for a sick child.\n  If we truly care about families, we have to change those facts. \nAmericans want to be responsible employees and responsible parents. We \nneed workplace laws that allow workers the time needed to care for \nthemselves or family members when they are sick without losing payor \nrisking their jobs.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Healthy Families Act, to give \nAmerican workers up to seven paid days of sick leave a year. Now \nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro is introducing the legislation in the House \nof Representatives.\n  Earlier this week, she and I met with hundreds of workers and parents \nfrom around the country, representing tens of thousands of parents \nasking Congress to take action.\n  I am talking about hard-working people such as Bertha Brown, who \nspoke to hundreds of us in front of the Capitol. Bertha is a home \nhealthcare aide. She has spent her life caring for America's sick and \nelderly, yet she herself has no paid sick days to care for herself or \nher children. She told us how she had to leave her sick daughter at \nhome when she went to work.\n  Paid sick days aren't just a family issue--they are also a public \nhealth issue. When sick people go to work, they are likely to infect \ntheir coworkers and the public. Every day, we hear reports of stomach \nillnesses breaking out in restaurants or on cruise ships. We learn of \nflu outbreaks leading to hospitalization of the elderly. Such illnesses \nare contagious, but their spread can be minimized if sick people stay \nat home.\n  However, a high proportion of workers who have constant contact with \nthe public have no paid sick days--85 percent of food service workers \nand 55 percent of workers in the retail industry are denied that \nbenefit; 30 percent of health care workers can't take paid time off \nwhen they are ill.\n  That is why nurses and doctors support paid sick days. When our \nHealth Committee held a hearing on this issue last month, we heard from \npediatricians at Boston Children's Hospital and a public health expert \nin San Francisco about the significant health benefits and reduction of \nmedical costs that result from paid sick days. We all know that \npreventive care helps reduce medical costs. Giving people the \nopportunity to obtain medical treatment for illnesses or chronic \nmedical conditions before their conditions worsen is common sense.\n  Paid sick days also are important to help children stay healthy and \nin school so that they can learn. When sick children go to school, they \ndon't learn well, and they are likely to infect their fellow students.\n  We also heard this week from Carolyn Duff, a nurse in an elementary \nschool in South Carolina. She treated a fifth grader she suspected had \nstrep throat. His parents did not have paid sick days and could not \ntake him to the doctor. After 4 days, his condition worsened. He \ndeveloped scarlet fever and a rash covered his entire body--all because \nhis parents, for fear of losing their jobs, weren't able to take time \noff to care for him. As Carolyn Duff said, the child not only suffered \nwithout the care of his parents, he also lost 10 precious days of his \nstudies at school.\n  Paid sick days will result in significant savings to our economy and \nour health care system. That is why employers support paid sick days \ntoo. Dancing Deer Bakery--a small business Boston--sent me a letter \nmaking this important point:\n\n       A national paid sick days law creates a level playing field \n     for all businesses. . . . We hope that a bill will move \n     through both Chambers and be on the President's desk. Paid \n     sick days should be a non-partisan issue. A healthy nation is \n     a productive nation.\n\n  Paid sick days are good for families, good for our public health, and \ngood for our economy. Our people have waited long enough for this need \nto be met. It is time to pass the Healthy Families Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Families Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Working Americans need time to meet their own health \n     care needs and to care for family members, including their \n     children, spouse, parents, and parents-in-law, and other \n     children and adults for whom they are caretakers.\n       (2) Health care needs include preventive health care, \n     diagnostic procedures, medical treatment, and recovery in \n     response to short- and long-term illnesses and injuries.\n       (3) Providing employees time off to meet health care needs \n     ensures that they will be healthier in the long run. \n     Preventive care helps avoid illnesses and injuries and \n     routine medical care helps detect illnesses early and shorten \n     their duration.\n       (4) When parents are available to care for their children \n     who become sick, children recover faster, more serious \n     illnesses are prevented, and children's overall mental and \n     physical health improve. Parents who cannot afford to miss \n     work and must send children with a contagious illness to \n     child care or school contribute to the high rate of \n     infections in child care centers and schools.\n       (5) Providing paid sick leave improves public health by \n     reducing infectious disease. Policies that make it easier for \n     sick adults and children to be isolated at home reduce the \n     spread of infectious disease.\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\n       (6) Routine medical care reduces medical costs by detecting \n     and treating illness and injury early, decreasing the need \n     for emergency care. These savings benefit public and private \n     payers of health insurance, including private businesses.\n       (7) The provision of individual and family sick leave by \n     large and small businesses, both here in the United States \n     and elsewhere, demonstrates that policy solutions are both \n     feasible and affordable in a competitive economy. Measures \n     that ensure that employees are in good health and do not need \n     to worry about unmet family health problems help businesses \n     by promoting productivity and reducing employee turnover.\n       (8) The American Productivity Audit found that \n     presenteeism--the practice of employees coming to work \n     despite illness--costs $180,000,000,000 annually in lost \n     productivity. Studies in the Journal of Occupational and \n     Environmental Medicine, the Employee Benefit News, and the \n     Harvard Business Review show that presenteeism is a larger \n     productivity drain than either absenteeism or short-term \n     disability.\n       (9) The absence of paid sick leave has forced Americans to \n     make untenable choices between needed income and jobs on the \n     one hand and caring for their own and their family's health \n     on the other.\n       (10) Nearly half of Americans lack paid leave for self-care \n     or to care for a family member. For families in the lowest \n     quartile of earners, 79 percent lack paid sick leave. For \n     families in the next 2 quartiles, 46 and 38 percent, \n     respectively, lack paid sick leave. Even for families in the \n     highest income quartile, 28 percent lack paid sick leave. In \n     addition, millions of workers cannot use paid sick leave to \n     care for ill family members.\n       (11) Due to the roles of men and women in society, the \n     primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on \n     women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of \n     women more than it affects the working lives of men.\n       (12) An increasing number of men are also taking on \n     caretaking obligations, and men who request leave time for \n     caretaking purposes are often denied accommodation or \n     penalized because of stereotypes that caretaking is only \n     ``women's work''.\n       (13) Employers' reliance on persistent stereotypes about \n     the ``proper'' roles of both men and women in the workplace \n     and in the home continues a cycle of discrimination and \n     fosters stereotypical views about women's commitment to work \n     and their value as employees.\n       (14) Employment standards that apply to only one gender \n     have serious potential for encouraging employers to \n     discriminate against employees and applicants for employment \n     who are of that gender.\n       (15) It is in the national interest to ensure that all \n     Americans can care for their own health and the health of \n     their families while prospering at work.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that all working Americans can address their \n     own health needs and the health needs of their families by \n     requiring employers to provide a minimum level of paid sick \n     leave including leave for family care;\n       (2) to diminish public and private health care costs by \n     enabling workers to seek early and routine medical care for \n     themselves and their family members;\n       (3) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) in a manner that is feasible for employers; and\n       (4) consistent with the provision of the 14th amendment to \n     the Constitution relating to equal protection of the laws, \n     and pursuant to Congress' power to enforce that provision \n     under section 5 of that amendment--\n       (A) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) in a manner that minimizes the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring \n     generally that leave is available for eligible medical \n     reasons on a gender-neutral basis; and\n       (B) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for \n     women and men.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 108\n\n       Whereas there is no known safe level of exposure to \n     asbestos;\n       Whereas deadly asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot be \n     smelled or tasted;\n       Whereas when a person inhales or swallows airborne asbestos \n     fibers, the damage is permanent and irreversible;\n       Whereas these fibers can cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, \n     lung cancer, and pleural diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years \n     to present themselves;\n       Whereas the expected survival rate of individuals diagnosed \n     with mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;\n       Whereas little is known about late-stage treatment and \n     there is no cure for asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases would \n     give patients increased treatment options and often improve \n     their prognoses;\n       Whereas asbestos is a toxic and dangerous substance and \n     must be disposed of properly;\n       Whereas, in 1977, the International Agency for Research on \n     Cancer classified asbestos as a Category 1 human carcinogen, \n     the highest cancer hazard classification for a substance;\n       Whereas, in 2002, the United States Geological Survey \n     reported that companies in the United States consumed 9,000 \n     metric tons of asbestos, of which approximately 71 percent \n     was consumed in roofing products, 18 percent in gaskets, 5 \n     percent in friction products, and 6 percent in other \n     products;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the World Health Organization issued a \n     policy paper, and the International Labour Organization \n     adopted a resolution, agreeing that all forms of asbestos\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\n     are classified as human carcinogens, no threshold for \n     ``safe'' exposure exists, and the elimination of asbestos use \n     is essential to stop the global epidemic of asbestos-related \n     diseases;\n       Whereas nearly half of the more than 1,000 screened \n     firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, and volunteers \n     who responded to the World Trade Center attacks on September \n     11, 2001, have new and persistent respiratory problems;\n       Whereas the industry groups with the highest incidence \n     rates of asbestos-related diseases, based on 2000 to 2002 \n     figures, were shipyard workers, builders of vehicle bodies \n     (including rail vehicles), pipefitters, carpenters and \n     electricians, construction workers (including insulation and \n     stripping workers), extraction workers, energy and water \n     supply workers, and manufacturing workers;\n       Whereas the United States has substantially reduced its \n     consumption of asbestos, yet continues to consume almost \n     2,000 metric tons of the fibrous mineral for use in certain \n     products throughout the Nation;\n       Whereas asbestos exposures continue, but attention to \n     safety and prevention has reduced significantly and will \n     continue to reduce asbestos exposures and asbestos-related \n     diseases;\n       Whereas the United States continues to import over \n     $100,000,000 worth of asbestos products annually, such as \n     brake pads and linings, cement pipe, floor tiles, and other \n     asbestos products from other countries for use throughout the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases kill 10,000 people in the \n     United States each year, and the numbers are increasing;\n       Whereas people in the small community of Libby, Montana, \n     have asbestos-related diseases at a rate 40 to 60 times the \n     national average, and suffer from mesothelioma at a rate 100 \n     times the national average;\n       Whereas asbestos exposure is responsible for 1 in every 125 \n     deaths of men over the age of 50;\n       Whereas asbestos has been the largest single cause of \n     occupational cancer;\n       Whereas asbestos is still a hazard for 1,300,000 workers in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas asbestos-related deaths have increased greatly in \n     the last 20 years and are expected to continue to increase;\n       Whereas 30 percent of all victims of asbestos-related \n     diseases were exposed to asbestos on naval ships and in \n     shipyards;\n       Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of virtually \n     all office buildings, public schools, and homes built before \n     1975;\n       Whereas safety and prevention will reduce asbestos exposure \n     and asbestos-related diseases; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Asbestos Awareness \n     Week'' would raise public awareness about the prevalence of \n     asbestos-related diseases and the dangers of asbestos \n     exposure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first week of April 2007 as ``National \n     Asbestos Awareness Week'';\n       (2) urges the Surgeon General, as a public health issue, to \n     warn and educate people that asbestos exposure may be \n     hazardous to their health; and\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Surgeon General.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution \nintroduced by Senator Baucus to designate the first week of April 2007 \nas ``National Asbestos Awareness Week.'' It is my hope this resolution \nwill raise public awareness of this dreadful substance and the pain and \nsuffering that it has caused. It is also a reminder of our \nresponsibility to the victims of asbestos in Nevada, in Libby, MT, and \nall over America.\n  We know too well that the effect of exposure can be deadly. Diseases \ncaused by asbestos include cancers of the lung, digestive tract, colon, \nlarynx, esophagus, kidney and some types of lymphoma; pleural disease; \nasbesostis; and, of course, mesothelioma. These devastating illnesses \ntake the lives of 30 Americans each day and as many as 10,000 Americans \neach year.\n  According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, \n1.3 million Americans still face significant asbestos exposure in their \nworkplaces. However, the danger is not confined to the Nation's \nshipyards, mines, or construction sites. Countless others are exposed \nin their neighborhoods, in schoolyards and at home; mothers and \nchildren who would otherwise have no clue that their very health is in \njeopardy from this poisonous substance.\n  The cases of disease and death caused by asbestos exposure are not \nabstractions. Real lives are affected and destroyed by this dreadful \nsubstance. I have received countless letters from victims of asbestos-\nrelated diseases and their families. Each one shares another story of \nloss and of pain, of sickness and of tragedy.\n  James Baxter, a retired railroad worker from Carson City, NV, suffers \nfrom lung damage and respiratory problems. Richard Strauss from Las \nVegas, NV, lost his father 3 years ago from asbestos exposure. Like \nmany others, these two men contacted me seeking help in dealing with \nthe hardship and tragedy they have endured.\n  Margy Urnberg from Carson City, NV, had a father, Ronald Johnson, who \ndied from asbestos exposure. He worked in a vermiculite mine and \nreceived secondhand exposure from living in Libby, MT. Connie Peck-\nYouso was born and raised in Libby, MT. Although she never worked in a \nmine, she bares the scarring in her lungs from the same type of \nsecondhand exposure that had such terrible consequences for Mr. \nJohnson.\n  Alan Reinstein, the cofounder and former Director of Communications \nof the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, suffered with acute \nmesothelioma. Alan fought bravely and responded to his illness as a \ncall to action. Sadly, he lost his battle with his terrible disease \nlast year. The Alan Reinstein Memorial Award was created to honor \nthose, like Alan, who have brought awareness to the victims of \nasbestos. Les Skramstad will be honored posthumously this year.\n  Last year, the Senate debated a bill to remove asbestos liability \ncases from the court system and compensate victims from a trust fund. I \nstrongly opposed that bill because it was unfair to asbestos victims. \nThe bill would have made it too difficult for seriously injured victims \nto recover damages, and the trust fund would have been inadequate. \nRather than deprive asbestos victims of their day in court, we should \npass legislation to ban asbestos and heighten public awareness of this \nfatal disease.\n  I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the legislation recently \nreintroduced by Senator Murray, the Ban Asbestos in America Act of \n2007, which would ban asbestos by prohibiting asbestos-containing \nproducts from being imported, manufactured, processed, or distributed \nin the United States. While it has been banned in over 40 countries \naround the world, we continue to import over $100 million worth of \nasbestos products annually. This is more than 30 million pounds of \nasbestos that is imported for use throughout the Nation. Additionally, \nthe bill calls for a public awareness campaign to help educate \npatients, workers, family members, and health care providers on the \ndangers of exposure to asbestos, along with possible treatment options. \nAsbestos is killing far too many people. We can and should do more. \nSenator Murray's bill and the National Asbestos Awareness Week are a \nstep in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3225-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3225-S3226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 109--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA \nFAIRBANKS RIFLE TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2007 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n                     ASSOCIATION RIFLE CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, since its inception in 1967, the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations has been a trusted friend of the \nUnited States. The original five-member countries of Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, were joined by Brunei \nDarussalam in 1984. Beginning in the late 1960s, U.S. officials today \ncontinue to interact with ASEAN regarding mutual interests in East and \nSoutheast Asia. Vietnam, Laos, Burma and Cambodia joined ASEAN after \n1994.\n  The level of intersects between ASEAN and the United States is \nimmense, including student exchanges, business and trade, and security \ncooperation. ASEAN is the third largest export destination of American \nproducts.\n  It is important to note that ASEAN is continually changing, with the \npursuit of economic integration. As noted by the ASEAN Secretariat, \nASEAN officials hope to create ``a stable, prosperous and highly \ncompetitive ASEAN economic region in which there is a free flow of \ngoods, services and investment and a freer flow of capital, equitable, \neconomic development and reduced poverty and socio-economic disparities \nin year 2020.'' Last year alone, there were over 500 meetings of ASEAN \nofficials--it is a vibrant regional structure.\n  Committed to promoting regional peace and harmony, there has been no \narmed confrontation among ASEAN member nations, since ASEAN's \nbeginning. An important part of ASEAN's future security lies in the \ndevelopment of a regional energy security strategy. This endeavor is \nwell underway, and the United States looks forward to future dialogue \non ways in which meaningful cooperation can occur.\n  Continued collaboration between ASEAN, the United States and the \nWorld Health Organization on addressing major disease challenges, such \nas Avian influenza is of the essence. All involved must act with \nvigilance and in a timely way.\n  While ASEAN and the United States have shared appreciation for the \nchallenges of terrorism, our relationship is far more complex. For the \nbenefit of my colleagues, I point to recent remarks conveyed to me by \nSingapore's esteemed Ambassador-at-Large, Tommy Koh, who wrote \n``ASEAN's relationship with the U.S. is its most important \nrelationship. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. However, ASEAN \noften feels that it has been treated by the U.S. with benign neglect \nand viewed solely through the prism of terrorism. We hope, on this 30th \nanniversary year of the U.S.-ASEAN dialogue relationship, that the U.S. \nwill develop a coherent strategy and policy to engage ASEAN, upgrade \nour priority and make the U.S. the best friend of ASEAN.''\n  Full implementation of the ASEAN-United States Enhanced Partnership \nand appointment of the U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs are important \nsteps in growing this important bilateral relationship.\n  I am pleased to introduce this resolution commemorating the 30th \nanniversary of the U.S.-ASEAN dialogue. It is a message of \nreaffirmation and deep appreciation by the United States Senate. We \nlook forward to an even closer future partnership on many fronts, \nyielding mutual benefit for the people of ASEAN and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3226-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3226-S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 20--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nNO FUNDS SHOULD BE CUT OFF OR REDUCED FOR AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE FIELD \n  WHICH WOULD RESULT IN UNDERMINING THEIR SAFETY OR THEIR ABILITY TO \n                    COMPLETE THEIR ASSIGNED MISSION\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Craig, Mr. Cornyn, \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Allard, Mr. Graham, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nCoburn, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Coleman, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Thune, \nand Mr. Sessions) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Res. 95\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming a representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas, during World War II, Greece played a major role in \n     the struggle to protect freedom and democracy by bravely \n     fighting the historic Battle of Crete, giving the Axis powers \n     their first major setback in the land war and setting off a \n     chain of events that significantly affected the outcome of \n     World War II;\n       Whereas Greece paid a high price for defending the common \n     values of Greece and the United States in the deaths of \n     hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians during World War II;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 countries in the world, outside the former British Empire, \n     that allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day in 2002, said, ``Greece and America have \n     been firm allies in the great struggles for liberty. . . . \n     Americans will always remember Greek heroism and Greek \n     sacrifice for the sake of freedom. . . .

The United \n     States deeply appreciates the role Greece is playing in the \n     war against terror. . . . America and Greece are strong \n     allies, and we're strategic partners.'';\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist \n     attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is \n     making to the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region and has invested \n     over $15,000,000,000 in the region;\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to requests \n     by the United States during the war in Iraq, immediately \n     granting the United States unlimited access to Greece's \n     airspace and the base in Souda Bay, and many United States \n     ships that delivered troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were \n     refueled in Greece;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the Olympic games came home to \n     Athens, Greece, the land in which the games began 2,500 years \n     ago and the city in which the games were revived in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received world-wide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympics of more than \n     14,000 athletes from 202 countries and more than 2,000,000 \n     spectators and journalists, a feat Greece handled \n     efficiently, securely, and with famous Greek hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented security effort in Greece for the \n     first Olympics after the attacks on the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, included a record-setting expenditure of \n     more than $1,390,000,000 and the assignment of more than \n     70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an \n     8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group that included the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region in which Christianity \n     mixes with Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations \n     with Muslim countries and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has had extraordinary \n     success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural \n     understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and \n     Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort to advance freedom, democracy, peace, \n     stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between the governments and the peoples of Greece and the \n     United States;\n       Whereas March 25, 2007, marks the 186th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the people of Greece \n     from the Ottoman Empire; and\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable for the people of the \n     United States to celebrate this anniversary with the people \n     of Greece and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which both Greece and the United States were born: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2007, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3229-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS RIFLE TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The American National Red \n     Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The \n     American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.\n       (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The \n     American National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') \n     commissioned an independent review and analysis of the Board \n     of Governors' role, composition, size, relationship with \n     management, governance relationship with chartered units of \n     The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower and audit \n     functions.\n       (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, \n     entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st \n     Century'' (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors \n     recommended changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and \n     other governing documents of The American National Red Cross \n     to modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of \n     Governors and governance structure of The American National \n     Red Cross.\n       (4) It is in the national interest to create a more \n     efficient governance structure of The American National Red \n     Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to \n     support the critical mission of The American National Red \n     Cross in the 21st century.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic \n     oversight board and for The American National Red Cross to \n     amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations \n     described in the Governance Report, to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors and to outline the areas of its \n     responsibility, including--\n       (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement for The \n     American National Red Cross;\n       (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's strategic \n     plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational \n     matters;\n       (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level of \n     compensation of the corporation's chief executive officer;\n       (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the \n     compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for \n     management succession;\n       (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit process, \n     internal controls, and legal compliance;\n       (F) holding management accountable for performance;\n       (G) providing oversight of the financial stability of the \n     corporation;\n       (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the \n     corporation;\n       (I) providing oversight of the protection of the brand of \n     the corporation; and\n       (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the \n     corporation.\n       (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors \n     is a critical component of effective governance for The \n     American National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the \n     national interest that The American National Red Cross amend \n     its bylaws to provide a method of selection consistent with \n     that described in the Governance Report.\n       (B) The new method of selection should replace the current \n     process by which--\n       (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board of \n     Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which \n     includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other \n     individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;\n       (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors are \n     nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of \n     Governors; and\n       (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are appointed by \n     the President of the United States.\n       (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance \n     Report reflects the single\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\n     category of members of the Board of Governors that will \n     result from the implementation of this Act:\n       (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of the Board \n     of Governors) would be nominated by a single committee of the \n     Board of Governors taking into account the criteria outlined \n     in the Governance Report to assure the expertise, skills, and \n     experience of a governing board.\n       (ii) The nominated members would be considered for approval \n     by the full Board of Governors and then submitted to The \n     American National Red Cross annual meeting of delegates for \n     election, in keeping with the standard corporate practice \n     whereby shareholders of a corporation elect members of a \n     board of directors at its annual meeting.\n       (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American \n     National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it is in the national interest that the \n     Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any \n     changes to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights \n     and obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry \n     out its purposes.\n       (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in \n     carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and \n     meeting its various obligations, the effectiveness of The \n     American National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation \n     of an organizational ombudsman who--\n       (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute resolution \n     practitioner whose major function will be to provide \n     confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and \n     external stakeholders of The American National Red Cross;\n       (B) will report to the chief executive officer and the \n     audit committee of the Board of Governors; and\n       (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in The \n     American National Red Cross.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of \n     American society, but these organizations can only fulfill \n     their important roles by maintaining the trust of the \n     American public;\n       (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and \n     transparency, which are the principal goals of the \n     recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance \n     Report and this Act;\n       (3) Federal and State action play an important role in \n     ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting \n     standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public; \n     and\n       (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will \n     remain a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it has the rights and obligations consistent with \n     that status, The American National Red Cross nevertheless \n     should maintain appropriate communications with State \n     regulators of charitable organizations and should cooperate \n     with them as appropriate in specific matters as they arise \n     from time to time.\n\n     SEC. 3. ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 300101 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``a Federally chartered \n     instrumentality of the United States and'' before ``a body \n     corporate and politic''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The corporation may conduct its \n     business and affairs, and otherwise hold itself out, as the \n     `American Red Cross' in any jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 300102 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n       ``(5) to conduct other activities consistent with the \n     foregoing purposes.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP AND CHAPTERS.\n\n       Section 300103 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or as otherwise \n     provided,'' before ``in the bylaws'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1)--\n       (A) by striking ``board of governors'' and inserting \n     ``corporation''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     related''; and\n       (3) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     shall require''; and\n       (B) by striking ``national convention'' and inserting \n     ``annual meeting''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

I thank my colleagues, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Kennedy, for their hard work on this issue \nand for introducing this important bill.\n  Since its founding by Clara Barton in 1881, the American Red Cross \nhas provided crucial relief services to those affected by famine, \nfloods, and natural and manmade disasters. Last year alone, the \nAmerican Red Cross responded to approximately 75,000 disasters with the \nhelp of more than 1 million volunteers and 35,000 employees. As a key \nparticipant in the U.S. disaster relief plan, the American Red Cross is \ncharged with helping the United States prevent, prepare and respond to \nnational emergencies. Over the past several years, however, the \nAmerican Red Cross has been strained by disasters of an unparalleled \nscope: the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the December 2004 \nAsian tsunami, and the 2005 hurricane season that included the \nenormously destructive Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. These \nevents all challenged the Red Cross's ability to respond to disasters \nquickly and effectively.\n  In order to improve its disaster relief services, the American Red \nCross's Board of Governors unanimously voted to accept recommendations \ngiven by an independent advisory board, which examined the American Red \nCross's governance structure and practices. S. 655 reflects these \nrecommendations and would improve the American Red Cross's governance \nstructure by centralizing and reorganizing its infrastructure. Some \nnotable enhancements include reducing its board size from 50 members to \n20 in order to facilitate emergency action, giving the board all the \npowers in governing and managing the American Red Cross, and \nestablishing a Presidential Advisory Council composed of 8 to 10 \nprincipal officers of the executive departments and senior officers of \nthe Armed Forces to provide governmental input and support. \nAdditionally, the modernized charter would enhance congressional \noversight and transparency by creating an ombudsman who would provide \nan annual report to Congress articulating any concerns of volunteers, \nemployees, donors, clients and the public.\n  According to the American Red Cross's end of the year report, \nHurricane Katrina created a record of 1.4 million families, or around 4 \nmillion people, who needed emergency assistance such as food, clothing, \nand other necessities. My wife Marcelle was one of hundreds of \nthousands of volunteers dedicated to providing these essential relief \nservices to victims of Katrina. No one knows when the next disaster \nwill strike. Congress must do everything in our power to ensure that \nthe American Red Cross can continue and improve upon the essential \nhumanitarian work on which the United States and the world relies. I \ncommend the Red Cross for taking important action to reform itself, and \nI urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 655), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 655\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The American National Red \n     Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The \n     American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.\n       (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The \n     American National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') \n     commissioned an independent review and analysis of the Board \n     of Governors' role, composition, size, relationship with \n     management, governance relationship with chartered units of \n     The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower and audit \n     functions.\n       (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, \n     entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st \n     Century'' (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors \n     recommended changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and \n     other governing documents of The American National Red Cross \n     to modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of \n     Governors and governance structure of The American National \n     Red Cross.\n       (4) It is in the national interest to create a more \n     efficient governance structure of The American National Red \n     Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to \n     support the critical mission of The American National Red \n     Cross in the 21st century.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic \n     oversight board and for The American National Red Cross to \n     amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations \n     described in the Governance Report, to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors and to outline the areas of its \n     responsibility, including--\n       (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement for The \n     American National Red Cross;\n       (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's strategic \n     plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational \n     matters;\n       (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level of \n     compensation of the corporation's chief executive officer;\n       (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the \n     compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for \n     management succession;\n       (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit process, \n     internal controls, and legal compliance;\n       (F) holding management accountable for performance;\n       (G) providing oversight of the financial stability of the \n     corporation;\n       (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the \n     corporation;\n       (I) providing oversight of the protection of the brand of \n     the corporation; and\n       (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the \n     corporation.\n       (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors \n     is a critical component of effective governance for The \n     American National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the \n     national interest that The American National Red Cross amend \n     its bylaws to provide a method of selection consistent with \n     that described in the Governance Report.\n       (B) The new method of selection should replace the current \n     process by which--\n       (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board of \n     Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which \n     includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other \n     individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;\n       (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors are \n     nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of \n     Governors; and\n       (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are appointed by \n     the President of the United States.\n       (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance \n     Report reflects the single category of members of the Board \n     of Governors that will result from the implementation of this \n     Act:\n       (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of the Board \n     of Governors) would be nominated by a single committee of the \n     Board of Governors taking into account the criteria outlined \n     in the Governance Report to assure the expertise, skills, and \n     experience of a governing board.\n       (ii) The nominated members would be considered for approval \n     by the full Board of Governors and then submitted to The \n     American National Red Cross annual meeting of delegates for \n     election, in keeping with the standard corporate practice \n     whereby shareholders of a corporation elect members of a \n     board of directors at its annual meeting.\n       (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American \n     National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it is in the national interest that the \n     Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any \n     changes to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights \n     and obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry \n     out its purposes.\n       (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in \n     carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and \n     meeting its various obligations, the effectiveness of The \n     American National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation \n     of an organizational ombudsman who--\n       (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute resolution \n     practitioner whose major function will be to provide \n     confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and \n     external stakeholders of The American National Red Cross;\n       (B) will report to the chief executive officer and the \n     audit committee of the Board of Governors; and\n       (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in The \n     American National Red Cross.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of \n     American society, but these organizations can only fulfill \n     their important roles by maintaining the trust of the \n     American public;\n       (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and \n     transparency, which are the principal goals of the \n     recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance \n     Report and this Act;\n       (3) Federal and State action play an important role in \n     ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting \n     standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public; \n     and\n       (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will \n     remain a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it has the rights and obligations consistent with \n     that status, The American National Red Cross nevertheless \n     should maintain appropriate communications with State \n     regulators of charitable organizations and should cooperate \n     with them as appropriate in specific matters as they arise \n     from time to time.\n\n     SEC. 3. ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 300101 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``a Federally chartered \n     instrumentality of the United States and'' before ``a body \n     corporate and politic''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The corporation may conduct its \n     business and affairs, and otherwise hold itself out, as the \n     `American Red Cross' in any jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 300102 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n       ``(5) to conduct other activities consistent with the \n     foregoing purposes.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP AND CHAPTERS.\n\n       Section 300103 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or as otherwise \n     provided,'' before ``in the bylaws'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1)--\n       (A) by striking ``board of governors'' and inserting \n     ``corporation''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     related''; and\n       (3) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     shall require''; and\n       (B) by striking ``national convention'' and inserting \n     ``annual meeting''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``NATO Freedom Consolidation \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The sustained commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made possible the \n     democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. \n     Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can and \n     should play a critical role in addressing the security \n     challenges of the post-Cold War era in creating the stable \n     environment needed for those emerging democracies in Europe.\n       (2) Lasting stability and security in Europe requires the \n     military, economic, and political integration of emerging \n     democracies into existing European structures.\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\n       (3) In an era of threats from terrorism and the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization is increasingly contributing to \n     security in the face of global security challenges for the \n     protection and interests of its member states.\n       (4) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of \n     Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared \n     that ``full and active participants in the Partnership for \n     Peace in a position to further the principles of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the \n     North Atlantic area should be invited to become full NATO \n     members in accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty at an \n     early date. . .''.\n       (5) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title \n     VI of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law \n     104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for the prompt \n     admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and \n     Slovenia to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and \n     declared that ``in order to promote economic stability and \n     security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine . . . the process of \n     enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and \n     Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of \n     admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia \n     as full members of the NATO Alliance''.\n       (6) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n     division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), \n     Congress declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO'' and that \n     ``Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria . . . \n     would make an outstanding contribution to furthering the \n     goals of NATO and enhancing stability, freedom, and peace in \n     Europe should they become NATO members [and] upon complete \n     satisfaction of all relevant criteria should be invited to \n     become full NATO members at the earliest possible date''.\n       (7) In the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \n     of 2002 (Public Law 107-187; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress \n     endorsed ``. . . the vision of further enlargement of the \n     NATO Alliance articulated by President George W. Bush on June \n     15, 2001, and by former President William J. Clinton on \n     October 22, 1996''.\n       (8) At the Madrid Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic were invited to join the Alliance, and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and government \n     issued a declaration stating ``[t]he alliance expects to \n     extend further invitations in coming years to nations willing \n     and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of \n     membership . . . [n]o European democratic country whose \n     admission would fulfill the objectives of the [North \n     Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded from consideration''.\n       (9) At the Washington Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in April 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization heads of state and government issued a \n     communique declaring ``[w]e pledge that NATO will continue to \n     welcome new members in a position to further the principles \n     of the [North Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and \n     security in the Euro-Atlantic area . . . [t]he three new \n     members will not be the last . . . [n]o European democratic \n     country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of the \n     Treaty will be excluded from consideration, regardless of its \n     geographic location . . .''.\n       (10) In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the foreign \n     ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     the Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Romania, Slovakia, and \n     Slovenia issued a statement (later joined by Croatia) \n     declaring that--\n       (A) their countries will cooperate in jointly seeking \n     membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the \n     next round of enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization;\n       (B) the realization of membership in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization by one or more of these countries would \n     be a success for all; and\n       (C) eventual membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization for all of these countries would be a success \n     for Europe and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       (11) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, \n     President George W. Bush stated ``[a]ll of Europe's new \n     democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that \n     lie between, should have the same chance for security and \n     freedom--and the same chance to join the institutions of \n     Europe--as Europe's old democracies have . . . I believe in \n     NATO membership for all of Europe's democracies that seek it \n     and are ready to share the responsibilities that NATO brings \n     . . . [a]s we plan to enlarge NATO, no nation should be used \n     as a pawn in the agenda of others . . . [w]e will not trade \n     away the fate of free European peoples . . . [n]o more \n     Munichs . . . [n]o more Yaltas . . . [a]s we plan the Prague \n     Summit, we should not calculate how little we can get away \n     with, but how much we can do to advance the cause of \n     freedom''.\n       (12) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, \n     former President William J. Clinton stated ``NATO's doors \n     will not close behind its first new members . . . NATO should \n     remain open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are \n     ready to shoulder the responsibilities of membership . . . \n     [n]o nation will be automatically excluded . . . [n]o country \n     outside NATO will have a veto . . . [a] gray zone of \n     insecurity must not reemerge in Europe''.\n       (13) At the Prague Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in November 2002, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia were invited to \n     join the Alliance in the second round of enlargement of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold \n     War, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of \n     state and government issued a declaration stating ``NATO's \n     door will remain open to European democracies willing and \n     able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of \n     membership, in accordance with Article 10 of the Washington \n     Treaty''.\n       (14) On May 8, 2003, the United States Senate unanimously \n     approved the Resolution of Ratification to Accompany Treaty \n     Document No. 108-4, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of \n     1949 on Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, \n     Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to join \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       (15) At the Istanbul Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in June 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization heads of state and government issued a \n     communique reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to new \n     members, declaring ``[w]e celebrate the success of NATO's \n     Open Door Policy, and reaffirm tody that our seven new \n     members will not be the last. The door to membership remains \n     open. We welcome the progress made by Albania, Croatia, and \n     the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1) in implementing \n     their Annual National Programmes under the Membership Action \n     Plan, and encourage them to continue pursuing the reforms \n     necessary to progress toward NATO membership. We also commend \n     their contribution to regional stability and cooperation. We \n     want all three countries to succeed and will continue to \n     assist them in their reform efforts. NATO will continue to \n     assess each country's candidacy individually, based on the \n     progress made towards reform goals pursued through the \n     Membership Action Plan, which will remain the vehicle to keep \n     the readiness of each aspirant for membership under review. \n     We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep the enlargement \n     process, including the implementation of the Membership \n     Action Plan, under continual review and report to us. We will \n     review at the next Summit progress by aspirants towards \n     membership based on that report''.\n       (16) Georgia and Ukraine have stated their desire to join \n     the Euro-Atlantic community, and in particular, are seeking \n     to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Georgia and \n     Ukraine are working closely with the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and its members to meet criteria for eventual \n     membership in NATO.\n       (17) At a press conference with President Mikhail \n     Saakashvili of Georgia in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 2006, \n     President George W. Bush stated that ``. . . I believe that \n     NATO would benefit with Georgia being a member of NATO, and I \n     think Georgia would benefit. And there's a way forward \n     through the Membership Action Plan . . . And I'm a believer \n     in the expansion of NATO. I think it's in the world's \n     interest that we expand NATO''.\n       (18) Following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in New \n     York on September 21, 2006, NATO Secretary General Jaap de \n     Hoop Scheffer announced the launching of an Intensified \n     Dialogue on membership between the Alliance and Georgia.\n       (19) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Summit in Brussels in \n     February 2005, President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko \n     declared membership in NATO as the ultimate goal of Ukraine's \n     cooperation with the Alliance and expressed Ukraine's desire \n     to conclude a Membership Action Plan.\n       (20) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Foreign Ministerial \n     meeting in Vilnius in April 2005, NATO and Ukraine launched \n     an Intensified Dialogue on the potential membership of \n     Ukraine in NATO.\n       (21) At the Riga Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in November 2006, the Heads of State and \n     Government of the member countries of NATO issued a \n     declaration reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to new \n     members, declaring that ``all European democratic countries \n     may be considered for MAP (Membership Action Plan) or \n     admission, subject to decision by the NAC (North Atlantic \n     Council) at each stage, based on the performance of these \n     countries towards meeting the objectives of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep \n     that process under continual review and report to us. We \n     welcome the efforts of Albania, Croatia, and the former \n     Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to prepare themselves for the \n     responsibilities and obligations of membership. We reaffirm \n     that the Alliance will continue with Georgia and Ukraine its \n     Intensified Dialogues which cover the full range of \n     political, military, financial and security issues relating \n     to those countries' aspirations to membership, without \n     prejudice to any eventual Alliance decision. We reaffirm the \n     importance of the NATO-Ukraine Distinctive Partnership, which \n     has its 10th anniversary next year and welcome the progress \n     that has been made in the framework of our Intensified \n     Dialogue.\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\n     We appreciate Ukraine's substantial contributions to our \n     common security, including through participation in NATO-led \n     operations and efforts to promote regional cooperation. We \n     encourage Ukraine to continue to contribute to regional \n     security. We are determined to continue to assist, through \n     practical cooperation, in the implementation of far-reaching \n     reform efforts, notably in the fields of national security, \n     defence, reform of the defence-industrial sector and fighting \n     corruption. We welcome the commencement of an Intensified \n     Dialogue with Georgia as well as Georgia's contribution to \n     international peacekeeping and security operations. We will \n     continue to engage actively with Georgia in support of its \n     reform process. We encourage Georgia to continue progress on \n     political, economic and military reforms, including \n     strengthening judicial reform, as well as the peaceful \n     resolution of outstanding conflicts on its territory. We \n     reaffirm that it is of great importance that all parties in \n     the region should engage constructively to promote regional \n     peace and stability.''.\n       (22) Contingent upon their continued implementation of \n     democratic, defense, and economic reform, and their \n     willingness and ability to meet the responsibilities of \n     membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a \n     clear expression of national intent to do so, Congress calls \n     for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, \n     Macedonia (FYROM), and Ukraine to the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization to promote security and stability in Europe.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its previous expressions of support for \n     continued enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization contained in the NATO Participation Act of 1994, \n     the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, the European \n     Security Act of 1998, and the Gerald B. H.

Mr. President, this week has been a week full of a lot of \nwork, a lot of surprises but a lot of results. We finished the 9/11 \nbill, which is something the Senate should feel very good about. We did \nthat on a bipartisan basis with the leadership of Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Collins.\n  Today we completed a 2-day debate on Iraq. It was a good, civil \ndebate. Both the majority and minority issued their statements. I \nthought they did them well. We were able to have some votes. I think it \nwas something that brought dignity to the Senate.\n  We had three judicial nominations approved--two district court \njudges, one circuit court judge. We are doing our level best to not \nhave any problems with judicial nominations. The President is doing his \nshare of helping us with this by sending us some good people. We have \nhad agreement on the U.S. attorney bill that has been done with \nbipartisan support. This is set up for debate starting Monday. We will \ncomplete that on Tuesday morning.\n  Then, finally, again, using the Lieberman-Collins example, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad and \nSenator Judd Gregg, did a wonderful job. There is not a more \ncontentious issue that comes before this body than the budget. All 100 \nMembers believe they can do a better job than either Judd Gregg or Kent \nConrad can do, but they have the responsibility of coming up with the \nbudget. They worked together for a number of years. They are friends \nand they set a good example. This matter was completed by 3:30 this \nafternoon.\n  Next week is going to be a tough week. There will be a lot of \namendments offered, and we look forward to that. But we have a \nstatutory way of proceeding through this. Whoever drew the statute \nprobably had too much to drink the night before. But at least that is \nthe statute we have. It is 50 hours, and unlimited amendments can be \noffered. But at least we know what we are up against next week because \nwe have done it many times.\n  In short, this closely divided Senate, at this stage during the final \nweeks of Senator Johnson's incapacitation, is 50 to 49. He will be back \nwith us soon. But even then, it is 51 to 49. It is a very closely \ndivided Senate, and we are getting work done recognizing that there can \nbe no bullies in the Senate, that we have to work together to get \nthings done.\n  I think we have accomplished a lot this week. All 100 Senators \ndeserve a pat on the back.\n  If there is no further business to come before the Senate today, I \nwould turn to the Republican leader to see if he has comments before we \nadjourn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would only add my own sentiment with \nregard to next week. It will be a challenging week; budget week always \nis. For those who are interested in offering amendments, obviously the \nearlier in the week, the better.\n  The majority leader and I have talked about the challenges associated \nwith the so-called vote-arama that occurs at the end of the budget \ndebate every year, which is frustrating to both sides. Some have \nthought it mutually assured destruction in terms of morale. The only \nway to have any real impact on that obviously is for Members to offer \ntheir amendments earlier in the week, hopefully to be allowed votes \nearlier in the week, thereby minimizing the multiplicity of votes that \nfrequently occur--in fact, always occur--at the end of a budget \nresolution when the time expires.\n  We look forward to a challenging week and will see all of our Members \nnext week.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, being the great fan of basketball that \nhe is, I thought he would note that Louisville won the first game \ntoday.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the majority leader noting that \nLouisville won the game today. I might say to my good friend, it is on \nthe DVR, and I expect to watch it at home tonight. I note that UNLV and \nURI will play tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/15/senate-section/article/S3237-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2007, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
