Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives \npassed a new Iraq supplemental. So now it is our turn. We have to take \nthe next step to pass our version of the bill that will go to \nconference. The House has done their job. We now have to do our job.\n  We all know reaching consensus on a new bill to send to the President \nwill not be easy. That is what the Republican leader and I were talking \nabout right here.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n  Passions run high on this issue--very high. But there is new reason \nthis week to believe a bipartisan consensus in Iraq is emerging. It is \nwhat the American people want. A recent poll--in fact, it was from a \ncouple days ago--shows 75 percent of Americans favor benchmarks and 60 \npercent favor a timetable for reducing combat forces. It is what \nPresident Bush's own military advisers say we need, including General \nPetraeus, who has said this war cannot be won militarily. It is what \nDemocrats have stood for with firm resolve throughout these entire \nnegotiations.\n  Now, in the last few days, we have seen our Republican colleagues \nmove closer to our position. Over the weekend, the House majority \nleader, John Boehner, said:\n\n       By the time we get to September or October, members are \n     going to want to know how well this is working, and if it \n     isn't, what's Plan B.\n\n  That is a timetable. The President has objected to our timetables. He \nvetoed our bill with timetables in it. The Republican leader in the \nHouse--the No. 1 Republican in the House--has told the President if \nthings are not OK in September or October, something else has to \nhappen. That is a timetable.\n\n  Senator Lott said:\n\n       This fall we have to see some significant changes on the \n     ground.\n\n  And days ago, Leader McConnell echoed those sentiments as well.\n  Meanwhile, on Wednesday a broad coalition of Republican House Members \nexpressed their dissent directly to the President. They went to the \nWhite House, spent an hour and 15 minutes with the President. One of \nthem, Tom Davis of Virginia, called it their chance to confront a \nPresident who, as he put it, is in a bubble.\n  In the spirit of bipartisanship, I am inclined to agree with that \nassessment. The President is in a bubble. He is isolated.\n  Every day, the ranks of dissatisfied Republicans grow. But I wish my \nRepublican colleagues--who now agree that President Bush's open-ended \ncommitment has failed--would put some teeth behind their views.\n  We have courageous American troops in harm's way every day. We lost \nanother Nevadan this week. There may be a State that has lost more than \nthe Presiding Officer's State, but I do not know what State that would \nbe. The State of Ohio has suffered significantly in the loss of life.\n  It is time for action. It is time to change course. It is long past \ndue.\n  But I would say the shift we are hearing from the Republicans, even \nthough a little bit quiet, each day is getting louder and louder and \nlouder. It is a welcome shift, and it is very encouraging. It gives me \nhope that in the coming days, weeks, and months we will be able to work \ntogether with good faith and bipartisanship to give our troops and all \nAmericans the new course they demand and deserve and the opportunity \nfor our troops to come home.\n  We are going to do our very best to come up with something we can \npass here in the Senate, send to the House, and confer, have a \nconference. We will do that to the very best of our ability. But, as I \nindicated earlier, it is not going to be easy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, competence, independence, and sound \njudgment are the lodestar of the administration of justice in this \ncountry. Unfortunately, over the past few months, I and many Americans \nhave been forced to question on all three counts those whom this \nPresident has appointed to lead the Department of Justice. Indeed, with \neach passing day, we sense more and more that something is gravely \nwrong.\n  For example, we have learned about the misuse and abuse of the \nDepartment's power to issue national security letters under the PATRIOT \nAct--which, even under the most legitimate and benign circumstances, \nrepresents a truly imposing authority. As you know, a national security \nletter, or NSL, is a Government demand for private information, issued \nwithout a warrant to third parties such as banks, phone companies, and \nInternet service providers. In March, the Department of Justice's \ninspector general reported that NSLs were being ``seriously misused.'' \nAmong other things, there were no clear guidelines for issuing national \nsecurity letters. They were issued without proper authorization, there \nwas sloppy recordkeeping by the FBI, and there were no procedures for \npurging a citizen's private information if the investigation was \nclosed.\n  We have also, of course, learned about the unprecedented firings of \neight U.S. attorneys--dismissals which seem to have been motivated by \npolitics, marred by incompetence, or, more likely, both.\n  The details of the Department's misjudgments in this matter, and \nparticularly the degree to which partisan politics has infiltrated this \nDepartment, become more numerous and more damaging to the Attorney \nGeneral's credibility every day. But the politicization of the \nDepartment should come as no surprise when we examine how the rules \ngoverning initial contacts between the White House and the Department \nof Justice on non-national security-related investigations and cases--\ntraditional criminal cases--have changed since President Bush took \noffice.\n  During previous administrations, there were strict rules governing \ncontacts between the White House and the Department of Justice on \ninvestigations and cases--and for good reason. A strong firewall is \nnecessary to prevent undue and untoward efforts to inject politics into \nthe administration of justice. During the Clinton administration, this \nfirewall was articulated in a September 1994 letter from Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno to White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler. It is my \nunderstanding that credit goes to Senator Hatch, then chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, for his interest in seeing this policy confirmed \nin this way. So this has been a continuing and bipartisan concern, this \nquestion of the firewall between the White House and the Department of \njustice. The Reno letter stated:\n\n       Initial communications between the White House and the \n     Justice Department regarding any pending Department \n     investigation or criminal or civil case should involve only \n     the White House counsel or deputy counsel, or the President \n     or Vice President, and the Attorney General or Deputy or \n     Associate Attorney General.\n\n  That policy is represented by this chart. On the White House side, \nthe only people authorized to have these initial discussions on \ncriminal cases are the President, Vice President, Deputy White House \nCounsel, and the White House Counsel. Within the Department of Justice, \nit is only the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and the \nAssociate Attorney General--a grand total of seven people.\n  As I noted during the Attorney General's testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee last month, that rule was changed in an April 2002 \nmemo from Attorney General Ashcroft. The new policy permits initial \ncommunications on cases and investigations between the Office of the \nDeputy Attorney General and the office of the counsel to the President, \nand it also states that staff members of the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral, if so designated by the Attorney General, may communicate \ndirectly with officials and staff of the Office of the President, the \nOffice of the Vice President, and the office of counsel to the \nPresident.\n  The new rule is represented by this other chart. There are over 400 \npeople in the White House now authorized to have those conversations \nwith the Department of Justice, where before it was 4. Before, it was \nthe very top administration officials in the White\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nHouse--the President, Vice President, Attorney General, White House \nCounsel, and Deputy White House Counsel. Who knows who all these other \nfolks are. One of these boxes is Karl Rove. That makes you wonder. Down \nhere, these are all the staff now within the Department of Justice who \nare authorized to have those communications, whereas before it was \nlimited to the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and Associate \nAttorney General.\n  These charts demonstrate the extraordinary latitude now permitted the \nWhite House and Department of Justice to discuss sensitive \ninvestigations and prosecutions. With the clear exception of \ndiscussions related specifically to national security, where one can \nunderstand you might want to have discussion also with the White House \nwhen it is a national security issue that would involve the military \nand other agencies of Government, for regular criminal cases and for \nprosecutions, I am hard-pressed to imagine any reason the Clinton-era \nrule needed expansion. Indeed, when I put this question to Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales when he was before our committee, he had no answer.\n  These are not just bureaucratic niceties. Rules governing conduct \nwithin organizations have an obvious and direct effect on the conduct \nof people within those organizations. Clearly, the politicization of \nthe Department has been either a byproduct or a cause of this changed \nrule. After all, the more political people you allow to weigh in on \nsensitive investigations and cases, the more you run the risk--or, \nindeed, make it possible--that those investigations and cases become \ninappropriately politicized.\n  So this brings us to FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nGiven all this, perhaps I should not have been surprised when I \nreviewed the administration's proposed Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act ``modernization'' bill and compared it to the current \nFISA statute.\n\n  Under the current statute, title 50 of the U.S. Code, section 1804, \npassed in 1978, each application for a court order approving electronic \nsurveillance under FISA must include the approval of the Attorney \nGeneral, plus a number of required statements and certifications. One \nof those is a certification that information sought is ``foreign \nintelligence information'' and that such information ``cannot be \nreasonably obtained by normal investigative techniques.'' That \ncertification--a critical proceeding with a FISA application--can \ncurrently be made by only a few people:\n\n       The Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs or an executive branch official or officials \n     designated by the President from among those executive \n     officers employed in the area of national security or defense \n     and appointed by the President with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate.\n\n  That is actually a grand total of nine people, all senior level, all \nwith a lot at stake in making sure they do the right thing. This makes \nperfect sense, given the importance of such a certification.\n  Now, let's take a look at the administration's proposed FISA \n``modernization.'' That bill will allow the following people to certify \napplications for court orders under FISA:\n\n       The assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs or an executive branch official or officials \n     designated by the President to authorize electronic \n     surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.\n\n  So any executive branch official or officials designated by the \nPresident can now authorize--or could if this passed--electronic \nsurveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the most \nconservative estimate of the number of people who could be called \n``executive branch officials'' under this definition is 9,050. The \nnumber is actually probably greater than that. So, in other words, if \nthe administration had its way, more than 9,000 people would be \neligible for designation by the President to certify an application for \na warrant to the FISA Court. That is what this chart demonstrates.\n  Just to give you an idea, over here on this chart, we are talking \nabout individuals--each block represents a person. Here, because the \nnumbers are so big, we have divided by nine. This block represented the \nexisting FISA certification authority to the nine Presidentially \nappointed and Senate-confirmed individuals who qualified, and we \nreduced it to one. Each one of these blocks would also represent nine, \nso multiply by nine. I am probably stretching my limits on the floor by \nusing two charts at the same time. If I had to represent this with 9 \npeople here and 9,000 here, I would have charts up to the ceiling of \nthis room. That is the scale they are trying to change this to. By the \nway, one of these people, again, would be Karl Rove.\n  What we have is another example of the Bush administration trying to \nbreak down established barriers that defend fair, professional, and \nresponsible decisions in national security and in the administration of \njustice.\n  Making matters worse, the administration's FISA bill would greatly \nexpand the powers of the Attorney General in a number of key areas.\n  I don't think I need to say again that this Attorney General has \nthoroughly and utterly lost my confidence. I think he has also lost the \nconfidence of this Chamber and of the American people. In my view, he \ndoes not merit any greater authority, particularly where that authority \ninvolves the power of the Federal Government to invade personal privacy \nfor the purpose of secret wiretaps. We gave him that kind of authority \nwhen we gave him the authority with the national security letters. Look \nwhat he did with it. That authority was ``seriously misused.'' This is \nthe man who has proven he cannot be trusted with these authorities.\n  The administration's bill would give the Attorney General expanded \npowers to hold on to information that was obtained without a warrant or \nobtained unintentionally. It would grant blanket immunity to any person \nor company that, from September 11 on, provided the intelligence \ncommunity with any records, facilities, or assistance purportedly \nintended to protect against a terrorist attack. This blanket immunity \npower would allow the Attorney General to shut down a number of \nlawsuits and State investigations looking into whether and how \ncompanies provide detailed records about their customers' private \ncommunications.\n  It would allow powers to transfer any case before any court \nchallenging the legality of classified communications intelligence \nactivity, or any case in which the legality of such activity is even an \nissue, from the court it is filed in to the secret Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. This would be an extraordinary and unprecedented \npower for the Attorney General to forum-shop by grabbing cases out of \nopen court and placing them before the secret FISA Court.\n  Finally, it would authorize the Attorney General to conduct \nsurveillance directed toward foreign powers with fewer safeguards to \nensure the surveillance will not capture the contents of Americans' \ncommunication.\n  This is just a sampling of the ways in which this bill would expand \nthe Attorney General's authority under that FISA statute. We count at \nleast 10 expansions of power.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Justice wields some of the most \npowerful tools held by any Federal agency.\n  The prosecutive power is probably the most severe power the \nGovernment holds. Among these powers is included the power to issue \nnational security letters, the power through U.S. attorneys to \nprosecute criminal cases, and the power to help administer the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  These awesome powers must be used with competence, independence, and \nsound judgment. I am afraid the current Attorney General has not lived \nup to those high standards, and for that reason, I cannot support \nlegislation that would increase this Attorney General's authority.\n  For that reason, I also call on him again to step down so we can \nbegin to put this sad episode in the history--the proud history--of the \nDepartment of Justice behind us.\n  The Attorney General's resignation will not solve all the problems at \nthe Department of Justice or the White House, but, regrettably, I have \ncome to the conclusion it is a necessary first step.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, this has been a very disappointing week \nfrom the standpoint of a discussion about international trade. \nYesterday morning, at about 8:30 in the morning, we learned the trade \ndeficit for the previous month has once again spiked up to a $63.9 \nbillion trade deficit in 1 month. And yet, most of this town continues \nto say how successful it is, this strategy of free trade.\n  This what has happened with our trade strategy. This chart represents \nan ocean of red ink. You can see, going back to 1995, we have had \nnothing but trouble, increasing deficits year after year. We are deep \nin debt with respect to our combined trade deficits. This is not a \ntrade strategy that is working.\n  At about the same time that I learned that our trade deficit spiked \nup once again to $63.9 billion in 1 month, I also learned that one of \nthe largest employers in North Dakota, Imation, is leaving our State. \nThey announced they are going to be closing their plant in Wahpeton, \nND.\n  They have actually announced it well ahead of time, and they are not \ngoing to be completely gone until the year 2009. It is helpful that we \nreceived some advanced notice.\n  But this is a company that has 390 employees. It produces high-tech \nproducts in data storage and so on. Mr. President, 390 workers who are \npaid well, who have good jobs with good pay and good benefits, facing \nthe prospect of all that disappearing.\n  I was on the phone yesterday with the CEO of this company, Imation, \nand asked questions. The company has said to its employees and to me \nthat they are closing down this factory in North Dakota because it \nproduces floppy disks, and that is yesterday's technology. Floppy disks \nare on the way out, not on the way in. The market has moved and that is \njust the fact. So supposedly that has required them to make a decision \nto close this plant.\n  Come to find out, though, that only 55 people in a plant of 390 \npeople are making floppy disks. The rest of the employees, of course, \nare not. They are involved in the production of other things. So it \ndoesn't really make sense that they are closing the plant because of \nfloppy disks.\n  Yesterday, in a conversation with the president of the company, after \na lot of probing, I found out that 168 of the jobs in this plant are in \nfact going to moved to Juarez, Mexico. Why? Undoubtedly because of low \nwages paid in Juarez, Mexico. You can produce things less expensively \nif you are paying people 50 cents an hour, I suppose. But at its root \nit is exactly what is wrong with what is happening in international \ntrade and our participation in it.\n  Instead of lifting others up, our entire trade strategy has been a \nstrategy that says it is all right to push the standards in this \ncountry down. No, the workers in Wahpeton can't compete with Mexican \nworkers, nor should they be expected to. And by the way, I will bet \nsome others of these jobs will be migrating to China and some other \nplaces in Asia.\n  I am not here to trash a corporation; that is not my point. This \ncompany has been a good employer in our State for a long time. But I am \nvery disappointed and very troubled they have announced they are \nleaving. In the last 5 to 7 years we worked hard to get them Federal \nGovernment grants, almost $3 million in Federal grants, plus a \nguaranteed Federal loan to expand their plant in Wahpeton, ND. Then, \njust a few short years later, there is a U-turn in the corporate board \nroom that says they have decided not only are they not going to want to \nproceed here, they are going to leave.\n  What about the millions of dollars of grants that we worked to get \nbecause we want to support those jobs? This, in a microcosm, is exactly \nwhat is going on all across this country. It is Wahpeton this week, but \nI could name almost any city and you will have the same thing.\n  I have been on the floor of the Senate many times talking about who \nis leaving and when and where and why and how. Levis--gone. They don't \nmake any Levis in America. There is not one pair of Levis made in \nAmerica. Fruit of the Loom underwear--all gone; no underwear made in \nAmerica by Fruit of the Loom. Fig Newton cookies, they, too, went to \nMexico. If you want to eat Mexican food, buy Fig Newton cookies. Radio \nFlier, Little Red Wagon--gone to China; Huffy bicycles, gone to China.\n  I could go on forever talking about things. But what happened in \nWahpeton, ND, brings it home in a stark way to the people who dressed \nup in the morning to go to work, appreciating those jobs, believing \nthose jobs were important in their lives, just to find out that one day \nthey are gone. And at least part of the reason they are gone is they \ncan't compete with people who will work for a whole lot less money in \nother parts of the world. Should they be required to? Is our strategy \nto say, after we have built a set of standards for a century in this \ncountry, that those standards don't matter because you have to compete \nagainst a different standard? And the different standard is what they \npay in China, what they pay in Mexico? We can't live on that in this \ncountry and that ought not be the standard.\n  I showed a chart with the red ink in terms of international trade \ndeficits that we have. Our trade deficit last year was $832 billion. \nYou can make a case with the budget deficit, where the Congress spends \nmore than it takes in--you can make the case from an economics \nperspective that is money we owe to ourselves. You can't make that case \nwith the trade deficit. That is money we owe to foreigners, and we are \ngoing to repay it someday with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry. That is a fact.\n  I wake up and read there is apparently some sort of fiesta at the \nWhite House. It is probably appropriately following the Cinco de Mayo \nperiod. They gathered together, Republicans and Democrats, and said: We \nhave reached a deal on trade.\n  So now we have a couple of trade agreements coming up--Peru, Panama, \nmaybe also Colombia and Korea. And we have some folks who got together \nand said: We reached a deal on trade.\n  No one I know of in this Chamber has reached a deal on trade. I think \nthere are plenty of voices in this Chamber that will rise in the coming \nweek to say, no, the trade debate has to involve people in this Chamber \nwho know that the current trade strategy doesn't work for this country.\n  It is not because we don't want to be engaged in trade. We believe in \ntrade, and plenty of it. We support international trade. But we support \ninternational trade that is mutually beneficial to us and others. What \nhas happened in recent trade agreements? I come back now to the issue \nof Mexico. We do a trade agreement with Mexico, and you turn a $2 \nbillion surplus into an annualized trade deficit now with Mexico--in \nthe first 3 months of this year it is going to be $70 billion a year, \nwith Mexico. Think of that. We turned a trade surplus with Mexico, a $2 \nbillion surplus, into a $70 billion deficit. You talk about \nincompetence? You talk about bad trade deals? This is the cherry on top \nof the sundae in bad trade deals.\n  Among the things they discussed yesterday is Korea. They made brief \nmention of that today in the paper. You have a couple of problems with \nKorea, aside from the fact that the agreement was generally negotiated \nincompetently.\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\n  Here is an example of what is wrong with Korea. Mr. President, 99 \npercent of the automobiles in Korea driven on the streets are made in \nKorea. Is that an accident? Why is that the case? Because that is the \nway Korea wants it. They don't want imported vehicles. They want the \npeople of Korea to buy Koreans cars that produce Koreans jobs in the \nmanufacturing marketplace.\n  Here is what has happened with Korea. Last year we sent Korea 4,200 \nAmerican cars. That is our export market to Korea. Last year, Korea \nsent us 730,000 Korean cars to be sold in our marketplace. So Korea \nsaid: Load all these cars on ships, send them to America, sell them to \nAmerican consumers and, by the way, while we send you 730,000 Korean \ncars, we will limit you to 4,200 American cars coming our way.\n  You say maybe there is not a market for American cars in Korea. Talk \nto the folks who try to sell Dodge Dakota pickups and learn that story, \nand then you will learn what happens with respect to American vehicles \nthat are attempted to be sold in Korea.\n  Now, in the discussion this morning, I read of the celebration at the \nWhite House by Members of the House and the White House, making some \nsort of deal with respect to Panama, Peru, Colombia, I guess. They \ntalked about labor standards, which I think is very important. In fact, \nthe only trade agreement that has ever had labor standards is the \nJordan agreement. The Clinton administration agreed that the free-trade \nagreement with Jordan would have labor standards.\n  Well, guess what. Last year there were findings of sweatshops \noperating underneath the umbrella of a free-trade agreement with \nsupposedly strong labor standards is in Jordan. Laborers were brought \nover from Bangladesh to sweatshops in Jordan, to turn Chinese materials \ninto garments for sale in the U.S. market. The workers were forced to \nendure 20-hour days; yes, 20-hour days in sweatshop conditions in a \ncountry with whom we have a trade agreement where there are labor \nstandards. These standards mean virtually nothing unless you have \nenforcement. All of these are just words unless you have enforcement. \nAnd this Administration has certainly demonstrated that it has no \ninterest in enforcing labor standards.\n  The Government of Jordan has taken some steps to try to fix some of \nthese problems. Is that because our U.S. trade officials tried to \nenforce the labor provisions in the trade agreement? No. It's because a \nlabor rights group called the National Labor Committee exposed these \nproblems, and because the New York Times wrote a front page story about \nthem. So it's not the labor standards in the trade agreement that got \nthe Jordan government to start to do the right thing, because this \nAdministration never tried to enforce those standards. It was the fact \nthat these abuses were independently exposed and held to the light.\n  These failed trade policies are undermining our country. This is \npulling the rug out from under our country.\n  But this is kind of a Rip Van Winkle moment again. We have an \nannouncement of surging trade deficits, and the Congress just sleeps \nthrough it, the White House sleeps through it. Instead of deciding \nthere is a crisis we ought to deal with, we now see a bunch of people \ngoing to the White House and embracing, saying: We have got a new \nagreement between House leaders and the President with respect to how \nwe are going to proceed on certain trade agreements.\n  Well, let me say to them there is another voice in this Congress, a \nvoice that will come from the Senate. There are some of us that will \ninsist we stand up for the economic interests of this country.\n  I am not suggesting we are against trade. That is not the case. But \nwe will insist there will be a new day in trade agreements that stand \nup for our economic interests. That has not been the case to date.\n  Now, let met finish by going back to the issue of what has happened \nthis week in Wahpeton, ND.\n  Those workers in Wahpeton, ND, appreciated those jobs; good jobs that \npaid well with good benefits. I appreciated the company that was there \nthat made those jobs possible. But I do not appreciate the circumstance \nwhere we are told one day: It is over. Just a few years after we worked \nto get substantial Federal grants and guaranteed Federal loans to \nexpand the manufacturing plant, the very plant we are now told is \nobsolete, or at least the very plant we are now told houses the \nproduction that will be moved elsewhere; production that will be moved \nto Mexico because of lower labor costs.\n  We did not strive for a century to raise standards in this country \njust to find them undermined day after day, by 30-cent or 20-cent-an-\nhour labor in China, or 50-cent-an-hour labor in Mexico. That is not \nthe right approach. It is not an approach that strengthens, it is an \napproach that weakens our country.\n  We expanded the middle class in this country over a century by \nlifting people up. I will not go into great detail about it, but I have \ntold this story 100 times about James Fyler, who died of lead \npoisoning. He was shot 54 times. That is lead poisoning, I guess. He \nwas shot 54 times. The reason he was shot was because in the early part \nof the last century, he insisted that people who went into a coal mine \nto work ought to be able to be paid a fair wage and expected to be \nworking in a safe coal mine; for that he was killed.\n  Over a century, so many men and women worked to raise standards, to \nsay: People ought to have the right to organize, they ought to have the \nright to a minimum wage, a safe workplace. Over a century we lifted \nthose standards. It did something important to expand the middle class \nof this country. But this is being undermined by the massive trade \ndeficits we are running, the $836 billion annual deficit we had in \n2006, and the nearly $64 billion trade deficit we ran in March 2007.\n  I hope one day there will be enough of us in the Congress who will \nsay: Stop. Enough. We are not going to put up with it. We are going to \ninsist and demand that our trade agreements represent the best economic \ninterests of our country. Yes, we want to help others. But most \nimportantly, we want to preserve a standard of living in this country \nthat gives us opportunity for the future.\n  Let me end by saying, again, I believe in trade. I believe in plenty \nof trade. I believe we can compete and compete successfully, but the \nrules have to be fair, and those who negotiate trade agreements have to \ndo so with one eye on how it is going to affect this country.\n  Regrettably, most of the trade negotiations in the last two and a \nhalf decades have been incompetent and I think have pulled the rug out \nfrom under America's workers and dumbed down the standards that many \nhave given their lives to create in this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk to proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is clear--we all agree--that the \nimmigration system is broken and badly in need of a fix. We have 12 \nmillion immigrants, some of who live in constant fear. We have \nemployers facing the quandary each day over who they can hire and who \nthey cannot hire, while raids regularly disrupt and even shut down \ntheir businesses. Crops can't be harvested. Produce is dying on the \nvine because farmers cannot hire enough workers to harvest the crop. \nUnder the current system, there are no winners but lots of losers.\n  Next Tuesday, right after our weekly party conferences, the Senate \nwill have an opportunity to vote on whether to begin debate on the \ncomplex and critical challenge of immigration reform. The bill we \ndebate and eventually pass will give us a chance to strengthen border \nsecurity, put in place an effective and efficient employer verification \nsystem, design a new worker program to take the pressure off the \nborder, and give those 12 million undocumented immigrants the \nopportunity to come out of the shadows and into the light of day.\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\n  Over the past several months, Senators from both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, have spent countless hours negotiating a \nbipartisan solution to this critical challenge. These Senators have \nbeen bargaining in good faith. I believe they are working hard to reach \na compromise. I hope they can do that. But if they are not able to \nreach a new bipartisan agreement, we have an opportunity to move \nforward on a previous bipartisan piece of legislation. The bill I \nplaced on the calendar is the same bill the Senate passed last year \noverwhelmingly with 23 Republicans voting in favor of the legislation. \nLast year's bill was far from perfect. Many of us had misgivings about \nit--this Senator included--but it is a solid, comprehensive package \nthat will serve as a good start for this year's very important and \nvital debate. Several of my colleagues have said we should not move \nforward at this time; let's wait.\n  Over this weekend, there will be negotiations taking place--the rest \nof this day, Saturday, Sunday, and I hope Monday--to see if a \ncompromise can be reached. If we put this off a week, the same thing \nwould happen. People would be trying to work something out at the last \nminute. There has been ample opportunity for people to work out an \narrangement. I have asked publicly and privately that the President be \ninvolved. Members have put so much time and effort into working on an \nimmigration bill, they certainly should embrace a motion to start \ndebate.\n  Those who have threatened a filibuster on the motion to proceed I \nhope will reconsider the threat and understand how illogical it would \nbe not to allow us to proceed. A bill that passed this body last year \nwith 21 Republicans voting for the legislation now saying they are not \ngoing to proceed does not make sense to me.\n  Let me be as clear as I can: By moving this bill, I am trying to make \nsure negotiations continue. There has been ample time for negotiations \nto bear fruit. The purpose of this legislation is to move forward on \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I want this Congress to accomplish \nimmigration reform, but we are running out of time to do it. We have \nset aside the next 2 weeks to do this. After that, we have 4 weeks, and \nthen we have the July 4 recess. After that, 4 more weeks, and then we \nare into the August recess. There is no more time to do it. Today is \nthe time. If we don't do it, starting next Tuesday, there will be no \nimmigration reform this Congress. That would be a real shame.\n  The House is waiting for us to do this. As everyone knows, the \nschedule we have is so crowded. This next 2 weeks, in addition to doing \nimmigration reform, we have to send a bill to the President for \nsupplemental appropriations for the ongoing conflict in Iraq, the civil \nwar in Iraq. We want to try to do our budget. We are going to finish \nWRDA. We have an energy bill we have to do. That is keeping in mind all \nthe procedural hurdles that are always present in the Senate.\n  A vote to proceed is a vote to open debate, not shut the door on it. \nIf a new agreement is reached, it can be offered as a substitute \namendment to this bill on the floor at any time. If a new agreement is \nnot reached, we can legislate the old-fashioned way--taking out what \npeople do not like and putting in new stuff. We can offer amendments to \nthe existing bipartisan bill to make it even better than the one we \npassed last year. Either path leads to progress that is long overdue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The distinguished Republican \nleader and I have had a number of conversations; the last one took \nplace just a few minutes ago here on the Senate floor.\n  As I indicated in my prepared remarks today, there are a number of \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, trying to work something out on \nimmigration. Over the last week or so, they have taken a step forward \nand three-quarters of a step backward. Progress is being made, but it \nhas been incremental, and it has been slow.\n  Some of the Senators believe there is a breakthrough that could take \nplace, but they need all day on Tuesday to do that. Staff is going to \nbe working over the weekend with some Senators.\n  So, reluctantly, but I think in anticipation of the greater good, the \nRepublican leader and I have agreed it would be in the best interests \nof the Senate to put the cloture over on the immigration motion to \nproceed until Wednesday morning. Therefore, I will file cloture on \nMonday on the motion to proceed on immigration--not today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6008-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2206\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Sunday, May 13, is Mother's Day. Motherhood \nand May are a perfect pairing of all that is warm and nurturing. The \nearth is soft and green, with the buds of new leaves and new life \nappearing everywhere. Birds fill the air with their love songs and \nflowers scent the breezes with their soft perfumes. All around us, if \nwe but look, we see the signs of happy motherhood, from the ducklings \nin a neat line behind their mother on a pond to calves curled up asleep \nby their mother's feet in deep green pastures. In neighborhood parks, \nmothers bring their toddlers out to play in the sunshine before their \nafternoon naps or push sleeping newborns in strollers along shade-\ndappled paths. In the springtime, the great cycle of life is at its \nfullest flow.\n  On this one lovely spring Sunday, the Nation heeds the Biblical \nadmonition to ``honor thy mother.'' It is an opportunity to make up for \nthose times all year that we may have overlooked our own mother's \ncontributions to our well-being, or snapped at her well-meaning advice \nand loving attempts to straighten our collars and smooth our hair. Such \nis the lot of mothers--to be essential but so often unappreciated. \nMothers are like water--without a mother, life could not exist, while \nnot enough mothering can stunt growth like a plant in a desert, but too \nmuch mothering can be as smothering as floodwaters on a field of corn.\n  Motherhood is a delicate high-wire act, balancing love and \ndiscipline, care and independence, attention and self-reliance. It is \ntime consuming, often stressful, unpaid, and with no promotion and \nlittle recognition. It is a Sisyphean task. Yet mothers persevere, \nrising each day to begin anew, building families with every meal they \nprepare, every schedule they coordinate, every book they read with \ntheir children, every dirty sock they collect and transform into clean \nand folded laundry. It takes strong women to do it well and to keep up \nthe effort over the many years of childrearing, for this is not a job \nthat one can hand in a resignation letter or shop around a resume to \nfind a better position. It is a job that is truly what a mother makes \nof it, for good or for ill. ``The hand that rocks the cradle is the \nhand that rules the world,'' observed W.R. Wallace.\n  Many great men have noted the influence of their mothers. George \nWashington wrote that ``All I am I owe to my mother.'' Abraham Lincoln \nsaid that ``I remember my mother's prayers and they have always \nfollowed me. They have clung to me all my life.'' Booker T. Washington \nsaid that ``. . . If I have done anything in my life worth attention, I \nfeel sure that I inherited the disposition from my mother.'' Andrew \nJackson observed that ``The memory of my mother and her teachings were, \nafter all, the only capital I had to start life with, and on that \ncapital I have made my way.'' Their mothers' hands surely influenced \nthe world through their mothering.\n  Most mothers will tell you that childrearing does not end after their \nchildren are officially grown up, either. Mothers remain a constant in \nthe lives of their offspring for years afterward, sometimes actively \ninvolved and sometimes waiting in the background in case they are \nneeded. The strains of sustaining the military deployments in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have resulted in many more military families calling upon \ngrandmothers and grandfathers to raise their grandchildren while their \nmilitary parents are deployed overseas for long periods. Strong \nfamilies and loving mothers make this possible, if not desirable.\n  Often mothers with children also find themselves taking up a new and\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\nunnamed role as mother to their own mother as she ages. Single women, \ntoo, can become mothers in this way, picking up more and more of the \ncare of their aging parents. The willingness and love with which \nchildren care for their parents is a direct reflection of how good a \njob their parents did raising them. The writer Charlotte Gray observed \nthat ``Children and mothers never truly part--bound in the beating of \neach other's heart.'' It is just that sometimes, the roles of mother \nand child, caretaker and care-receiver, reverse. And while it can be \nsad to see one's mother failing, the burden of her care is lightened by \nthe warm memories of all the nights her hands tucked in the bedcovers \nor checked a forehead for fever, and by all the prayers her lips have \nuttered on her child's behalf.\n  Mr. President, I close with a poem by an unknown author, entitled \n``Mother's Love'':\n\n                             Mother's Love\n\n     Her love is like an island\n     In life's ocean, vast and wide\n     A peaceful, quiet shelter\n     From the wind, the rain, the tide.\n\n     'Tis bound on the north by Hope,\n     By Patience on the West,\n     By tender Counsel on the South,\n     And on the East by Rest.\n\n     Above it like a beacon light\n     Shine Faith, and Truth, and Prayer;\n     And thro' the changing scenes of life\n     I find a haven there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6011-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO LILY STEVENS, THE LAW SCHOOL GRADUATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last month, this Chamber celebrated a \nmilestone day in the life of our dear colleague, Senator Ted Stevens. \nOn April 13, the senior Senator from Alaska became the longest serving \nRepublican Senator in history. This was an important day for him. It \nwas an historic day for us.\n  But having served in this Chamber with Senator Stevens for more than \nfour decades, and knowing him as I do, I feel confident that, in a few \ndays, he will be celebrating what to him will be an even more important \nday. This Saturday, May 12, his lovely, talented, and beloved daughter \nLily will graduate from law school. She will receive her Juris Doctor \ndegree from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.\n  I extend my heartiest congratulations to Lily, whom I know quite \nwell. I remember her as an infant when her father carried her around \nthe Capitol in a basket. I remember attending the birthday parties that \nher father gave her. I enjoyed watching her grow up. Now she is the \ngraduate of one of our Nation's most prestigious law schools. And she \nis ready to embark upon what I am confident will be a rewarding, \nproductive, and most successful career.\n  Knowing Lily as I do, I am sure that she will see her graduation, not \nas the end, but as just another step in her educational endeavors. As \nSolon, one of the seven wise men of Greece, observed, ``I grow old in \nthe pursuit of learning.'' Although Lily is a young woman, I am \nconfident that she will grow old ``in pursuit of learning.''\n  Today, I congratulate her and wish her the best as she completes an \nimportant milestone in her education and her life, and embarks upon the \nnext endeavor.\n  And I also congratulate her father, Senator Ted Stevens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6011-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6011-S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ABUSIVE LITIGATION IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about abusive \nlitigation in America. Unfortunately, many personal injury lawyers' \ninsatiable appetites for a big payday by any theory imaginable are \nnever satisfied, and so I come yet again to speak about tort reform--an \nissue I have worked on nearly every year that I have been in the \nSenate.\n  Earlier this week, as part of an ongoing effort to bring much-needed \nreform to our civil-justice system, I reintroduced the Commonsense \nConsumption Act with Senators Pryor, Graham, Baucus, Cornyn, Lincoln, \nAlexander, Dole, and Bunning.\n  When I first introduced the Commonsense Consumption Act in July of \n2003, the effort by some unscrupulous personal injury lawyers to target \nfood manufacturers and sellers was only beginning to take shape.\n  In fact, I noted at that time an article in the satirical newspaper \n``The Onion.'' This newspaper had gotten a big laugh through a spoof \narticle entitled ``Hershey's Ordered to Pay Obese Americans $135 \nBillion.''\n  The article poked fun at the worst excesses of plaintiff's attorneys, \ndescribing a class-action suit that accused the candy company of \n``knowingly and willfully marketing rich, fatty candy bars, containing \nchocolate and other ingredients of negligible nutritional value.''\n  That spoof was published in August of 2000. But almost 7 years later, \nfarce has become reality.\n  Frivolous lawsuits against the food industry are moving forward on a \nnumber of different fronts and a growing cadre of academics, \noverzealous public health advocates, and of course, personal injury \nlawyers, are forthright about their intentions to make food \nmanufacturers and sellers the victims of their next huge payday.\n  One of the more prominent members of the movement to sue the food \nindustry is John Banzhaf, a personal injury attorney and a professor. \nBanzhaf appears often in the media to discuss strategies for suing food \nproducers and sellers.\n  In one appearance, Banzhaf told an interviewer in regard to obesity \nlawsuits:\n\n       [Y]ou may not like it . . . but we'll find a judge. And \n     then we'll find a jury.\n\n  During another interview, Banzhaf proclaimed:\n\n     . . . we're going to sue them and sue them and sue them, and \n     I think ultimately, as with tobacco, we're going to win.\n\n  The comparison of this litigation to the tobacco suits is apt, \nbecause trial attorneys are eager to find another industry to bear the \nburden of inflating their bank accounts. As Banzhaf told National \nPublic Radio:\n\n     . . . when we proposed that the states would sue for the cost \n     of health care for lung cancer, heart attack and so on, \n     people thought the lawyers bringing those suits were crazy. \n     They called them crazy. Today, we call them something else. \n     We call them multimillionaires, because, as you know, they \n     won over $250 billion.\n\n  Indeed, a great deal of time and energy is being invested into \nstrategies to transfer huge sums from the food industry to overeating \nplaintiffs and, more to the point, their exceedingly active lawyers.\n  But these lawsuits are not only about money. They also represent \nattempts by a small group of lawyers and special-interest groups to \nsubvert the legislative process and impose by litigation what they \ncannot achieve at the ballot box. In 1999, Robert Reich, former \nSecretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton, said that, ``The era \nof big government may be over, but the era of regulation by litigation \nhas just begun.''\n  Last November, a group calling itself the Public Health Advocacy \nInstitute held its fourth annual conference regarding obesity \nlitigation.\n  This is the same Public Health Advocacy Institute whose 2004 \nConference featured a memorable overhead projection display proclaiming \n``Patience, hell. Let's sue somebody.'' And these groups will sue, and \nthey will sue, and they will sue, until they have imposed their \nspecial-interest policy preferences on the rest of America.\n  This kind of reckless litigation cannot be allowed to continue. A \nGallup poll found that 89 percent of Americans oppose holding the food \nindustry legally responsible for the diet-related health problems of \npeople who choose to eat fast-food on a regular basis.\n  The economic repercussions of this sort of frivolous litigation are \nvery real. In fact, the food industry is one of the most important \nengines for our Nation's economy. The food retail sector of the \nindustry is America's largest private-sector employer, providing jobs \nand livelihoods for more than 12 million Americans. Estimates suggest \nthat the food industry is responsible for 4 percent of the United \nStates GDP.\n  Nor is this an industry dominated by a small number of large market \nparticipants. Numerous mom-and-pop grocery stores, family-owned and \noperated restaurants, specialty producers, and other small businesses \nwill find themselves in the crosshairs of the personal injury lawyers \ntrying to cash in on obesity-related lawsuits.\n  Wayne Reaves, an entrepreneur who operates seven quick-service \nrestaurants in the Northern Alabama region, testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Administrative\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\nOversight and the Courts on the dangers that obesity lawsuits pose for \nsmall businesses. Mr. Reaves gave compelling testimony about the \ncatastrophic effects that such a lawsuit could have on him and his 196 \nemployees. He then noted an even more insidious cost of obesity \nlawsuits:\n\n       But beyond the costs of defending a potential suit and the \n     risks to my business that go along with it, there are other \n     significant and detrimental effects. For instance, the mere \n     threat of such a suit can have a direct impact on the cost \n     of insuring my business. Insurance companies have \n     acknowledged that they are watching these lawsuits very \n     closely, and they recognize that this litigation is very \n     much a factor in how they may price future liability \n     products for food companies.\n\n  Mr. Reaves' testimony is especially important, because it highlights \nthe fact that much more is at stake in the obesity lawsuit debate than \nthe transfer of huge monetary sums from businesses to wealthy trial \nlawyers. If the mere threat of these lawsuits is not removed, then \neconomic ripples will negatively impact every sector of the food \nindustry. Even the ordinary consumer will feel this impact in the form \nof higher retail prices.\n  These lawsuits may even have the perverse effect of exacerbating the \nproblems of overweight Americans. By trying to assign responsibility \nfor overeating to food producers and sellers, the obesity lawsuit \nmovement may be actively discouraging the kind of personal \nresponsibility needed for Americans to develop healthier eating habits.\n  Let me be clear: This bill is not intended to minimize the problem of \novereating. In fact, overweight Americans need to design healthier \nlifestyles for themselves and their children. America is blessed with \nan abundant, affordable food supply and an overwhelming number of food \nchoices. With so many food choices, some of us overdo it.\n  That overindulgence, combined with an underindulgence of exercise, \ncan have negative health consequences. But most of us take \nresponsibility for the amount and the type of food we put in our mouth, \nand we accept the consequences of these decisions.\n  Unfortunately, some personal injury lawyers are now trying to \nconvince Americans with expanding waistlines that someone else is to \nblame for their weight problem. This is precisely the wrong message to \nsend to Americans who may be struggling with their weight.\n  Dr. Gerard J. Musante is an adjunct professor at Duke University and \nfounder of Structure House, a well-known and highly respected \nresidential weight loss center in Durham, North Carolina. Dr. Musante \nhas testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that he was \nconcerned about the message sent to overweight Americans by litigation \nrelated to obesity.\n  Dr. Musante's viewpoint on this issue is worth our full attention. \nSpecifically, he testified that:\n\n       Lawsuits are pointing fingers at the food industry in an \n     attempt to curb the nation's obesity epidemic. These lawsuits \n     do nothing but enable consumers to feel powerless in a battle \n     for maintaining one's own personal health. The truth is, we \n     as consumers have control over the food choices we make, and \n     we must issue our better judgment when making these \n     decisions. Negative lifestyle choices cause obesity, not a \n     trip to the fast food restaurant or a cookie high in trans \n     fat. Certainly we live in a litigious society. Our \n     understanding of psychological issues tells us that when \n     people feel frustrated and powerless, they lash out and seek \n     reasons for their perceived failure. They feel the victim and \n     look for the deep pockets to pay. Unfortunately, this has \n     become part of our culture, but the issue is far too \n     comprehensive to lay blame on any single food marketer or \n     manufacturer. These industries should not be demonized for \n     providing goods and services demanded by our society.\n\n  Dr. Musante is absolutely right, and this bill is designed to ensure \nthat an individual's eating habits do not become the province of our \nalready overcrowded judicial system.\n  The bill is narrowly tailored to apply only to frivolous lawsuits \nseeking to shift responsibility for unhealthy lifestyle choices. It \nacknowledges that weight gain and its consequences have numerous \ninterrelated causes, including genetic factors, physical activity, and \nother lifestyle choices unrelated to consumption of food manufactured \nor sold by a specific restaurant or corner store.\n  It is not intended to limit a plaintiff's ability to pursue legal \naction against food manufacturers or sellers who are found to be \nengaged in wrongdoing. In fact, let me be clear about what this bill \nwill not do:\n  It would not affect lawsuits against food manufacturers or sellers \nthat knowingly and willfully violate Federal or State statutes \napplicable to the manufacture or sale of food. This means that suits \nbased on knowing misrepresentations regarding nutritional information \nor other statements would not be precluded by this bill.\n  It would not apply to lawsuits for breach of contract or express \nwarranty.\n  It would not apply to claims relating to ``adulterated'' food or \nprovide immunity to restaurants that improperly store, handle, or \nprepare food leading to an illness.\n  It would not apply to claims stemming from the use of dietary \nsupplements.\n  In short, it will not provide widespread legal immunity for the food \nindustry. It only provides protection from abusive lawsuits by people \nseeking to blame someone else for their poor eating habits.\n  I should mention that in the 109th Congress, the House voted on \nsimilar legislation. That bill, entitled the ``Personal Responsibility \nin Food Consumption Act,'' passed the House on October 19, 2005, by the \noverwhelming margin of 306-120.\n  In our overly litigious society, this bill delivers an important \nmessage about personal responsibility. Americans have the freedom to \nmake choices about the food they want to eat, and those choices cannot \nbe litigated away. Frivolous lawsuits are not a substitute for the \nconsidered judgment of legislatures and regulatory agencies about the \nbest ways to encourage healthy lifestyles that include a proper diet \nand exercise.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in taking an important step to \npreserve common sense in the judicial system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6012-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Private First Class Katie Soenksen\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

My thoughts and \nprayers are with her parents, Mary Ann and Ronald Soenksen, her brother \nand sister, and all her family and friends as they grieve her loss. \nKatie is one of many members of her extended family who have served \ntheir country in the military, and she felt a calling to military \nservice. She even visited her former high school, Davenport North, to \nrecruit for the Army. She joined the Army knowing full well what \nsacrifices she might be asked to make, but she believed in what she was \ndoing and in her mission in Iraq. Katie kept in regular contact with \nher family and reported about the tremendous good she and her fellow \nsoldiers were doing to make better the lives of everyday Iraqis. \nCertainly the Iraqi citizens whose lives she helped to improve, as well \nas all Americans, whose security she has helped ensure, owe her a \ntremendous debt of gratitude. Our Nation is truly blessed to have such \ncitizens as Katie Soenksen who are prepared to make the ultimate \nsacrifice for our freedom, and I am proud to call her an Iowan. Words \ncannot adequately express the thanks owed to her and her family, who \nfeel her loss so deeply.

Mr. President, in order to get a handle on today's gun \nviolence among students, we must increase our awareness on the issue. \nLast week, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence released a report \nthat draws attention to the gun lobby's efforts over the past few years \nto change college campus rules that prohibit firearms. The report \ndetails the gun lobby's efforts in multiple States to pressure colleges \nto allow the possession and use of firearms by students and others on \ncampus.\n  The report, ``No Gun Left Behind: The Gun Lobby's Campaign to Push \nGuns into Colleges and Schools,'' reveals a letter addressed to a Maine \nlegislator from the National Rifle Association Institute for \nLegislative Action on April 2, 2007, emphatically opposing legislation \nto ``allow any college or university to regulate the possession of \nfirearms on the property of the college or university.'' It also \ndescribes the gun lobby's support for a law passed in Utah that \nexpressly prohibits public school districts, public schools, and State \ninstitutions of higher education from keeping guns off campuses. \nSimilar legislation was proposed in Virginia last year.\n  ``Our schools should be sanctuaries, not armed camps,'' stated Paul \nHelmke, President of the Brady Center. ``Institutions of higher \neducation already have chosen policies either banning or tightly \ncontrolling guns on campus. That is as it should be. These institutions \nare responsible for the safety of their students and the security of \ntheir campuses and should continue to have the right to control \nfirearms.''\n  No Gun Left Behind also details some of the reasons bringing guns \nonto campus increases the danger to students and faculty alike. Every \nyear approximately 1,100 college students commit suicide, with an \nadditional 24,000 attempting suicide. Roughly 90 percent of those who \nattempt suicide with a firearm are successful. And, there is a \nsignificant danger of guns being stolen in the dorm setting.\n  As Congress considers sensible gun legislation, I urge my colleagues \nto read this important report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6013-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women \nthat serve our Nation as military spouses. I greatly admire the \nstrength, courage, and commitment of these special individuals.\n  In 1984, President Ronald Regan recognized the vital importance and \npersonal sacrifice of the military spouse by declaring the Friday \nbefore Mother's Day as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. The impact \nthat the military spouse has on the readiness and effectiveness of \ntoday's all-volunteer Armed Forces cannot be overstated.\n  However, military spouses are rarely thanked or recognized for the \nvital role that they play in maintaining our national security.\n  Today, more than 50 percent of our total force is married. Of the \n1.12 million military spouses 92 percent are women, 78 percent are \nenlisted spouses, 57 percent are between the ages of 25-40 years, 73 \npercent have children, and 65 percent also work outside of the home.\n  The Armed Forces' current operational tempo has placed unique \nchallenges and extraordinary strain on our military families. Months of \nwaiting and late nights filled with worry about a forward deployed \nloved one can take a toll on the most steadfast and stout-hearted man \nor woman. Despite this intense strain, military spouses have remained \ncommitted and loyal to their servicemember and families. These men and \nwomen know the true meaning of sacrifice and devotion.\n  Today, America says thank you to our loving military spouses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6013-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the hard \nwork and sacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers all across \nour great land. Many officers have lost their lives in the line of duty \nso that our families and communities may remain safe. We must never \nforget those who have given their lives to protect us all.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy first declared the annual \ncelebration of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week in \n``recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and \nday, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our \nlaws.''\n  Sadly, since the turn of the last century, more than 126 law \nenforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty in New \nMexico. This year, two New Mexico police officers will be honored and \nremembered by having their names added to the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial in Washington, DC.\n  The first, Deputy James McGrane was tragically shot and killed on \nMarch 22, 2006 while making a traffic stop. Unknown at the time to \nDeputy McGrane, the driver of the vehicle Michael Paul Astorga was \nwanted for a 2005 murder. As he approached the vehicle, Deputy McGrane \nwas cold bloodedly shot twice and died at the scene. A massive manhunt \nin New Mexico ensued. After the case was profiled on the television \nshow Americas Most Wanted Astorga was apprehended in Juarez, Mexico and \nexpedited to the United States. Deputy McGrane had served with the \nBernalillo County Sheriff's Department for three years and had \npreviously served with the New Mexico State Police and the U.S. Postal \nInspection Service.\n  Also being honored this week is Patrolman James Archuleta of Espanola \nwho was killed June 4, 2006, in an automobile accident. Patrolman \nArchuleta was responding to a shooting when the accident occurred. \nPatrolman Archuleta had served with the New Mexico State Police for 2 \nyears and was also a member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves.\n  This week we remember the dedication of Deputy McGrane and Patrolman \nArchuleta and all of our fallen policemen and women who protect and \nserve our communities, and the tragic price they paid for that \ndevotion. We must also remember the families of all fallen officers and \nthe sacrifices they have incurred because of a deep-seated commitment \nto duty and public service. All of us from New Mexico owe a debt of \ngratitude to each and every officer who has lost their life in the line \nof duty. To those who continue to serve, we are grateful. You have my \nutmost admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6013-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6013-S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, due to my flight from Rhode Island being \ndelayed, I was unavoidably absent for vote No. 151, the Cochran second-\ndegree amendment No. 1010 to the Dorgan amendment No. 990.\n  Had I been present, I would have opposed the Cochran amendment. While \nI have supported the Cochran amendment in the past, the amendment this \ntime seeks to amend a different and vastly strengthened Dorgan \nreimportation proposal. Senators Dorgan and Snowe have acknowledged the \nsafety concerns that have been raised in the past and have sought to \naddress them. Specifically, their amendment establishes a framework for \nthe registration and regulation of exporting pharmacies and \nwholesalers. It also directs the FDA to initiate a process to approve \nidentical medications as FDA-approved products in the United States. \nThe amendment also requires clear labeling and documentation of the \ndrug from the point of origin to the point of sale. I believe these \nseries of measures greatly improve the Dorgan amendment, reduce the \nrisk of counterfeit products entering the domestic drug supply chain, \nand assure the safety of reimported drugs. The Dorgan-Snowe proposal \nalso meets the second test set forth in the Cochran second degree \namendment--cost savings. According to Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nestimates, implementation of prescription drug importation provisions \nwould lead to $50 million in direct savings. However, the CBO also \nfound that imposing the Cochran amendment would reduce those potential \nsavings to zero.\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\n  The time has come for Congress to move forward with a thoughtful and \nresponsible framework for drug reimportation. In a free market economy \nsuch as ours, it seems unfair that we have permitted a system that only \nallows the manufacturers to reimport drug products. It is essential \nthat we find ways to reduce drug prices for Americans and one approach \nis by allowing drug reimportation. As such, we can and should, with the \nappropriate safeguards, allow a more open prescription drug \nreimportation regime to take hold in this country. The Dorgan-Snowe \nproposal offers a reasonable and responsible framework for such an \nendeavor to begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6014-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the fifth \nanniversary of the Wachovia Championship golf tournament and its \ncontribution to charitable causes in North Carolina.\n  Several years ago, a group of North Carolinians gathered to begin the \nplanning for this first-class event. Under their leadership, the \nWachovia Championship has quickly risen to the top echelon of sporting \nevents in the country. In only 5 short years, the Wachovia Championship \nhas become known as one of the preeminent golf tournaments in the \ncountry--second only to the major championships.\n  The organizers desired to create a premier sporting event that would \nprovide a first-class experience for patrons, PGA tour players, and \nvolunteers that at the same time would have a significant economic \nimpact for the Carolinas, showcase our State and region to a national \nand international television audience, and most importantly, raise \nsignificant funds for charitable causes in the State.\n  On all accounts, the Wachovia Championship has been a resounding \nsuccess story. This year alone, the Wachovia Championship will have an \neconomic impact of over $45 million in the state of North Carolina.\n  The primary beneficiary of the success of the Wachovia Championship \nis Teach for America. Funds generated from the tournament are used to \nsupport the national efforts of this organization. Teach for America is \nthe national corps of outstanding college graduates who commit 2 years \nto teach in low-income communities and become advocates for expanding \neducational opportunity. Since 1990 nearly 17,000 college graduates \nhave joined Teach for America, impacting the lives of over 2.5 million \nstudents.\n  In North Carolina, Teach for America has over 250 corps members \nteaching in Charlotte, Durham and communities across the eastern half \nof the State.\n  Since the inception of the tournament, over $4 million has been \ngenerated for Teach for America from the success of the Wachovia \nChampionship in Charlotte.\n  As you can see, this is much more than just a golf tournament. The \nWachovia Championship is a community and economic success story.\n  I congratulate the organizers and the thousands of volunteers that \nmake the Wachovia Championship one of the special events that makes our \nstate of North Carolina proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6014-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING DEE SARTON\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

On Wednesday \nnights, just before signing off the early evening news, she introduces \nsibling groups or older youth who are waiting for adoptive homes, and \nher compelling, sensitive interviews with these young people have \ntouched the hearts of families across the Nation.

The dedication and patriotism of this Army \nReserve unit from Olathe, KS, truly makes all Kansans and Americans \nproud.\n  In October 2005, Pakistan suffered a severe disaster when a 7.6-\nmagnitude earthquake devastated the country. This unit, known as the \nSpartans, was in the midst of training at Fort Sill, OK, to prepare for \nits deployment to Afghanistan when they received orders to assist in \nthe humanitarian relief efforts.

During the 5 months \nof this operation, the Spartans flew 2,633 missions where they \ndelivered more than 18 million pounds of supplies, transported almost \n7,000 refugees, and medically evacuated 311 casualties. This mission \nproved to be the longest and largest helicopter relief mission in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  Following their relief mission, the unit deployed to Afghanistan to \nprovide heavy-lift support for combat operations at Kandahar Airfield \nin southern Afghanistan. During their 7-month\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\ndeployment, the unit contributed to three major offensive operations by \ntransporting troops and supplies in some of the most difficult \nconditions for aviation operations.\n  In early October 2006, the unit returned to Pakistan for Operation \nPromise Keeping, a mission to commemorate the 1-year anniversary of the \nearthquake. The unit delivered more than 87 tons of steel sheets, \ncement, and construction materials to help with rebuilding efforts in \nPakistan.\n  This weekend, at the Army Aviation Association of America's annual \nconvention, the unit is being recognized as the Army Reserve Aviation \nUnit of the Year. The Pakistani people will forever remember the \nservant hearts of these military members. It is with an overwhelming \nsense of gratitude that I wish to recognize these fine service members \nand their families for their dedication to the cause of freedom and \ncongratulate them on their much deserved award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6015-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF MARGARET SPRING\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a member \nof my staff who retired from service to the Senate after dedicating 8 \nyears to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Margaret \nSpring, Democratic general counsel for the Commerce Committee, left the \nSenate for love. In doing so, she will be leaving behind a record of \naccomplishment that will be difficult for anyone to match. During her \n8-year tenure on the committee, more than 10 major ocean and coastal \ninitiatives, which she was heavily involved in drafting, have been \nenacted into law, including the National Sea Grant College Program \nReauthorization, the Oceans and Human Health Act, Coast Guard \nReauthorization Acts, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments \nAct, the Tsunami Preparedness Act, and the Marine Debris Research, \nPrevention, and Reduction Act. Probably most notable are the first and \nlast pieces of legislation Margaret worked on. The first was the Oceans \nAct of 2000, and the final bill was the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Reauthorization Act.\n  What is clear from the passage of all these bills is both Margaret's \nability to successfully negotiate and work in a bipartisan fashion, \nregardless of whether she was in the minority or the majority, and her \nunwavering commitment to making the world we live in a better place for \ntoday and for the future. Her trustworthiness and constant striving for \nperfection provided a process where every staffer who worked with her \nbelieved the final product was a true reflection of negotiations and \ndiscussions, and the outside parties that had an interest in the \nlegislation, whether environmental or industry groups, while not \nnecessarily agreeing completely with the ultimate outcome, felt like \ntheir voices were heard. The best example of her abilities is the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act, which passed by unanimous consent with support \nfrom the fishing industry and environmental groups, a rarity in this \nday.\n  A hallmark of Margaret's legacy will be a cleaner and healthier \nenvironment for generations to come. The Oceans Act, which passed in \n2000, created the Ocean Commission, consisting of this country's \nleading ocean experts. Without the legislation enacted though her \nefforts, Congress and the administration would be without a landmark \nblueprint. Margaret's work, in combination with efforts of other \ndedicated members and staff, has given us guideposts for what we must \ndo to sustain the ocean environment for future generations.\n  While Margaret has left the Senate, she has not left her call to \npublic service, to preserving the coastal environment, or to improving \nthe planet for the next generation. While she and her new husband have \ndecided to move to the West coast, she also decided to continue her \npassionate interest in the marine environment with a nonprofit \norganization whose mission is to preserve environmental diversity \nthrough the protection of lands and waters. The Commerce Committee, the \nSenate, and this country have benefited from Margaret's dedication \nduring the past 8 years, and while she will be missed, the country will \ncontinue to benefit from her commitment, dedication, and tireless \nefforts to improve the world we live in.\n  On the eve of Margaret Spring's wedding to Mark Bunter, we wish her \nwell as she embarks on a new chapter of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6015-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GREG STEVENS\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the late \nGregory Clark Stevens--an incredible political strategist, loyal \nRepublican, wonderful husband and father and a terrific friend to me \nand my wife Janet.\n  Last month, our Lord took Greg from us after 58 years on Earth. \nGreg's last days weren't easy on him or his family as he suffered from \nbrain cancer. But he was able to find an inner peace that I know helped \nhim in his final days.\n  Looking back, Greg had a full and accomplished career--a career that \nled to many people, including myself, getting elected and doing immense \ngood for our Nation.\n  After graduating from the University of Maine in 1971, he spent half \na decade as a reporter in New Jersey, and was then hired as President \nGerald Ford's reelection campaign press secretary. He was hired by \nformer New Jersey assemblyman turned campaign manager for Ford, Thomas \nKean. Kean later returned to New Jersey and, after a defeat running for \nthe same office, he was later elected Governor and hired Greg to be his \ncommunications director. When Kean was reelected in 1981 he made Greg \nhis chief of staff.\n  A fellow Ohioan, Roger Ailes, hired Greg in 1988 to work on Vice \nPresident George H.W. Bush's campaign for the Presidency. Then, 2 years \nlater, Greg ran my successful campaign to be Governor of the great \nState of Ohio.\n  A few years later Greg opened his own consulting business in the \nWashington suburbs and had many clients. I remained one of them, with \nGreg running my multimedia campaign in 1994 for my second term as \nGovernor, then in 1998 and 2004 for my current Senate seat. He did a \nmarvelous job and we became good friends. And it meant a great deal to \nJanet and me that we had someone working with us who cared so much \nabout us personally. We always said hiring Greg was the best decision \nwe ever made.\n  But it was his genuine caring for me and my family that translated \ninto his incredible television ads that helped get and keep me elected. \nGreg always ``got us,'' we used to say, and got our values. And he \ncommunicated those values through his commercials in a way that no one \nelse could.\n  Over the years Greg has worked for many famous people and been \ninvolved in numerous historic and epic political battles. But that is \nnot how I really remember him. I remember Greg as a fine man and good \nfriend.\n  As time goes on and we get older, and our families seem to grow and \ngrow, our free time seems to shrink more and more. So there wasn't a \nlot of time for me to make it up to Maine to see my friend Greg. But I \ndid take the time to send him a letter right before he passed.\n  In that letter I reminded him of the good work he did on behalf of me \nand the Nation, and about how I cherished our friendship and fighting \nthe good fight together, but also about how worried I am about our kids \nand grandkids and what kind of opportunities they will have in the \nfuture. I told him I would love to talk to him about these things again \nsoon but, unfortunately, time ran out.\n  Greg Stevens meant a lot to a lot of people. And he did so much good \nwhile he was with us here on Earth.\n  A minister's son, I know Greg found comfort knowing this life was not \nall there was. I concluded my letter to Greg with this: ``I'm sure you \nare comforted by the thought that you will be with our Father, \neternally happy, and that one day we all will be together again.''\n  I look forward to seeing my good friend Greg once again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6015-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6015-S6016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DEL GREENFIELD\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, those of us entrusted to represent \nour States in the Senate are so unbelievably fortunate thanks to the \nwonderful people we meet and work with along the way. These encounters \nremind us on a regular basis of the inherent goodness of\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\nso many folks, and of their dedication to making our communities, our \nNation and our world a better place in which to live and raise \nfamilies. Today I pay tribute to one such person--a very special \nperson--I was blessed to have met along the way.\n  Del Greenfield, who passed away just last month, was an extraordinary \nwife, mother, and citizen whose uncommon commitment to humankind and \npeace touched thousands of people and enriched our world in ways that \nwill ripple across generations for as long as we humans will inhabit \nthis Earth.\n  I met Del and her husband, Lou, long ago when I was running the Grey \nPanthers in Oregon. She was a well-known political activist and worked \nfor some outstanding public servants, including Governor Bob Straub and \nmy former colleague, Congressman Les AuCoin. In the early eighties, Del \nbegan to lead the Portland chapter of Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, and it was there that she made a profound and \nunforgettable impression on so many government leaders who played a \nrole in deciding matters of war and peace, equality and inequality, \njustice and injustice.\n  She was well known to those of us in public office for several \nreasons. We all came to respect her tremendous command of grassroots \npolitics. She harbored an unflinching belief in the power of people to \neffect change, and she was quite skillful at organizing her troops and \nusing the strength of the many to overcome the sometimes unnatural \nadvantages of the most fortunate few.\n  She was also unforgettable because of her unyielding, boundless \npassion for her beliefs and her mission. Del was full of praise for us \nwhen she approved of what we were up to--and thankfully, that was most \nof the time with me--but she never, ever gave up when we took an action \nshe disagreed with. Even when that disagreement had long passed, Del \ncontinued to view those disappointments as potential teachable moments, \nas opportunities for our growth. On those occasions, Del could chew on \nyou pretty good, but if she liked you, she always did it with a smile \non her lips and a twinkle in her eyes. She frequently forgave, but she \nnever forgot.\n  And, importantly, and this was perhaps the root of her high standing \nwith all of us, there was never any doubt about Del's motives. If she \npossessed any ego, I never encountered it. The one thing I always knew \nabout Del, even on those rare occasions where we disagreed, was that it \nwas never about her. She was inherently decent and kind and involved in \nall of her causes for all the right reasons.\n  I am so proud to have had Del and Lou as two of my earliest \nsupporters and am so honored to have had the opportunity to work with \nand learn from such a wonderful, powerful woman. She and Lou leave to \nus all a legacy of hope and goodness that will be carried on for \ngenerations to come by her wonderful children, their grandchildren, \ntheir great grandchildren, and the thousands of others who have been \ntouched by their loving, good works.\n  Because I know she is still watching me closely, and because I know \nshe could care less about how many nice things I have to say about her, \nDel, I will think of you every opportunity I get to end this misguided \nwar in Iraq. And I will think of you every time I have an opportunity \nto bring about lasting peace, justice, and equality. Your lessons and \nlove will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6016-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:01 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1684.

A bill to amend the Denali Commission Act of 1998 to modify \nthe authority of the Commission; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to introduce S. \n1368, a bill to reauthorize a Federal-State partnership known as the \nDenali Commission. This Commission plays a crucial role in the \ndevelopment of basic infrastructure for communities in rural Alaska.\n  The Denali Commission was originally established by Congress in 1998. \nThe unique structure of the Commission ensures the most efficient \nallocation of Federal funds, as it caps administrative expenses at 5 \npercent and capitalizes on the use of strategic partnerships. Over the \ncourse of the past decade, the Commission has partnered with Federal \nand State agencies, tribal organizations, and local communities to \naddress the unique challenges associated with living in Alaska. In just \na short period of time, the Commission has improved the living \nconditions of rural Alaska by providing job training, teacher housing \nand funds to improve options for handling solid waste. The bulk fuel \nprojects undertaken by the Commission have reduced the costs of rural \nenergy. The health clinics have increased the availability of health \nservices to rural villages that are isolated from metropolitan areas. \nThere are 240 Alaska Native Villages, and over 100 communities have \nbeen served by the Denali Commission.\n  Although the Denali Commission has made tremendous strides to ensure \nrural Alaska has basic living conditions, there still is work to be \ndone. Many of the rural communities have no roads and their \ntransportation infrastructure is deteriorating. Numerous villages can \nonly be accessed by water, and the docks in the communities are in \ndesperate need of repair. The projects conducted by the Denali \nCommission not only keep communities connected to mainstream Alaska, \nprojects also foster economic growth. The unemployment rates in many \nvillages remain above 50 percent. The high cost of basic needs, such as \nmilk and oil, coupled with public infrastructure that is comparable to \ndeveloping nations create difficult circumstance in rural Alaska. The \nDenali Commission is our best hope for properly addressing these issues \nand meeting the needs of Alaskans.\n  The continuation of the Denali Commission's presence in rural Alaska \nis of critical importance to the future of rural Alaska. The bill I \nintroduce today would reauthorize the Denali Commission for 5 years, \nthrough fiscal year 2014.\n  Other provisions of this bill would also amend the Denali Commission \nAct of 1998 to make the Commission stronger and more efficient.\n  Senator Murkowski is an original cosponsor of this legislation, and \nit is our hope the Senate will act quickly to reauthorize the Denali \nCommission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1369. A bill to grant immunity from civil liability to any person \nwho voluntarily notifies appropriate security personnel of suspicious \nactivity believed to threaten transportation safety or security or \ntakes reasonable action to mitigate such activity; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould provide immunity to individuals who report suspicious activities \nthat may reflect terrorist threats to our transportation system. I am \nvery honored that Senators Kyl and Lieberman have joined me in \nintroducing this important bill.\n  The recent arrest in New Jersey of six men charged with conspiring to \nmurder American soldiers at Fort Dix underscores the need for this \nbill. Law enforcement officials have noted that their investigation was \ntriggered by the report of an alert store clerk who said a customer had \nbrought in a video that showed men firing weapons and shouting in \nArabic. This reminded the store clerk of the 9/11 terrorists.\n  But for the report of this store clerk, it is unlikely this potential \nplot against Fort Dix--a plot that if executed would have caused the \nloss of lives--would have been uncovered. That store clerk's action may \nhave saved literally hundreds of lives and represents a core truth of \nthe dangerous times in which we live. Our safety depends on more than \njust police officers, intelligence analysts, and soldiers. It also \ndepends on the alertness and civil responsibility of ordinary American \ncitizens, including the peaceful and tolerant people who form the vast \nmajority of America's Muslim communities.\n  We must encourage average citizens to be watchful and report behavior \nthat appears to be suspicious or threatening. That imperative is \nespecially strong in the area of mass transportation, where there is \nthe potential for mass casualties, where vehicles and aircraft can be \nused as weapons, and where there is often only a brief period of time \nfor assessing and reacting to alarming behavior. That is why the slogan \n``See something, say something,'' is used in the New York subway.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen that plaintiffs can misuse our legal \nsystem to chill the willingness of average citizens to come forward and \nreport possible dangers. As was widely reported last fall, six Islamic \nclerics were removed from a USAirways flight after other passengers \nexpressed concerns that some of the clerics had moved out of their \nassigned seats and had requested, but apparently were not using, \nseatbelt extenders that could possibly double as weapons.\n  As a result of that incident, what happened? Well, the USAirways \nofficials decided to remove these individuals from the plane so they \ncould further investigate. What happened to the individuals who \ncourageously came forward and reported this suspicious behavior? \nUnbelievably, they were sued for voicing their fears that the clerics \ncould be rehearsing or preparing to execute a hijacking. These honestly \nconcerned passengers found themselves as defendants in lawsuits that \nwere filed in March.\n  The existence of this lawsuit clearly illustrates how unfair it is to \nallow private citizens to possibly be intimidated into silence by the \nthreat of litigation. Would that alert clerk in the store have come \nforward if he thought there was a chance he was going to be sued? Would \nthe passengers have spoken up if they had anticipated there would be a \nlawsuit filed against them? Even if such suits fail, they can expose \ncitizens to heavy costs in time and legal fees.\n  Our bill would provide civil immunity in American courts for citizens\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nacting in good faith who report threats to our transportation systems.\n  The bill would encourage people to pass on information to appropriate \ntransportation system officials and employees, to law enforcement or \ntransportation security officials, or to the Departments of Homeland \nSecurity, Justice, or Transportation, without fear of being sued just \nfor doing their civic duty.\n  Only disclosures made to those responsible officials and employees \nwould be protected by the legislation's grant of immunity. Once a \nreport is received, those officials would be responsible for assessing \nits reasonableness and determining whether further action is required. \nIf these officials take reasonable action to mitigate the reported \nthreat, they, too, would be protected from lawsuits. Just as we should \nnot discourage reporting suspicious incidents, we also should not \ndiscourage reasonable responses to them.\n  Let me make very clear this bill does not offer any protection \nwhatsoever if an individual makes a statement that he or she knows to \nbe false. No one will be able to use this bill, should it become law, \nas I hope it will, as a cover for mischievous, vengeful, or biased \nfalsehoods.\n  Our laws and legal system must not be hijacked to intimidate people \ninto silence or to prevent our officials from responding to terrorist \nthreats. Protecting citizens who make good-faith reports--and that is \nan important qualification in this bill--protecting citizens who make \ngood-faith reports of potentially lethal activities is essential to \nmaintaining our homeland security.\n  Our bill offers protection in a measured way, that discourages abuses \nfrom either side. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have been holding a series of hearings, \nstarting last year, in the Homeland Security Committee, to look at the \nthreat of home-grown terrorists, domestic radicalization. We have \nlearned a lot in the past 6 months. What we have learned has only \nstrengthened my determination to push ahead with this bill.\n  The fact is, each of us has an important responsibility. The fight \nagainst domestic terrorism--or, indeed, any kind of terrorism--requires \nthe active involvement of the citizenry of this country. It is not a \nfight that can be left simply to law enforcement. We simply could never \nhave a sufficient number of law enforcement or intelligence officials \nto take care of every threat. Indeed, the foiled threat at Fort Dix \nshows us how important citizen involvement is.\n  I think this is a reasonable bill. It requires this immunity would be \ngranted only for reports made in good faith. This would help encourage \npassengers on airlines and on trains to report suspicious activities. I \nthink that is a necessary protection in this day and age.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1370. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \nmore investment and innovation in clean energy technologies; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I believe is an important component of comprehensive energy \npolicy. In order to transition away from an overreliance on fossil \nfuels, we must promote investments in clean energy generation using \nrenewable resources and reduce the growth in demand for energy by \nstressing efficiency.\n  I think every Member of the Senate recognizes that while there is no \nsingle technological silver bullet for our energy problems, there are \nmany emerging technologies that if adopted and deployed could go a long \nway in meeting our vexing energy security and climate challenges.\n  We also know that Government can play a key role setting technology \nstandards and clean energy goals, but shifting our Nation's and the \nworld's energy system to clean energy alternatives will take \nsubstantial private sector investment. Here, too, the Government can \nplay a key role by enabling the market conditions that will take the \ntechnology from the laboratory and turn it into fully operational \nenergy producing facilities.\n  A number of reports have suggested that private investment in energy \ntechnologies is on the rise. While estimates vary widely, New Energy \nFinance has reported that 1,246 private equity funds put more than $70 \nbillion into clean energy technologies in 2006--a 43-percent increase \nrelative to 2005. Similarly, a survey conducted late last year by the \nNational Venture Capital Association found that more than 90 percent of \nrespondents expect to increase investment in the energy sector in 2007.\n  This is a unique time. There is growing consensus that our Nation's \nenergy demands need to be better and more smartly managed and, more \nimportantly, consensus that those growing energy demands should be met \nusing clean, renewable energy resources.\n  The Clean Energy Investment Assurance Act of 2007, which I introduce \nalong with my colleagues, Senators Gordon Smith and John Kerry, \nresponds to the clear message that was delivered to both the Senate \nEnergy and Senate Finance Committees by businesses that are on the \ncutting edge in this area. What we heard from the renewable energy \ncommunity and the investment community is that what they need most is \nsome certainty in the Tax Code.\n  This type of Federal assistance will support the needed long-term \ninvestments that ultimately will drive down the costs of electricity \nfrom renewable sources. Once the market for these new technologies is \nup and running, such facilities will be economically self-sustaining \nand profitable.\n  Our legislation adheres to the following principles:\n  Certainty. We put the existing tax incentives in place long enough to \ndrive investment dollars so these new technologies can be \ncommercialized. The core of this bill is a 5-year extension and \nmodification of the production tax credit. This tax credit is designed \nto help businesses and utilities diversify their sources of energy and \npromote energy production using biomass, wind power, hydropower, \ngeothermal power, and other clean, renewable resources. In addition, we \nextend for 8 years the investment tax credit that is so important in \nencouraging the large upfront outlay of capital that is required for \nsolar and fuel cell power plants.\n  Technological neutrality. This bill levels the playing field by \nproviding an incentive to both thermal energy production and \nelectricity production that use renewable resources. It also modifies \nthe tax credits to increase the incentive effect for all renewable \ntechnologies that can produce energy with zero carbon emissions.\n  Parity between investor-owned utilities and consumer-owned public \npower utilities. The bill provides a powerful, complementary incentive \nthrough the Clean Renewable Energy Bond Program so that public power \nand consumer-owned utilities that cannot benefit from tax credits are \nnot financially disadvantaged when they invest in renewable facilities. \nPublic power utilities are required to meet State renewable portfolio \nstandards in the same way as investor-owned utilities, and Government \nshould provide comparable financial incentives so that ultimately the \ncost of electricity can be reduced for all customers.\n  Importance of efficiency. This bill includes provisions that better \nutilize the incentives in the Tax Code to promote energy efficiency in \nmanufacturing, construction of ``green buildings,'' and more efficient \nhomes. These tax incentives help defray the additional costs associated \nwith using new energy-efficient technologies, systems, and materials to \nconstruct and retrofit factories, commercial buildings, and houses in \norder to reduce energy demand. I know Senator Snowe has done a great \ndeal of work in this area, and I look forward to working with her on \nthese important provisions.\n  Another key component in this regard is an inducement for customers \nand utilities to upgrade to ``smart meters.'' A ``smart meter'' is a \ndevice with an electronic circuit board containing computer chips and a \ndigital communications device. It allows a customer to interact with a \nutility in real time. This interaction allows the utility to better \nforecast and manage energy load and the customer can manage his energy \nuse to lower the cost.\n  The electromechanical meter, the device that measures energy use with \nthe little wheels turning inside it that is hooked up to almost every \nhome and business in America, is almost the\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\nsame as when it was invented in the 1930s, when FDR was President.\n  Inefficient use of energy forces utilities to invest millions in \nbuilding plants that operate only when energy demand peaks. As a \nresult, the power these plants generate costs far more than power from \nother sources. This means more expensive power when demand is high.\n\n  Our bill would allow a faster recovery period for the costs of \ninstalling these new ``smart meters,'' which will make it easier for \nconsumers to reduce energy use during these peak periods and shift \ntheir energy use to low-demand, low-cost times of the day.\n  We know that we don't have an unlimited pool of Federal resources, \nand I believe strongly that the Finance Committee should redirect \nsubsidies that historically have propped up the oil and gas industry to \nnow support this new direction in energy policy.\n  Our tax policy here should be driven by our energy policy goals. We \ncannot make a long-term difference with start-and-stop tax policy. But \nwe must be mindful that after a reasonable period all tax incentives \nshould be reexamined to see whether we have gotten the results we \nanticipated and whether the marketplace is ready to function on its \nown.\n  We should focus tax incentives where they will have the greatest \nimpact in helping meet those goals. While this bill seeks to address \nrenewable power and efficiency, I plan to continue working on \nlegislation to effectively align the other incentives in the Tax Code \nthat are designed to promote alternative fuels and vehicles.\n  We all witnessed how innovation in information technologies served as \na forceful driver of productivity and economic growth in the recent \npast.\n  Energy technology innovations now have similar potential to fuel a \nnew wave of economic growth and job creation.\n  I would like to note that this bill has already received the support \nof the following organizations: American Forest Resource Council; \nAmerican Public Power Association; Biomass Investment Group; Energy \nNorthwest; Large Public Power Council; Northwest Public Power \nAssociation; Southern California Public Power Authority; Solar Energy \nIndustries Association; USA Biomass Power Producers Alliance; Chelan \nCounty PUD, Snohomish County PUD, Tacoma Power, and Seattle City Light; \nWashington Public Utility Districts Association; Simpson Investment \nCompany, Tacoma; National Hydropower Association; Seattle Steam; and \nTechNet.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity in this Congress to set a new course \nin energy, environmental, and economic policy for the 21st century, and \nI hope we aggressively move forward and meet this challenge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the \nClean Energy Investment Assurance Act of 2007 be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the material was \nordered to be printed in the Record as follows:\n\n           The Clean Energy Investment Assurance Act of 2007\n\n       A bill to provide reliable Federal tax incentives to help \n     ensure more private sector led investment an innovation in \n     clean energy technologies.\n\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     Sec. 1 Short Title.\n     Sec. 2. Expansion and modification of renewable electricity \n         production credit (IRC Section 45).\n       Under current law, a qualified facility must be placed in \n     service by December 31, 2008, in order to claim a tax credit \n     for electricity that is produced. The bill extends the placed \n     in service date until December 31, 2013, in order to provide \n     an adequate incentive to have more facilities placed in \n     service. Investors willing to bear the risks of new energy \n     technologies should not be subject to the economic risks of \n     start-and-stop tax policy.\n       The tax credit would be expanded to allow a credit for \n     either the production of thermal energy--heat, in the form \n     hot water or steam, or cooling in the form of chilled water, \n     ice or other media--or the production of electricity. This \n     would provide an incentive to invest in facilities that use \n     renewable energy sources to create useful and valuable \n     thermal energy, without generating electricity. Such district \n     energy facilities can provide significant efficiency gains \n     for heating and cooling buildings, displacing peak \n     electricity demands on the local grid and enhancing fuel \n     flexibility.\n       All qualifying facilities would be eligible to receive the \n     full rate of credit, as adjusted for inflation. Current law \n     reduces the credit by half for open-loop biomass, small \n     irrigation power, landfill gas, trash combustion, and \n     hydropower facilities.\n       New and existing facilities would be able to claim the \n     credit for a period of 10 years, beginning on the date the \n     facility is placed in service.\n       The goal of the credit is to encourage deployment of \n     facilities that can produce energy from renewable sources. In \n     order to enable new and emerging technologies to benefit from \n     the credit, the bill grants authority to the Treasury \n     Department to allow a facility placed in service before \n     January 1, 2014, to qualify for the Section 45 credit even \n     though it produces thermal energy or electricity using a \n     renewable resource that is not enumerated in Section 45 \n     provided that the facility produces energy with zero carbon \n     emissions. The determination of whether a facility meets the \n     zero carbon emissions requirement would be made in \n     consultation with the Energy Department. New and emerging \n     technologies that achieve the underlying goal of the \n     incentive will not be disadvantaged by having to come through \n     the lengthy legislative process in order to qualify.\n       The bill attempts to clarify existing Treasury guidance in \n     order to facilitate electricity purchased by a co-located \n     host facility (e.g. lumber mill) even in the case that both \n     facilities are owned by the same taxpayer. Treasury/IRS \n     Notice 2006-88 includes the concept of ``simultaneous sale \n     and purchase'' that is being viewed as an impediment for some \n     open-loop biomass facilities to claim the section 45 credit. \n     This broad concept appears to require netting of electricity \n     sold to, and purchased from, unrelated parties in order for a \n     facility to qualify. Our proposal seeks to reverse the effect \n     of this netting rule to allow qualified biomass facilities to \n     obtain the PTC for gross electricity sold to the grid without \n     any requirement to ``net'' electricity sold to and purchased \n     from an unrelated party.\n       The bill modifies the definition of closed-loop biomass in \n     Section 45(c)(2) to indicate that power producers that use \n     part or the dedicated crop to produce some other type of \n     renewable energy, for example: ethanol, etc., in addition to \n     making electricity, are not disqualified from obtaining the \n     closed-loop tax biomass tax credit for the electricity. Under \n     current law, if any part of the dedicated energy material \n     is used for any purpose other than producing electricity, \n     the electricity produced is not eligible for the closed \n     loop credit. Advances in energy science have led \n     scientists and investors toward the creation of ``energy \n     plantations'' that grow a dedicated crop for electricity \n     production that also can provide a source of cellulosic \n     ethanol. The bill would remove a disincentive to bringing \n     such multiuse green facilities online.\n       Under current law, for only closed-loop biomass facilities \n     modified to co-fire with coal, to co-fire with other biomass, \n     or to co-fire with coal and other biomass, there is no \n     reduction in credit by reason of grants, tax-exempt bonds, \n     subsidized energy financing, and other credits while there is \n     a reduction in the credit of up to 50 percent for other \n     qualified facilities in cases where a facility benefited from \n     grants, used proceeds from tax-exempt bonds, or was \n     subsidized under a Federal, State or local program. Our \n     proposal would equalize the treatment of all types of \n     facilities by repealing this limitation in current law \n     Section 45B(3). This will encourage States and localities to \n     partner with private industry as part of a multi-faceted \n     energy and environmental strategy.\n       Clarifies the statute to reflect additional work that may \n     be needed to retrofit potential non-hydropower dams and make \n     a technical correction related to incremental hydropower.\n     Sec. 3. Extension and expansion of credit to holders of clean \n         renewable energy bonds (IRC Sec. 54).\n       Under current law, the full financial incentives provided \n     under the tax credits are not available to certain entities \n     such as consumer-owned utilities, yet these utilities also \n     need to increase their investments in renewable energy \n     sources to meet their growing demands. The Clean Renewable \n     Energy Bond, CREB, program, enacted as part of the Energy \n     Policy Act of 2005, was crafted to provide a comparable \n     financial incentive for consumer-owned utilities to invest in \n     new renewable electricity generation facilities. CREBs \n     provide public power systems with interest free borrowing for \n     qualified projects. State and local governments, U.S. \n     territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, Indian \n     tribal governments, CoBank, the National Rural Utilities \n     Cooperative Finance Corporation, mutual or cooperative \n     electric companies described in Internal Revenue Code Section \n     501 (c)(12) or 1381 (a)(2)(c), and a not-for-profit electric \n     utility that has received a loan or loan guarantee under the \n     Rural Electrification Act are all eligible to issue CREBs. \n     Unfortunately, the 2-year authorization, the cumulative \n     volume limit, and the smallest-to-largest project allocation \n     of this limited authority have made it difficult for these \n     bonds to be an effective large-scale investment incentive. \n     Our proposal would extend the program to December 31, 2013 \n     and convert the cumulative volume cap into an annual cap. \n     Thus, the limitation in bonds issued would be $5 billion in \n     each calendar year. It is intended that the higher volume cap \n     will encourage broader allocation of the bonds to large-scale \n     projects.\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\n     Sec. 4. Extension and modification of residential energy \n         efficient property credit (Section 25D)\n       The bill extends until 2017 a 30 percent investment tax \n     credit for the purchase of residential solar water heating \n     and fuel cell property. In addition, the solar credit would \n     be based on system power rather than cost and would provide \n     $1,500 for each half-kilowatt of capacity for solar PV \n     equipment and $1,000 for each kilowatt of capacity for fuel \n     cells. Credits would be permitted against the alternative \n     minimum tax to expand the incentive effect of the tax credit.\n       The bill allows the same credit for purchases of \n     ``qualified energy storage air conditioner property,'' which \n     increases the value of intermittent energy sources, such as \n     wind and solar, by creating, storing, and supplying cooling \n     energy.\n     Sec. 5. Extension and modification of energy credit (Section \n         48).\n       The bill extends until 2017 a 30 percent business credit, \n     for the purchase of fuel cell power plants, solar energy \n     property, and fiber optic property used to illuminate the \n     inside of a structure. The bill changes the maximum credit to \n     $1,500 for each half-kilowatt of capacity for solar PV \n     equipment and eliminates the cap on fuel cell power plant \n     property. The bill allows credits to be taken against the \n     alternative minimum tax.\n       The bill also allows the credit for purchases of \n     ``qualified energy storage air conditioner property,'' which \n     increases the value of intermittent energy sources, such as \n     wind and solar, by creating, storing, and supplying cooling \n     energy.\n     Sec. 6. Extension and modification of nonbusiness energy \n         property credit (Section 25C).\n       The bill extends would extend through 2012 the 10 percent \n     investment tax credit for expenditures with respect to \n     building envelopes using qualified energy efficient property, \n     including qualified advanced main air circulating fans, \n     natural gas, propane, oil furnaces or hot water boilers. The \n     bill also would expand the deduction by removing the lifetime \n     limit and modifies the law so that the incentives are based \n     on performance rather than cost.\n     Sec. 7. Extension of new energy efficient home credit \n         (Section 45L).\n       Our proposal would extend through the end of 2012 the tax \n     credit to eligible contractors for the construction of \n     qualified new energy-efficient homes.\n     Sec. 8. Extension and modification of energy efficient \n         commercial buildings deduction (Section 179D).\n       Our proposal would extend through 2013 the deduction for \n     investments in commercial buildings that reduce annual energy \n     and power consumption. The bill also increases the amount of \n     the deduction to $2.25 per square foot, and modifies the \n     measurement of energy savings under the law.\n     Sec. 9. Five-year applicable recovery period for depreciation \n         of qualified energy management devices (Section 168(e)).\n       The bill would treat qualified ``smart meters'' as \n     qualified technological property eligible for 5 year cost \n     recovery; This will ease the financial burdens that are \n     hampering the deployment of this energy efficient technology \n     and reflect the more appropriate tax treatment of this next \n     generation meter technology. Under current law, smart meters \n     are treated the same ways as electromagnetic meters with a 20 \n     year cost recovery period. This has been a serious \n     disincentive for taxpayers to upgrade their meters and \n     realize the energy savings that will result.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 1374.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my Prepare All Kids \nAct of 2007, a bill that represents one of my highest priorities, high \nquality prekindergarten education for all children, and particularly \nthose from low income families for whom the cost of prekindergarten may \nbe prohibitive. Investing in high quality early childhood development \nprograms should be a national priority for our country. I look forward \nto speaking at length on the floor early next week about what my bill \nwill accomplish for children and working families. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

HIGH QUALITY FULL-DAY PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS.\n\n       Chapter 8 of subtitle A of title VI of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35; 95 Stat. 357) \n     is amended by inserting after subchapter C the following:\n\n     ``Subchapter D--High Quality Full-Day Prekindergarten Programs\n\n     ``SEC. 661. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Investments in children and early education should be \n     a national priority.\n       ``(2) The cost of high quality preschool is prohibitive for \n     poor families and is a significant financial strain for many \n     working- and middle-class families.\n       ``(3) State-funded preschool is the most rapidly expanding \n     segment of the United States educational system, but in many \n     States a lack of stable funding poses an enormous threat to \n     the provision or continuation of high quality preschool.\n       ``(4) The provision of high quality prekindergarten is a \n     cost-effective investment for children and for the Nation. \n     Research shows that for every $1 invested in high quality \n     early childhood programs, taxpayers save more than $17 in \n     crime, welfare, education, and other costs.\n       ``(5) Fewer than half the Nation's poor preschool-age \n     children attend preschool. The result is a significant \n     preparation gap between poor and middle-class children and \n     between minority and white children.\n       ``(6) High quality early education increases academic \n     success for schoolchildren who received that education by--\n       ``(A) increasing high school graduation rates;\n       ``(B) improving children's performance on standardized \n     tests;\n       ``(C) reducing grade repetition; and\n       ``(D) reducing the number of children placed in special \n     education.\n       ``(7) High quality early education promotes responsible \n     behavior by teens and adults who received that education by--\n       ``(A) reducing crime, delinquency, and unhealthy behaviors \n     such as smoking and drug use;\n       ``(B) lowering rates of teen pregnancy;\n       ``(C) leading to greater employment and higher wages for \n     adults; and\n       ``(D) contributing to more stable families.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist States \n     in--\n       ``(1) making voluntary high quality full-day \n     prekindergarten programs available and economically \n     affordable for the families of all children for at least 1 \n     year preceding kindergarten; and\n       ``(2) making the prekindergarten programs available to a \n     target population of children from families with incomes at \n     or below 200 percent of the poverty line, for whom the \n     prekindergarten programs will be free of charge.\n\n     ``SEC. 662.

A bill to ensure that new mothers and their families are \neducated about postpartum depression, screened for symptoms, and \nprovided with essential services, and to increase research at the \nNational Institutes of Health on postpartum depression; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my friends Senators \nDurbin and Snowe to reintroduce the Mom's Opportunity to Access Help, \nEducation, Research, and Support for Postpartum Depression, MOTHERS, \nAct.\n  Senator Durbin has been and continues to be a leader on this issue \nand I am grateful for the opportunity to work with him on this \nimportant legislation. I would also like to recognize Representative \nRush, who has been a champion for women battling\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\npostpartum depression, PPD, in the House for many years. I am proud to \nsay that his bill, The Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research \nand Care Act, shares the same goals as the MOTHERS Act.\n  Mr. President, in the United States, 10 to 20 percent of women suffer \nfrom a disabling and often undiagnosed condition known as postpartum \ndepression. Unfortunately, many women are unaware of this condition and \noften do not receive the treatment they need. That is why I am \nintroducing the MOTHERS Act, so that women no longer have to suffer in \nsilence and feel alone when faced with this difficult condition.\n  Last year, the great State of New Jersey passed a first of its kind \nlaw requiring doctors and nurses to educate expectant mothers and their \nfamilies about postpartum depression. This bill was introduced in the \nState legislature by State Senate President Richard Codey. The \nattention of Senator Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, who personally \nbattled postpartum depression, have brought to the issue is remarkable. \nBrooke Shields, a graduate of Princeton University, has also shared her \nstruggle with postpartum depression publicly and should be commended \nfor her efforts to bring awareness to this condition. Postpartum \ndepression affects women all across the country, not just in New \nJersey, and that is why I believe the MOTHERS Act is so important.\n  In America, 80 percent of women experience some level of depression \nafter childbirth. This is what people often refer to as the ``baby \nblues.'' However, each year, there are between 400,000 and 800,000 \nwomen across America who suffer from postpartum depression, a much more \nserious condition. These mothers often experience signs of depression \nand may lose interest in friends and family, feel overwhelming sadness \nor even have thoughts of harming their baby or harming themselves. \nPeople often assume that these feelings are simply the ``baby blues'', \nbut the reality is much worse. Postpartum depression is a serious and \ndisabling condition and new mothers deserve to be given information and \nresources on this condition so, if needed, they can get the appropriate \nhelp.\n  The good news is that treatment is available. Many women have \nsuccessfully recovered from postpartum depression with the help of \ntherapy, medication, and support groups. However, mothers and their \nfamilies must be educated so that they understand what might occur \nafter the birth of their child and when to get help. This legislation \nwill require doctors and nurses to educate every new mother and their \nfamilies about postpartum depression before they leave the hospital and \noffer the opportunity for new mothers to be screened for postpartum \ndepression symptoms during the first year of postnatal check up visits. \nIt also provides social services to new mothers and their families who \nare suffering and struggling with postpartum depression. By increasing \neducation and early treatment of postpartum depression, mothers, \nhusbands, and families, will be able to recognize the symptoms of this \ncondition and help new mothers get the treatment they need and deserve.\n  The MOTHERS Act has another important component. While we continue to \neducate and help the mothers of today, we must also be prepared to help \nfuture moms. By increasing funding for research on postpartum \nconditions at the National Institutes of Health, we can begin to \nunravel the mystery behind this difficult to understand illness. The \nmore we know about the causes and etiology of postpartum depression, \nthe more tools we have to treat and prevent this heartbreaking \ncondition.\n  We must attack postpartum depression on all fronts with education, \nscreening, support, and research so that new moms can feel supported \nand safe rather than scared and alone. Many new mothers sacrifice \nanything and everything to provide feelings of security and safety to \ntheir innocent, newborn child. It is our duty to provide the same level \nof security, safety and support to new mothers in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6023-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 194--COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n  LANDMARK CASE IN RE GAULT, ET.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 194.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 194) commemorating the 40th \n     anniversary of the landmark case In re Gault, et. al., in \n     which the Supreme Court held that all children accused of \n     delinquent acts and facing a proceeding in which their \n     freedom may be curtailed have a right to counsel in the \n     proceedings against them.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of \nthe landmark Supreme Court decision of In re Gault in 1967, in which \nthe Court declared that children accused of delinquent acts have a \nconstitutional right to counsel. Before that decision, children accused \nof delinquency had virtually no legal rights. They were at the mercy of \na legal system that often led to unjust results. Gerald Gault's \nexperience illustrates the injustices that often took place.\n  When he was 15 years old, Gerald was accused of a delinquent act that \ninvolved making a nuisance phone call. He was swept up in a juvenile \njustice system that had almost no procedural\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nsafeguards. Basic rights available to adults were denied to him. He was \nsentenced by the juvenile court to 6 years in his State's Youth \nIndustrial School, with no right to appeal the decision. Fortunately, \nhis parents didn't give up. They filed a writ of habeas corpus for his \nrelease.\n  Gerald's case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which held that \nproceedings against juveniles must meet the essential requirements of \nthe due process clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution. These \nrights included the right to advance notice of the charges, the right \nto counsel, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the right to \nconfront and cross-examine witnesses. Eventually, the charges against \nGerald were dropped, and his case changed the juvenile justice system \nforever.\n  In fact, the development of the juvenile justice system was long in \ncoming. Before the 20th century, children as young as 7 years of age \ncould be tried as criminals, and if found guilty, could be sentenced to \nprison or even to death. The first juvenile court was established just \nover a century ago in Chicago as a result of the efforts of reformers \nwho were appalled by the denial of rights to young offenders. By 1925, \nthe majority of States had separate courts for juveniles in a system \nguided by the doctrine of parens patriae, which gave each State the \nauthority to act as a parent for children in need of guidance and \nprotection. Under the doctrine, States were able to provide treatment \nand rehabilitation or safe conditions of confinement for troubled \nyouth, and the Gault decision guaranteed that juvenile offenders would \nhave basic legal rights.\n  In the years that followed, numerous improvements have been made to \nthe juvenile justice system. In recent years, however, there has been \nan alarming escalation in the willingness of States to treat children \nas adults. Nearly 100,000 children today are incarcerated in juvenile \nfacilities, and they may well be the most vulnerable and defenseless \ngroup in our criminal justice system. They are routinely sent to adult \nprisons where they face significant dangers. Juveniles in adult \nfacilities are five times more likely than those in juvenile facilities \nto report being sexually assaulted. Even more disturbing, the suicide \nrate of children in adult prisons is over seven times higher than those \nin juvenile facilities. Their plight is shameful and unacceptable. \nClearly, these children deserve better.\n  Gerald Gault went on to have a long career in the United States Army, \nrising to the rank of sergeant. He has become a deeply devoted family \nman and will celebrate his 35th wedding anniversary 5 days after the \n40th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in his case. Who knows \nwhat would have happened to Gerald if he had not been given his due \nprocess rights and had been locked away instead in a detention center? \nThe anniversary of the Gault decision is a time for all of us to \nremember that the juvenile justice system is there to protect the \nrights of the Nation's children, and this resolution enables us to \nrenew our commitment to building on the legacy of that historic \ndecision.\n  With this resolution, the Senate acknowledges the need for the Nation \nto recommit to the goals and purposes of this landmark decision to \nfinally achieve the goals set forth in the Gault decision. I am pleased \nthat the resolution has the support of so many organizations and \nindividuals across the country, including the National Juvenile \nDefender Center, Harvard Law School, the Child Welfare League, the \nACLU, the Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators, the Center \nfor Children's Law and Policy, the National Immigration Project of the \nNational Lawyers Guild in Boston, the Children's Law Center of \nMassachusetts and so many other distinguished individuals fighting for \na better justice system for all children in the United States.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record as if given.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 194) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 194\n\n       Whereas, on May 15, 1967, the Supreme Court recognized in \n     In re Gault, et al., 387 U.S. 1 (1967) that all children \n     accused of delinquent acts and facing a proceeding in which \n     their freedom may be curtailed have a right to counsel in the \n     proceedings against them;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court held that proceedings against \n     juveniles must meet the essential requirements of the due \n     process clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution;\n       Whereas the Gault decision recognized that the \n     constitutional protections of due process extend to juveniles \n     the right to fundamental procedural safeguards in juvenile \n     courts, including the right to advance notice of the charges \n     against them, the right to counsel, the privilege against \n     self-incrimination, and the right to confront and cross-\n     examine witnesses; and\n       Whereas, 40 years after the Gault decision, some children \n     appear in court with no legal counsel at all: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 40th anniversary of the \n     decision in In re Gault, et al., 387 U.S. 1 (1967);\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to recognize \n     and honor the 40th anniversary of the Gault decision;\n       (3) supports strategies to improve the juvenile justice \n     system that appreciate the unique nature of childhood and \n     adolescence; and\n       (4) pledges to acknowledge and address the modern day \n     disparities that remain for children after the Gault \n     decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6031-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6031-S6032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRAQ FUNDING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding, prior to my doing \nthe closing--and I don't know if the distinguished Republican leader \nhas anything today--it is my understanding that the Senator from \nVirginia wanted to make a statement. Does the Senator from Kentucky \nhave anything to say?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No, Mr. President, I don't have anything to add.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may engage our respected leaders in a \ncolloquy regarding the passage last night of the House supplemental. I \nam speaking for, I think, a number of Senators on both sides of the \naisle, who have some thoughts with regard to how we proceed on the \nfunding issue. I personally--speaking for myself--believe we should \nhave no bifurcation of the funding and that it should all be acted upon \nat one time. I am very anxious that the tentative schedule of the \nleadership is before Memorial Day. That is most important.\n  I hope some of us could address the Senate and the leadership \nregarding the subject of benchmarks. I read with great interest that \nthe President is openminded on the question of benchmarks. I believe it \nis important that, in September, General Petraeus is going to give us a \nreport, together with the U.S. Ambassador, and presumably the \nSecretaries of State and Defense will join in that very important \nreport to the Congress--indeed, to the whole country--with regard to \nthe status of things in Iraq in September. I do believe there is such a \nrapidly unfolding situation over there--we don't know from day to day \nhow to anticipate certain things. Earlier this morning, General Mixon \nreported that he didn't have sufficient forces, U.S. forces and \npresumably Iraqi forces, to perform his mission in Diyala Province.\n  I am hopeful, speaking for myself, that we can put in some language \ntied to benchmarks by which the President, before we go out on the \nAugust recess, would report to the Nation and to the Congress on his \njudgment as to whether there is progress on the benchmarks and whether \nhe feels that in the July timeframe some change in strategy must be \nbrought about in order to achieve the goals of the original strategy \nlaid down on January 10 of this year.\n  My language would not have any obstruction to the flow of funds, but \nit would simply keep the Nation and the Congress fully informed of his \njudgment, together with his senior advisers, at that critical time \nbefore we go out on the August recess. I believe we have a \nresponsibility, first and foremost, to the men and women in the Armed \nForces, their families, and to the country for the Congress to watch \nthis situation very closely and not defer until the September timeframe \nthe concentrated judgment that would\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nbe brought to bear on the receiving of the report in September.\n  To what extent can you advise us as to the process that might be \nfollowed in order to expeditiously get to the conference but at the \nsame time either the conferees be informed of the views of others or we \nhave some mechanism by which to address the issue?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are many issues--in fact, most issues \nthat come before this body deal with monetary things, policy issues, \nwhich do not deal with the lives of our men and women in uniform. This \nissue does. I cannot speak for my Republican counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell, but I can say without any question that I believe he and I \nare arm-locked in the recognition of how serious this is and how we \nhave to do the very best the Senate can do. We are going to try to do \nthat.\n  This is a time when we have to work on a nonpartisan basis--not \nbipartisan but a nonpartisan basis--to get a matter to the House of \nRepresentatives so we can do a conference. At this stage, I have to say \nto my friend from Virginia, who is so knowledgeable about things \nmilitary, we don't know how we are going to do that yet. That is a fair \nstatement. Everything is on the table. But how we take things off the \ntable and put certain things back on the table, I don't know at this \nstage. I don't think my friend from Kentucky does, either, but we are \nopen for suggestions and comments. It is not an easy situation. The \nHouse of Representatives is a different body than we are. The majority \nparty there can do what they want to do. We cannot do that. This is the \nSenate, which is divided, as we speak, 50 to 49. So we have to work \ntogether.\n  I say to my friend that I understand his involvement in this. He has \nworked over the years very well with the Democrats. I look forward to \nthat continuing during the supplemental appropriations bill. Speaking \nfor me, I don't know how we are going to get there, but we are going to \ntry. We have no choice. Failure is not an option.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, nobody has done more for his country, \nfor the defense of this country, and for the Armed Forces of this \ncountry than the distinguished Senator from Virginia. We thank him for \nhis ongoing advice about how to deal with this most difficult problem.\n  The majority leader and I are in exactly the same place. I believe \nthe Senator from Virginia is as well. It is our great desire to get to \nconference and get a bill signed before Memorial Day. Exactly as the \nmajority leader indicated, how we get from here to there is a matter \nunder serious discussion between the two of us and with our members. So \nwe will be working to get the job completed at the earliest possible \nopportunity.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I only add that I have been as critical of \nthe President as anybody in the Senate. But I have to say that, in the \nlast week or two, his spokesperson, his Chief of Staff, speaking with \nthe authority of the President, has been available to Senator McConnell \nand me anytime I have asked. I appreciate that. If we are going to get \nthis done, the President has to be part of the solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/11/senate-section/article/S6032-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 14, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
