Mr. President, I yesterday asked by unanimous consent that \nwe adopt the Wounded Warrior legislation that was brought to the Senate \nduring the Defense authorization bill in a form of a bipartisan \namendment. A number of Senators worked very hard. Senator Murray is on \nthe floor. She worked very hard, and a number of Senators have worked \nvery hard on this legislation. It came about as a result of what we \nlearned at Walter Reed about how our returning troops from Iraq and \nAfghanistan were being basically neglected. They had been wounded, and \nthey were receiving unacceptable and poor treatment when they came \nhome. That failure was learned about--not only about the veterans care \nsystem, which had many bureaucratic failures, but also the physical \nfacilities that were there failed to meet a minimum level of \nacceptability. The American people were outraged by the facts that came \nto light, and the Senate took prompt action.\n  The Wounded Warrior amendment, now in legislation that is before the \nSenate, would address the substandard facilities we have talked about \nand we have seen. It would address the lack of seamless transition and \ndevelop one when medical care for troops is transferred from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Veterans' Administration, which oftentimes \nin the past has led to diminished care. It addresses the inadequacy of \nseverance pay. It addresses the need for improved sharing of medical \nrecords between the Department of Defense and the Veterans' \nAdministration. We are told now that there are as many as 600,000 \npending claims of returning veterans. It addresses the inadequate care \nand treatment of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and a number of other very important items.\n  So I again renew my request. Yesterday we were told that the \nRepublicans were looking at this. Mr. President, I am going to renew \nthis request. There are all kinds of reasons, I guess, for objecting to \nsomething such as this. Now I am told the reason for objecting is the \npay raise isn't included. The Wounded Warrior legislation becomes \neffective upon passage and approval. The pay raise for the troops \ndoesn't become effective until October 1 or January 1--I don't know how \nthe legislation reads, but it is not now. So that would not be a good \nreason in my estimation, and I think in the estimation of these wounded \nwarriors, for objecting.\n  The pay raise does not become effective until the beginning of the \nfiscal year. In fact, I think it is January 1 of next year. It is \ndifferent than a number\n\n[[Page S9858]]\n\nof things we pass. But it does not become effective now. So if that is \na reason for objecting, it is a poor reason, because they are two \ndifferent issues. One is the pay raise does not become effective now; \nthis does become effective.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 1538, and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration; that the substitute amendment \nat the desk, which is the text of the Wounded Warriors provision in \nH.R. 1585, be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; \nand any statements relating to this matter be printed in the Record, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I would hope to get the majority leader to amend his \nunanimous consent request. I notified him through floor staff that it \nwould be my hope we could modify the unanimous consent request and not \nonly pass the Wounded Warrior provision, which was regretfully taken \ndown along with the Defense authorization bill last week, but modify \nthat to include the language of section 601 of the Defense \nauthorization bill, which would provide for an increase in military \nbasic pay of all of our uniformed military personnel. So if the \nmajority leader would modify his consent agreement as I have suggested, \nthe bill, in effect, that we would be passing would be Wounded Warrior, \nplus the military pay raise. That would be my suggestion to the \nmajority leader.\n  I am not going to object to his unanimous-consent agreement. I agree \nwith him that the Wounded Warrior provisions are extremely important. I \nwas disappointed it was taken down along with the Defense authorization \nbill last week, but I would respectfully suggest that it be modified to \ninclude the pay raise as well.\n  Mr. REID. I accept the modification.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request, \nas modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could we also send this matter to \nconference?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me suggest, I do need to consult \nwith the ranking member. I am sure that won't be a problem, but to do \nit on the spur of the moment without consulting with the ranking \nmember, it would probably not be acceptable to my side. But I can't \nimagine this would be a problem, and we will get back to the majority \nleader shortly.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that, Mr. President. I appreciate the \ncooperation. This is a good step forward.\n  The amendment (No. 2402) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 1538), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have offered the Dignified Treatment of \nWounded Warriors Act as a stand-alone bill that incorporates the \nprovisions of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act as marked \nup by the Armed Services Committee and as amended when offered as an \namendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act and passed by \na vote of 94 to 0.\n  Our wounded warriors cannot wait, and should not have to wait, for us \nto finish the Department of Defense Authorization Act to get the relief \ncontained in this bill. The bill incorporates the ideas of many \nSenators and the consideration of both the Armed Services Committee and \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs. A total of 51 Senators have \ncosponsored this legislation. It is truly a bipartisan effort to \naddress shortfalls in the care of our wounded warriors. I am delighted \nthe Senate is passing this bill today so that we can move forward to \nconference with the House of Representatives to reach agreement on a \nbill that both the House and Senate can pass and send to the President.\n  This bill addresses the issue of inconsistent disability ratings by \nrequiring that the military departments use VA standards for rating \ndisabilities unless the Department of Defense rating is higher. The \nbill adopts a more favorable statutory presumption for determining \nwhether a disability is incident to military service by adopting the \nmore favorable VA presumption. The bill requires two pilot programs to \ntest the viability of involving the Veterans' Administration in the \nassignment of disability ratings for the Department of Defense. The \nbill also establishes an independent board to review and, where \nappropriate, correct unjustifiably low Department of Defense disability \nratings awarded since 2001.\n  This bill also addresses the lack of a seamless transition from the \nmilitary to the Veterans' Administration by requiring the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a \ncomprehensive policy on the care and management of injured \nservicemembers who will transition from the Department of Defense to \nthe VA. The bill establishes a Department of Defense and a Department \nof Veterans Affairs interagency program office to develop and implement \na joint electronic health record.\n  This bill authorizes $50 million for improved diagnosis, treatment \nand rehabilitation of military members with traumatic brain injury, \nTBI, and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. The bill requires the \nestablishment of centers of excellence for both TBI and PTSD to conduct \nresearch and train health care professionals. The bill requires that \nthe Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, report to Congress with comprehensive plans to \nprevent, diagnose, mitigate and treat TBI and PTSD.\n  This bill increases the minimum severance pay to 1 year's basic pay \nfor those separated with disabilities incurred in a combat zone or \ncombat-related activity and 6 months basic pay for all others. This is \nquadrupling or doubling, depending on the circumstance, the current \narrangement. The bill also eliminates the requirement that severance \npay be deducted from disability compensation for disabilities incurred \nin a combat zone.\n  This bill also addresses the problem that exists because medically \nretired servicemembers who are eligible for Tricare as retirees do not \nhave access to some of the cutting-edge treatments that are available \nto members still on active duty. The bill does that by authorizing \nmedically retired servicemembers to receive the active duty medical \nbenefit for 3 years after the member leaves active duty. This can be \nextended to 5 years where medically required. The bill authorizes \nmilitary and VA health care providers to provide medical care and \ncounseling to family members who leave their homes and often leave \ntheir jobs to help provide care to their wounded warriors. The \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act requires the Secretary of \nDefense to establish standards for the treatment of and housing for \nmilitary outpatients. These standards will require compliance with \nFederal and other standards for military medical treatment facilities, \nspecialty medical care facilities, and military housing for outpatients \nthat will be uniform and consistent and high level throughout the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  This bill also includes measures proposed by the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs under the leadership of Senator Akaka that address \nshortfalls in the VA system for care of our wounded warriors after \ntheir transition to the VA.\n  So in summary, the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act is a \ncomprehensive approach that lays out a path for the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to address shortfalls in \nthe care of our wounded warriors while they remain in military service, \nduring the transition from the military to the VA, and after this \ntransition, while in the care of the VA.\n  Our wounded warriors deserve the best care and support that we can \nmuster. The American people rightly insist on no less. This wide-\nranging legislation will improve the provision of health care and \nbenefits to injured military personnel and make the system much more \nefficient as well.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate adopted, by \nunanimous consent, legislation that will make a significant difference \nin the lives of America's wounded warriors and veterans. I\n\n[[Page S9859]]\n\napplaud the passage of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act \nand the 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for the men and women of \nthe U.S. military.\n  This legislation bridges the gap in health care coverage for the \nseverely wounded, and ensures their access to the broadest possible \nrange of health care services. It authorizes additional care and \nsupport for families who are caring for the wounded. The bill increases \ntraumatic brain injury care for veterans, and access to mental health \nevaluations. It requires the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs to develop and implement new policy to better manage the care \nand transition of our wounded soldiers. It also empowers a special \nboard to review disability ratings of 20 percent or less, and to \nrestore to wounded soldiers, if appropriate, a higher disability rating \nor retired status. And, it authorizes additional funding for traumatic \nbrain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  The disability evaluation systems of the Departments of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs are out of date and in need of reform. This \nlegislation advances that reform by requiring the immediate initiation \nof pilot projects to fundamentally change and streamline those \nantiquated systems. The bill also improves benefits related to \nadministrative separation from the military due to injury, increasing \nseverance pay and eliminating the requirement that severance pay be \ndeducted from VA disability compensation for injuries incurred in a \ncombat zone.\n  The legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to inspect and \nimprove medical treatment and residential facilities, and to study the \naccelerated construction of new facilities at the National Military \nMedical Center at Bethesda, MD.\n  This legislation is an important step toward restoring trust for \nAmerica's wounded soldiers and veterans. The Senate can be proud that \nit has put the needs of wounded warriors and our selfless service men \nand women ahead of partisanship, jurisdictional boundaries and \ndisagreements over policy. We are now ready to move foward to \nconference with the House of Representatives and make overdue \nimprovements for our soldiers, their families, and our veterans.\n  While I am pleased we have been able to take this action today, very \ncritical improvements to defense policy and programs remain in the \nunfinished work on the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008, \nwhich the Democratic Senate leadership pulled from the Senate floor \nlast week because of policy disagreements on Iraq.\n  Failure to pass the Defense authorization bill will curtail many \nneeded initiatives to support our military personnel and their families \nand to continue the fight on the global war on terror. Our military \nforces deployed throughout the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan, \nneed the resources, training, and equipment that this bill would \nprovide. Examples of the important authorities that are being held \nhostage to the contentious debate on policy in Iraq include: increasing \nin end-strength for the Army and Marine Corps; providing combat-related \nspecial compensation to serve members who are; medically retired \nbecause of a combat-related disability; paying over 25 special pays and \nbonuses designed to improve military recruiting and retention; \nimproving military equipment needed to protect deploying forces, \nincluding $4.0 billion for mine-resistant vehicles known as MRAPs; \nupdating Army combat systems and additional funding for armor and \naviation survivability equipment; building five warships and funding \nfor Virginia class submarines; increasing the number of Department of \nDefense and Department of Energy programs to help reduce the threat of \nnuclear materials from the former Soviet Union falling into the hands \nof terrorists; encouraging more focused competition for the billions of \ndollars that the Department of Defense spends on contract services; and \nproviding critical authorities to combatant commanders to address \nsecurity priorities and support allies, coalition partners, and others \nin the war on terror.\n  I call on the Senate leadership to resume consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill at the earliest possible time, so that these \nand many other critical pieces of the legislation will become law for \nthe benefit of our troops. Swift passage of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for 2008, coupled with support for our wounded \nwarriors and hard-working troops together represent the full measure of \nsupport for our military forces that they need, and that they \nunquestionably deserve.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Levin, along with Senator McCain, \nhave forged a comprehensive, bipartisan legislative package to ensure \nthat wounded and injured members of the Armed Forces receive the finest \ncare and benefits, which they richly deserve.\n  I thank Senators on both sides who participated in this legislation, \non the basis of their own legislative initiatives and their \namendments--10 of which were agreed to when the bill was considered by \nthe full Senate on July 12, 2007.\n  I want to underscore that this bill is--in no way--a reflection of \nconcern about the quality of acute medical care that our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines receive when they sustain wounds or \nillness in the field of battle.\n  Our men and women in uniform receive the best treatment anywhere in \nthe world, and that fact has been sustained by every outside panel \nstudying the problems arising from the disclosures at Walter Reed last \nFebruary.\n  In fact, just today, the President's Commission on Care for America's \nWounded Warriors, the Dole-Shalala Commission, found that the survival \nrate of those seriously injured has markedly increased compared to the \nrate in Vietnam and previous wars.\n  The report of a commission appointed by Secretary Gates, and led by \ntwo distinguished former Secretaries of the Army, Togo West and John \nMarsh confirms this by stating: Through advances in battlefield \nmedicine, evacuation care, the Department has achieved the lowest \nmortality rates of wounded in history.\n  Let us never doubt the bravery and skill of our medical personnel.\n  This bill, approved by the Senate this morning, addresses the failure \nof systems--again, quoting from the Department of Defense Commission \nreport--failures which included the: product of bureaucratic behavior, \ninability to reconcile institutional disparities, and leaving the \nwounded warrior and family to untangle that which government agencies \ncannot.\n  It is with great humility that I recall that I was the first Member \nof the Senate to visit Walter Reed--on February 23, 2007. It happened \nto be the same day that Secretary Gates visited Walter Reed to conduct \nhis own inspection.\n\n  In the intervening months, many encouraging developments have taken \nplace. I applaud the leadership of Secretary Gates in promptly taking \naction to correct deficiencies at Walter Reed, and insisting on \naccountability for failures in leadership that contributed to \nunacceptable conditions for our soldiers.\n  Our committee has also have received assurances from the Secretary of \nthe Army Pete Geren, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England and the \nDeputy Secretary of Veterans' Affairs Gordon Mansfield, that each will \nwork tirelessly to improve the consistency and effectiveness of their \nmanagement of all soldiers and veterans.\n  The bill which has now been passed by unanimous consent is \ncomprehensive and deserving of our support. It incorporates many of the \nfindings of completed studies and reviews, as well as the constructive \nideas of Members of the Senate.\n  This legislation will ensure that wounded and injured members of the \nArmed Forces receive the care and benefits that they deserve.\n  It will improve physical and mental health benefits for the severely \nwounded, to ensure that they have the broadest possible options for \ncare from military, veterans and private sector health care resources.\n  It includes significant initiatives in the areas of traumatic brain \ninjury, TBI, and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, for soldiers and \nveterans. This addresses the Dole-Shalala findings that over 52,000 \nIraq and Afghanistan returning veterans have been treated for PTSD \nsymptoms by the VA.\n  This legislation also creates a special review board to reexamine \ndisability determinations which fall below the 20 percent threshold if \na former member\n\n[[Page S9860]]\n\nof the armed services feels that he or she received an unfair rating.\n  Additionally, the bill requires the Departments of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs to rapidly move to fundamentally change and improve \nthe disability evaluation systems within the two departments.\n  I am pleased that the legislation will ensure that as policies and \nprograms are developed to improve care and management of wounded \nsoldiers and veterans, that such policies and improvements will apply \nequally to members of the Active and Reserve components.\n\n  The bill also requires that military personnel continue to receive \nthe best possible care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center until \nequivalent medical facilities are constructed at the National Naval \nMedical Center, Bethesda, MD, and the Fort Belvoir, VA, Army Community \nHospital--and requires the Department of Defense to study the \nfeasibility of accelerating the relocation of medical capabilities in \nthe National Capital Region required by the Base Realignment and \nClosure Act of 2005.\n  The Senate can be proud that it has put the needs of our wounded \nwarriors first and set forth bipartisan jurisdictional boundaries.\n  I want to thank my colleagues--especially Senator Akaka, chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, and Senator Craig, the \nranking member, for their cooperation, and for the work of both our \ncommittee staffs--working together--in the preparation of this \nlegislation.\n  It is my hope that we will proceed expeditiously to conference with \nthe other body on wounded warrior legislation and promptly resume \nconsideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 when \nCongress reconvenes in September.\n  We owe this to our men and women in uniform and their families \nstationed throughout the world. They deserve nothing less than our full \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9860-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

A \nmember of the 1st Squadron, 33rd Cavalry, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, \n101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, KY, he was 31 years \nold.\n  For his outstanding service as a soldier in the U.S. Army, SFC Bishop \nwas awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart, as well as many \nother medals and honors of distinction.\n  Jason was the first of four children born to his parents Frank and \nBrenda Bishop in the northern Kentucky town of Covington. His mother \nremembers Jason as a young child standing on the seat in the family car \nand singing along with the radio, especially to Kenny Rogers.\n  Riding in the car with his father was a different experience. Frank \ntaught young Jason how to drive by putting him in the driver's seat at \nthe top of a hill, disengaging the parking brake, and issuing one \ncommand: ``Drive.'' On a stick shift, no less.\n  Jason and his dad enjoyed deer hunting and fishing together, \nsomething they did whenever the opportunity arose. Playing cards was \nanother way the two enjoyed each other's company. His family says Jason \nlearned to count using playing cards.\n  Jason graduated from Covington Holmes High School in 1993 with 4 \nyears of junior ROTC experience. He entered the Army immediately upon \ngraduation.\n  After basic training and assignment at Fort Knox, also in my State of \nKentucky, Jason was sent to the Republic of Korea. He also was deployed \nto Bosnia for a 10-month tour. Later assigned to Fort Campbell back in \nKentucky, Jason was promoted to sergeant first class.\n  Completing Drill Sergeant School was one of SFC Bishop's proudest \naccomplishments. Earning that drill sergeant badge was physically and \nmentally grueling, perhaps the toughest of all of his assignments.\n  Jason became a darn good drill sergeant. A fellow drill sergeant who \nserved with him at Fort Knox, SFC Daniel Webster, says he is not aware \nof any combat deaths among the 1,000 men Jason trained at Fort Knox--a \nremarkable record. ``There is no doubt in my mind soldiers are coming \nback from Iraq and Afghanistan alive because Jason was so committed to \ntheir training,'' SFC Webster added.\n  In July of 1999, while stationed at Fort Knox, Jason met the woman he \nwould marry, Katrina Bishop. They took their vows in 2002. ``He and I \nwere soulmates,'' Katrina says.\n  They had a son, Matthew Franklin Bishop. Only 1\\1/2\\ years old when \nJason deployed for the last time, he idolized his father. Matt \n``quickly became his shadow,'' Katrina says. ``Wherever Daddy was, Matt \nhad to be too.''\n  In September 2005, Jason and his unit deployed to Iraq. They would \ncome home without him in September of 2006.\n  Jason is loved and remembered by his parents Frank and Brenda Bishop; \nhis sisters Jamie, Lacey, and Julia Bishop; his wife Katrina Bishop; \nhis son Matthew Bishop; his daughter Morgan Bishop, as well as many \nother beloved family members.\n  A wall that stands at Fort Knox to honor all of the fallen heroes in \nIraq and Afghanistan has been named for the soldier who once served \nthere. It is called ``Bishop's Wall of Remembrance.''\n  There is also a Sergeant First Class Jason Bishop Memorial Park at \nCovington that sits directly across from the house in which Jason grew \nup.\n  But the tribute to Sergeant First Class Bishop I can speak to most is \nthis medal.\n  This medal, this coin was sent to me by Katrina Bishop. The Bishop \nfamily had it made in honor of their son. On one side it lists Jason's \ndates of birth and death, his assignment in the 101st Airborne \nDivision, and his service in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  On the other side of the coin it reads: ``Sergeant First Class Jason \nLee Bishop'' and has a picture of his sergeant's stripes. It also lists \nseven attributes that the Bishop family chose to remember their son, \nhusband, and father by: loyalty, honor, duty, integrity, respect, \nselfless service, personal courage.\n  Mr. President, this medal is the Bishop family's reminder of Jason's \nlife, which was tragically ended, and of their love for him, which will \nnever end.\n  I thank Katrina Bishop for this gift, and I will be honored to keep \nit in my office. It will serve as a reminder to me, as well, of how \nmuch we owe the men and women of our Armed Forces whose highest calling \nis to fight for the freedom of others.\n  I ask the Senate to pause for a moment today and hold the family and \nfriends of SFC Jason Lee Bishop in their prayers. They certainly will \nbe in mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I want to compliment the distinguished \nminority leader for not just recalling the sacrifices of the family and \nmembers of the U.S. military today, but for his efforts to do that for \na long time now on the Senate floor. He focuses on Kentuckians who have \na long history of service to their country, and rightly so. I know he \nwould add to that the service of those members of our military and \ntheir families from all over this country and add them to our prayers \nand thoughts as well. We spend time in Washington debating policies \nthat affect them, and they are living it every day, every minute of \nevery day. I appreciate the words he brought to the Senate floor not \njust on this occasion but on previous occasions as well.\n  Mr. President, I will talk about the action taken earlier by the \nmajority and minority leaders. We have now, by unanimous consent, \napproved two key provisions of the Defense authorization bill by \nunanimous consent in a period of 3 or 4 minutes. Yet it took the last 2 \nweeks to debate the Defense authorization bill, only to have it pulled \nfrom the floor so that we could not vote on it. It was used by the \nmajority leader as a surrogate for the debate on Iraq policy. We have \nhad something like seven or eight different resolutions--perhaps more, \nI have forgotten the count this year--on policy relating to Iraq. There \nis no more important national security issue facing our country than \nthe war against terrorists, and certainly the central battle field in \nthat war is the Iraq war.\n  Republicans do not shy away from the debate about what to do. It is \nan extraordinarily important debate. On the other hand, I would have \ntwo arguments with the way this has been done. First, the time of the \ndebate right now is misplaced because after the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed General Petraeus, after the President had changed his course \nand consulted with General Petraeus and others about a new strategy, \nand that strategy was developed, we sent General Petraeus to Iraq to \nbegin executing that strategy. We put together five brigades to \nrepresent a surge in troop strength to accomplish the mission, the last \nof which went into the theater about a month ago.\n  When we did that, we made a commitment to the soldiers, marines, \nairmen, and all the Navy personnel to back them in what we sent them to \ndo, not to immediately begin questioning whether they could succeed in \ntheir mission. We heard a lot of calls from the other side of the aisle \nthat were very defeatist in nature, saying it was already lost and \nthere was no way they could win. That is, obviously, not a good sendoff \nfor the young men and women you are putting in harm's way to accomplish \na mission that is important to the American people.\n  So the timing of the debate was off. General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker will report back here in September. It is an interim report on \nthis new strategy. But we have an idea that it will tell us a lot about \nthe future course of action we should pursue. I think most Americans \nbelieve, even though all of us would like to have the troops come home \nand have our engagement there ended as much as it can, the reality is \nthat Americans don't want to lose, don't want to be defeated. They \ncertainly don't want to see the consequences of that defeat, with al-\nQaida having a base of operations in Iraq, perhaps millions of Iraqis \nslaughtered in the ensuing chaos, and U.S. policy in the war against \nterror undercut dramatically in that very important region of the \nworld. So the timing was off.\n  Secondly, using the Defense authorization bill as the surrogate for \nthat debate was wrong. This is a little bit of an inside-the-beltway \ndiscussion, but the American people need to know why this is wrong. \nEach year, for 45 years, the Senate has passed a Defense authorization \nbill setting the policy for our national security for the following \nyear and establishing the authorization for troop strength, military \nweapons acquisitions, policy related to missile defense, and you name \nit. The President has signed the Defense authorization bill. That then \nenables the Congress to appropriate the money to pay for the things \nthat we believe are necessary for the military.\n  But this year, instead of having the debate and amending that bill \nand passing it, it was simply used as a vehicle to debate Iraq. Then \nwhen the last Iraq resolution was defeated, the bill was not passed. It \nwas pulled from the floor. That left extraordinarily important policy \nhanging--policy on which our military troops rely.\n  This is not the first time the Democratic majority has had second \nthoughts about action it has taken on the Senate floor. I am glad it is \nhaving second thoughts about this bill. But by the action that has been \ntaken, we are still not going to be adopting good policy in the right \nway. There are consequences to this piecemeal approach.\n  Let me illustrate my point. What we have just done this morning is to \ndo two very important parts of that bill: to adopt a 3.5-percent, \nacross-the-board pay raise for uniform military service personnel, and \nto adopt the language from the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors \nAct, both of which were critical components.\n\n  Senator John McCain, my colleague from Arizona, spoke eloquently \nregarding both matters on this floor on numerous occasions. I know were \nhe here now, he would be pleased at the action the Senate has taken.\n  Let me cite a few of the things that have been left on the cutting \nroom floor as a result of not passing the Defense authorization bill, \nbut rather simply taking a couple of provisions that are obviously \npopular with our constituents and leaving the remainder behind. Here \nare a few of the things we are not adopting as a result of this \npiecemeal approach: Senator Joe Biden noted that the MRAP, or Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected vehicles, ``are the best available vehicle \nfor force protection'' for our troops. He is right. There was $4.1 \nbillion in the act to authorize payment for this equipment. Not \nadopted.\n  It authorizes the new hiring and bonus authorities to assist the \nDefense Department in recruiting and retaining needed, quality health \nand mental care professionals in the military. Not adopted.\n  It authorized $50 million in supplemental educational aid to local \nschool districts affected by the assignment and location of military \nfamilies. That is something all military families know about. Not \nadopted.\n  It authorized payment of combat-related special compensation to \nservicemembers who are medically retired due to combat-related \ndisability. Not adopted.\n  It included provisions to examine and strengthen security forces at \ndefense sites storing weapons-grade nuclear materials. That is a very \nimportant provision relating to nuclear deterrent. Not adopted.\n  It would have satisfied the Army Chief of Staff's unfunded \nrequirements list by authorizing an additional $2.7 billion for items \nsuch as reactive armor, aviation survivability equipment, combat \ntraining centers, and machine guns--a variety of things the Pentagon \nsaid were necessary to support the missions of our men and women in the \nmilitary. Not adopted.\n  My point here is that when you use the Defense authorization bill for \nthe purpose simply of having a debate on Iraq, there are a lot of bad \nconsequences to not passing that bill. You cannot cure them by simply \npicking a couple of the more politically popular items, such as we have \ndone today, and getting those adopted by unanimous consent. I am \ndelighted that we have done it, but that is not the end of the story if \nwe are really going to support the mission of our troops.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude on this thought. To some extent, this \ndebate we had in the last 2 weeks just on the Iraq war is a \nmanifestation of what has gone on in the Congress for the last 200 \ndays. It is hard to believe that 200 days is gone. What does this \nCongress have to show for its actions and being in session for these \n200 days? I cannot say nothing because the reality is, we have approved \nand named 20 post offices. That is a post office every 10 days. It is \nnot exactly heavy lifting, but it is something. As a matter of fact, it \nis the main thing this Senate can point to in terms of accomplishment. \nThe only other thing of substance was the minimum wage increase, which, \nunfortunately, did not include the benefits to small businesses that \nhave to pay the minimum wage in terms of tax relief, which Republicans\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\ntried to have included. Of course, we had to pass the supplemental \nappropriations bill to fund the war effort. That is it.\n  I apologized yesterday for calling this a ``do-nothing Congress.'' \nAfter all, we have named 20 post offices. Let's call it the ``post \noffice Congress.'' Perhaps in the remaining time this year we will pick \nup the action. Perhaps we will find ways to accomplish things that the \nAmerican people really want us to do.\n  One of the big problems we can see is because we have not done the \nappropriations bills to fund everything from the military to the \nDepartments of Justice and Commerce, all of the other departments of \nGovernment that serve the American people are going to be facing a \ntrillion-dollar-plus Omnibus appropriations bill this winter. That is \nthe worst of legislating. It is kind of the opposite of what we are \ndoing with the Defense authorization bill where we don't pass the bill, \nbut we pick two or three items that are politically popular and do them \nby unanimous consent.\n  In this case, you don't do anything to fund the Government until the \nlast few days, and then you ball it up into one giant bill, thinking \nnobody can vote against it because, after all, it is either all or \nnothing.\n  That is very bad legislating and something I think we are going to \nresist because it represents not just an increase in spending but will \nundoubtedly represent bad policy as well.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that this ``post office Congress'' can get \non to some other business. I am delighted we have been able to select \ntwo items from the Defense authorization bill to adopt by unanimous \nconsent today. But that will not correct the deficiencies. I hope my \ncolleagues, in the remaining time before the August work period, and in \nthe months of September and October, will roll up their sleeves and \nwork on the problems the American people sent us here to resolve.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, last week was not a great week in the U.S. Senate. We \nhad an overnight session that was designed to highlight the efforts by \nthe majority to pass a timetable for withdrawal in Iraq, regardless of \nthe consequences of that timeline and that withdrawal.\n  We then had another episode where I think both sides of the aisle \nwere sort of forced to look in the abyss and to pull back because, as I \nam sure the Chair and other colleagues will recall, there was an \namendment clearly offered to embarrass the President and this side of \nthe aisle based upon the commutation of the sentence of Scooter \nLibby. There was an amendment offered highlighting the dozens of \npardons issued by President Clinton. As you will recall, Mr. President, \npeople paused at where we had gotten to in this debate--the acrimony \nand incriminations--and decided to figuratively lay our guns on the \ntable and walk away.\n\n  That vote on the Scooter Libby commutation was actually vitiated, \nsomething I have never seen happen before, but I guess anything can \nhappen by unanimous consent in the Senate, and it did. And there was no \nvote on the amendment to deal with the Clinton pardons.\n  I mention those because I think, unfortunately, the Senate has gotten \nto a bad place, not only in the eyes of the American people, where 16 \npercent, according to the most recent poll I have seen, believe the \nSenate is doing a good job, but we have gotten to a bad place in terms \nof the hyperpartisan atmosphere and the point-scoring that seems to \ntake precedence over all other matters. That is not the kind of Senate \nI ran to serve in, and I know that a number of colleagues feel exactly \nthe same way.\n  On Tuesday mornings, thanks to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee \nand Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, we have instituted a new \nbreakfast meeting each week. It is a bipartisan meeting. This was the \nsubject of some conversation--the amendments, the hyperpartisan \natmosphere, and really the episodes I just mentioned that occurred last \nweek.\n  Again this morning, on Wednesday morning, one of the highlights of my \nweek, I attended the Senate Prayer Breakfast. It is also bipartisan, \nobviously. This was brought up again, although I am not going to go \ninto any detail since both of those meetings occur without any policy \nstatements and, obviously, press is not invited; it is a private \nmeeting where Senators can come together on a bipartisan basis, both at \nthe Wednesday breakfast and the Tuesday breakfast, and talk about \nissues we care about, trying to do things for the American people, in \nthe case of a prayer breakfast to share stories and get to know each \nother a little bit better.\n  I will say that there is some recognition that the Senate has too \nmany team meetings--and by that I mean with Republicans meeting with \nother Republicans trying to figure out how we can win or score points \nagainst Democrats and Democrats meeting with Democrats thinking about \nways they can score points against Republicans--and not enough meetings \nwhere we get together on a bipartisan basis to try to figure out what \nwe can do to get business done for the benefit of the American people.\n  Senator Kyl mentioned the woeful record of accomplishments so far \nthis year. I note that beyond the unanimous consent requests that were \nproffered this morning that passed the Wounded Warrior legislation and \nthe pay raise for our men and women in uniform, the minimum wage \nincrease is the only substantive legislation that has passed so far \nthis year, notwithstanding that being part of the ``6 for '06'' part of \nthe campaign our friends on the other side of the aisle made part of \ntheir agenda.\n  I note, as Senator Kyl has pointed out, that since taking power more \nthan 200 days ago, the new majority has renamed 20 post offices. But my \npoint is that it has opened more than 300 investigations and held more \nthan 600 oversight hearings. Unfortunately, this has resulted in an \neffort to try to score political points by looking backward, conducting \ninvestigations about matters that have happened in the past or, I fear, \ntoo often partisan purposes and at the loss of our ability to look \nforward and figure out how do we work together to solve problems.\n  I guess one of the most recent manifestations of this hyperpartisan \natmosphere and the kind of point-scoring we see going on, to the \ndetriment of passing good bipartisan legislation, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, announced recently his intention to submit two \nresolutions to censure the President, one for his handling of the war \nin Iraq and the other for antiterrorism policies the administration has \nestablished. Of course, if he does follow through with his stated \nintention to submit these censure resolutions, that would prompt debate \non what I believe would be meaningless political gestures and would \nfurther delay substantive legislation we should be considering.\n  Senator Kyl mentioned the most direct example of the kind of game-\nplaying we have seen recently with the Defense authorization bill. Of \ncourse, that served as the platform for the debate on the withdrawal \nresolutions and the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by Senator \nLevin and Senator Reed, but when that did not pass, of course, that \nlegislation was pulled from the Senate's agenda. Of course, as Senator \nKyl pointed out, there are a lot of important parts of that bill which \nwill not be enacted because it was pulled down.\n  I am glad to see that the Wounded Warrior legislation, which I have \nworked on as part of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has now \npassed, as well as the 3-percent across-the-board pay raise. But other \nimportant parts of that legislation have not been passed, including a \n$4.1 billion authorization to procure Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \nvehicles. These, of course, are a new design of vehicles that are \ndesigned to defeat improvised explosive devices, which have been one of \nthe most deadly weapons used against our troops in Iraq. Unfortunately, \nmany of these weapons have been shipped, especially explosive foreign \npenetrators, from Iran to Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\n  There are other important parts of this legislation: For example, \nadding $2.7 billion for items on the Army Chief of Staff's unfunded \nrequirements list, including money for reactive armor and Stryker \nrequirements; $207 million for aviation survivability equipment; $102 \nmillion for combat training centers, and funding for explosive ordnance \nequipment, night-vision devices, and the like.\n\n  There is also $50 million in supplemental educational aid to local \nschool districts affected by the assignment or location of military \nfamilies, so-called impact aid, which affects my State. A lot of school \ndistricts depend on that money which is provided to local school \ndistricts because, of course, Federal property cannot be taxed for \npurposes of local education, and when you have a Federal military \ninstallation there with a lot of children going to those schools, the \nonly way they can pay the bills is to get this impact aid.\n  I could go on and on. Unfortunately, because of what we have seen in \nthis hyperpartisan atmosphere, those important provisions of the \nDefense authorization bill have not been passed, although I am glad \nthat the Wounded Warrior legislation and the 3-percent pay raise did \npass this morning by unanimous agreement.\n  Then, of course, we see another casualty of the hyperpartisan \natmosphere where it took more than 100 days for the new majority to \nallow the passage of an emergency war funding bill for our troops in \ncombat. This delay caused a lot of dislocation and hardship for our men \nand women in uniform and their families, the very people we ought to be \ntrying to lighten the burden for rather than burden them further with \nthe political theater and the political wars in the Senate.\n  Then there is the issue of judicial nominees. The last 2 years of \nPresident Clinton's term of office, with a Republican-controlled \nCongress, there were, if memory serves me correctly, 15 to 17 circuit \ncourt nominees confirmed. So far, we have only had a handful confirmed \nby this Congress, and we have judges stuck in this slow walk of a \nprocess--for example, judges such as Leslie Southwick, a nominee for \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Southwick's qualifications and credentials are outstanding. The \nAmerican Bar Association has given him its highest rating. He was \napproved unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee for a life-\ntenured position as a U.S. district judge during the 109th Congress. \nAlthough he is from Mississippi now and serves on the State courts in \nMississippi, he graduated from the University of Texas in 1975. After \ncompleting law school, he clerked for the presiding judge of the Texas \nCourt of Criminal Appeals and then for Judge Charles Clark on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. After a few years in private practice, Judge \nSouthwick reentered Government service in 1989 when he became a deputy \nassistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice. In 1994, \nJudge Southwick was elected 1 of the first 10 judges on the Mississippi \nCourt of Appeals. He remained on the bench, except for a military leave \nof absence from 2004 until 2006. During that time, he served as a staff \njudge advocate for the 155th Brigade combat team in Iraq.\n  Despite his stellar qualifications and strong support from his two \nhome State senators, so far it has been the demonstrated intent of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to block his ability to get a \nvote in the Senate Judiciary Committee and to prevent him from getting \nan up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  I should correct that. In fairness, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee has offered to give Judge Southwick a vote in the committee, \nbut we know committee Democrats are poised not only to tarnish the good \nrecord of this judge but then to perhaps send him here with a negative \nvote in committee. I know there are talks that are ongoing.\n  Unfortunately, I think this is a demonstration again of the \nhyperpartisan atmosphere that unfortunately poisons relations, not only \nbetween colleagues in the Senate but turns off so many people across \nthe country. It is regrettable.\n  My hope is, as we did last Thursday night, that we can walk away from \nthis hyperpartisan atmosphere, seeing that basically no one wins when \ncongressional approval hovers at 16 percent. It is hard to imagine that \nit could go much lower. Unless we turn away from the kinds of practices \nwe have seen for the first 200 days under this new majority and unless \nwe try harder to work together, have less team meetings and have more \nbipartisan meetings where we talk about what we can do to pass \nlegislation for the benefit of the American people, I fear Congress \nwill continue to be held in low esteem by the American people.\n  It is important that we wake to what should be a wake-up call that is \nprovided by these low poll numbers and the recognition that this serves \nno one's best interests, certainly not the best interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  My hope is that rather than just naming more post offices, rather \nthan passing one or two bills, such as the minimum wage bill and now \nthese bills by unanimous consent this morning, we will seize this \nopportunity to try to do what is in the best interest of the American \npeople. That is why most of us came to the Senate. Unfortunately, we \nhave been captivated by the partisanship that is insisted upon too \noften by narrow special interest groups that seem to spend a lot of \ntime at the Capitol and have way too much influence, in my view.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9863-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9863-S9864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DIGNIFIED TREATMENT OF WOUNDED WARRIORS ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, earlier this morning, the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, asked unanimous consent for the Senate to pass a \nsignificant piece of legislation, the Dignified Treatment of Wounded \nWarriors Act. That was agreed to, and the Senate has now accomplished a \nmajor step that I wish to take a few minutes to highlight this morning.\n  All of us were astounded earlier this year when the Washington Post \nran a series of articles about the treatment of our soldiers, our men \nand women, at the Walter Reed facility. They outlined the horrific \nconditions that some of our soldiers were living in as they received \ntreatment for their wounds from a war far away. After that, we talked \nto and heard about many soldiers who were in medical hold units not \nonly at Walter Reed but across the country who were waiting not a few \nweeks, not a few months, but months on end--and even almost 2 years--to \nget their disability ratings so that they could be discharged from the \nmilitary and continue on with their lives once they had been wounded.\n  I went up to Walter Reed with our majority leader and members of our \nleadership team to talk to some of the soldiers who were in medical \nhold at Walter Reed. They expressed complete frustration at what they \nfound themselves in. It was not just the physical part of their living \nconditions, but it was the fact that they had other wounded soldiers \nwho were their advocates trying to help them work through a disability \nsystem that made no sense to them, their advocate or to any of us who \nwere listening.\n  They talked about their family members who were literally left on \nhold not knowing when they would be able to come home, get a job, go \nback to work, and resume being a part of their family again. They \ntalked about long lines. They talked about paperwork that had gotten \nlost. They talked about not knowing they had traumatic brain injury \neven a year and a half after they had been wounded and came home.\n  No one had taken the time to ask them if they had been near an \nexplosive device and perhaps they had some kind of brain injury. Yet \nthey knew that they couldn't find their keys that they had set down, \nthey couldn't remember the dates of their kids' birth, they couldn't \nremember what they had done a few years ago, much less today. They knew \nsomething was wrong, but no one had taken the time to ask them what \nthey had seen on the ground in Iraq or what they had been involved with \nthat might have caused a brain injury.\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\n  I went home to the State of Washington and talked to some of our \nsoldiers who were in medical hold at one of our facilities in \nWashington State. I invited anyone who would like to come. I expected \nmaybe a dozen, two dozen men and women to come over and talk to me. \nOver 200 showed up, expressing anger, frustration, and telling story \nafter story after story of long delays in getting their disability \nratings, in being unable to get their lives put back together, in not \nbeing diagnosed correctly.\n  Well, I am proud the Senate, in a few short months, has stood up and \nsaid: Not on our watch. Not anymore. This morning, in passing the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act, we are moving forward in \nan aggressive way to make sure the men and women who have served our \ncountry so honorably are treated well when they come home. We are \nmaking sure those men and women who were asked to fight a war for this \ncountry, no matter how we felt about that war personally, those who \nwent to the war and fought for our country don't have to come home and \nfight their own country to get the health care they so deserve and \nshould get without having to fight someone for it.\n  This Senate acted in an aggressive way. Two of our committees, the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, headed by Senator Akaka, and the Armed \nServices Committee, headed by Senator Levin, in a bipartisan way, put \ntogether, for the first time, a historic joint committee to bring in \nexperts to talk to us about what the needs were and what we needed to \ndo. From those excellent recommendations from that joint hearing, we \nworked together in a bipartisan way to craft legislation that would \nrequire the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto develop a comprehensive policy by January 1 of next year on the \ncare, management, and transition of our servicemembers from the \nmilitary to the VA, or to civilian life, so our brave men and women \ndon't fall into that transitional trap between the DOD and the VA \nanymore and feel like they have come home and been lost.\n  This is critically important. It is an aggressive action that, for \nthe first time, will require the Department of the Defense and the \nDepartment of the VA to work together. Soldiers, men and women, too \noften feel like when they are in the service--in the Army, in the Navy, \nin the Armed Forces--there is a completely different system that \ndoesn't even talk to our VA, which has a totally different disability \nsystem. Their paperwork doesn't go back and forth between each \nregarding how they are rated as disabled. The Army is completely \ndifferent than how they are rated by the Veterans Affairs Department. \nThat means their care is not adequate, it means they are frustrated, it \nmeans they are angry, and we say: No more. We are requiring now the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly \ncome back to us with a policy that makes sense for this country's men \nand women who have fought for all of us.\n  In this legislation, we also dealt with enhanced health care for our \nmen and women who have served us. Too often they find their health care \ncut off long before they are able to get back and get a job. We \nauthorize disability ratings of 50 percent or higher to receive health \ncare benefits for 3 years. For some of the family members of a spouse--\nhusband or wife--who have been injured, they lose their own health \ncare. So we make sure we aggressively move forward and not allow our \nfamilies to be left without health care while their servicemember is \nbeing cared for at one of our medical facilities.\n  We also focus dramatically on TBI, traumatic brain injury, and post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome, two significant wounds of this war. We \nestablish new centers of excellence within the Department of Defense, \none for TBI and one for post-traumatic stress syndrome. We require the \nDepartment of Defense to analyze soldiers so they do not go home and \nend up like the young man who told me he had been discharged from the \nArmy and for 18 months was at home. No one asked him when he was \ndischarged whether he had been around any kind of IED explosion in \nIraq. No one asked him how he was doing. For 18 months, he sat at home \nin a rural community in my State and wondered why he could no longer \ntalk to his friends; wondered why he couldn't remember what he learned \nin school a few years ago; wondered why, as a young man of 22, he felt \nhis life had changed dramatically and he didn't know who he was \nanymore. Eventually, he tried to take his own life. That should not \nhappen to a service man or woman who has served us honorably.\n\n  What happened to him has happened to many other soldiers who have \nserved us in Iraq. He had been around not 1, not 5, not 20, but more \nthan 100 explosions while he was on the ground in Iraq. As a result, he \nhad severe traumatic brain injury that was not diagnosed when he left. \nNo one asked him when he was discharged whether he was having any \nproblems. No one followed up when he got home, to see if he was \nadjusting okay.\n  We say, no more. We say the Department of Defense looks at every \nsoldier when they come in and when they leave, asks them what kind of \naction they have seen on the ground in Iraq, and follows up with them \nand gives them the care so they can perform and come back to normal \nlife as quickly as possible. This is the least we can do.\n  It has taken the Senate just a few months to aggressively go after \nthis, to pass a bill through committee, to bring it here to the floor \nof the Senate and, very importantly, the full Senate this morning \nsupporting that legislation and passing it to the House, hopefully \nquickly to conference and to the desk of the President of the United \nStates. That is what our soldiers deserve. I am sorry it happened 4\\1/\n2\\ years after this war started. It should have happened before this \nwar started with the preplanning that I will not go into this morning \nthat obviously we did not have. But I will say as a Senator who did not \nvote to go to war in Iraq, I have said consistently--no matter how we \nfelt about that war then or how we feel about it today--that we have an \nobligation, as leaders of this country, to make sure the men and women \nwho fight for us get the care they deserve. The passage of this bill \ntoday is part of that commitment, and I am very proud of the Senate.\n  Later this morning, the commission the President has put in place, \nthe Dole-Shalala commission, will also come forward with their \nrecommendations. I look forward to seeing what they have to say, but \nthis Senate is not going to sit around and wait for a report from \nanybody. We are moving, and moving aggressively. I hope whatever \nrecommendations come out in the Dole-Shalala commission report that we \nsee today do not end up on a dusty shelf in the White House, as the 9/\n11 Commission recommendations did or as the Iraq study commission \nrecommendations did. I hope the White House works aggressively to make \nsure these recommendations--both from Congress and from their \ncommission--are put into effect because whatever laws we pass will only \nbe managed efficiently and effectively and work if the White House \njoins us in a partnership to make this happen.\n  I wanted all of our colleagues in the Senate to know, and for the \ncountry to know, we are moving aggressively forward to make sure the \nmen and women who serve us are served as well by this country, and I am \nproud of the action of the Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9864-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9864-S9866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to talk about \na bill that I am proud of, and of which all Americans should be proud.\n  I first want to commend the esteemed chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd for his commitment to drafting a bill that is \nin our Nation's best interest. I also would like to convey my respect \nfor Senator Byrd and the ranking member, Senator Cochran, for the \nexemplary bipartisan they have shown in negotiating this bill and \nbringing it to the floor.\n  The Homeland Security Appropriations bill that will be before us \nlater\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\ntoday is a clear indication that our priorities have changed. After \nyears of neglecting key homeland security initiatives, this bill ends a \ntrend that has been straining our first responders, forcing our States \nto come up with more, and leaving us more vulnerable than we should be \n6 years after September 11.\n  This bill is part of a framework that we have created this year to \nrestructure our priorities--and it is clear that homeland security is \nat the top of the list. I am proud of the levels we set in the budget \nresolution we passed earlier this year. As a member of the Budget \nCommittee, one of my top requests to Chairman Conrad was that we \nprovide enough to the Appropriations Committee so that it could not \njust reject the President's cuts to key homeland security funding, but \ngo above and beyond what has been funded in recent years. I thank \nChairman Conrad, for his commitment to homeland security funding in the \nbudget resolution and for understanding what those funds mean to a \nState like New Jersey.\n  This year we have set the tone. The message is clear--when it comes \nto homeland security, the status quo just won't cut it. This bill says \nthat loud and clear. By increasing overall funding by 8 percent over \nlast year, we recognize that those on our front lines need our support. \nIn this bill, they will get it.\n  For New Jersey, the funds in this bill mean the difference between \nhaving what we need to protect our high-risk areas and leaving our \ninfrastructure vulnerable. The grants this bill provides means millions \nmore for our ports to increase site security and implement key \ninitiatives.\n  The increases for next year mean our fire departments will have the \nresources they need to hire new firefighters, to upgrade their \nequipment, and to reduce the long shifts far too many of them are \nworking. The focus on first responder funding means our law enforcement \nwill continue to have support to carry out key terrorism prevention \nefforts in our cities.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this bill does not take the approach that \nwe can do what is minimally required and pretend that is enough. For \nall of the President's talks about how critical security at home is, \nfor all the administration continues to warn us about how at risk we \nare for an attack, I am just dumbfounded because no matter where I \nlook, I cannot find where he makes supporting our first responders a \npriority. No matter how hard I try, I cannot see how he expects our \nports to be as secure as they should be 6 years after September 11. For \nall the reminders this administration likes to give the American people \nthat we are at war, that we are vulnerable, that we must be vigilant, I \ndo not see where we are matching that rhetoric with dollars.\n  This bill is about more than rhetoric. It is about providing what is \nneeded.\n  I am proud that this bill rejects the President's cuts to first \nresponders, and actually increases funding by $644 million. Nearly 6 \nyears after September 11, would seem unfathomable that we would \nactually cut funding for first responders, but that is exactly what the \nPresident's budget called for.\n  In this bill, we provide more than $400 million than the President \nfor firefighters. We increase funding for FIRE grants by $25 million \nmore than last year so that fire departments can purchase new \nequipment. When nearly a third of firefighters are not equipped with a \nself-contained breathing apparatus or portable radios, I think there is \nno question that these funds are sorely needed. One of the grant \nprograms I hear about the most, as I am sure do many members, is the \nSAFER grants. I have listened to firefighters from my State far too \nmany times plead for the SAFER grants not to be cut. And yet, every \nyear, this is a fight we have had to have with the administration. I \ntruly hope this is the last year. These grants help departments \nincrease their staff, often so they can cover more 24-hour shifts. Our \nbill increases funding by $13 million over last year.\n  I am also extremely proud of the direction this bill takes us for \nimproving key grant funding to States and our most at-risk areas. This \nbill restores the two major grant programs, the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, and \nincreases funding for urban area security grants. For reasons I cannot \nexplain, the President sought to cut State homeland grants in half, and \npractically eliminate the law enforcement grants.\n  For States like New Jersey, these funds are not just an added bonus--\nthey are essential. These grants allow States to purchase equipment, \ntrain first responders, put in place response plans, and a whole host \nof other critical activities. By restoring cuts to these programs, \nofficials in New Jersey will have the confidence that we are working to \nprovide them every last dollar, and that we understand how critical \nthis funding is.\n  Our bill also provides an increase for the Urban Area Security \nInitiative, the only fully-risked based funding of its kind, designed \nto help the most high-threat urban areas. I have spoken on this floor \nbefore about the unique threats that our UASI--Urban Area Security \nInitiative--region in northern New Jersey faces. As one of the most \ndensely populated areas in the Nation, we face the complexity of \npopulous neighborhoods nestled among high-profile infrastructure, \nincluding the largest port on the east coast, a major international \nairport, and a string of chemical plants--which makes up what is known \nas the ``2 most dangerous miles'' in America. When people back home \nhear that, they ask me what we are doing to protect that area, because \nthose 2 miles are not isolated--thousands drive by it every day, and \nmany live close enough to call it their backyard. When we pass this \nbill, I can tell them that yes, we are working to make more funding \navailable, yes, we are addressing those areas most at risk.\n  Our bill also seeks to end the trend of pouring our resources into \naviation security and spending pennies in comparison on rail, mass \ntransit, port, and chemical security. This bill more than doubles \nfunding for rail and transit security, and far exceeds what our past \nfunding bills have done for port security. We provide $400 million for \nport security grants, a level which our ports have been calling for for \nsome time.\n  Anyone who knows the Port of New York and New Jersey understands the \ndaunting task of securing the perimeter of the port. The port is \nsurrounded by storage facilities and warehouses, with waterways on one \nside, and a major highway and an airport on the other, and rail lines \nand a major pipeline running along side it. So, for a site as complex \nas our port, perimeter security is no easy feat.\n  Our Nation's ports have a long to-do list, and I guarantee you, every \none of the improvements they want to make costs money. In the wake of \nthe SAFE Port Act, which the President signed into law last year, our \nports have even more requirements they are supposed to carry out. Yet \nthe President did not call for any funding to implement these \ninitiatives. Our bill does.\n  We double port security grants, to the level authorized in the SAFE \nPort Act.\n  We provide $15 million for the Coast Guard so they can increase the \nnumber of inspections at facilities, conduct vulnerability assessments, \nand develop long-range vessel tracking systems.\n  We provide $60 million for operational centers as called for in the \nSAFE Port Act that will help coordinate information sharing, \nintelligence gathering, and support cooperation among Federal, State, \nand local agencies.\n  And, we provide $15 million to help ports implement the TWIC port \nworker ID program, which has been delayed again and again. It is past \ntime for us to have something as simple as uniform, technologically \nadvanced ID cads for those workers at our ports.\n  This bill also contains a very short, but very crucial provision that \nis well known to people in New Jersey. It allows States to have more \nstringent chemical security standards. If you have ever been to \nNewark's Liberty Airport, than you were within a few short miles of the \nKuehne plant in South Kearny, in a range that would without question be \ndevastated by an attack at that facility. Because plants like this one \nare uniquely sandwiched between highways and neighborhoods, in an area \nthat rises to the level of being called the ``2 most dangerous miles,'' \nNew Jersey has taken action to make sure we are doing everything \npossible to keep these plants secure.\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\n  Because it is far ahead of the curve when it comes to chemical \nsecurity, the notion that the Department of Homeland Security can issue \nregulations that could preempt New Jersey's, and possibly be weaker \nthan our standards, turns logic on its head. The bottom line is, when \nit comes to the security of things uniquely New Jersey, like the \nlocation of this chemical plant, no one knows what we need better than \nour State. And that is the position that this bill takes. I applaud my \nfellow Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, for ensuring this \nlanguage is part of this bill, and I thank Senator Byrd for realizing \nhow essential preserving New Jersey's standards are for the future of \nchemical security.\n  When this Homeland Security appropriations bill is passed and signed \ninto law, we will be able to definitively say we have passed \nlegislation that makes us smarter and stronger when it comes to our \nNation's security.\n  The bill ensures we are protecting, not neglecting, our critical \ninfrastructure; our first responders have more, not less, to do their \njobs; and our States will have the critical resources they deserve.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this incredibly sound bill and \ntake this important step to getting our homeland security funding where \nit should be in finally meeting the challenge of securing our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, as you will recall, in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzales appeared. I spoke \nwith him about a seemingly simple concept, the impartial administration \nof justice.\n  But, as is so often the case with this administration and with this \nAttorney General, the simple is often confused, and what should be \nimpartial is often tainted with politics.\n  I asked the Attorney General about the administration's policy \nregarding communications between staff at the Department of Justice and \nat the White House, about ongoing investigations and cases. This kind \nof conversation, of course, should be very limited in scope. Until \nrecently, it was.\n  Attorney General Janet Reno wrote, in a 1994 letter to White House \nCounsel Lloyd Cutler:\n\n       Initial communications between the White House and the \n     Justice Department regarding any pending Department \n     investigation or criminal or civil case should involve only \n     the White House Counsel or Deputy Counsel (or President or \n     Vice President), and the Attorney General or Deputy or \n     Associate Attorney General.\n\n  That is seven people, total. Four in the White House, three in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  As I pointed out to the Attorney General, this administration has \ndramatically expanded this policy to allow literally hundreds of people \nat the White House to discuss sensitive case-specific information with \ndozens of people at the Department of Justice. Even worse, a further \nrevision to this policy signed by Attorney General Gonzales \nspecifically added the Vice Presidents's Chief of Staff and the Vice \nPresident's Counsel, David Addington, to the list of those empowered to \nhave these conversations. Karl Rove, by the way, is also on the list.\n  Why in the world would it be appropriate to give the Vice President's \nstaff a green light to muck around in sensitive Department of Justice \naffairs? Based on my experience as a U.S. attorney, I can think of no \nreason.\n  So why did the Attorney General himself issue a memo specifically \nauthorizing that? Well, the Attorney General himself seemed to have no \nidea. When I asked him about it yesterday, he said:\n\n       As a general matter, I would say that that's a good \n     question. I'd have to go back and look at this. On it's face, \n     I must say, sitting here, I am troubled by this.\n\n  Well, Mr. Gonzales, I am troubled by this too. Troubled but, \nunfortunately, not surprised.\n  Not surprised because this administration has, at almost every turn, \ndone everything possible to enhance the power of the President and the \nVice President to dismiss Congress's essential constitutional oversight \nresponsibilities, to disrupt the balance of power crafted by our \nforefathers and to thwart those who would stand up and say: Enough is \nenough.\n  But now a chorus of Senators is finally saying: Enough is enough.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I spoke often about the need for a check \non the Bush administration's relentless abuse of power. Now, after \nhaving served in this great institution for only 6\\1/2\\ months, I feel \nmore strongly than ever that it is vital for our Democratic majority to \nserve as an essential bulwark against an imperial executive branch.\n  Without 60 votes, we cannot get things done over objection from the \nother side as often as we would like. But with a majority, we can at \nleast stop some of the mischief. We can stop them from politicizing \neverything from Government-funded scientific research to U.S. \nattorney's offices, Government functions that have historically \noperated entirely free of partisan influence.\n  We can spotlight their efforts to undo our system of checks and \nbalances, their penchant for unneeded secrecy, and often, disregard for \nthe law and our American principles.\n  We can call them out when they use national security as a shield \nagainst legitimate oversight and as a weapon against political \nadversaries, against attempts to conduct Government in secret and in \ndarkness and sometimes in defiance of the law.\n  In the process, the administration has done grave damage to the \nprinciples and values that have made this country an example for the \nworld. The writ of habeas corpus? Adherence to the Geneva Conventions? \nThe independence of Federal prosecutors? The principle of judicial \nreview? The notion that a citizen in a democracy has a right to know \nwhat their Government is doing in his name?\n  Each of these, in ways great and small, has been eroded by this \nadministration. Then, when you think they cannot possibly push the \nenvelope any further, they do. I am referring to two recent episodes: \nFirst, the Vice President's now infamous and incredible assertion that \nhis office is exempt from an Executive order designed to protect \nclassified information because it is not, get this, it is not an entity \nwithin the executive branch, and the Attorney General's apparent \ncomplicity with this theory.\n  Executive Order No. 12958, as amended by President Bush, regulates \nthe classification, safeguarding, and declassification of national \nsecurity information. It also requires the National Archives' \nInformation Security Oversight Office to, among other things, conduct \nonsite inspection of Federal agencies and White House offices to ensure \ncompliance with these important regulations.\n  Despite cooperating with the National Archives in 2001 and 2002, in \n2003, the Vice President abruptly decided he was above complying with \nan Executive order, even one signed by President Bush.\n\n  Repeated attempts by the National Archives to secure the Vice \nPresident's cooperation or at least an explanation for noncompliance \nwere met with silence and then, apparently, an effort to abolish the \noffice that had dared try to enforce the law.\n  In the meantime, in January 2007, the National Archives referred the \nquestion to the Department of Justice for clarification, as to whether \nthe Vice President is an executive branch entity required to comply \nwith an Executive order. You might think that in 6 months the \nDepartment of Justice would produce a memo stating the Vice President \nmust comply with Executive orders and that he is, in fact, as we all \nknow, in the executive branch.\n  Well, you would be wrong. The Vice President makes an argument that \nwould flunk an elementary school civics test so he may circumvent \nsafeguards on national security information. The Attorney General goes \nalong with this by refusing even to respond to a letter seeking \nclarification of the law, which is a core function of the Department of \nJustice Office of Legal Counsel.\n  What is going on here? Second, in this ignominious list is the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\npersonal intervention to deny security clearances to investigators from \nthe Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, or as \nwe call it, OPR, who were looking into the administration's warrantless \ndomestic surveillance program.\n  This is the first time ever an OPR investigator was denied necessary \nclearances to conduct their investigation. Of course, the denial of \nsecurity clearances had the intended effect: The investigation by OPR \nwas shut down.\n  Now, as we all know, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has been forced to issue subpoenas \nto the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Department of \nJustice, and the National Security Council, in order to obtain \ninformation Congress has sought for months related to the \nadministration's legal justification for the warrantless wiretapping \nprogram.\n  If the White House's refusal to honor earlier congressional subpoenas \nand turn over information on the U.S. attorney firings is any \nindication of things to come, we can expect more stalling and more \nstonewalling by this administration as Congress seeks to learn the \ntruth.\n  Again, what is going on here? What is going on, I believe, is a \nsystematic effort on the part of the Bush administration, to twist, to \npartisan and political advantage, threats to our national security as \njustification for conducting Government in secret and in darkness, \nshadowed from congressional oversight and far from the light of public \nscrutiny.\n  If this requires making preposterous arguments, such as the Vice \nPresident's, in their view, that is fine. If this requires taking \nunprecedented action to deny clearance to Government investigators, \nfine by them. If this requires dispensing with many years of tradition \nand practice, distorting the plain language of Executive orders and \nabdicating the Department of Justice's watchdog role, again, fine with \nthem. If this requires attempts to a evade even a congressional \nsubpoena, well, that is apparently fine too.\n  I will end where I began, with the issue of communications regarding \nongoing cases and investigations between the White House and the \nDepartment of Justice. As Mr. Gonzales acknowledged yesterday, the \ngreatest danger of infection of the Department of Justice with improper \npolitical influence comes from the White House.\n  Along with Chairman Leahy, I have introduced a bill to set the Reno-\nCutler policy for White House contacts as a baseline and to require the \nDepartment of Justice and the White House to report to Congress any \ntime they authorize someone else to have these sensitive discussions.\n  It is my sincere hope this bill will have bipartisan support. But \nthis bill is only one small part of a larger effort to restore checks \nand balances to our Government. We must and we will continue this \neffort, challenging the administration to work for the Democratic \nCongress, to stop playing politics with national security, and to end \nthe secrecy and abuse of power that have become the hallmark of the \nBush era.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9867-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9867-S9869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JUDGE LESLIE SOUTHWICK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the more challenging tasks for a \nSenator is not to stand in judgment of a bill or even a law or a policy \nbut to stand in judgment of a person. I served in the House of \nRepresentatives for 14 years before coming to the Senate. It is the one \ndramatic difference between the two bodies. Time and again we are \ncalled on in the Senate, in our capacity to advise and consent to \nPresidential nominations, to stand in judgment of people. It is not an \neasy assignment. You have to, in a matter of a short period, maybe meet \na person, read about their background, and try to think ahead whether \nthey are ready for the job they are being sent to do. For some it is \nonly a temporary assignment. It might be for a year or two or more in a \nFederal agency with an important responsibility. I look at those \njudgments and assignments seriously, but not nearly as seriously as the \ntask of picking Federal judges. A Federal judge, that man or woman, is \nappointed for a lifetime. The decision you make about a person has to \nbe done more carefully. There has to be more reflection. If questions \nare raised about a person, their judgment, their values, their \nbackground, their veracity, their integrity, those questions are taken \nmore seriously because that judge on that bench will be the face of \nAmerica's law for the rest of his or her natural life.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I come face to face with \nthese decisions on a regular basis and try to do my best to not only \nhelp pick good judges for my own State of Illinois but to be fair in \njudging those the President, whether a Democrat or Republican, sends to \nus for approval.\n  There is a controversial nomination now pending for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, the nomination of a local State judge in \nMississippi named Leslie Southwick. I came to the Southwick nomination \nwith no advance knowledge of the man or anything he had done. I truly \nhad an open mind. I attended his nomination hearing and tried to give \nhim the benefit of the doubt. Today I am sorry to report I have only \ndoubt about his appointment to this lifetime position. There are too \nmany questions about whether Judge Southwick would bring a measure of \nfairness in cases involving civil rights and the rights of ordinary \npeople in his court. This perception as to whether he will be fair or \nevenhanded is determinative in my mind. Whether you agree with that \nperception, it is there.\n  It is sad but accurate to report that Judge Southwick has lost the \nconfidence of the civil rights community in the State of Mississippi \nand across the Nation. There is one case I wish to mention which may \nhelp explain why this has occurred. The case is called Richmond v. \nMississippi Department of Human Services. Because of the wording in the \ncase, it is unfortunate, I will be unable to read it into the Record; \nit would be inappropriate. But suffice it to say, in this 1998 case, \nthe Mississippi State Court of Appeals ruled 5 to 4 to reinstate and \ngive back pay to a White employee who had been fired for calling a \nBlack employee the ``N'' word. Judge Southwick was in the five-person \nmajority and thus was the deciding vote in that case.\n  Here is the background. The plaintiff, Bonnie Richmond, was a White \nemployee who worked at the Mississippi Department of Human Services, a \nState agency with a 50-percent African-American workforce. After \nreferring to an African-American colleague as a ``good ole'' ``N'' \nword, Bonnie Richmond, the white employee, was fired. She appealed her \ntermination and was successful. A State hearing officer reinstated her. \nThat decision was affirmed by the full Mississippi Employee Appeals \nBoard, then reversed by the State court trial judge. Judge Southwick's \ncourt reversed it again, ruling for the White employee who had used the \noffensive racial epithet. Finally, the Mississippi Supreme Court \nweighed in. The Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously reversed the \nmajority opinion which Judge Southwick had signed his name to, ordering \nthe case to be remanded to determine an appropriate punishment short of \ntermination for the White employee, Bonnie Richmond.\n  Mr. Southwick's defenders point out that he didn't write the opinion \nhe signed on to. That is certainly true. But he didn't have to sign on \nto it, if he didn't agree with it. He could have filed a concurrence \nagreeing in the judgment but not the reasoning. He chose not to do so. \nThe opinion Judge Southwick signed stated that the White employee who \nused the ``N'' word in this case ``was not motivated out of racial \nhatred or animosity directed toward her co-worker or toward blacks in \ngeneral.''\n  I don't believe that is a mainstream view in America. I don't believe \nit is a mainstream view to say that the ``N'' word is ``not motivated \nout of racial\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\nhatred or animosity.'' The Southwick majority also affirmed the \ndetermination of the hearing officer who said the use of the term good \nold ``N'' word was intended to mean a ``teacher's pet'' and was in this \ncontext about as offensive as calling someone ``a good old boy or Uncle \nTom or chubby or fat or slim.'' Again, is that a mainstream view in \nAmerica?\n  Recently a civil rights organization had a symbolic ceremonial burial \nfor the ``N'' word, saying it is time it be removed from the American \nlanguage, it is so offensive. For someone in Judge Southwick's court to \nbe so dismissive of this term is truly to be insensitive. I don't \nbelieve the opinion which Judge Southwick signed on to reflected the \ntype of racial sensitivity we need in a Federal judge.\n  The dissent in the case was eloquent and powerful. It said:\n\n       The [``N'' word] is, and has always been, offensive. Search \n     high and low, you will not find any non-offensive definition \n     of this term. There are some words, which by their nature and \n     definition are so inherently offensive, that their use \n     establishes the intent to offend.\n\n  I certainly agree with that powerful dissent. I am sorry Judge \nSouthwick does not.\n  At his May 10, 2007 hearing, Judge Southwick was asked if he still \nstood by his vote in that case. He said he did. I find that very \ntroubling.\n\n  This is particularly important given the context of this nomination. \nThis Fifth Circuit covers the States of Mississippi, Texas, and \nLouisiana. Those three States have the largest percentage of minority \nresidents of any Federal circuit in America--44 percent. The State of \nMississippi has the largest percentage of African Americans of any \nState in the Union--36 percent.\n  There are 19 judges on the Fifth Circuit. Of those 19, only one is \nAfrican American. That would be Judge Carl Stewart of Louisiana.\n  Now, some have suggested that recent nominees to the Fifth Circuit \nreflect a deliberate design to protect this imbalance. Others say it is \na conscious disregard of the obvious unfairness. The most generous view \nis that it is only a coincidence.\n  Two previous nominees to this Fifth Circuit seat--Charles Pickering \nand Michael Wallace--were not confirmed because of their anti-civil \nrights backgrounds.\n  Judge Pickering had unethically tried to lower the prison sentence \nfor a convicted cross burner. Mr. Wallace defended the discriminatory \npolicies of Bob Jones University and was so notorious for his hostility \nto civil rights that the American Bar Association gave him a rating of \n``not qualified.''\n  The Southwick nomination has become a controversial nomination, with \nmore focus than any other current circuit court nomination I can think \nof on the racial issue. Time and again, the nominees sent by the White \nHouse to the Senate Judiciary Committee fail the most basic test as to \nwhether they will fill this lifetime position on the Federal bench and \nrule fairly on issues involving race.\n  It is critical that members of the Fifth Circuit have an open mind \nwhen it comes to issues of race. In a letter sent to the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Congressional Black Caucus opposed the confirmation of \nJudge Southwick and said:\n\n       Our Caucus is most concerned about Mr. Southwick's ability \n     to afford equal justice under law in the Circuit where racial \n     discrimination has always been most pronounced.\n\n  In another letter of opposition sent to the Judiciary Committee, the \nNAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Urban League, and the \nRainbow/PUSH Coalition said:\n\n       This position is a lifetime appointment. If confirmed, \n     Southwick will often provide the final word on the civil \n     rights of millions of minority residents within the Fifth \n     Circuit.\n\n  Historically, there have been some judicial giants in the Fifth \nCircuit who have served with great courage. Alabama used to be part of \nthat Circuit. A few years ago, I went to Alabama for the first time as \na guest of an organization known as the Faith and Politics Institute on \nCapitol Hill. It is a bipartisan group, and it tries to blend some \nviews toward values with political decisions.\n  Under the leadership of John Lewis, the Congressman from Atlanta, GA, \nwho was a pioneer in the civil rights movement, we went down to visit \nsome of the key places where the civil rights struggle occurred.\n  We went to Birmingham and Montgomery and Selma, AL. I had to leave a \nlittle early, and so it appeared I would not have a chance to visit the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge, the notorious bridge where the march from Selma \nwas stopped with violence. John Lewis, typical of what a fine person he \nis, said: I will get up extra early Sunday morning. I will drive you \nover there. You and I will walk across the bridge together.\n  Well, Senator Sam Brownback joined us, and I am sure Senator \nBrownback felt as I did, that it was an extraordinary day. That early, \ncool Sunday morning, John Lewis took us across that bridge and showed \nus the point where he had been clubbed and almost killed, as he tried \nto walk on that civil rights march.\n  I will never forget that scene. As a college student, I thought that \nmaybe I could be there at that march. As luck would have it, I was not. \nI have regretted it ever since. But to be there that moment with John \nLewis a few years ago really was a touching experience.\n  As we were driving back from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, John Lewis \nsaid to me: Do you know who the real hero was that day? It was Federal \nJudge Frank Johnson of Alabama. Johnson ordered the integration of \nMontgomery buses after Rosa Parks' protest in 1956, and he was the one \nwho allowed that march in Selma to take place. Because of Judge \nJohnson's courage, he was shunned by his community, ostracized. His \nmother's home was bombed. He was threatened many times because of his \ncourage when it came to the issue of civil rights.\n  So when we speak of the Fifth Circuit, and its history, and Federal \njudges, I think of Frank Johnson and what he meant to America's history \nbecause of his courage.\n  At Judge Southwick's nomination hearing, I wanted to be fair with \nhim, and I asked him a question which was maybe one of the easiest \nquestions you could ask of a nominee. I asked him to name a single time \nin his career or in his life when he took an unpopular point of view on \nbehalf of the voiceless or powerless. He could not name a single \ninstance.\n  I thought, perhaps that was not fair. The judge should be allowed to \nreflect on that question. I will send it to him in writing and ask him: \nWas there a time in your life when you sided, for example, with a civil \nrights plaintiff when your court was split? He could not name a single \ncase in his judicial career.\n  There has been a heavy focus placed on Judge Southwick's votes in the \nso-called ``N'' word case--which I have discussed--and a custody case \nin which he voted to take an 8-year-old girl away from her lesbian \nmother.\n  I disagree with Judge Southwick's position in these cases. I think, \nsadly, they show an inclination toward intolerance and insensitivity. \nBut I am sympathetic to the argument that these are only two cases out \nof thousands in which he has taken part. However, it is not the end of \nthe story.\n\n  A business group in Mississippi looked at 638 cases during an 8-year \nperiod of time and rated Judge Southwick as the judge on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals most likely to rule against common, \nordinary people, employees suing their employers. Another study showed \nhe voted with companies and employers, businesses and powerful \ninterests, in 160 out of 180 cases in which there was a split decision.\n  Many groups that do not normally take a position on a Federal judge \nhave spoken out against Judge Southwick. There are many positive things \nabout this judge's life. He has served his country. He has served in \nthe military. And I am sure he has done many good things. But when a \nSenator has to make a decision about a lifetime appointment to a \ncritical circuit court position, in a controversial area, where we have \nhad a string of controversial nominees, you have to take that very \nseriously.\n  There is just too much doubt about whether Judge Southwick will have \nan open mind when it comes to civil rights and the rights of ordinary \npeople in his court, and that is why I will oppose him if he comes \nbefore the Judiciary Committee.\n  A final word. Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, has said he will\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\ncall Judge Southwick for a vote whenever Senator Specter and the \nRepublican minority want his name to be called. I do not know how my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side will vote. I know many of them share \nmy misgivings.\n  Judge Southwick has had a hearing, which is more than can be said for \nmany nominees from the Clinton administration--over 60 judicial \nnominees were bottled up in the Senate Judiciary Committee during those \nyears, never even given the dignity or courtesy of a hearing and vote. \nJudge Southwick had his hearing. He had his opportunity to speak and \nanswer questions, unlike dozens of Clinton nominees who never had that \nchance.\n  Now his record is there for everyone to view, and his name is there \nif the Republicans decide they wish to call him for a vote. This is not \nobstructionism. This is the process as it should work. I urge my \ncolleagues, particularly from the State of Mississippi, if Judge \nSouthwick does not prevail, I hope they will be able to find in that \ngreat State someone who can be brought to this nomination who will not \nincur the wrath and doubt that Judge Southwick has over his decisions \nand over his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the very \nable and distinguished Senator from South Carolina, for his \ncharacteristic courtesy.\n  Mr. President, this morning, we return to the consideration of the \nfiscal year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill. The \nAppropriations Committee, by a vote of 29 to 0, produced a balanced and \nresponsible bill.\n  The bill includes significant resources for border security, for \nenforcing our immigration laws, and for improving security at our \nairports. We include--we include, may I say--significant new resources \nfor implementing the SAFE Port Act. We also restore cuts in the first \nresponder grants program.\n  Last week, the administration released its latest National \nIntelligence Estimate concerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. \nhomeland. Hear me now. I will say that again. Last week, the \nadministration released its latest National Intelligence Estimate \nconcerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. That is right \nhere, the U.S. homeland. I will quote from the report. This is not just \nRobert Byrd talking.\n  Let me say that again. Last week, the administration released its \nlatest--I am talking about the administration, the Bush administration, \nthe administration in control of the executive branch--the \nadministration released its latest National Intelligence Estimate \nconcerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. I will quote from \nthe report:\n\n       We judge the U.S. Homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next three years.\n\n  That ought to make us sit up and take notice. I am going to say it \nagain. Hear me.\n  Last week, the administration released its latest National \nIntelligence Estimate concerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. \nhomeland. I will quote from the report:\n\n       We judge the U.S. Homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. The main \n     threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, \n     especially al-Qa'ida, driven by their undiminished intent to \n     attack the Homeland and a continued effort by these terrorist \n     groups to adapt and improve their capabilities. . . .\n       [W]e judge that al-Qa'ida will intensify its efforts to put \n     operatives here.\n\n  Let me repeat that word--here, H-E-R-E.\n  Yesterday, in light of this latest threat assessment from the \nGovernment's most senior intelligence analyst--I better read that \nagain. Yesterday, in light of this latest threat assessment from the \nGovernment's most senior intelligence analyst, I urged the President to \nreconsider his veto threat of this bill. This morning, we received the \nWhite House's response. The President has said he will veto this bill \nbecause he, the President--President Bush--regards the additional \nspending for border security, port security, aviation security, and for \nfirst responder grants as excessive.\n  The President has every right to make this threat, but, in my view, \nthe view of this West Virginia mountaineer, the threat is \nirresponsible. Let me say that again. In my view--and I am a U.S. \nSenator--the threat is irresponsible.\n  If the President is going to scare the Nation by issuing intelligence \nestimates that say the threat of a terrorist attack is persistent and \nevolving, he, the President--President Bush--has a responsibility to \nback it up with resources to deter that threat. The Appropriations \nCommittee recognizes the threat, and the Appropriations Committee of \nthe Senate has responded responsibly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement \nof Administration Policy dated July 25, 2007.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Administration Policy, S. 1644--Department of Homeland \n                   Security Appropriations Act, 2008\n\n       (Sponsor: Senator Byrd (D), West Virginia.)\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 1644 because, in \n     combination with the other FY 2008 appropriations bills, it \n     includes an irresponsible and excessive level of spending and \n     includes other objectionable provisions.\n       The President has proposed a responsible plan for a \n     balanced budget by 2012 through spending restraint and \n     without raising taxes. To achieve this important goal, the \n     Administration supports a responsible discretionary spending \n     total of not more than $933 billion in FY 2008, which is a \n     $60 billion increase over the FY 2007 enacted level. The \n     Democratic Budget Resolution and subsequent spending \n     allocations adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     exceed the President's discretionary spending topline by $22 \n     billion causing a 9 percent increase in FY 2008 discretionary \n     spending. In addition, the Administration opposes the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee's plan to shift $3.5 billion from \n     the Defense appropriations bill to non-defense spending, \n     which is inconsistent with the Democrats' Budget Resolution \n     and risks diminishing America's war fighting capacity.\n       S. 1644 exceeds the President's request for programs funded \n     in this bill by $2.2 billion, part of the $22 billion \n     increase above the President's request for FY 2008 \n     appropriations. The Administration has asked that Congress \n     demonstrate a path to live within the President's topline and \n     cover the excess spending in this bill through reductions \n     elsewhere. Because Congress has failed to demonstrate such a \n     path. if S. 1644 were presented to the President, he would \n     veto the bill.\n       The President has called on Congress to reform the \n     earmarking process that has led to wasteful and unnecessary \n     spending. Specifically, he called on Congress to provide \n     greater transparency and full disclosure of earmarks, to put \n     them in the language of the bill itself, eliminate wasteful \n     earmarks, and to cut the cost and number by at least half. \n     The Administration opposes any efforts to shield earmarks \n     from public scrutiny and urges Congress to bring full \n     transparency to the earmarking process and to cut the cost \n     and number of earmarks by at least half.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n       The Administration would like to take this opportunity to \n     share additional views regarding the Committee's version of \n     the bill.\n\n\n                          securing our borders\n\n       The Administration has requested a total of $11.8 billion \n     in FY 2008 for border security and interior enforcement \n     measures, representing a nearly 50 percent increase since FY \n     2006. The Administration is pleased that the bill supports \n     the requested funding for strengthening border security by \n     adding 3,000 new Border Patrol agents, enhancing interior \n     enforcement efforts, and providing $1 billion for fencing \n     and other infrastructure improvements through the Secure \n     Border Initiative. The Senate is asked to support other \n     key elements of the Administration's effort to control our \n     border as well.\n       The Administration strongly objects to the $100 million \n     reduction to the US-VISIT budget. While the Administration \n     appreciates the Senate's support for the Unique Identity \n     program, US-VISIT cannot collect and analyze 10-print or move \n     towards completing IDENT/IAFIS interoperability without the \n     full request, as these funds are necessary to critical \n     support operations and key program management and support \n     functions, such as data center operations and fingerprint \n     examiners. This shortfall will deny DHS and the FBI the \n     ability to search each other's databases using a full 10 \n     fingerprints, to assist with terrorism and criminal \n     investigations.\n       The Administration opposes any provision delaying Western \n     Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) implementation at our \n     land and sea borders to June 2009. The Administration is \n     committed to working with Congress and the public to \n     implement WHTI in a manner that will cause as little \n     disruption as possible, while providing Americans with the \n     enhanced security that they expect. Recently, the U.S. \n     Departments of State and Homeland Security announced that \n     U.S. citizens traveling to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and \n     Bermuda, by air, who have applied for but not yet received \n     passports can nevertheless temporarily enter and depart the \n     United States with a government issued photo identification \n     and proof of application for a passport from the Department \n     of State through September 30, 2007. The federal government \n     is making this accommodation for air travel due to longer-\n     than-expected processing times for passport applications in \n     the face of record demand. In addition, earlier this summer, \n     DHS announced that it will accept an expanded list of secure \n     documents at land and sea ports of entry when WHTI becomes \n     effective on January 31, 2008.\n       The Administration is concerned by the decision to \n     significantly reduce funding for the Secure Flight program, \n     which addresses critical vulnerabilities in the Nation's \n     aviation security system. The program has been delayed for \n     many years, and lack of sufficient funding in FY 2008 would \n     further delay it beyond the current target deployment of \n     2010. TSA has provided all requested information on the \n     program and continues to work closely with Congress and the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO) to meet the ten \n     mandates specified in P.L. 108-334. Hence, the Administration \n     asks that Congress fund the Secure Flight program at the \n     requested level while providing TSA authority to transfer \n     sufficient funds, if needed, after Congressional \n     notification, to meet the ten requirements as soon as \n     possible.\n\n\n               federal emergency management agency (fema)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes the dramatic increase \n     of $1.8 billion for State and local homeland security grant \n     programs. By the end of FY 2007, DHS will have provided over \n     $23 billion in direct preparedness support to State and local \n     agencies of which approximately $8.5 billion will be unspent \n     and available for preparedness projects in FY 2008. Rather \n     than appropriating additional unjustified dollars, Congress \n     should work together with the Administration to ensure that \n     existing dollars are being appropriately spent and to develop \n     a better understanding of what reductions in risk and \n     increases in State and local capabilities will be achieved \n     with these unspent funds. The Administration strongly \n     believes that the FY 2008 request level of $2.2 billion is \n     appropriate and allows the Federal Government to meet \n     national priorities and stand together with State and \n     local first responders in preparing for terrorist attacks \n     and other major disasters. Further, the Administration is \n     opposed to the creation of a new regional preparedness \n     grant program, which would be duplicative of current \n     programs. While the Administration strongly supports \n     efforts to enhance preparedness on a regional scale, \n     existing grant programs currently offer strong incentives \n     for regional collaboration through State homeland security \n     strategies and programs.\n\n\n                       chemical facility security\n\n       The Administration opposes section 531, which would prevent \n     the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from establishing \n     and enforcing, for the first time, a single, national \n     performance-based standard for enhancing the security of \n     high-risk chemical facilities. Allowing State preemption of \n     Federal law could thwart DHS's efforts to establish a \n     national chemical facility security framework. Separately, \n     while the Administration would prefer that Congress not \n     restrict the Department's authorities in this manner, the \n     Administration notes that the approach taken by this bill \n     would cause less disruption to the chemical security program \n     than language contained in the House version of the bill, \n     H.R. 2638 which in addition to allowing State preemption, \n     would also lessen the protection of sensitive information \n     relating to the security of these facilities.\n\n\n                             secret service\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of \n     $3.1 million for presidentially designated Secret Service \n     protection for Executive Office of the President (EOP) \n     personnel, which leaves these costs unfunded for FY 2008. In \n     addition, beyond FY 2008, the uncertainty of who will be \n     protected and how much the Secret Service protection will \n     cost would create an unnecessary burden for the EOP.\n       The Administration also strongly objects to section 516(b) \n     that would limit the Secret Service's protective mission by \n     creating a burdensome reimbursable mechanism in lieu of the \n     appropriate flexibility needed to protect these officials. \n     The Secret Service is better equipped to manage these costs.\n\n\n                    principal federal official (pfo)\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security supports the Senate \n     bill's omission of language previously included in the House \n     bill, H.R. 2638, which would prohibit funding PFOs during \n     disasters or emergencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     serves as the principal Federal official for domestic \n     incident management. The PFO plays a valuable role as the \n     representative of the Secretary in the field by coordinating \n     Federal operations to respond to and recover from terrorist \n     attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The \n     Administration understands the need to clarify the chain of \n     command for incident management and is currently revising the \n     National Response Plan to address this need.\n\n\n                               Management\n\n       The Administration strongly supports funding provided in \n     the bill for the design and buildout of the St. Elizabeths \n     campus, which is the first critical step toward a \n     consolidated DHS headquarters.\n       The Administration is strongly opposed to any effort to \n     reduce, limit, or delay funding for DHS human resources \n     initiatives. The bill provides only $5 million of the $15 \n     million requested for a human capital system, whi?h would \n     severely impact support to basic human resource services and \n     development of practices designed to meet the Department's \n     diverse personnel requirements.\n       While the Administration understands the need for prompt \n     delivery of reports to Congress, the requirement to deliver \n     reports on complicated matters before receiving funding could \n     inhibit the Department's efforts to carry out its mission. \n     Congress already requires more than 1,000 appropriations-\n     related DHS reports and is urged to ease the administrative \n     burden upon DHS and reduce the additional reports required in \n     the bill.\n       The Administration objects to the provision that would \n     prohibit the use of funds for further data center development \n     until the National Center for Critical Information Processing \n     is fully used. The Department is consolidating its data \n     center operations into two primary facilities and this \n     provision would limit the Department's ability to improve and \n     streamline its data management capabilities.\n       The Administration appreciates the importance of GAO's \n     ability to conduct inquiries efficiently and effectively, and \n     DHS is taking action to speed its response to GAO requests. \n     However, the Administration objects to the requirement that \n     DHS revise departmental guidance regarding relations with GAO \n     in consultation with the Comptroller General. Congress's \n     directing the adoption of certain truncated deadlines and \n     procedural hurdles is inconsistent with the principle of \n     separation of powers, because it would interfere with the \n     time-tested process of accommodation between the Executive \n     and Legislative branches.\n       The Administration strongy objects to section 502, which \n     would suspend for FY 2008 the DHS Secretary's authority to \n     reorganize the Department to rapidly meet changing mission \n     needs.\n\n\n                     National Communications System\n\n       The Administration is concerned with the level of funding \n     provided for Next Generation Network priority \n     telecommunications services. Without the full request, the \n     Wireless Priority Service and Government Emergency \n     Telecommunications Service would lose coverage as \n     communications carriers migrate from circuit-switched \n     networks to packet-switched networks, preventing national \n     security decision makers from receiving prioritized bandwidth \n     for emergency communications.\n\n\n                    United States Coast Guard (USCG)\n\n       The Administration objects to section 529, which prohibits \n     alteration of the Civil Engineering Program of the Coast \n     Guard. This language would severely limit USCG's \n     administration of its engineering programs, including its \n     ability to make such programs more cost-effective, \n     and undermine the Commandant's authority under 14 U.S.C. \n     632. It would also significantly affect the Commandant's \n     efforts to realign the USCG's mission support \n     organization, of which civil engineering activities and \n     elements comprise only one part.\n\n\n       United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\n\n       The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not \n     include a provision necessary to clarify fee authority with \n     respect to the USCIS Systematic Alien Verification for \n     Entitlements (SAVE) program. The\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\n     SAVE program serves the needs of numerous Federal, State and \n     local agencies that need to verify immigration status for the \n     purpose of determining eligibility for a wide variety of \n     public benefit programs by providing them the necessary \n     information from DHS records.\n\n\n                          Competitive Sourcing\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes sections 515 and 528, \n     which impose restrictions on competitive sourcing for work \n     performed by the Immigration Information Officers at the U.S. \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center instructor staff. Depriving DHS \n     of the operational efficiencies gained by competition limits \n     its ability to direct Federal resources to other priorities. \n     Management decisions about public-private competition and \n     accountability for results should be vested with the \n     Department.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Concerns\n\n       Several provisions of the bill purport to require advance \n     approval by congressional committees prior to the obligation \n     of funds. These include sections 504, 505, 509, and 534; and \n     under the headings, ``Border Security Fencing, \n     Infrastructure, and Technology,'' and ``Air and Marine \n     Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance, and Procurement,'' \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection; ``Salaries and \n     Expenses,'' United States Secret Service; ``Management and \n     Administration,'' National Protection and Programs \n     Directorate; and ``Indicator Technology,'' United States \n     Visitor and Immigrant Status.\n       Section 513 of the bill, which purports to prohibit the \n     Executive Branch from screening certain airline passengers, \n     should be stricken as inconsistent with the President's \n     constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to take steps \n     necessary to protect the Nation from foreign attack.\n       Section 518 purports to prohibit the use of funds with \n     respect to the transmission of certain information to \n     Congress. This section could impede communications within the \n     Executive Branch and could undercut the President's \n     constitutional duty to ``take care that the Laws be \n     faithfully executed.'' The Administration urges the Senate to \n     delete the provision.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from South Carolina \nis recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2412 To Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I offer an amendment and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Gregg, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. McConnell, \n     Mr. Domenici, Mr. McCain, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n     Coleman, and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2412.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment builds a little bit on what \nSenator Byrd is talking about. How the threats to the Nation are real, \nhow to handle those threats, how much money we need, and where to put \nthe money are all honest and genuine debates. But I think we found some \ncommon ground here as a nation from the last immigration debate.\n  Senator Judd Gregg has been one of the leading advocates for stronger \nborder security since I have been in the Senate.\n  During the last immigration debate in terms of a comprehensive \napproach to solving immigration policy, one of the things we seemed to \nfind common ground on was the idea of providing additional border \nsecurity. So the amendment I have just offered, which will be \ncosponsored by Senators Gregg, Sessions, Kyl, Cornyn, McConnell, \nDomenici, McCain, Sununu, Martinez, Coleman, Specter, and many others, \nseeks to build on what we did in the last debate--to make it a reality \nin the area in which we have common ground.\n  The amendment has $3 billion in terms of spending, emergency funding. \nI would argue that the border security situation in this country and \nvisa overstays are emergencies and that we have lost operational \ncontrol of our border. We have lost the ability to track people who \ncome here on visas in terms of when their visas expire and whether they \nleft, and we will pay a heavy price, not only economically and socially \nbut from a national security perspective. Of the ``Fort Dix Six'' \npeople who were caught conspiring to attack Fort Dix, NJ, I think three \noverstayed their visas and three came across the border illegally \nearlier on in their life. So this amendment puts the Senate and the \nAmerican people's money where our mouth has been, and $3 billion will \ngo a long way.\n  The goal of this amendment is to provide complete operational control \nof the U.S.-Mexican border. It will increase the number of Border \nPatrol agents to 23,000. It will allow us to appropriate four new \nunmanned aerial vehicles, 105 ground-based radar camera towers, 300 \nmiles of vehicle barriers, 700 miles of border fencing, and a permanent \nend to the catch-and-release policy with 45,000 new detention beds.\n  This is a comprehensive border security amendment. It also authorizes \nthings we need to have authorized from the last debate where we were \nnot able to pass a comprehensive bill. It takes some of the stronger \nborder security measures and makes them part of this amendment. As I \nsaid, it will increase the number of border security agents to 23,000. \nIt adds 14,500 new Customs Border Patrol agents through fiscal year \n2012, increasing the overall number to 30,000. The Sanctuary City \nproblem Senator Coburn identified--he has modified his original \nproposal, and that is in this amendment.\n  This amendment authorizes a continued National Guard presence. It \nstrengthens our laws to deny immigration benefits to aggravated felons, \ngang members, sex offenders, and child abusers. It really goes into our \nlaw and cleans up what is pretty much a mess by making sure we have the \nability to detain and deport people who are dangerous, who have been \nconvicted of serious offenses.\n  It gives State and local law enforcement authorities the ability to \ndetain illegal aliens and transfer them to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It basically allows them to take money from Homeland Security \ngrants and apply it to the cost of detaining and turning over illegal \nimmigrants they may run into and apprehend.\n  As to visa overstayers, the 19 hijackers who came into America who \nperpetrated the acts of 9/11, I believe all of them--if not all of \nthem, most of them--were visa overstayers. Forty percent of the illegal \naliens in this country never come across the border; they overstay \ntheir visa. This will allow the Department of Homeland Security to come \nup with a tracking system to better identify visa overstayers, who have \nproven to be in the past some of the most dangerous people in terms of \nthreat to the homeland. It will allow the agency to coordinate with \nlocal law enforcement mandatory detention and deportation.\n  It also gets tough on those who keep coming back across the border. \nThere is this catch-and-release concept which needs to end. That is why \nwe have 45,000 new bedspaces to detain people, give them the hearings \nrequired by law, and under this amendment, if you are caught coming \nback into the country after you have been deported, it has mandatory \njail time.\n  One reason we have 12 million people here is that no one seems to \ntake our laws too seriously, including ourselves. So now it is time to \ntell the world at large and those who would violate our laws that there \nwill be a price to be paid, unlike the current system; that if you are \ncaught coming back into the country after you have been deported, there \nwill be mandatory jail time. This has been tried in some areas of the \nborder, and it has been enormously successful.\n  There are many parts in this bill regarding employment eligibility \nand verification. The pilot program to have biometric cards to \ndetermine employment will be expanded, and those who tell us about \npossible threats to our Nation's transportation system or homeland, we \nare going to protect them from civil lawsuits. If you are trying to \nidentify a problem and you call your government and say: I think there \nis a problem here, we are going to make sure you don't get sued for \ndoing your civic duty.\n\n  So it is a comprehensive approach. It is a $3 billion dollar \nappropriation, and within that appropriation, we have some change in \npolicy that will secure the homeland in a better fashion than the \ncurrent system does. If this is not an emergency, I don't know what \nwould be in terms of our national security interests.\n  The one thing the Congress--the Senate and the House--should agree on \nimmediately, in my opinion, is gaining operational control, regaining \noperational control of our border and controlling the visa program that \nallows millions of people over time to come to the United States.\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\n  I would just make one point here. Rahm Emanuel, one of the Democratic \nHouse leaders, was quoted recently as saying that his party will not \nattempt comprehensive immigration reform until at least the second term \nof a prospective Democratic President. That is a chilling statement. I \nthink that is a very dangerous thing to be saying at a time when our \nNation is under siege, and to suggest to the American people that the \nDemocratic leadership in the House is going to put this topic off until \nthe second term of a prospective Democratic President misses the point \nand really, literally, misses the boat. This is an emergency if there \never was one, and the idea of putting this off for 6 or 7 more years I \nthink would be a national security nightmare. It would be an economic \nand social mistake for the ages in terms of the role the Congress would \nplay.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the Senate not to go down the road that \nCongressman Emanuel has laid out for the Democratic-controlled House; \nthat is, putting this whole discussion off until the second term of a \nprospective Democratic President. I couldn't find a better issue to \nshow difference between myself and my colleagues in the House at the \nDemocratic leadership level than this issue. Not only should we do this \nnow on this bill at this moment, we should have done this years ago.\n  This is one of the issues facing the American people where there is \nbroad consensus by Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. People \nwant operational control of their borders. They want more money spent \nto secure their borders and to control who comes to the country, and \nfor those who violate our laws and commit crimes, a better process to \ndetain them and deport them. That is exactly what this amendment does.\n  I believe our thinking on this amendment is very much in line with \nthe American people. They see this very much as something we should \nhave done a long time ago. Let's not forgo this opportunity. We tried \njust a few weeks ago, and that failed; a chance of having comprehensive \nreform failed. I feel an obligation to join forces with people who were \ndisagreeing with me on a comprehensive approach to find common ground. \nI think the country is urging us to find that common ground. I believe \nthis is a great place to start.\n  The Border Security First Act of 2007 has been a product that has \nbeen bipartisan in nature. It is a collaborative effort between people \nwho have a common view of our border security needs, and it is good \nlegislation. It is needed money at the right time. It is policy changes \nthat will make us safer as a nation.\n  I would like to recognize Senator Judd Gregg's efforts over many \nyears to push the administration--and the Senate particularly--to deal \nbetter with the lack of control on our borders.\n  I look forward to talking about this amendment further. I appreciate \nall the cosponsors and the effort to do something constructive now. \nLet's, for heaven's sake, not wait 6 more years before we do something. \nLet's seize the moment, and the moment is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Maryland be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, before congratulating the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for bringing forward this extremely important amendment, \nlet me begin by congratulating the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from Mississippi, the senior members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nwho also are chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, for bringing forward a bill which makes major \nstrides toward addressing our needs as a nation to protect ourselves \nand to make sure our borders are secure.\n  This has been a very integral issue for both of these leaders for \nmany years. Senator Cochran, who chaired this committee before the \nDemocratic majority took over, and Senator Byrd, who was the ranking \nmember on this committee for years and has been intimately involved in \nthe effort to try to make sure we adequately address things like port \nsecurity--their leadership is extraordinary, and this bill is a \nreflection of that. I do not want this amendment to in any way imply \nthey have not made an extraordinary and a very effective effort to move \nforward with border security because within the context of the dollars \nthey had available to them, they have done excellent work.\n  What this amendment does, however--and I congratulate the Senator \nfrom South Carolina for bringing it forward--is acknowledge the fact \nthat we have an emergency here. It is as big and important an emergency \nrelative to national security as the war in Iraq is. I look at them \npretty much as the same type of national emergency. The issue of \ncontrolling our borders is an issue of national security, of making \nsure that we as a country are safe and we maintain our viability as a \nnation. A country that doesn't control its borders is not safe and will \nlose its viability as a nation. So nothing is more important to us from \nthe standpoint of protecting national security and making sure we get \noperational control over the borders, which the Senator pointed out \neffectively, as this amendment moves forward.\n  Some have said: Why would the former Budget Committee chairman, and \nnow ranking member, be willing to offer an emergency resolution which \nbrings this bill up by $3 billion? That is the reason. I have voted to \nmake sure our troops are fully funded in Iraq. I am voting for this \namendment because it will make sure we have the people we need on the \nborder to assure that our national security is maintained. In \nmaintaining security over the border, this amendment, once and for all, \nwill put into place the necessary funding--this isn't an authorizing \nevent, remember--to be sure we have the boots on the ground, the \ntechnology in place, and the detention capability in place in order to \nmanage the border.\n  It takes the present situation where we are ramping up the 20,000 \nborder agents and increases that number to 30,000 by 2012, and prefunds \nit, for all intents and purposes. In addition, it gives us 45,000 \ndetention beds, which is what we need to stop the catch-and-release \nprocess. So when the border agents apprehend someone whom they deem to \nbe in this country inappropriately, they have a place they can put that \nperson, where they can find them until they make a final \ndetermination--when the court system makes a final determination of \nwhether that person is illegally in this country and should be \nreturned.\n  The way the law works now, unfortunately, we don't have enough beds. \nWhat happens is the person gets detained and the court system says \nreturn in a couple weeks and we will dispose of whether you are here \nlegally. For the most part, they don't show up for court. This \namendment will end that practice of catch and release, and I \ncongratulate the Department for having worked hard to try to do this \nwith the resources they presently have.\n  In addition, this amendment will fully fund the commitment that we as \na Congress made at least 2 years ago now to put into place the \nnecessary hard fence and the virtual fence so that we know who is \ncrossing the border, or when someone is crossing illegally, and we can \nstop, as well as possible, those who attempt to enter illegally. We \nknow we need hard fencing in urban areas and we need virtual fencing \nalong the less populated areas. We put out a plan and hired a \ncontractor to put up the virtual fencing. This amendment guarantees \nthat that virtual fencing, which involves a lot of electronics and air \nobservation through Predators and the equipment necessary, such as \nhelicopters and vehicles, will enable the people on the ground to \napprehend these individuals who come in illegally where the crossing \noccurs, and it involves the necessary resources and capital investment \nto accomplish all of that, which is absolutely critical.\n  It has the capital resources in it necessary to get the job done of \nprotecting our borders, and the American people, if this amendment \npasses, will be able to look at the dollars that have been put into the \npipeline, which will accomplish what is the first thing the American \npeople want relative to immigration reform, which is secure borders.\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\n  I supported the last comprehensive immigration bill. I was one of the \nfew members on our side who voted for that bill. I believe we need to \ndo something in a comprehensive way. But I also recognize the reality \nof the situation, which is that the American people will not move \nforward or will not accept movement in the area of comprehensive \nimmigration reform until they are confident we have regained control \nover our borders. This amendment accomplishes that.\n  In addition, there are a number of authorizing events in here. I \nrecognize that authorizing appropriations is anathema to many of us. As \nwas pointed out eloquently by the Senator from South Carolina, we don't \nhave effective immigration reform. So the vehicle for accomplishing \nvery targeted law enforcement reform--and this is law enforcement \nreform--in the area of protecting our borders is going to have to fall \nto the Appropriations Committee. It has not been unusual for the \nAppropriations Committee to assume the role of taking on an authorizing \nevent when it is narrow and aimed at an issue of doing something that \ndelivers a better service, and in this instance it is protecting our \nborders. That is not an unusual event for the Appropriations Committee. \nIt is a lift, but it is something the Committee has done in the past \nand done rather well. I have chaired a couple of committees where that \nhas been done.\n  This is the time to do it. This is the time to put into place the \nauthorizing language necessary to do the demonstration programs on US-\nVISIT, which we absolutely need, to address the issue of how you deal \nwith criminal aliens who have committed a felony, a rape, or are child \nabusers--that language is in here--and to address the issue of how you \ndeal with sanctuary cities, and especially give State and local law \nenforcement individuals the authority to be an adjunct to the law \nenforcement effort being put forward by border control and Customs in \nthe area of making sure our borders are secure.\n  When someone comes through the northern border, for example--we don't \nhave a lot of security on the northern border in the sense that we have \nit on the southern border because it is mostly forest or terrain that \nis not open. People can cross that border fairly quickly and easily and \nalways have been able to. We don't have the same problem on the \nsouthern border. We have waves of people coming in there. Most of the \nfirst individuals coming in at the northern border will usually meet \npeople of a law enforcement nature, but not our Customs and Border \nPatrol agents. It is probably going to be somebody south of there, in \nEpping, NH, or in New Ipswich, who says I want to know if you are here \nlegally, and they have to have some authority to be able to raise that \nissue. They have to have probable cause. They have to have the \nauthority to step forward when they have probable cause. This bill \ngives that authority.\n  This is a good and appropriate piece of legislation for us to take up \nat this time. I recognize it puts the bill in further jeopardy because \nit is emergency funding and it adds $3 billion to the bill. But this is \na national security issue and it needs to be done. I also recognize the \nSenator from West Virginia pointed out that this bill has received a \nletter from the administration saying they may or may not--but implying \nthey would--veto it because it is over their allocation.\n\n  Like the Senator from West Virginia, that concerns me a great deal \nbecause I, again, must state that I don't see a whole lot of difference \nbetween fighting the war in Iraq and fighting the war on the border to \nprotect ourselves from people coming into this country who may do us \nharm. Those are two issues which merge in this entire question of how \nwe fight the war on terror. I can separate this bill from the other \nappropriations bills that may be over the administration's request--\nmaybe in agriculture, or in foreign operations, or in education and \nlabor, or maybe in transportation, which is the actual day-to-day \noperations of the Government. But when it comes to fighting the war on \nterror and protecting national security, I believe we have to do \neverything necessary to accomplish that, and that means, in this \ninstance, fully funding the necessary people to go on the border and \nthe capital resources necessary to support those people on the border.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2415 to Amendment No. 2412\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time, I send a second-degree \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2415 to amendment No. 2412.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       This division shall become effective one day after the date \n     of enactment.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This amendment simply changes the date, Mr. President. It \nis a technical amendment. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nMaryland in allowing me to proceed and, obviously, the Senators from \nWest Virginia and Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I yield to the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from West Virginia, who I understand would like \nsome time to respond to the amendment offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, the able Senator, for yielding.\n  I rise to discuss the Graham amendment. In total, in fiscal year \n2008, the bill includes $11,377,816,000 for border security programs \nwithin U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement. This is $1,288,302,000, or 12.7 percent, above \nfiscal year 2007, and $338,846,000 above the President's request. That \nis 3 percent over the President's request.\n  With these funds, by the end of fiscal year 2008, there will be a \ntotal of 17,819 Border Patrol agents, 31,500 detention beds, and more \nthan 12,700 immigration enforcement and detention personnel. \nAdditionally, the combined funding in fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008 \nfor border security fencing, infrastructure, and technology is more \nthan $2.5 billion.\n  Including the funding provided in this bill, since 2004, on a \nbipartisan basis under the leadership of Senators Byrd, Craig, and \nGregg, Congress will have increased the number of Border Patrol agents \nby 7,000, the number of immigration enforcement personnel by 2,546, and \nthe number of detention beds by 13,150.\n  The President has threatened to veto this bill because of what he \nconsiders to be ``excessive'' spending. However, it is not \n``excessive'' when we provide funds to secure our borders. I support \ncontinued bipartisan efforts to provide funding for real border \nsecurity. We do not yet have the amendment, but I look forward to \nreviewing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Byrd and Senator \nCochran and the members of the Appropriations Committee for the fine \nwork they have done on this 2008 Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill.\n  As has been pointed out, this will provide $2.2 billion more than the \nPresident's request for homeland security. I note that it received the \nunanimous support of all members of the committee, and for good reason: \nIt is an important investment in the security of our Nation. It \nprovides the needed resources so we can deal with the security concerns \nin our own country, whether they be at our airports, seaports, rail \nstations, or in our home communities. That is what we should be doing. \nIt should be our highest priority. I congratulate the committee for the \nmanner in which it considered this legislation and has brought it \nforward. I urge us to move it forward as rapidly as possible.\n\n  Two weeks ago, Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, said he had a gut feeling our Nation is at an \nincreased risk of a terrorist attack this summer. While I hope his \nwarnings would be based on more than a feeling, the National \nIntelligence Estimate released last week\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\nsupports Secretary Chertoff's instincts. Based upon the facts before \nit, the National Intelligence Council judged that ``the U.S. homeland \nwill face a persistent and evolving terrorist threat.'' Al-Qaida has \n``protected and regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack \ncapability'' and is now as strong as it was in 2001. The NIE states \nthat ``the United States currently is in a heightened threat \nenvironment.''\n  Based upon that, it is disheartening that while the intelligence \ncommunity is discovering evidence of an increased threat to this \ncountry, President Bush has recommended cutting funding to grant \nprograms that secure our ports, airports, and bolster local law \nenforcement and fire departments around Maryland and our Nation.\n  The increased funding in this bill for our port and aviation security \nand first responders will have a profound impact on my State of \nMaryland.\n  Let me start with the Port of Baltimore. It is one of our country's \nmost important ports and a significant economic engine for our entire \nregion, providing more than 33,000 jobs in Maryland and generating $1.5 \nbillion in revenue every year. It is the Nation's eighth largest port, \nhandling about 2,000 ships and 3l million tons of cargo each year.\n  With the size of the Port of Baltimore, proximity to Washington, \nworkload, and productivity come increased risks. That is why I was a \nstrong proponent of the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act \nof 2006, the SAFE Port Act of 2006. This bill authorized more funding \nfor programs that are critically important to the security of our \nports, including risk-based port and cargo security grant programs, the \ndevelopment of a long-range ship-tracking system, the development of a \nbiometric transportation security card for port workers, and \ndevelopment of a system to identify high-risk containers.\n  These were all programs that, after hearings in the Congress, we felt \nwere critically important to secure our seaports.\n  You can imagine my dismay and the distress of the public safety \nofficials and emergency planners in Maryland when President Bush, who \nsigned the SAFE Port Act, did not propose to fund many of the new \nactivities that legislation authorized. I am grateful to the \nAppropriations Committee for recognizing the risk to the Port of \nBaltimore and other ports around the country. It provided the funds so \nwe can move forward with those initiatives.\n  The bill will provide $15 million above President Bush's request to \nhire additional port security inspectors, conduct vulnerability \nassessments at 10 high-risk ports, and develop a long-range vessel-\ntracking system so we can monitor ships as they travel around the \nworld.\n  Most importantly, this bill provides $400 million in port security \ngrants, $190 million above the President's request as authorized--as \nauthorized--by the SAFE Port Act of 2006, which the President signed. \nThese grants will provide Maryland with critical support to improve \nperimeter fencing, underwater detection capability, and enhanced video \nsurveillance systems.\n  I am pleased the committee recognizes the importance of the Coast \nGuard's presence at Curtis Bay, MD, and notes it is a ``critical \ncomponent of the Coast Guard's core logistics capability'' and \n``directly supports fleet readiness.''\n  The committee further recognizes the vital role the yard has played \nin ``the Coast Guard's readiness and infrastructure for more than 100 \nyears'' and recommends ``that sufficient industrial work should be \nassigned to the Yard to maintain this capability.'' I agree, and I \nintend to do my best to make sure the committee's recommendations are, \nin fact, followed.\n  The bill provides $15 million above President Bush's request to \naddress a shortage of Coast Guard boats and qualified personnel to \nallow the Coast Guard to enforce security zones and protect critical \ninfrastructure.\n  The bill provides $60 million above the President's request for the \nestablishment of Coast Guard interagency maritime operational centers \nauthorized, again, by the SAFE Port Act of 2006, which will improve \ncollection and coordination of intelligence, increase information \nsharing, and unify efforts among Federal, State, and local agencies.\n  The bill gives equal attention to transportation security, providing \n$3.7 billion for transportation security improvements, $764 million \nmore than the President's request. This funding includes $400 million \nfor rail and mass transit security grants, $529 million for explosive \ndetection systems, and $41 million for surface transportation security. \nThe bill provides the needed funds for passenger and luggage screening.\n  These grants will provide much-needed funding to protect airports in \nMaryland and across the Nation. In the past, I have worked with the \nTransportation Security Administration, TSA, to bring the latest high-\ntech devices to Baltimore, including state-of-the-art equipment to scan \nbaggage and passengers for explosives. I am proud the BWI Thurgood \nMarshall Airport was the first airport in the Nation to have a fully \nfederalized screening workforce after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  Despite continued threats to aviation security, President Bush sought \nto cut funds to purchase and install explosive detection equipment at \nairports by 17 percent. Once again, I thank the committee for not \nfollowing the President's recommendation in that area.\n\n  This bill provides $66 million for TSA air cargo security, $10 \nmillion above the President's request. When combined with the $80 \nmillion included in the fiscal year 2007 emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill, these funds will put TSA on a path to screen all \ncargo placed on passenger aircraft, and that is what we should be \ndoing.\n\n       The bill provides nearly $530 million, almost $90 million \n     above the President's request, to purchase and install \n     explosive detection equipment at airports around the country. \n     We need to do that. We need to have the latest equipment for \n     explosives at our airports.\n\n  I am disappointed the committee was forced to shift $45 million from \ncontainer security to secure pathways, such as airfreight. We should \nnot be in a position where we have to make those kinds of choices.\n  We must do more to ensure the safety of the Nation's chemical \nfacilities. Enhanced security requires strong regulatory standards and \npolicies attuned to the risks faced by the communities surrounding such \nfacilities. In December 2006, the Bush administration proposed \nregulations to preempt State and local governments from adopting \nstronger chemical security protections than those proposed by the \nFederal Government. While the Federal Government must ensure chemical \nfacilities meet minimal safety standards, States must retain the \nability to set stricter standards to address the unique needs of their \nlocal communities. This bill ensures the essential ability of States to \npass and enforce tougher chemical site standards than existing Federal \nstandards, and it provides an additional $15 million to help States \nmeet those standards.\n  Again, I applaud the committee for providing that help. It is very \nimportant to the area I represent in Maryland, where we have so many \nchemical plants.\n  Despite tragically ample proof in the wake of Hurricane Katrina that \nState and local governments were unprepared for a major natural \ndisaster or terrorist attack, the President's budget proposes a $1.2 \nbillion cut in vital homeland security grant programs that provide \ncritical support to local law enforcement and firefighting departments.\n  I know we all talk about how important these agencies are, our local \nfirefighters, our local first responders. The President's budget cuts \nthose funds. I am pleased the Appropriations Committee did not follow \nthe recommendation of President Bush but instead increased funding by \n$1.8 billion over the President's request for our States and cities to \nimprove their ability to respond to attacks and natural disasters.\n  These allocations include $560 million for firefighter equipment \ngrants, $525 million for State homeland security grants, $275,000 more \nthan President Bush's request, and $375 million for law enforcement and \nterrorist prevention grants.\n  The committee also provided FEMA with $100 million to rebuild its \ncore competencies and improve management. I hope the Agency will make \nwise use of these additional funds.\n  Emergency preparedness officials in Maryland are especially happy to \nsee\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\nincreased allocations in FEMA's budget for predisaster mitigation. \nIncreased preparedness funding will lead to long-term savings by \ndecreasing subsequent damage claims. Most importantly, increased \npreparedness ensures we are ready to keep our people out of harm's way.\n  I am pleased the bill contains critical resources to develop and \nimplement improved detection and communications technology, improve \ncommunications, and improve and streamline intelligence-gathering \nagencies. Better technology and intelligence are a critical part of us \nbeing prepared against threats. We need to do better on intelligence \ngathering, and this bill provides help in doing that.\n  Congress can provide resources, but we cannot legislate appropriate \naction by DHS officials. All of us remember with outrage how DHS \nofficials placed the Washington, DC, and the New York City metropolitan \nareas in a low-risk category for terrorist attacks or catastrophe. That \ndecision was ridiculous. That decision, if it had been allowed to \nstand, would have cost those regions millions of dollars of \nantiterrorist funds and would have had a devastating impact on their \nability to respond to attacks. Last year, many of DHS's grants were not \nreleased until December 29, 2006, the day before the end of the fiscal \nyear. When the money Congress appropriates sits around in Washington \nfor more than 11 months, Americans certainly are not any safer. The \ndelay in releasing funds undermines the budget and plans of emergency \nresponse agencies in all our communities. The appropriations bill will \npenalize DHS for releasing grants late--a reduction of $1,000 per day \nwhen mandated timelines are not met. Local officials are hamstrung \nwaiting for guidance and grant moneys from DHS. Once again, I thank the \nAppropriations Committee for putting that provision in the bill.\n  This bill takes other unusual measures, such as requiring the \nDepartment to submit expenditure plans for key programs to the \ncommittee for review before funds will be released. We saw the \ndevastating results of incompetent management in the disastrous days \nbefore, during, and after Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005.\n  At the beginning of this month, the Washington Post reported the Bush \nadministration had failed to fill roughly one-quarter of the top \nleadership posts at DHS, ``creating a `gaping hole' in the nation's \npreparedness for a terrorist attack or other threat.'' These are \nserious problems the administration needs to address immediately.\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed S. 2, a bill implementing many \nof the remaining 9/11 recommendations. Ever since I served on the House \nSelect Committee on Homeland Security, I have strongly supported the 9/\n11 recommendations that we distribute homeland security money based on \nrisk and ``be mindful of threats'' increased security measures will \npose ``to vital personal and civil liberties.'' In other words, put our \nmoney where it is needed based on risk assessment, but be mindful of \ncivil liberties.\n  S. 2 increases the amount of grant money distributed based on risk, \nand it strengthens protections for all our most cherished liberties. I \nhope the Senate will get a chance to pass the conference report to this \nbill before the August recess. I look forward to sending it to \nPresident Bush for his signature. It nicely complements the \nappropriations bill we are poised to pass in the next day or two.\n  Nearly 6 years ago, on a sunny September morning, Americans received \na terrible wakeup call, telling us we can be attacked here and we need \nto do more to protect ourselves. Congress took that responsibility to \nheart, passing legislation empowering the President to protect our \nNation.\n  I am proud to offer my support for this critical bill. Given the \ncurrent state of our national security and the most recent NIE report, \nit is imperative we pass this bill immediately. There is no time for \ndelay.\n  Once again, I thank the leadership of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this bill forward. It deserves our support. I hope we will \nhave a chance to vote on it within the next day or two so this bill can \nbecome enacted in a timely way to meet the needs of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes and then immediately thereafter for my colleague \non this issue, Senator Nelson, to be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2400\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up the Vitter amendment No. 2400, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending matter?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this time, I object to setting aside \nthe amendment. Certainly, the Senator can speak on the amendment, but \nwe are working through the process on the first amendment and are \nunable to, at this point, set it aside. Certainly, he is welcome to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Louisiana \nis recognized to speak on his amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, that is disappointing because we have been \nin communication with all the floor leaders of this bill to actually \ncall up the amendment, but I will certainly proceed to speak on it. It \nis amendment No. 2400, which is at the desk, which would amend the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Act to allow the reasonable \nreimportation of prescription drugs from Canada only.\n  I am joined in this very important amendment by Senator Nelson of \nFlorida and Senator Stabenow of Michigan, and I thank my colleagues, \nand many other colleagues, who are supportive of this idea. This will \nbe a continuation of a very important, very productive policy we began \nlast year. Last year, I again joined with Senator Nelson of Florida, \nSenator Stabenow, and many others in coming forward with this specific \namendment on last year's Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  We had a full and healthy debate on the topic. After that full and \nhealthy debate, it passed the Senate floor 68 to 32. After it was \nretained in the conference committee and passed through the House and \nthe Senate in the final version of the appropriations bill, this \namendment and the policy was signed into law. Because of that, we \neffectively ended the practice by Customs and Border Patrol of seizing \nfrom Americans what are otherwise lawful, safe, prescription drugs that \nhappen to be purchased from Canada--drugs which are identical to those \nthat can be purchased in the United States.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to make clear to all my colleagues that \nthis amendment merely continues the important work we began last year, \nwhich received a very resoundingly positive vote of the full Senate--68 \nto 32. Why do we need to continue that? Well, everybody knows--\neverybody who buys prescription drugs, everyone who has an elderly \nparent, grandparent, or aunt whom they are helping in terms of those \nvery real needs and costs--we are burdened with sky-high prescription \ndrug costs in this country, while virtually the rest of the world pays \nfar greater reduced prices for exactly the same prescription drugs. \nThat is the system we are trying to break up and break through. That is \nwhat we are trying to end in order to allow Americans to have access to \nsafe and cheaper prescription drugs from Canada, and elsewhere.\n  It is very important that we take this step forward to continue the \npolicy we started last year, to continue it for this fiscal year, in \norder to allow Americans this opportunity. Again, I want to underscore \nseveral things, at the risk of repeating myself.\n  No. 1, this is a continuation of what we did last year by a vote of \n68 to 32. No. 2, this applies to individuals only, and individual \namounts of prescription drugs for individual use. We are not talking \nabout wholesalers, we are not talking about businesses getting into the \nbusiness of buying from Canada. And, No. 3, this does apply to Canada \nonly. We are not talking about any other country.\n  Now, let me say straight off that I support much broader and stronger \nreimportation legislation. I have supported that position consistently \nsince I came to the Senate and before that while I was in the House, \nand I am very hopeful that I will be successful, working with others on \nthis issue, in passing\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\nthat broader reimportation language this year. But in the meantime, \nthis is a very important step forward that we must preserve into the \nnext fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and invite Senator Nelson to share \nhis remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to discuss this \nbipartisan amendment, which we overwhelmingly passed last year as an \namendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It basically \ngets at one little thing that we can do to protect against the rising \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  At the end of the day, what we are going to have to be able to do, on \na big program such as Medicare and the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, we are going to have to give that negotiating power to the \nFederal Government, through Medicare, to negotiate, through bulk \npurchases, the price of the drugs in order to bring them down. Until we \ncan get that--and we tried earlier this year and we were not successful \nin getting 60 votes to cut off debate. So until we can get that, we \nhave to go at whatever avenue we can.\n  One way is to allow citizens to order, through Canadian pharmacies, \nthe very same drugs they get from American pharmacies. And it is not \nonly the same drug, it is manufactured in the same place--indeed, with \nthe same packaging. They can order from Canadian pharmacies where they \nget that drug, in many cases, at half the retail price they are paying \nin pharmacies in the United States. I am talking about not only going \nacross the border and bringing it back, but I am talking about also \nbeing able to order by mail, by telephone, and by the Internet without \nhaving U.S. Customs intercept and confiscate these packages.\n  We went through this whole discussion a year ago, and we pointed out \nthe history of this program. We pointed out how Customs had gotten into \nit and were confiscating these packages. Yet the Acting FDA--Food and \nDrug Administration--Commissioner said it wasn't a safety factor if the \ndrugs were coming from Canada. I want to underscore Canada. I didn't \nsay another country. I said Canada--if the drugs were for the personal \nuse of the person ordering the prescriptions, and if they were for a \nlimited supply. And they defined that limited supply as 90 days or \nless--3 months. And, of course, that is what a lot of our constituents \nhave been doing for years, and getting their prescriptions at less than \nhalf the cost.\n  So we passed that amendment last year overwhelmingly. What happened \nwas, the pharmaceutical lobby got hold of it when it got into the \nconference committee with the House and it got watered down so you \ncould do it as long as you traveled into Canada and brought the drugs \nback. Well, for somebody who lives in Detroit, maybe that helps them, \nor somebody who lives on the northern end of any of the northern States \nthat have a border with Canada, maybe that helps them, but it doesn't \nhelp our constituents who live elsewhere in the country, particularly \nin a State such as mine, Florida, where they are trying to make \nfinancial ends meet.\n  I recall for the Senate the fact that there are senior citizens in \nAmerica today who cannot afford the cost of their prescriptions and the \ncost of their food as well. They go in and they cut their prescription \ntablets in half, which, of course, does not solve their problem. So \nwhat we are trying to do is, in one little way here, to get at the cost \nof these drugs to be able to bring them down.\n\n  What we want to do is pass this amendment. If we can get it up for a \nvote, it will pass the Senate. What Senator is going to say to a senior \ncitizen: You cannot order prescription drugs from Canada at half the \nprice. Every Senator is going to vote for it, and then we will have to \nprotect it again when it gets down in the conference committee with the \nHouse to see that it doesn't get watered down. And we will have to \nprotect against the putting in of such limitations as they have in the \npast, saying: Oh, well, the White House will approve this amendment if \nthey make it subject to the Secretary of HHS determining that it is \nsafe.\n  Well, of course, they never make that determination, so, in effect, \nit doesn't ever happen. In point of fact, if you ask these officials \nprivately, they will admit that it is safe because it is the same drug, \nmade by the same manufacturer, even with the same packaging.\n  So Senator Vitter and I will be offering this amendment later, at a \ntime that we are allowed under the parliamentary procedure to offer it, \njust as we offered it last year, and I would then encourage the Senate \nto pass it overwhelmingly, just as we did last year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Congressional Delegation to Greenland\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I understand we are going to have a \ngroup of Senators visiting Greenland this weekend to see the effects of \nglobal warming on glaciers. I am sure they will visit areas where you \ncan see icebergs breaking off glaciers, presumably more frequently than \nnormal, due to global warming, although this phenomena has always \noccurred to some extent.\n  Perhaps these Senators will also visit with local residents, such as \nfarmers who have been able to graze their sheep longer during this \nwarmer weather that now seems to be there.\n  However, I wonder if, for a little historical perspective, the group \nwill be visiting the Viking ruins on the southern tip of Greenland. As \nsomeone interested in history, I think such a visit would be very \nfascinating. I have always believed that we can learn a lot from \nhistory, so I am sure some value could be found in such an excursion to \nthe Viking ruins at the southern tip of Greenland.\n  As many of my colleagues may be aware, archeologists have dug through \nthe permafrost to excavate the remains of Viking farms, part of two \nmajor settlements that at one time may have had up to 5,000 \ninhabitants, and those settlements, presumably, lasted for over 400 \nyears.\n  As we all know, Greenland was first settled by Erik the Red, who \nencouraged fellow Norsemen to join him in colonizing the empty land \nthat we call Greenland today. These men grew grain and grazed sheep and \ncows in pastures. They prospered, at least at first, building \nstructures like a great hall and a cathedral, as well as homes and \nbarns. The remains of about 400 stone structures still exist on \nGreenland.\n  For reasons I am not sure are fully understood, sometime around the \nend of the 15th century, the Viking settlement in Greenland \ndisappeared. No one knows precisely why the Vikings disappeared from \nGreenland, but it appears from the archeological evidence that life got \nsomewhat harder and the climate became cooler and the land more \ndifficult to farm, until Greenland could no longer sustain the Viking \nsettlements.\n  I had an opportunity to be reminded of this as I saw on the Discovery \nChannel this week where they were talking about a small ice age \novercoming the Northern Hemisphere during the late 1400s, 1500s, and \n1600s. Maybe that had something to do with the Viking settlements \ndisappearing from Greenland. But 500 years later, we are able to catch \na glimpse of what their life must have been like by digging through a \nfarm buried in that permafrost on Greenland. Only a little more time \nhas passed since the Viking settlements disappeared until today, than \nfrom the time they were established there in Greenland until they were \nabandoned.\n  Contemplating the passage of time over centuries humbles us by \nputting our own short lifespan in historical perspective. It makes us \nrealize that God is ultimately in control and the activities of human \nbeings today are one tiny part of that divine plan. I think, from time \nto time, we need to reflect that way, which is why I hope my colleagues \nvisiting Greenland this weekend have an opportunity to take time out of \ntheir schedule to visit the Viking ruins.\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on \nthe Graham-Gregg-McConnell amendment that has been offered this morning \nand to support it. It is the Border Security First Act. It includes \nactual funding which would be emergency funding. I think this is \njustified.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Gregg, is a former chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He is very astute and alert that we do not abuse \nemergency funding, and he believes this is a justified emergency--and I \ndo too. In other words, how much longer can we continue to have \nlawlessness at our borders? This bill would go a long way in fixing \nthat. Certainly, every aspect of the bill, I believe, is a positive \nstep in returning us to a lawful system of immigration in America.\n  One reason actually funding this project, these efforts, through this \nbill and through emergency spending is so important is because we have \na history of promising things and not doing them. Not this year but \nlast year the bill came forward in the Judiciary Committee to \ncomprehensively reform immigration. I realized we had a shortage of \nborder enforcement officers, Border Patrol, and I offered an amendment \nto do that as part of that authorization bill, that immigration reform \nbill. It was readily accepted.\n  I offered an amendment that added bed spaces, and it was readily \naccepted, because I knew we needed more if we were going to be \neffective.\n  I offered more funding to train State and local law enforcement. It \nwas accepted.\n  I offered amendments on fencing which were accepted as well--at least \nsome of them. More on the floor were accepted.\n  Then I had an insight that hit me. That insight was that when we pass \nan authorization, what occurs is we authorize certain legal changes. \nThose legal changes take place at once. For example, the guaranteed \npath to citizenship in that immigration bill--it passed, it became law, \nit was guaranteed, it would happen no matter what. But I realized it \nwas real easy for my colleagues to agree to things that involved \nenforcement that required money, real dollars, to carry out because I \nrealized they may have no intention of seeing that effort be funded. \nOr, if they did have an intention to see it funded, there are so many \nsteps, hurdles, and loopholes to go through before it is ever funded it \nmay never get funding because it would have to go through the \nappropriators and they would have to appropriate the money.\n  To authorize money for a fence is not to build a fence. That is the \npoint. You have to appropriate some money to build a fence. That was \nthe gimmick, I believed all along, and that led to a suggestion I made \nabout having a trigger. Senator Isakson went into that in some depth \nand offered the amendment to have a trigger. The trigger said: Before \nany of these other law changes about amnesty or legalization of those \nhere illegally could occur, some other things had to happen first. If \nyou didn't spend the money on the others, this would never happen. \nThere was a trigger. That was a good idea, it was. It dealt with the \nproblem we were dealing with.\n  There is cynicism that is out there because of what happened in 1986. \nLet's be honest about it, what happened in 1986 was amnesty occurred. \nThey didn't deny it was amnesty. They were giving people legal \nresidence and path to citizenship in 1986. But they promised to do the \nthings necessary to create a lawful system in the future and that it \nwould not happen again. Three million people in 1986 were provided \namnesty. But as we all know, the promises were never fulfilled. We did \nnot create a lawful system of immigration. We did not do the things \nnecessary to enforce our laws at the border. As a result of that, we \nnow have 12 million people illegally in our country. Right? That is \nwhat happened. There is no mystery about this. This is actually fact.\n  We had this bill that came up, the so-called comprehensive reform \nbill. I absolutely believe it did not get us there. That is why I \nopposed it. I made up my mind I was not going to participate in a \nlegislative process that would tell our people of America, and my \nconstituents, we were going to create a lawful system in the future, if \nwe were not going to do it. That is why a number of people suggested we \nshould have a border security first bill. That is what the House of \nRepresentatives said last year. They said they were not even going to \nconsider our bill because they believed we ought to prove to the \nAmerican people we could create a lawful system of immigration first.\n  In this amendment, Senator Gregg and Senator Graham and Senator Kyl \nand McConnell--many of those who had supported the comprehensive \nreform--are saying let's get some credibility with the American people. \nI thank them for that. I believe this is a step in the right direction.\n\n  Senator Graham and Senator Gregg--we discussed it recently with \nmembers of the press and they made the point: The American people want \nto see we are serious about what we promise first. That is why they \nsupport that.\n  For example, this legislation would fund 23,000 border agents. The \nbill that is on the floor today, the basic Homeland Security bill, \nwould fund a little less than 18,000 agents. We need more agents. We \nhave to get to that tipping point. We don't need a whole unlimited \nnumber of agents. In my opinion, somebody who has been involved in law \nenforcement most of my career, I believe we can get to a point where \nthe word is out worldwide that our borders are not wide open, and if \nyou come to the United States, you are likely going to be caught, \nunless you come legally. If we do, we could see a substantial reduction \nin the number of people attempting to come here illegally. But we have \nto get other agents out there to get to that point--so 23,000 would \nhelp a lot. It is more than this bill has in it.\n  Another thing you have to have is detention beds. In other words, if \nyou arrest someone for illegally entering our country, if you are in a \nposition where they are released on a promise to come back for some \nproceeding because you do not have a prison bed, a detention bed in \nwhich to put them, they do not show up. We have examples of the catch-\nand-release policy, where 95 percent of the people released on bail on \na promise to come back for their hearing didn't show up--surprise, \nsurprise. They were willing to come to the country illegally. Who \nthinks they are going to show up legally to be deported? How silly is \nthat? It was an indication to me and the American people that this \nGovernment was not serious about immigration. We were not serious. Any \ngovernment that allows such a silly, worthless, no-good policy as that \nis not serious about it.\n  So this bill would add detention beds. The underlying bill is at \n31,000. This would take us to 45,000. Hopefully, that will take us to \nthat tipping point, so then we can say to a person who has been \napprehended: We are not going to release you, we are going to hold you \nuntil you are deported. Sometimes it is difficult, if they are from \nforeign countries, distant countries, not our border countries, to get \nthem back to their countries. It takes some time to get a plane or a \nboat to ship them out.\n  Another thing that is a part of this--certainly, if we are serious \nabout immigration, one of the things we want to do is welcome \nlegitimate help from our State and local law enforcement agencies. \nThere are only a few thousand Federal immigration agents inside the \nUnited States--not at the border, I mean inside the United States. \nThere are 600,000-plus State and local law enforcement agents. They \nbasically have been blocked from being able to participate in any way.\n  There is, however, a program called a 287(g) provision that gives \ntraining to State and local officers so they don't mess up, and they \ntreat everybody exactly properly and help in an effective way to \npartner with Federal officers to enforce immigration laws.\n  If you don't want immigration laws enforced, you don't want the \n600,000 State and local law officers participating. See? If you don't \nwant the law enforced, you don't want these people to participate in \nany way because right now we only have several thousand\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\nFederal agents--not on the border, inside the whole United States of \nAmerica. The only people we can rely on would be voluntary State and \nlocal support.\n  What we learned in Alabama, my home State, we trained 60 State \ntroopers in this program. It took far too long, in my view. The State \nhad to pay their salaries. It cost the State of Alabama $120,000 to be \na partner with the Federal Government to enforce laws that they have \nauthority to enforce--but to enforce laws of the Federal Government on \nan issue, immigration, that should be primarily a Federal \nresponsibility.\n  This bill, the amendment that was offered, this border security first \namendment, would provide some grant programs to enable more States to \nparticipate in this program.\n  It also funds--actually puts the money out to fund the fence. We have \nhad a half dozen votes on the fence, and it has still not been built. \nThey are building some now, they say. They are doing some. But it is \nstill not on track to be completed, and it is not funded according to \nwhat we voted. We voted to build 700 miles of fencing. The underlying \nlegislation, this appropriations bill, only funds 370 miles. That is \nnot what we voted to do.\n  You see what I am saying? It is one thing to authorize and vote to do \nsomething. We all go back home and we are so proud: I voted to build a \nfence. But nobody ever comes around to provide the money to actually do \nit. So this bill would fund that.\n  On the question of our local facilities to apprehend people for \nserious crimes, people who are in the country illegally, who are \nsubject to being deported as soon as they are released from jail \noccurs--under current law, that is not working well at all.\n  This bill would allow local facilities, detention facilities, to \ndetain them for up to 14 days, to give the Federal Government the right \nto do that, to get them deported, as they should be, if they committed \nfelonies in the United States.\n  Last September, 80 Senators voted to build 700 miles of fencing along \nour border. Ninety-four Senators voted for the amendment I offered for \n$1.8 billion to be appropriated. It eventually got reduced in \nconference to $1.2 billion to build the fence we said we were going to \nbuild. This bill, the underlying bill, calls for an additional $1 \nbillion toward construction of the fencing. But that is not enough. The \nGregg-Graham-Kyl amendment would provide the money sufficient to do \nthat and get us on the right track.\n  I will mention briefly a couple of other things in the legislation \nthat I strongly favor. Senator Graham has advocated previously that we \nneed to have penalties for people who come back into the country \nillegally. I mean, how silly is it to have persons enter the country \nillegally, you apprehend them, you do not prosecute them, you do not \nput them in jail--you could, because it is a crime--and you deport \nthem, and here they are the next week, or even the next day coming back \ninto the country. You have got to, at some point, if you are serious \nabout law, have a penalty extracted.\n  So this bill would require penalties for people who reenter a second \ntime, at least, in our country illegally. Certainly that is a good \nstep, but it is not happening today. There is a deal going on among \ncertain judges, and it has gotten to be a real problem for our \nimmigration enforcement system. That is, local State judges, if they \nhave an individual who is about to be deported, often will cut the \nsentence and not make it the required sentence, and that would obviate \ntheir deportation from the country for being convicted of a felony. \nThis would keep judges from going back and manipulating the criminal \njustice system to try to prevent a result that should naturally occur \nin the future.\n  It has institutional removal program funding. This is important as a \npractical matter. It does not work to wait until a person has completed \ntheir jail time for a serious criminal offense, and then have the \nFederal Government start up a proposal to deport them. They run away; \nthey do not show up to be deported. It is so obvious that that is \nhappening. So we have a program, the institutional removal program, \nthat does allow the Federal Government to take those people before they \nare released from jail and do the paperwork and commence the hearing so \nat the time of their departure, they are released into State prison for \nthe serious offense they have committed, they would directly be \ndeported. That only makes sense. We are doing some of that now, and \nthis bill would provide extra money for that.\n  In every aspect of the legislation, it is a step in the right \ndirection. It does not get us there if the executive branch or if the \nGovernment does not want to enforce these laws. It does not get us \nthere if the House or conferees fail to put this money in the bill. \nThere are still a lot of loopholes. We should not pat ourselves on the \nback. But these are all critical steps toward creating a lawful \nimmigration system. If we can do that and regain some confidence among \nthe American people, we will be able to talk about many more of the \nissues in favor of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 2392, the Isakson-\nChambliss amendment, be called forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I regretfully inform the Senator at this \npoint we are not setting aside amendments until we have disposed of or \ndetermined how we are going to dispose of some of the other amendments \nthat are in front of us. I would be happy to let the Senator speak on \nthe amendment at this time. We are going to object until we have a way \nto proceed forward with the amendments that have been offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \nask unanimous consent--I am going to speak briefly--Senator Chambliss \nbe allowed to speak immediately after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2392\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks that \nI have been able to hear this morning by Senator Gregg, Senator \nSessions, Senator Graham, and others. I rise to bring forward--I cannot \nbring it forward because they will not let me call it up, but at least \ntalk about amendment 2392 offered by myself and Senator Chambliss \nfrom Georgia. To that end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record our joint letters--Senator Chambliss and my joint letters--\nof June 12 and July 12.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the reason I entered these two letters is \nthey reflect precisely what the amendment does. The amendment offered \nis a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It is the sense of the Senate that \nexpresses the following: This is a team sport. It takes the executive \nand the legislative branch to get our Nation secured, our homeland \nsecurity, and in this case, our borders secured. The letters I \nsubmitted by Senator Chambliss and myself are letters to the President \nof the United States--one submitted during the debate on immigration, \none submitted 2 weeks following the debate on immigration--asking the \nPresident of the United States to send an emergency supplemental to the \nfloor of the House and Senate to fund all of the border security \nmeasures we have passed, such as the fence bill, which we authorized \nlast year, and the five key provisions of the immigration bill that \nwere lost that deal with border security. That is Border Patrol agents; \nthe unmanned aerial vehicles and ground positioning radar; it is \ndetention facilities; and, most importantly, most importantly, it is \nthe biometrical secure ID which gives you the redundancy to see to it \nthat we finally stop the forged document business, close the border, \nremove the attractive nuisance to come to America, and motivate people \nto go back and come in the right way and the legal way.\n  Some may say, well, an emergency supplemental is not the way to go. I \nwould submit it is the only way to go. If anybody doesn't think this is \nan\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\nemergency, I don't know about your phone system, but mine broke down \nwith the volume of calls we had last month. The Senate broke down with \nthe volume of calls and the weight and the complexity of this issue. \nBut, most importantly of all, we broke down because the people of the \nUnited States do not have the confidence in this Congress or the \nPresident that they will secure the border.\n  There is no question that this country needs an immigration policy \nsystem that works for high skilled, moderately skilled and lower \nskilled. There is no question that we need to review our entire \nimmigration system. There is no question it needs fixing. But there is \nequally no question that is never going to take place until the \nAmerican people feel we have secured the homeland and, in particular, \nhave secured the border to the South with Mexico.\n  We know what it takes to do it. It is delineated in the bill that was \non the floor of the Senate a month ago. We know what it takes to do it. \nWe know how to do it. In fact, in the last year, we developed an entire \nnew system of building fences that has allowed us to accelerate barrier \nconstruction along the border. It is being done right now at San Luis, \nbetween San Luis and Yuma, AZ. I have been there and seen it. It speeds \nup the system, and it is foolproof. It gets the redundancy we need in \nour security system to make it work.\n  I am not asking the Senate to do anything I have not asked the \nPresident of the United States to do. I think every day we wait is a \nserious mistake. We know it will take a minimum of 24 months to do the \nbiometric ID, train the number of Border Patrol officers we need to \nadd, build the 30,000 detention cells, put the unmanned aerial vehicles \nin the sky, and get the ground positioning radar and ground sensor \nsystems in. We know it is going to take 24 months. But it is going to \ntake 24 months from when we finally have the political courage and will \nto fund the money. The only way to ensure that is for us to join hands \nwith the President, pass a singular bill without any other subject on \nit, that appropriates the emergency funds necessary to accomplish those \nthings.\n  It is not complicated, and I do not think it should be controversial. \nIt is my hope when the majority reads this amendment and decides on \nwhatever their posturing would be on this bill, that they understand \nthis is a clear, concise message that a unanimous Senate should send to \nthe President of the United States to see to it that we start that 24-\nmonth clock by funding the money and appropriating it and getting the \njob done. This issue is too critical; it is too important. It is job \none and we must do it now.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2007.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Although the Senate's effort to reform \n     our nation's immigration laws through the Secure Borders, \n     Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 is \n     stalled, illegal immigration remains our nation's number one \n     domestic issue. We therefore believe it is incumbent upon us \n     and our colleagues to tackle this issue and not leave this \n     problem for future generations to solve.\n       As we travel around Georgia and continue to hear from our \n     constituents, the message from a majority of Georgians is \n     that they have no trust that the United States Government \n     will enforce the laws contained in this new legislation and \n     secure the border first. This lack of trust is rooted in the \n     mistakes made in 1986 and the continued chaos surrounding our \n     immigration laws. Understandably, the lack of credibility the \n     federal government has on this issue gives merit to the \n     skepticism of many about future immigration reform.\n       We believe the way to build greater support for immigration \n     reform in the United States Senate and among the American \n     public is to regain the trust in the ability of the federal \n     government to responsibly administer immigration programs and \n     enforce immigration laws. There is bipartisan agreement that \n     we need to secure our borders first, and we believe this \n     approach will serve as a platform towards addressing the \n     other issues surrounding immigration reform.\n       To that end, we believe that you and your administration \n     could alleviate many of the fears of our constituents by \n     calling for an emergency supplemental bill to fully fund the \n     border and interior security initiatives contained in \n     legislation currently pending in the Senate, as well as any \n     outstanding existing authorizations. Such a move would show \n     your commitment to securing the border first and to stopping \n     the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into our nation. It \n     will also work towards restoring the credibility of the \n     federal government on this critical issue.\n       We urge you to carefully consider this request, and thank \n     you for the opportunity to express the views of the people of \n     Georgia on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Saxby Chambliss,\n       Senator.\n     Johnny Isakson,\n       Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2007.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On June 12, 2007, we wrote to you \n     regarding our commitment to securing our nation's borders and \n     suggesting a way forward on comprehensive immigration reform. \n     Now that the Senate has again rejected the comprehensive \n     approach embodied in the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity \n     and Immigration Reform Act of 2007, we want to underscore our \n     belief that illegal immigration remains our nation's top \n     domestic issue. Although the Senate has turned its attention \n     to other legislative priorities, the American public, who \n     daily encounters the effects of our current failed \n     immigration system, has not forgotten the duty we have, as \n     their federal representatives, to address the issue of \n     illegal immigration.\n       Many Americans from across the nation have become engaged \n     in this issue, and shared with us their wide ranging and \n     passionate opinions on how we can reform our immigration \n     system. While there is no consensus on the best approach to \n     comprehensive immigration reform, there is near unanimity in \n     the belief that we should secure our borders first. We \n     sincerely believe the greatest obstacle we face with the \n     American people on the issue of immigration reform is trust. \n     The government's past failures to uphold and enforce our \n     immigration laws have eroded respect for those laws and \n     eliminated the faith of the American people in the ability of \n     the government to responsibly administer immigration \n     programs.\n       We believe there is a clear way to regain the trust of the \n     American public in the competency of the federal government \n     to enforce our immigration laws and manage our immigration \n     system: We should prove our abilities with actions rather \n     than make promises. To that end, we believe that you and your \n     administration could alleviate many of the fears of our \n     constituents by calling for an emergency supplemental bill to \n     fully fund the border and interior security initiatives \n     contained in the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and \n     Immigration Reform Act of 2007, as well as any outstanding \n     existing authorizations. Such a move would show your \n     commitment to securing the border first, stopping the flow of \n     illegal immigrants and drugs into our nation, and creating a \n     tamper-proof biometric identification card for foreign \n     workers. It will also work towards restoring the credibility \n     of the federal government on this critical issue.\n       We urge you to carefully consider this request, and thank \n     you for the opportunity to express the views of the people of \n     Georgia on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Saxby Chambliss,\n       Senator.\n     Johnny Isakson,\n       Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2392\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first, I associate myself with the \nremarks of my good friend and my colleague from Georgia relative to \nthis particular amendment. He is dead on target. We have been there for \n2 years now encouraging this border security issue, that it be brought \nforward to the forefront on this issue of immigration. We are going to \ncontinue to pound at this until it is, in fact, realized by Congress \nand the administration and something is done.\n  I also associate myself with the remarks of my good friend from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, along with Senator Gregg and Senator Graham. \nThis problem relative to illegal immigration was debated here \nthoroughly in the halls of the Senate a year ago as well as last month. \nUnfortunately, we have not come to any conclusion as to any part of \nthis issue. The problem has not gone away. So I rise today to discuss \namendment No. 2392, which is an amendment Senator Isakson and I have \noffered regarding the need for emergency spending to secure the borders \nof the United States.\n  Since September 11, our local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nofficials\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\nhave taken great strides to make communities, air and water ports, \ncities, and national landmarks safer and more secure. I think it is a \ncredit to this administration, as well as to the Congress, that we have \nnot suffered another attack domestically since September 11. But we \nmust continue to be vigilant. One part of that is securing our borders. \nWe have improved our information-sharing capabilities between Federal \nand local first responders and law enforcement officials.\n  Within our intelligence community--the CIA, the FBI, NSA--we have \nalso increased our information-sharing capabilities -both vertically \nwithin each agency and horizontally with each other.\n  Since the inception of our global war on terrorism, we have made \nnumerous arrests, disrupted al-Qaida communication and planning \ncapabilities, prevented and foiled potential terror attacks, broken up \nsleeper cells, and captured members of al-Qaida's top leadership.\n  When it comes to our national security, terrorists only have to get \nit right once. We have to get it right every single time. None of us \ncan afford to take our safety and our freedom for granted. Much more \nstill needs to be done, But there is no doubt about it, we are winning \nthe war on terrorism.\n  On June 28, 2007, the Senate, by a vote of 46 to 53, rejected cloture \non a bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform. However, \nillegal immigration remains as a top domestic issue in the United \nStates. The American people continue to encounter the effects of our \nfailed immigration system on a daily basis. They have not forgotten the \nduty of Congress and the President to address this issue of illegal \nimmigration and the security of the international borders of the United \nStates. This amendment will help remind the President and Congress that \nthe problem of illegal immigration is still with us. There is no \nconsensus on the best overall approach to comprehensive immigration \nreform, but I believe, and many Americans do as well, that the first \nstep is funding the necessary tools to defend our country. The Federal \nGovernment has the responsibility to, and immediately should, secure \nthe borders of the United States.\n  Even with our best efforts, illegal entry into the United States \nremains a vast problem that is getting more and more out of control. \nThis is a security breach we must address. We must commit the \nsufficient money for our border security agencies, including Customs \nand Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as the \nNational Guard currently on our borders through Operation Jump Start.\n  Many Americans from across the Nation have become engaged in this \nissue and shared with me their wide-ranging and passionate opinions on \nhow we can secure our borders and resolve our illegal immigration \ncrisis.\n  I sincerely believe the greatest obstacle this body faces with the \nAmerican people on the issue of border security and immigration reform \nis trust. The Federal Government's lack of action to uphold and enforce \nour immigration laws and secure our borders has eroded respect for \nthose laws and eliminated the faith of the American people in the \nability of the Government to responsibly administer immigration \nprograms and protect our citizenry.\n  I believe there is a clear way to regain the trust of the American \npeople in the ability of the Federal Government to enforce our \nimmigration laws and secure our borders. We should prove our abilities \nwith actions rather than continuing to make promises.\n  To that end, Senator Isakson and I believe the President could \nalleviate many of the fears of our constituents and other great \ncitizens of America by calling for an emergency supplemental bill to \nfully fund the border and interior security initiatives contained in \nthe Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of \n2007, as well as any outstanding existing authorizations.\n  Such a move would show his commitment to securing the border first, \nstopping the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into this country, \nand creating a tamper proof biometric identification card for foreign \nworkers who are here legally. It will also work toward restoring the \ncredibility of the Federal Government on this very critical issue. \nFrankly, Congress has not done a very good job of addressing this issue \nfor about two decades. It is imperative that we find and implement a \nsolution quickly. This is a national security emergency which must be \naddressed immediately. I certainly do not have all of the answers, but \nI do know that, first and foremost, what we have to do is secure the \nborders. This is where the problem originates, and this is where it \nmust be halted. If we don't secure our borders, then nothing else we do \nrelative to immigration reform or national security will really matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in support of \nthe Graham amendment, of which I am pleased to be a cosponsor, and to \nprovide my colleagues some information I found particularly revealing \nin the form of a four-part series in my hometown newspaper, the San \nAntonio Express News, written in May of 2007. The author of the series, \na reporter by the name of Todd Bensman, chronicles the movement of an \nIraqi individual from Damascus, Syria, to Detroit, MI. It is \nparticularly instructive, as we are contemplating this amendment and \nthe importance of funding border security measures, that this kind of \ninformation be brought to the attention of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the first of the four-part article \nfrom MySA.com entitled ``Breaching America: War refugees or threats?'' \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. Bensman, in this article, found the following in his \ninvestigation, and I will summarize. More than 5,700 illegal immigrants \nfrom 43 countries with majority Muslim populations, including state \nsponsors of terror, have been caught while traveling over the Canadian \nand Mexican border along well-established underground smuggling routes \nsince 9/11, a traffic that continues today. Mr. Bensman estimates \nbetween 20,000 and 60,000 of these so-called special interest aliens, \nby virtue of their country of origin being countries where terrorism \nis, unfortunately, alive and well or because they are state sponsors of \ninternational terrorism, have gotten through without being caught since \n9/11. These migrants, although relatively small in total numbers, are \nhigh risk because they hail from countries where American troops are \nactively battling Islamic insurgents, nations where radical Islamic \norganizations have bombed U.S. interests or murdered Americans. \nUnguarded U.S. borders are most certainly in the terrorists' playbooks \nas a means of entering the country. Since the late 1990s, at least a \ndozen confirmed terrorists have sneaked over U.S. borders, including \noperatives from Hezbollah, Hamas, Tamil Tigers, and one al-Qaida \nterrorist once No. 27 on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.\n  On the U.S. side of the border, the FBI is supposed to interrogate \nand conduct a threat assessment and interrogations on every captured \nspecial interest alien, but the process is severely flawed and open to \nerror. Often, the FBI signs off on captured special interest aliens, \nallowing them access to the political asylum process without \nconclusively knowing whether they are or are not associated with \nterrorist organizations. Furthermore, Border Patrol agents are simply \nusing expedited removal processes to kick special interest aliens back \nover the border into Mexico, where they will certainly try to cross \nagain, with no investigation and no FBI referral whatsoever.\n  This series of articles published in the San Antonio Express News \nwill be an eye-opener for the people of this country.\n  Frankly, those of us who are Members of the Senate have the privilege \nof having classified briefings from time to time. Of course, we cannot \ntalk about that intelligence information on which we are briefed behind \nclosed doors. But here in the public domain are the results of Mr. \nBensman's investigation in chilling detail, chronicling the movement of \nan individual from Damascus, Syria, to Detroit, MI, via Moscow, Havana, \ninto Guatemala, and then up through Mexico's southern border and into \nthe United States.\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n\n  I have met with Border Patrol agents. Perhaps the current occupant of \nthe chair and others have had the same experience I have. I asked them, \nout of the 1.1 or the 1.3 million people we actually detain coming \nacross our southern border, for every person we detain, how many people \ndo you think get across? I have heard estimates ranging from detaining \nmaybe one out of every three to one out of every four. The truth is, \nnobody knows for sure who gets away. We do know that people who are \ndetained and returned across the border likely try again. So it is hard \nto get good information.\n  This is not a matter of solely economic migrants coming from Mexico \nor Central or South America into the United States. The truth is, \nCentral America and Mexico are a land bridge into the United States for \nanybody anywhere around the world who wants to come here, anybody who \nhas the money to pay the human smugglers to get them here. Obviously, \nthese could be individuals who want to work and who want nothing but a \nbetter life--what we all have and want in America--but it can also be \nvery dangerous people who want to do us harm. That is the reason this \nfunding, this emergency funding for border security, is so important.\n  It is also important that we begin to regain the lost public \nconfidence that the Federal Government can actually deliver on its \npromises. We have been telling people for a long time how important it \nis in a post-9/11 world to know who is coming into our country and why \npeople are coming here. Recognizing that if there is a way to separate \nthe economic migrants and to create an immigration system that would \ngive people an opportunity through legal immigration to come to the \nUnited States on a controlled basis, it will then allow law enforcement \nagencies an effort to target those who are common criminals, drug \ndealers or, indeed, terrorists or special interest aliens from state \nsponsors of terrorism.\n\n  We were reminded again about the dangers from our porous borders \nwhen, on Monday, officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nannounced that they had arrested more than 100 gang members in Texas. \nThese 121 suspects represent 27 different gangs, including the \nnotorious Mexican Mafia and MS-13. Of course, MS-13 is the ultraviolent \nCentral American gang that has come into the United States through our \nbroken borders. More than half of these gang members had criminal \ncharges against them, and nearly half of them were arrested on \nadministrative and immigration-related charges. So we see time and time \nagain, as most recently as the daily newspaper, what the threat is. Yet \nCongress continues to do not nearly enough to fix it.\n  This amendment gives us an opportunity to fix the problem at the \nborder. It is not just at the border. We need to deal with our broken \nimmigration system because roughly 45 percent of the people who are \nillegally present in the country today in violation of our immigration \nlaws came in on a legal visa but simply overstayed and melted into the \nvast American landscape. So we have to, as this amendment does, make \nsure we find ways to police visa overstayers. We need to make sure we \ncontinue to work on document fraud and identity theft that makes it \nhard for even good faith employers to determine the legal eligibility \nof prospective employees to work in America. This amendment is the \nfirst big step toward regaining the public's confidence again and \ndemonstrating that we are actually serious about delivering on our \npromises, not engaged in overpromising but underdelivering, as we have \nin the past.\n  I will be offering at a later time some amendments myself. Coming \nfrom a border State with 1,600 miles of common border with Mexico, this \nis a personal issue to many of my constituents, particularly. While \nsome, such as the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, believe strongly \nin the need for more fencing along the border, it is controversial \nalong the border in south Texas. I have worked with those local \nofficials and property owners. We have two amendments I will be talking \nmore about later. The consultations we have conducted have been useful \nin coming up with creative ways to accomplish the nonnegotiable goal of \nborder security.\n  I noticed most of the property abutting the Rio Grande River is \nprivate property. I am not sure the Border Patrol or the Department of \nHomeland Security has really thought through the fencing idea and what \nit would mean to condemn through eminent domain proceedings private \nproperty along the border in Texas. I am informed that in Arizona and \nother places, much of the property along the border is already owned by \nthe Federal Government, so we don't have that issue. But I have found \nin Texas, this is a controversial issue.\n  I have been pleased to work with my colleague, Senator Hutchison, to \nmake sure that in this amendment and in every opportunity, we have \ninsisted upon consultation with local elected officials and property \nowners to achieve the most effective means of border security, \nrecognizing that result is nonnegotiable but how we get there should be \nthe subject of consultation and negotiation.\n  Getting back to the private property issue, one of my amendments will \nask the Department of Homeland Security to produce a report talking \nabout the impact on border security due to the fact that much of the \nproperty, for example, in Texas is private property and asking them to \ncome back and tell Congress so we can make more intelligent decisions \nabout how to effectively use the taxpayers' money to accomplish that \nnonnegotiable goal of border security, given the fact that a lot of \nthat property is private property and would require, if fencing was \ngoing to be built on it, that some sort of eminent domain proceeding \nwould go forward. Obviously, the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Senator from Mississippi, and the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee would want to know whether the Federal \ntaxpayer is going to be asked to pay just compensation for eminent \ndomain proceedings if, in fact, those were contemplated.\n  There is a lot of beneficial discussion going on as we talk about \nthis with local officials and others. For example, on my many visits to \nthe U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, I have heard local law enforcement \nofficials and the Border Patrol talk about the problems caused by an \ninvasive plant commonly called Carrizo cane. Carrizo cane, as it turns \nout, grows so big and so fast that not even the night-vision technology \nused by Border Patrol agents can penetrate the Carrizo cane. It serves \nas a safe haven for human smugglers and common criminals along the \nborder. If the Federal Government could work with local officials and \nlocal property owners to eradicate Carrizo cane, this robust perennial \ngrass that can grow to a height of 20 to 30 feet, multistemmed clumps \nthat resemble bamboo and forms large colonies, it would enhance the \nnatural barrier the Rio Grande River already provides in many places \nalong the border. Thus, it would also assist the local Border Patrol \nagents by providing a clear line of sight and ready access to areas \nthat are currently not available to them because of the dense growth of \nthis Carrizo cane.\n\n  I am pleased to say the Border Patrol has taken the suggestion and is \ntalking to local officials and property owners. This shows some real \npromise. But it demonstrates what happens when you have local officials \nand people who live in the community talking to Federal officials \ntrying to come up with a solution to a common problem.\n  Now, when the Federal Government--folks operating in the Beltway--\ndecide they have a better idea, and they do not care what local and \nState officials think about it, well, usually that creates a lot of \nconflict and it also creates a less perfect solution and maybe not a \nsolution at all.\n  So I will be offering that Carrizo cane amendment as well as another \namendment which would require a report by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity on the impact of border security measures on private property \nowners along the Rio Grande River a little later on.\n  But I close by saying the threat posed by common criminals--as a \nresult of our broken borders--to drug dealers is very real. As Mr. \nBensman's article points out, the access through our broken borders to \nvirtually anybody in the world who has enough money to pay the \nsmugglers to get them in is an open door to people whom we prefer not \ncome here; namely, people who come from countries\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\nthat are state sponsors of international terror and, perhaps, people \nwith the goals of harming innocent Americans, taking advantage of the \nsame broken borders that yield access to economic migrants.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the San Antonio Express-News]\n\n              Breaching America: War Refugees or Threats?\n\n                           (By Todd Bensman)\n\n       Damascus, Syria.--Al Nawateer restaurant is a place where \n     dreams are bartered and secrets are kept.\n       Dining areas partitioned by thickets of crawling vines and \n     knee-high concrete fountains offer privacy from informants \n     and agents of the Mukhabarat secret police.\n       The Mukhabarat try to monitor the hundreds of thousands of \n     Iraq war refugees in this ancient city, where clandestine \n     human smuggling rings have sprung up to help refugees move \n     on--often to the United States.\n       But the refugees who frequent Al Nawateer, gathering around \n     Table 75 or sitting alone in a corner, are undaunted, willing \n     to risk everything to meet a smuggler. They come to be \n     solicited by someone who, for the right price, will help them \n     obtain visas from the sometimes bribery-greased consulates of \n     nations adversarial or indifferent to American security \n     concerns.\n       The deals cut at places like Al Nawateer could affect you. \n     Americans from San Antonio to Detroit might find themselves \n     living among immigrants from Islamic countries who have come \n     to America with darker pursuits than escaping war or starting \n     a new life.\n       U.S.-bound illicit travel from Islamic countries, which \n     started long before 9-11 and includes some reputed \n     terrorists, has gained momentum and worried counterterrorism \n     officials as smugglers exploit 2 million Iraq war refugees. \n     The irony is that the war America started to make itself \n     safer has forced more people regarded as security threats \n     toward its borders.\n       A stark reminder of U.S. vulnerability at home came this \n     month when six foreign-born Muslims, three of whom had \n     entered the country illegally, were arrested and accused of \n     plotting to attack the Army's Fort Dix in New Jersey.\n       What might have happened there is sure to stoke the debate \n     in Congress, which this week will take up border security and \n     immigration reform. But the Iraqi refugee problem provides a \n     twist on the question of what assurances America owes itself \n     in uncertain times: What do we owe Iraqis thrown into chaos \n     by the war?\n       Politically, immigration can be a faceless issue. But \n     beyond the rhetoric, the lives of real people hang in the \n     balance. A relatively small but politically significant \n     number are from Islamic countries, raising the specter, some \n     officials say, of terrorists at the gate.\n       For those few, the long journey to America starts at places \n     like Al Nawateer.\n       The restaurant's reputation as a meeting place is what drew \n     Aamr Bahnan Boles.\n       Night after night, Boles, a lanky 24-year-old, sat alone \n     eating grilled chicken and tabouli in shadows cast by Al \n     Nawateer's profusion of hanging lanterns: Boles always came \n     packing the $5,000 stake his father had given him when he \n     fled Iraq.\n       Boles was ordering his meal after another backbreaking day \n     working a steam iron at one of the area's many basement-level \n     garment shops when he noticed a Syrian man loitering near his \n     table. The Syrian appeared to be listening intently. He was \n     of average build and wearing a collared shirt. Boles guessed, \n     he was about 35 years old.\n       When the waiter walked away, the Syrian approached Boles, \n     leaned over the cheap plastic table and spoke softly. He \n     introduced himself as Abu Nabil, a common street nickname \n     revealing nothing.\n       ``I noticed your accent,'' the Syrian said politely. ``Are \n     you from Iraq?''\n       Boles nodded.\n       ``I could help you if you want to leave,'' the Syrian said. \n     ``Just tell me when and where. I can get you wherever you \n     want to go.''\n       For an instant, Boles hesitated. Was the Syrian a \n     Mukhabarat agent plotting to take his money and send him back \n     to Iraq? Was he a con artist who would deliver nothing in \n     return for a man's money?\n       ``I want to go to the USA,'' Boles blurted.\n       ``It can be done,'' said the Syrian. But it wouldn't be \n     cheap, he warned. The cost might be as high as $10,000.\n       Hedging against a con, Boles said he didn't have that kind \n     of money.\n       The Syrian told him there was a bargain-basement way of \n     getting to America. For $750, he could get Boles a visitor's \n     visa from the government of Guatemala in neighboring Jordan.\n       ``After that you're on your own,'' the Syrian said. ``But \n     it's easy. You fly to Moscow, then Cuba and from there to \n     Guatemala.''\n       The implication was obvious. The Syrian would help Boles \n     get within striking distance of the U.S. border. The rest was \n     up to him.\n       Boles knew it wouldn't be easy or quick: Not until a year \n     later in-fact, in the-darkness just before dawn on April 29, \n     2006, would he finally swim across the Rio Grande on an inner \n     tube and clamber up the Texas riverbank 40 miles west of \n     Brownsville.\n       But Boles was undaunted. He cut a deal with the Syrian, \n     setting in motion a journey into the vortex of a little-known \n     American strategy in the war on terror: stopping people like \n     him from stealing over the border.\n\n\n                          River of immigrants\n\n       Near the tiny Texas community of Los Indios, the Rio Grande \n     is deep, placid and seemingly of little consequence.\n       But its northern bank is rigged with motion sensors that \n     U.S. Border Patrol agents monitor closely, swarming whenever \n     the sensors are tripped:\n       Here and all along the river, an abstract concept becomes \n     real. America's border with Mexico isn't simply a political \n     issue or security concern. It is a living body of water, \n     surprisingly narrow, with one nation abutting its greenish-\n     brown waters from the north and another from the south.\n       Since 9-11, the U.S. government has made guarding the \n     1,952-mile Mexican border a top priority. One million \n     undocumented immigrants are caught each year trying to cross \n     the southern and northern U.S. borders.\n       Because all but a tiny fraction of those arrested crossing \n     the southern border are Mexican or Central American, issues \n     of border security get framed accordingly and cast in the \n     image of America's neighbors to the south. Right or wrong, in \n     this country the public face of illegal immigration has \n     Latino features.\n       But there are others coming across the Rio Grande, and many \n     are in Boles' image.\n       People from 43 so-called ``countries of interest'' in the \n     Middle East, South Asia and North Africa are sneaking into \n     the United States, many by way of Texas, forming a human \n     pipeline that exists largely outside the public consciousness \n     but that has worried counterterrorism authorities since 9-11.\n       These immigrants are known as ``special-interest aliens.'' \n     When caught, they can be subjected to FBI interrogation, \n     detention holds that can last for months and, in rare \n     instances, federal prison terms.\n       The perceived danger is that they can evade being screened \n     through terror-watch lists.\n       The 43 countries of interest are singled out because \n     terrorist groups operate there. Special-interest immigrants \n     are coming all the time, from countries where U.S. military \n     personnel are battling radical Islamist movements, such as \n     Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and the Philippines. They come \n     from countries where organized Islamic extremists have bombed \n     U.S. interests, such as Kenya, Tanzania and Lebanon. They \n     come from U.S.-designated state sponsors of terror, such as \n     Iran, Syria and Sudan.\n       And they come from Saudi Arabia, the nation that spawned \n     most of the 9-11 hijackers.\n       Iraq war refugees, trapped in neighboring countries with no \n     way out, are finding their way into the pipeline.\n       Zigzagging wildly across the globe on their own or more \n     often with well-paid smugglers, their disparate routes \n     determined by the availability of bogus travel documents and \n     relative laxity of customs-enforcement practices, special-\n     interest immigrants often converge in Latin America.\n       And, there, a northward flow begins.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to, if I may, turn to one \nother issue; and that has to do with the nomination of Judge Leslie \nSouthwick.\n  I heard the distinguished Democratic whip, majority whip, speak to \nthe Southwick nomination earlier, and I wish to make sure, in fairness, \nthere is a complete consideration of the facts.\n  Of course, Judge Southwick, the nominee to which the majority whip \nobjects, has been given the highest marks by his peers for the \nqualities of fairness and compassion by both the Mississippi Bar \nAssociation and the American Bar Association on two occasions, both \nwhen he was nominated to serve as a Federal district judge and now with \nhis nomination to the Fifth Circuit.\n  Regarding Senator Durbin's concerns, of course, as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, he voted to confirm Judge Southwick to a lifetime \nFederal bench. So I wonder why, now that he has been nominated to the \nFifth Circuit, those concerns have arisen when, in fact, there were no \nsuch concerns expressed when Judge Southwick was nominated and \nconfirmed unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Federal \ndistrict bench.\n  I heard Senator Durbin criticize Judge Southwick for his \nparticipation in the case of Richmond v. Mississippi Department of \nHuman Services. The fact of it is, Judge Southwick did not write the \nopinion Senator Durbin is critical of. Of course, as a judge, unlike a \nlegislator, a judge has no choice but to vote. He voted for the result, \nfor the outcome of the case, but I think it is unfair to attribute the \nwriting of the opinion to Judge Southwick, something he did not write.\n  Of course, we all deplore the racial slur which was the subject of \nthat opinion. The board determined, from the evidence before it, that \nthe racial slur was an isolated comment, was made outside of the \ntarget's presence, was\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nfollowed by an apology--which I think is significant--which was \naccepted and did not result in significant disruption of the workplace.\n  Under Mississippi law, the board's ruling could only be reversed if \nit was ``arbitrary and capricious, accepting in principle the notion \nthat a decision unsupported by any evidence is by definition arbitrary \nand capricious.''\n  The court of appeals majority, including Judge Southwick, operating \nunder a highly deferential standard of review--which is applied in the \ncase of agency decisions routinely--upheld the board's decision and \nfound that there was some evidence to support the board's ruling that \nthe isolated comment did not sufficiently disturb the workplace so as \nto justify the employee's termination.\n  The majority made clear it did not endorse or excuse the slur. They \nsaid:\n\n       We do not suggest that a public employee's use of racial \n     slurs . . . is a matter beyond the authority of the employing \n     agency to discipline.\n\n  In other words, they said it would be appropriate to discipline a \nperson for using racial slurs.\n  Of course, Judge Southwick reiterated his disdain for the use of any \nracial slurs and has repeatedly told the committee that the use of the \nword at issue is--in his words--``always offensive''--I would hope we \nwould all agree with that--and ``inherently and highly derogatory.'' At \nthe hearing he said: ``There is no worse word.'' He said it was \n``unique'' and that he could not imagine anything more offensive.\n  In response to a written question from Senator Durbin, Judge \nSouthwick wrote:\n\n       Use of this word is wrong, improper, and should offend \n     everyone regardless of the speaker's intent.\n\n  I agree.\n  As a legal matter, the Supreme Court of Mississippi explicitly agreed \nwith the appellate court's conclusion that dismissal was unwarranted. \nThat was the appeal from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court of \nMississippi. The supreme court said:\n\n       In this case, we find that the harsh penalty of dismissal \n     of Bonnie Richmond from her employment is not warranted under \n     the circumstances.\n\n  We can agree or disagree with the decision made by the board that \nreviewed that. We can agree or disagree with the decision of the court \nof appeals. But I do not know why, after the American Bar Association--\nthe professional organization that reviews Federal nominees--after they \nhave reviewed Judge Southwick's record, including his participation in \nthat decision, and found him to be highly qualified, why we would come \nback and try to besmirch his reputation as a part of trying to defeat \nthis nomination.\n  I am sure there will be more discussion about Judge Southwick as we \ngo forward. I hope we are not heading down a very dangerous path again, \nwhich is to deny this President's nominees--or any President's \nnominees--an opportunity for an up-or-down vote. Right now, I know the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, has been talking to the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the chairman has offered a \nvote for Judge Southwick's nomination in the committee.\n  But right now Judge Southwick is continuing to have consultation with \nmembers of the committee, in hopes he can get an up-or-down vote in the \ncommittee and then hopefully come to the floor where we can have a \ndebate which will cover the whole range of Judge Southwick's \nqualifications and his resume and his record so the Members of the \nSenate can fairly ascertain for themselves whether he should be \nconfirmed and then have an up-or-down vote.\n  But right now I hate to see Judge Southwick unfairly criticized by \nattributing to him something he did not even say, by joining an opinion \nwhich was ultimately upheld by the Mississippi Supreme Court in \ncompliance with appropriate legal standards. That is what judges do. \nThey do not decide winners and losers and then try to justify the \nresult. They apply the law impartially to everyone who comes before \nthem. From all appearances, Judge Southwick has been true to that \nrequirement and that great tradition of our judiciary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My apologies, Mr. President. I will be brief. My staff \nreminded me there was one other amendment I was going to mention that I \nfailed to mention. It will be an amendment I will also offer later on \nthat builds upon the good work of Mr. Bingaman, the Senator from New \nMexico, that was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier this week.\n  My amendment will actually double the amount Congress can provide for \nthe Border Relief Grant Program that will help local law enforcement in \ntowns and cities along our borders cover some of the costs they incur \nserving as the backup to Federal officials when it comes to combating \nillegal immigration and fighting drug traffickers and other border-\nrelated crimes.\n  The Senate unanimously approved this same amendment during debate on \nthe immigration bill we considered earlier this year. It is also \nincluded in the comprehensive border security package Senator Graham \nhas offered and is currently pending, and, of course, of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  It is the obligation of the Federal Government to adequately secure \nthe Nation's borders and prevent the flow of undocumented persons and \nillegal drugs into the United States.\n  For far too long, local law enforcement officers--I am talking about \nsheriffs, I am talking about police chiefs, and others--as well as \nlocal taxpayers, have borne the burden of law enforcement, given the \nfailure of the Federal Government to adequately fund the Border Patrol \nand to demonstrate its willingness to secure the border. So now it is \ntime not only to add to the Federal law enforcement officials--by \nincreasing the number of Border Patrol--but it is time for the Federal \nGovernment to own up to its responsibilities and fund local law \nenforcement through this grant program to the extent they are willing \nand able to support the Federal Government's efforts to secure the \nborder.\n  This Border Relief Grant Program will give the men and women in law \nenforcement, who are on the frontline of securing America's border, the \nnecessary support to do their jobs and ensure that local taxpayers do \nnot have to foot the bill. These funds can be used to obtain equipment, \nhire additional personnel, and upgrade law enforcement technology.\n  It is my hope my colleagues will support this amendment again, as \nthey have before.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that I \nmay be permitted to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to reply to a \nfloor statement made earlier today by the senior Senator from Illinois \nconcerning the pending nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick for the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The Senator from Illinois asserted that ``there are too many \nquestions about whether Judge Southwick would bring a measure of \nfairness in cases involving civil rights and the rights of ordinary \npeople in his court.'' But in the course of the speech of the Senator \nfrom Illinois, he only raised one question. That one question was about \na specific case.\n  The Senator from Illinois went on to say:\n\n       This perception as to whether he will be fair or evenhanded \n     is determinative in my mind. Whether you agree with that \n     perception, it is there.\n\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\n\n  I begin by disagreeing categorically with the Senator from Illinois \nthat it is a matter of perception. It is a matter of fact. When he says \nthis perception as to whether he will be fair or evenhanded is \ndeterminative, I disagree strongly. What is determinative is what are \nthe facts of his record taken in totality.\n  The one question which the Senator from Illinois has raised involves \na case where the Mississippi intermediate appellate court upheld a \nfinding by an administrative board that an employee should not be fired \nunder the circumstances which I will now describe.\n  The employee had made a racial statement which was a one-time \ncomment. The slur was not in the presence of the targeted coworker. The \nemployee apologized to the coworker. The coworker accepted the apology. \nThe incident did not produce any significant workplace disruption.\n  The administrative board then made the determination that the \nincident did not warrant dismissal of the employee. The question then \npresented to the court on which Judge Southwick sat, the intermediate \nappellate court, was whether the finding by the administrative board \nwas arbitrary and capricious; that is, whether there was sufficient \nevidence for them to find to that effect.\n  When Judge Southwick testified before the Judiciary Committee, he was \nemphatic in his statement that the slur was unacceptable, that he did \nnot agree with that kind of conduct, and that it was the worst kind of \nword to use--the so-called ``N'' word--but that his role as an \nappellate judge was to make a legal determination on whether there was \nsufficient evidence to uphold the decision or whether the \nadministrative board was arbitrary and capricious.\n  The Senator from Illinois then said that the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt unanimously reversed the majority opinion. But, the fact is--and \nthis is implicitly acknowledged by the Senator from Illinois--that the \nonly reversal was on the very narrow ground of whether there had been \nsufficient findings by the administrative board to come to its \nconclusion.\n  The Mississippi Supreme Court agreed with the Mississippi \nintermediate appellate court that dismissal was an inappropriate \nremedy. That was really the core of the case. But the State supreme \ncourt said there ought to be more facts stated by the administrative \nboard in coming to that conclusion, which was a highly technical \nmodification as to what the appellate court had said.\n  The Senator from Illinois further made a very brief reference, a one-\nsentence reference, in his speech, to a custody case in which ``he \nvoted to take an 8-year-old girl away from her lesbian mother. I \ndisagree with Judge Southwick's position in these cases.'' That is the \nonly thing he had to say about the custody case which has been cited \nagainst Judge Southwick.\n  Here again, as in the case involving the racial slur, Judge Southwick \ndid not write the opinion. He concurred in the opinion. I think fairly \nstated as a legal matter, when someone writes the opinion, there is \nfull responsibility for everything in it. In a sense, one might say the \nsame thing about someone who concurs. That person could write a \nseparate concurring opinion. But unless there is something \nextraordinarily wrong, out of line, that is not a common practice.\n  In the second case to which the Senator from Illinois referred--only \none sentence--there were many factors which led to the award of custody \nto the father, such as he had a steady job, he had a higher income, he \nowned a large residence, and he had roots in the community. Although \nthe Senator from Illinois did not refer to one sentence in the \nopinion--again, which Judge Southwick did not write but concurred in--\nthere was a reference to a ``homosexual lifestyle'' which has been used \nfrequently, including the Lawrence v. Texas decision. It is perhaps not \nthe most sensitive kind of language, and perhaps there could have been \na substitution for it, but it certainly does not rise to the level of a \ndisqualifier.\n  The Senator from Illinois has said that Judge Southwick could not be \nfair to run-of-the-mill litigants in the courts and cited a couple of \nstudies, which are not identified, which do not specify any authors, \nand on their face, in the statement by the Senator from Illinois, I \nthink fairly stated should be entitled to really very little, if any, \nweight. But let's take a look at some of the specific cases that Judge \nSouthwick has decided.\n  In a case captioned McCarty Farms Inc. v. Caprice Banks, Judge \nSouthwick affirmed an award of permanent partial disability benefits \nfor a woman who experienced a 70-percent industrial disability to her \nright arm and a 30-percent loss to her left. However, Judge Southwick \nwrote separately to argue that injured workers deserve more evidentiary \noptions to prove damages. He would have instructed the court to \nconsider wage-earning capacity as well as functional or medical \nimpairment.\n\n  In the case captioned Sherwin Williams v. Brown, Judge Southwick held \na 45-year-old carpet layer was permanently and totally industrially \ndisabled due to an onsite injury and that the carpet layer made \nreasonable efforts to obtain other employment. Judge Southwick \nconcluded he was entitled to permanent total disability benefits.\n  In a case captioned United Methodist Senior Services v. Ice, Judge \nSouthwick affirmed the award of workmen's compensation benefits to a \nwoman who hurt her back while working as a certified nursing assistant, \ndespite her first employer's claim that she exacerbated the injury \nduring her subsequent employment. In addition, Judge Southwick \nrecognized that the evidentiary standard the employer sought to impose \nwould have prevented many plaintiffs from receiving compensation for a \nwork injury.\n  In Kitchens v. Jerry Vowell Logging, Judge Southwick reversed the \nWorkers Compensation Commission's decision that a truck driver from a \nlogging company did not suffer a permanent loss of wage-earning \ncapacity, and remanded the case for further consideration.\n  In Total Transportation v. Shores, a 6-to-4 decision, Judge Southwick \njoined the other three dissenters, who would have upheld an award of \nworkmen's compensation benefits for a truck driver's widow where the \nmajority ruled in favor of the employer.\n  In Burleson v. Hancock County Sheriff's Department, a 6-to-3 \ndecision, again Judge Southwick joined in dissent, arguing that a \npublic employee was unconstitutionally fired, while the majority ruled \nin favor of the employer.\n  Similarly, Judge Southwick has ruled numerous times in favor of tort \nvictims and against businesses. In Ducksworth v. Wal-Mart Stores, Judge \nSouthwick voted to reverse a trial court's verdict against a customer \nwho had slipped on an unknown substance at Wal-Mart.\n  In Breland v. Gulfside Casino Partnership, Judge Southwick voted to \nreverse summary judgment for a casino in a slip-and-fall action brought \nby a patron who had suffered multiple injuries falling down a casino \nstaircase.\n  In Martin v. B. P. Exploration & Oil, Judge Southwick voted to \nreverse summary judgment against the plaintiff, who injured her ankle \nupon exiting a gas station's restroom on an allegedly poorly \nconstructed access ramp.\n  In Wilkins v. Bloodsaw, Judge Southwick voted to reverse a grant of \nsummary judgment in favor of a Pizza Hut which was sued by a mother who \nwas injured when her disabled son fell as she tried to help him exit \nthe restaurant.\n  Similarly, Judge Southwick has voted in favor of criminal defendants \non numerous occasions, often in dissent. For example, in Jones v. \nState, a 5-to-5 decision, Judge Southwick dissented, arguing for \nreversing a conviction because the indictment did not provide the \ndefendant with sufficient clarity to know with certainty what crime was \nbeing charged.\n  In Parker v. State, Judge Southwick dissented, arguing that a murder \nconviction should be reversed because the trial judge failed to give a \nproper jury instruction.\n  In Mills v. State, a 6-to-3 decision, Judge Southwick dissented from \nthe majority, affirming a drug conviction on the grounds that the court \nshould not have admitted a statement by the defendant's 4-year-old son, \nand the State failed to disclose a piece of evidence against the \ndefendant that it had in its possession.\n  In Harris v. State, a 5-to-4 decision, Judge Southwick dissented from \nthe majority opinion, affirming a drunk\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\ndriving conviction on the grounds that the trial court erroneously \nallowed the State to avoid proving all the elements charged in the \nindictment.\n  In Hughey v. State of Mississippi, Judge Southwick affirmed the trial \ncourt's decision to disallow cross-examination as to the victim's \nsexual preference, recognizing that whether the victim was homosexual \nwas not relevant to the defense, and that such a line of inquiry could \nproduce undue prejudice.\n  This Hughey v. State of Mississippi case, where Judge Southwick \nexcluded a victim's sexual preference, is a strong indication--much \nstronger than the one line in the argument by the Senator from \nIllinois--concerning the issue of a ``homosexual lifestyle.''\n  There are also testimonials, and I will offer two. La'Verne Edney, a \ndistinguished African-American woman partner in a prominent Jackson, \nMississippi, law firm, a member of the Magnolia Bar Association, the \nMississippi Women Lawyers' Association, and a member of the Mississippi \nTask Force for Gender Fairness, has shared her compelling story of \nJudge Southwick, who gave her an opportunity when few would. This is \nwhat she said, and I quote:\n\n       When I finished law school . . . I believed that my chances \n     for landing a clerkship were slim because there was only one \n     African-American Court of Appeals judge on the bench at the \n     time and there were very few Caucasian judges during the \n     history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or the Court of \n     Appeals . . . who had ever hired African-American law clerks. \n     . . . While Judge Southwick had many applicants to choose \n     from, he saw that I was qualified for the position and \n     granted me the opportunity.\n\n  Ms. Edney further observed:\n\n       It did not matter the parties' affiliation, color or \n     stature--what mattered was what the law said and Judge \n     Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly. Judge \n     Southwick valued my opinions and included me in all of the \n     discussions of issues presented for discussion. Having worked \n     closely with Judge Southwick, I have no doubt he is fair, \n     impartial, and has all of the other qualities necessary to \n     be an excellent addition to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n  Now, contrast what Ms. Edney said, a prominent lawyer engaged in all \nof the advocacy groups--gender fairness, women trial lawyers, Magnolia \nBar--compare that to the opinion of Judge Southwick in one case, where \nhe joined in a concurring opinion, where there was a racial slur \nimmediately apologized for, with what this woman, who was his law \nclerk, found in a very detailed relationship showing fairness and \njustice.\n  Patrick E. Beasley, a practicing attorney in Jackson, Mississippi, \nwho also happens to be African-American, endorsed Judge Southwick for, \namong other qualities, his fairness to minorities. This is what Mr. \nBeasley had to say:\n\n       I speak from personal experience that Leslie Southwick is a \n     good man who has been kind to me for no ulterior reason. I am \n     not from an affluent family and have no political ties. While \n     I graduated in the top third of my law school class, there \n     were many individuals in my class with higher grade point \n     averages and with family ``pedigrees'' to match. Yet, despite \n     all of the typical requirements for the clerkship that I \n     lacked, Judge Southwick gave me an opportunity. Despite all \n     the press to the contrary, Judge Southwick is a fair man and \n     this is one of the qualities that makes him an excellent \n     choice for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No. But I will be glad to respond to the Senator from \nAlabama when I finish my speech. I will be glad to respond to him at \nlength.\n  The overall record--I have changed my mind. I will yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Maybe the Senator from Illinois will change his mind, \ntoo.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for the first time, on the question of \nJudge Southwick's ruling, the Senator's remarks make clear to me that \nhe was required as a judge, as I understand it, to not reverse the \nadministrative panel's opinion unless it was arbitrary and capricious, \nI believe is what the Senator said.\n  It seems to me that sometimes we make a mistake, and I was going to \nask the Senator a question, as one of the most able lawyers here in \nthis body for sure, about whether he thinks sometimes we ascribe to the \njudge who has to rule on a case following the law, that somehow we \nwould suggest he may have approved this racial slur even though he may \nhave ruled in a way different from that?\n  In other words, does the Senator think we ought to be careful in this \nbody not to unfairly suggest that the judge approved this racial slur, \nwhich I know he did not, as a result of that ruling?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the question posed by the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama is illustrative of the unfairness of citing that \ncase against Judge Southwick, because he did not sanction the slur \nwhich was uttered.\n  In fact, the administrative review board did not sanction the slur. \nThe administrative review board had only the question to decide as to \nwhether that was grounds for permanent dismissal. That is the only \nquestion they had to decide. And then when the case came before the \nMississippi intermediate appellate Court, as the Senator from Alabama \nhas noted, that court had only to decide whether the ruling by the \nadministrative review board was arbitrary and capricious, which means \nthat there was insufficient evidence to sustain it.\n  So Judge Southwick is removed by two major barriers from any \nconceivable approval of a racial slur: first, on the fact that the \nadministrative board said it was bad, Judge Southwick said it was bad; \nand, in addition, there was sufficient evidence for the administrative \nboard to find what it did.\n  Now, on the critical question as to whether there were any grounds \nfor permanent dismissal because of what was said, everybody said no--\nthat is, the administrative board, the intermediate appellate court, \nand the State Supreme Court--contrary to the bland assertion by the \nSenator from Illinois that the intermediate appellate court was \nreversed. The Supreme Court said everybody is correct, there are not \ngrounds for permanent dismissal, but we think the administrative board \nshould have given more details as to the reasons why it came to that \nconclusion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his effort and \nthe time it takes to be able to examine the complexities of this \nsituation. Most of us are too busy to do it. You do indeed have a \npassion for the truth, and you have done well in getting there, and I \nthank you for sharing those thoughts with us.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I thank the Senator from Alabama for complimenting \nme for my passion for truth. It so happens that is the title of the \nbook I wrote--Harper Collins, available online.\n  Back to the case, though, Mr. President, and I will be brief here. I \nwould point to Judge Southwick's overall record. It is an excellent \nrecord: cum laude from Rice, J.D. from the University of Texas Law \nSchool, clerk for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, an \nadjunct professor in the Mississippi College of Law, unanimously well \nqualified by the American Bar Association.\n  And then an extraordinary thing. When he was in his fifties, he \nvolunteered to go to Iraq in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, and \nwas in areas with very heavy fighting. He interrupted a 12-year service \non the Mississippi appellate court to do that. That is an extraordinary \nact, really extraordinary, for somebody in his position to do.\n  I sat down with Judge Southwick at some length to talk to him, and he \nis an enormously impressive man. He is very mild mannered. He has been \non the court, as I say, for 12 years. He has participated in 6,000 \ncases, he has written 985 opinions, and all they can extract out of \nthis record is one case which, as the colloquy with the Senator from \nAlabama points out, doesn't establish a peppercorn. That is a legal \nexpression for being practically weightless in terms of what their \nobjections are.\n  The Senator from Illinois then went through the history of the last \ntwo nominees who were shot down. I have a reputation and a record to \nback it up, to have supported President Clinton's nominees, crossing \nparty lines, when they were qualified.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois makes it a point--not that it has anything \nto do with this case--that the Republicans didn't give 70 of President \nClinton's nominees a hearing.\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\n  That was wrong. That was wrong. But what we are doing here is we are \nvisiting on Judge Southwick somebody else's sins. If I thought he was \nnot qualified, I wouldn't be taking the lead that I am in this case.\n  When we go through these issues, it is reminiscent of the very \ncontentious controversy which was raised on this floor in 2005 when the \nDemocrats were filibustering judges in retaliation for what had \nhappened during the Clinton years and the Republicans were threatening \nthe so-called constitutional or nuclear option. We ought not go back to \nthose days.\n  When you have a man with the record of Judge Leslie Southwick, he is \nbeing picked on. With the extensive record he has, to cite one case and \nto talk about perception--I repeat, when the Senator from Illinois says \nthat perception is determinative, I say that this body ought to vote on \nthe facts.\n  I am pleased to see that a number of Democrats are interviewing Judge \nSouthwick, and I believe they will find him to be very impressive, as I \ndid. I strongly urge my colleagues to look at the facts very carefully. \nThe Senate should not function on perception. The Senate should not \nfunction on what somebody else concludes or believes. We ought not do \nthat. We ought to look at the record and make the decision in fairness \nto this man and in fairness to the entire process of confirmation of \nFederal judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask the manager of the bill if it would be \nappropriate for me to speak now on the amendment I propose to offer. \nSeeing no objection, I will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak on the \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2405\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will not ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside because I understand from the bill's \nmanagers that at this point there would be an objection to that.\n  That disappoints me. I have an amendment I would like to offer. It is \nan amendment we discussed in the full Appropriations Committee when it \nwas considered, and I hope I have the opportunity to offer the \namendment at another time.\n  The amendment was filed earlier today. It is No. 2405. The amendment \nhas as cosponsor Senator Collins.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time that Senator Voinovich and \nSenator Warner be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 2405.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this amendment, the Alexander-Collins-\nVoinovich-Warner amendment, has to do with the law we call REAL ID.\n  I will describe REAL ID in a moment, but fundamentally what the \namendment proposes is to offer $300 million in funding to the States to \nimplement REAL ID. The offset would be a 0.8-percent across-the-board \ncut in the rest of the bill. The total bill is $37 billion, more or \nless. I know that offset is not one the chairman and ranking member of \nthe committee are likely to approve of, but during our committee \ndiscussions I offered other offsets which weren't approved of, and I \nfeel strongly that if the Congress requires the States to adopt REAL ID \nor something similar to REAL ID, then the Congress ought to pay for \nit--hence the $300 million amendment.\n  Someone once said about me last year--and I haven't been here very \nlong, this is my fifth year as a Senator, but I have been around a \nwhile--they said the problem with Lamar is he hasn't gotten over being \nGovernor, which I was privileged to be in my home State of Tennessee \nfor several years.\n  I hope when I get over being Governor, the people of Tennessee send \nme home because I think one of the contributions I can make is to \nremind the Congress and remind the country that our country's strengths \nbegin with strong communities and strong counties and strong cities and \nstrong States and that the central government, according to our \ntraditions and our Constitution, is for the rest of the things that \nStates, communities, cities and counties can't do. According to the \n10th amendment and its spirit, if we require it of the State and local \ngovernments from here, we should fund it from here.\n  Nothing used to make me more angry as a Governor than for some \nSenator or Congressman to pass a bill with a big-sounding idea in \nWashington, DC, hold a press conference, take credit for it, and then \nsend the bill to me to pay. Then that same Senator or Congressman more \nthan likely would be back in Tennessee within the next few weeks making \na big speech at the Lincoln Day or Jackson Day dinner about local \ncontrol.\n\n  This is such an important issue that the 1994 elections turned on it, \nto a great extent. I remember dozens of Republican Congressmen and \ncandidates standing with Newt Gingrich on the Capitol steps, saying:\n\n       No more unfunded Federal mandates. If we break our promise, \n     send us home.\n\n  That may be one of the reasons the Republican Congress got sent home \nlast year, because we hadn't paid enough attention to that promise. I \ncan remember Senator Dole, when he was the majority leader in the \nSenate in 1995. He was campaigning for President, campaigning around \nthe country and I was often at the same events. He would hold up his \ncopy of the Constitution and talk about the 10th amendment. That is the \nspirit I wish to talk about today.\n  The REAL ID Act began in a good way. The 9/11 Commission recommended, \nin some fairly vague language, that we needed to improve our \nidentification documents in the United States. The Commission found \nthat:\n\n       [a]ll but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of \n     U.S. identification document, some by fraud. Acquisition of \n     these documents would have assisted them in boarding \n     commercial flights, renting cars, and other necessary \n     activities.\n\n  So said the 9/11 Commission. The Commission added that the Federal \nGovernment should:\n\n       . . . set standards for the issuance of . . . sources of \n     identification, such as drivers' licenses. Fraud in \n     identification documents is no longer just a problem of \n     theft.\n\n  The Congress began to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission soon thereafter, and in December of 2004 the Senate passed \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 which \ncalled for States to create secure driver's licenses and ID cards under \nsection 7212 of the bill.\n  It established a negotiated rulemaking process that included State \ngovernment officials, which was a direct effort to deal with the \nproblem I discussed. Through that, standards would be promulgated that \nwould make it more difficult to create and obtain fraudulent driver's \nlicenses.\n  The purpose of the negotiated rulemaking process was so that as \nCongress said that our national needs called for more secure documents, \nthe State and local governments could say let us talk with you about \nthe realities at home, about what we use driver's licenses for, about \nhow many there are, about what the cost would be of implementing new \nstandards, and about how long it might take. In addition, we might have \nsome other ideas about a different kind of secure document that might \nbe better than a driver's license for this purpose. And there are some \nprivacy standards we are worried about.\n  In addition to that, the experience with national identification \ncards around the world hasn't been all that promising. In Nazi Germany \nit wasn't a good story. Those who remember the more recent history of \nSouth Africa, when every citizen had a card to carry around which would \ndecree what their race is and whether they were of mixed blood, that \nsort of ``Big Brother'' attitude is of great concern in the land of \nliberty, the United States of America. So the negotiated rulemaking \nprocess was to take into account all of that.\n  Then came along the REAL ID Act of 2005 in the midst of all this \ncareful consideration. It was attached to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill of 2005. In other words, it was stuck in, by the \nHouse of Representatives, on the troop funding bill and it was signed \ninto law by the President in May. We had no choice but to pass it. We \nhad our men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq. We had to pay the bills \nfor their service. This was just stuck in there. We had to vote it up \nor down and REAL ID became law. The Senate didn't hold any hearings. It \nwas swept through Congress.\n\n[[Page S9887]]\n\n  The REAL ID Act superseded that negotiated rulemaking process \nincluded in the Intelligence Reform bill, in which the States and the \nFederal Government were working back and forth to set minimum standards \nfor State driver's licenses in an effort to deter terrorists. REAL ID \nestablished a de facto national ID card by setting Federal standards \nfor State driver's licenses and making the States create and issue \nthem.\n  One might say the States don't have to do it. They don't have to do \nit unless they want their citizens to be unable to fly on airplanes or \nobtain other necessary Federal services. It is a Hobson's choice. So, \nin effect, the REAL ID law, with no hearings, no consideration of \nwhether there might be some other kind of card or set of different \ncards that would be more appropriate, became law. The States had to \ncomply with that and that meant 245 million U.S. driver's licenses or \nID holders would have to get new identification.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has not yet issued final \nregulations of this massive act, even though the States are supposed to \nbe ready to comply with these new standards and measures by May 11 of \nnext year, 2008. Final regulations are expected to be released in the \nearly fall, and this will give States just months to reach the May 2008 \ndeadline.\n  It is true that, thanks to Senator Collins and others, and our \nwillingness to forgo an amendment earlier this year, the Department of \nHomeland Security agreed to grant waivers to States to delay \nimplementation. But, still, under the present route, 245 million people \nin America will need to get new ID cards by May of 2013.\n  REAL ID is a massive unfunded mandate on the States to begin with. \nLast fall the National Governors Association and others released a \nstudy putting the cost of REAL ID at $11 billion over 5 years. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security itself said the cost may reach $20 \nbillion over 10 years. To date, the Federal Government has appropriated \n$40 million for the States to comply with REAL ID, and only $6 million \nof the $40 million has actually been given to the States.\n  Here we go again. After a lot of promises from Washington, DC, on \nthis side of the aisle and on that side of the aisle--we say no more \nunfunded mandates, but we have a real big idea, we announce it, take \ncredit for it and send the bill to the Governors and the legislatures. \nWe let them worry about whether to raise college tuitions, raise \nproperty taxes, or cut services over here--worry how do we pay for this \nnew mandate?\n  No wonder 17 States now have passed legislation opposing the REAL ID \nAct, including Tennessee, which became the 16th State on June 11 of \nthis year.\n  To get an idea of what REAL ID would require, first, you have to \nprove the applicant's identity, which would take a passport, birth \ncertificate, a consular report--there are a number of other documents \nthat could be used. Then you have to prove your date of birth. That \nmight mean you have to bring in two documents. Then you have to prove \nyour Social Security number. That might mean you have to go find your \nSocial Security card. I wonder how many people have their Social \nSecurity card today. You are up to three documents. You need the \naddress of your principal residence--you have to prove that. Then you \nhave to prove you are lawfully here. That is not just for someone who \nis becoming a citizen or someone coming here, this is for every single \nperson who drives a car or gets an ID; he or she has to prove they are \nlawfully here under REAL ID. In all the States, that is 245 million \npeople.\n  In Tennessee last year, there were 1,711,000 new or renewed driver's \nlicenses. I renewed mine by mail; 154,000 renewed theirs online. There \nwill be no mail renewals, there will be no online renewals in Tennessee \nor Maryland or Mississippi or Washington State. Everybody will get to \ngo to the driver's license office. There are 53 of those in Tennessee, \nand 1.7 million of us will show up at those 53 offices, not just at one \ntime, not just in 1 week, but just in 1 month, scrambling around, \ntrying to figure out what documents we need to have. I can imagine \nthere are going to be phone calls coming into our offices that make the \nphone calls on immigration look like a Sunday school class.\n  We need only look at the recent passport backlog to imagine what \nmight happen with the REAL ID backlog. We remember that the passport \nquagmire in which we have been in the last few months was triggered by \na very well intentioned policy change designed to thwart terrorists. \nSpecifically, new rules were implemented in January of 2007 requiring \nAmericans to have passports for travel between the United States and \nCanada, Mexico and most of the islands of the Caribbean. This caused a \nmassive surge in passport applications. There were 12 million passports \nissued in 2006. The State Department expects to issue 17 million this \nyear--a 42-percent increase. Prior to the passport regulations, \napplications were increasing at a rate of 1 to 2 million a year. We are \nexpecting an increase of 5 million applications from 2006 to 2007.\n  In March of this year, there was a backlog of 3 million passports. \nThe current backlog is 2.3 million passports. Prior to the new \nregulations, turnaround time was 6 weeks on regular service and 2 weeks \non expedited service. At the worst part of this year, they were running \n12 to 14 weeks on regular service and 4 to 6 weeks on expedited \nservice. This massive backlog destroyed summer vacations, ruined \nwedding and honeymoon plans, disrupted business meetings and \neducational trips, caused people to lose days of work waiting in line, \nand caused people to lose money for nonrefundable travel and hotel \ndeposits and reservations.\n  My office has worked with the passport office over the last few \nmonths. I would compliment them for the dedication of the employees and \nhow they were trying to deal with this massive surge, but we imposed \nupon them a burden they simply could not handle.\n  What do we say to the people of Tennessee: Show up at our 53 driver's \nlicense offices with the correct documentation; otherwise, you may wait \nfor 2 hours, you get up to the window, and then they tell you've \nforgotten your Social Security card and you must come back again. If \nthey show up over 1 month, this is going to make the passport \napplication surge look like a small problem.\n  I believe we have a choice in Congress. I think insofar as REAL ID \ngoes, we should either fund it or we should repeal it. Fund it or \nrepeal it.\n  It may be that we need to have a national identification card. I have \nalways been opposed to that, but we live in a different era now. But I \nwould much prefer to have seen the Senate debate this in the usual way \nand let us consider, for example, whether a secure work card, such as \nthe kind Senator Schumer and Senator Graham have proposed and Senator \nCornyn and I have talked about, might not be a better form of ID card.\n  Most of our immigration problems, for example, are related to work. \nMaybe a secure identification card would be better, a secure Social \nSecurity card would be better, or maybe, because of privacy concerns \nand our memory of Nazi Germany and our memory of South Africa, we want \nto be very careful about having anything that is actually called a \nnational ID card or even a de facto ID card. So maybe we can work over \na period of years and help to create several cards: maybe a travel card \nthat some can use on airplanes or other forms of travel; maybe a work \ncard; maybe some States would want to use the driver's license as that \nform of ID card. But the point would be that there would be three or \nfour choices which could be used for ID which would be secure and would \nhelp with the terrorism threat we face.\n  I regret very much that we did not have a chance to take this \nproblem, this recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, properly through \nthe Senate and consider it. I was glad to see the legislation that \ncreated the negotiated rulemaking process that at least involved the \nStates in what is going on.\n  We have an obligation in this body to recognize the fact that if we \nare going to have something called REAL ID--and according to our own \nDepartment of Homeland Security, it is going to cost $20 billion over \n10 years--then we have a responsibility to appropriate that money or \nmost of that money to pay for it. Today, we are at $40 million. That is \nwhy Senator Collins and Senator Warner and Senator Voinovich and I \nintend to offer this amendment to the appropriations bill to provide \n$300 million in funding to the States to\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\nimplement REAL ID. In the meantime, I am going to work with other \nSenators to either reestablish the negotiated rulemaking process or to \nrepeal REAL ID and let us move ahead with a different way of developing \na secure identification card.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, while I am not offering any amendments \nnow on Homeland Security appropriations, I do wish to speak about a \ncouple of amendments I will be offering.\n  First, we all understand that the inspector generals are the eyes and \nears for not only the public and the executive branch but also for \nCongress within Federal agencies.\n  As part of a piece of broader legislation I have previously filed, I \nwanted to include in this bill the provisions that would relate to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Keep in mind, the Department of \nHomeland Security has been on the high-risk list as long as it has been \nin existence. The high-risk list is put out, in terms of management \nissues, by the Government Accountability Office.\n\n  There are so many areas I could go into of mismanagement and problems \nwithin FEMA and other parts of Homeland Security, but suffice it to say \nthat my amendment is going to help the public get access to the \ninspector general's information. It would require that the Department \nof Homeland Security put on the home page of their Web site a direct \nlink to the inspector general's report and, furthermore, provide \ninformation on the home page of how people can, in fact, turn in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for issues of fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  We need to enlist the public's help. In order for them to do that, \nthey have to know what is going on. It is my goal eventually to make \nsure the IG Web site is on the home page of every Federal agency, and \nthis is a good start in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The other amendment I have is troubling. In fact, it is scary. After \nthe hurricanes in 2005, there were a number of trailers that were \ndistributed to the victims of Katrina and Rita. Less than a year later, \nthere was a complaint regarding the condition of these trailers, and it \nrelated to the health of the people in the trailers. There was testing \ndone, one test, by FEMA. It found dangerously toxic levels of \nformaldehyde. What happened after those test results, and test results \nalso done by independent organizations? Nothing. Toxic levels of \nformaldehyde in trailers the Government provided to victims of a \nhurricane.\n  Here is the scary part. The scary part is the General Counsel's \nOffice within FEMA was advising the department: Let's keep this quiet. \nWe don't want to own this issue.\n  I am quoting now from things written by the lawyers in FEMA. A man \nactually died in a trailer. There was a conference call. As a result of \nthe call, the General Counsel's Office put out a directive: We are in \nlitigation on this issue. We must be on every conference call. Nothing \nshould be done on this without going through us. We don't want to own \nthis issue.\n  All of these kinds of messages were sent throughout FEMA. Now we have \na problem; we have a safety issue for American citizens living in \ntrailers that we have given them.\n  FEMA finally goes out and does some testing. They open all the \nwindows and turn on the exhaust fans and then say: We don't think the \nproblem is that serious. We better notify people. We want to notify \npeople, but don't put our phone number on it. Tell them there might be \na problem. In other words, let's see if we can't avoid being held \nresponsible by giving out information. But for gosh sakes don't let \nthem ask a question about what they do to get out of the trailer, how \nthey get a new trailer, how they can find out how the problem is being \naddressed.\n  We can take two attitudes in Government. We can take the attitude \nthat we want to try to ``CYA'' and look good or we can take the \nattitude we are here to serve the public. Those people in FEMA were \nusing Federal tax dollars, and their goal was to help people in times \nof need and make sure they stayed safe.\n  This Congress has a solemn obligation to make sure we get to the \nbottom of this. My amendment will require the inspector general to do \nan immediate and thorough report as to everything that happened in this \nincident and, within 15 days of enactment of this law, FEMA must report \nto Congress what action they have taken in response to this issue.\n  When, finally, this all came to light in a very well run House \nhearing in July of 2007, they promised swift action. We need to know \nwhat is ``swift action.'' We have to have the indoor quality testing \nand the root cause determination. We must make available alternative \nsafe housing, and we obviously have to make sure the Office of General \nCounsel is held accountable for an attitude that is all about covering \nour risk instead of protecting American citizens.\n  Senator Obama and Senator Pryor are working with me on this \namendment. I anticipate it will have bipartisan support and many other \nSenators will join us.\n  There is a lot of talk around right now about whether Congress is \ndoing its job, whether we are asserting ourselves in terms of a branch \nof Government that is supposed to provide oversight and accountability. \nI am confused as to why this did not reach the public's attention prior \nto January of this year. I am proud that it has now. I am proud that \nthese kinds of hearings are going on and that we are providing the kind \nof oversight and accountability of the executive branch that protects \nthe American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can make sure \nour job is to protect the people we serve and not to protect Government \nofficials.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to talk about the pending amendment to \nthe bill. This amendment is called the Graham-Gregg-Kyl-Sessions, et \nal., amendment. I wanted to make a couple of quick comments about it.\n  Because the immigration bill failed on the floor of the Senate, a \nvariety of States have begun to pass their own laws to enforce certain \nelements of immigration policy, including determining employment \neligibility. My State of Arizona is one of those States.\n  What I noticed that at least a couple of them have done, including \nArizona, is to require that employers check with the Department of \nHomeland Security, and the basic pilot program we have established as a \npilot program, to determine the validity of the Social Security status \nof the prospective employee. It may well be that as States fill the gap \ncreated because the Federal Government has not adopted immigration \nreform legislation, especially dealing with that subject, that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and Social Security will be \nincreasingly called upon to provide information to the States. Because \nof that, they are probably going to need to be able to improve their \nsystems; not to change what they do or create a Federal program but at \nleast to be able to respond to those State inquiries.\n  My understanding from the Department of Homeland Security is that \nthey have the capacity to deal with additional inquiries now, but they \nwish to improve their capabilities and make sure the accuracy level is \nhigh of the information passed back to the States and to the employers \nrequesting information, and perhaps even to expand what it is they can \nprovide by way of verification of the validity of the Social Security \nnumbers. So as this process unfolds, we are going to have to make sure \nall of our Government agencies--primarily the Department of\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\nHomeland Security--have what they need to respond to these requests.\n  To that end, one of the elements of the amendment that has been \noffered here authorizes the expenditure of funds for the specific \npurpose of improving the reliability of the basic pilot program and \nassociated programs of the Federal Government that would respond to \nState inquiries. Obviously, my preference is that the Federal \nGovernment undertake that ourselves. Our responsibility is to form the \nimmigration laws and secure the border. Having failed to pass \nlegislation, they can help our citizens around the country by having \nthe most robust database possible that is easy to access and, \ntherefore, States and employers throughout the States can take \nadvantage of.\n  The only other thing is that I support this amendment because it \nincludes many of the features that were part of the immigration bill \nthat almost everybody agreed with. What you heard in the debate was \nthat we all agree we need to secure the border, enforce the laws, \nreturn to the rule of law, but--there was always a ``but'' and \ndifferent people had different reasons they didn't want to support the \nbill. But the bottom line was that almost everybody here supported the \nessential enforcement features.\n  The Department of Homeland Security appropriation bill, therefore, is \nthe appropriate place to include funding for the execution of the laws \nthat currently exist and, almost without exception, this amendment does \nnot add new authority or programs for enforcement but rather identifies \nareas in which enforcing existing law would be enhanced through greater \ncapability achieved through the expenditure of funds that could, among \nother things, hire more personnel or in other ways make the system more \nrobust.\n  Here is one specific example: Most folks like to refer to securing \nthe border, and the symbol of that is the hiring of more Border Patrol. \nThat is fine; we need them. But we also know that 40 percent of illegal \nimmigrants in the United States didn't cross the border illegally. They \ncame here on visas and then overstayed their visas illegally. The \nquestion is, what can we do to enforce our visa policy, as well as what \ncan we do to secure the border?\n  This bill focuses on that visa overstayer problem and provides \nfunding for the kind of particular investigators and agents for \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement that would ordinarily be looking at \nthat problem. In addition, it explores ways in which the entry-exit \nsystem can be implemented and we can understand who has overstayed \ntheir visas so that can be enforced.\n  There is much else in this amendment that is good policy and that \nbacks up that policy by the expenditure of funds. The $3 billion figure \nin here is, very roughly, an approximation of what the immigration bill \nthat we debated provided for, minus the implementation of a couple of \nprograms, the biggest one of which was the employee verification \nsystem. That system obviously failed along with the rest of the \nimmigration bill. That was a pretty expensive item.\n  You will recall that we had mandatory spending of $4.4 billion--money \nthat would have been collected from fines and fees. The $3 billion here \nrepresents the bulk of what that money would have been spent on, minus \nthe employee verification system and a few other odds and ends.\n  That is the explanation for the particular amount of funding in the \nbill. I hope our colleagues will think carefully about this amendment. \nIts purpose is good. I think its execution is good. It is on the right \nbill. What it does that is a bit troublesome to some Members is provide \nsome authorization, though that is not the primary element; it would \nnot be the first time we provided authorization on an appropriations \nbill, but I can see there is some of that in here. The other aspect is \nthe emergency funding nature. One way or another, we are going to have \nto get the funding to do the things the American people have insisted \non. I have no objection to doing this as emergency funding. If we can \nfund $100 billion for the Iraq war, for example, I think we can fund $3 \nbillion to secure our own border. If the loss of the immigration bill a \nmonth ago taught me anything, it was that the American people are very \nskeptical that we are committed to enforcing the law. I believe until \nwe demonstrate to them a seriousness of purpose by actions rather than \nwords, by the appropriation of money and by the expenditure of that \nmoney on things that they can see make a difference in enforcing \nimmigration policy, they are not going to give us the green light to \nadopt a more comprehensive immigration reform bill. That is why I am \nsupportive of this amendment as the next step toward solving the \nproblem. I think we want to solve it. I think this is a step in that \ndirection and I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I filed earlier a number of amendments. \nI want to talk about some of those and why I think that they are \nimportant. I am pleased to say many of them have been included, all or \nin part, in the Graham-Gregg-Kyl-McConnell amendment that I have \ncosponsored. I think, in effect, it represents a positive step to \ncreating a lawful system of immigration, which I believe we owe to the \nAmerican people. They expect that.\n  What good is it for us to pass new ideas, new laws, and new \nprovisions concerning immigration if they will not be enforced any \nbetter than those we have had before? That is the real rub, the real \nproblem we have. That was my fundamental concern and objection to the \ncomprehensive bill that failed to pass a few weeks ago. It would not \nhave done the job, it would not have been effective, and it did not \naccomplish what we need to accomplish.\n  I want to share some ideas about the amendments that I have offered \nand why they are important. I believe Senator Kyl said that we have \nbroad bipartisan support for this. There was some belief that if \nenforcement amendments are passed, then some people would never \nconfront the other aspects of immigration that others believe need to \nbe confronted. I think the truth is that people tried to hold hostage \nenforcement in order to gain support for a new idea of immigration, and \nan amnesty, or a legalization process that the American people didn't \nagree to. It didn't work. So let me share a few thoughts that I think \nare important with regard to having a good legal system for our \nborders.\n  First, we have to have more barriers, more fencing. The funding for \nthe fencing that we asked for--the 700 miles of fencing--would be \nincluded in the amendment that has been proposed, offered, and called \nup. That is a good step in the right direction. I will offer separately \nan amendment asking the GAO--our Government Accountability Office--to \nanalyze the cost. The cost factor that I have heard is about $3.2 \nmillion per mile for the fence. That exceeds my best judgment of how \nmuch that I think it ought to cost to build a fence based on my \nexperience of building a fence in the country in the past. Fences \nusually do not cost millions of dollars but, this fence on the border \nis going to cost a lot of money. Yes, we need a lot of fencing on the \nborder, and maybe double and triple fencing in some areas. We need \nhigh-tech cameras, and that will run the cost up. But sometimes you get \nthe impression that the people who don't believe in fencing are running \nthe cost up so high that maybe the American people will change their \nmind about the fence. We know the fence at San Diego was a great \nsuccess. People on both sides of the border appreciate it. What was a \nrundown, crime-prone area on both sides of the border in San Diego is \nnow making economic progress, and illegal immigration and crime in that \nsector is way down. Putting up a strong fence is the right thing for us \nto do and we must do it if we are serious about enforcement.\n  I ask for commonsense purposes, tell me how we can have enough border \nagents to cover 1,700 miles for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? Are they \njust going to stand out there all day and all night? We need barriers \nthat will multiply the Border Patrol officer's capability to respond in \nan effective way to\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\napprehend those who break into the country.\n  Through a combination of these efforts, we can get to the point where \nwe go from an open border to a border that people understand to be \nclosed, and, as a result, we could see a reduction in the number of \npeople who attempt to come into our country illegally.\n  I am pleased that a good part of the State and local law enforcement \nprovisions I have provided for will be included in the amendment. I am \npleased that a good part of the National Guard provisions I have \noffered, including continuing Operation Jump Start, will be included, \nand the criminal alien provisions dealing with removing those aliens \nwho have been convicted of crimes are deported.\n  I am pleased that we are moving towards ensuring that illegal \nentrants will be prosecuted when they come into the country illegally. \nThis can be done by expanding the Del Rio, TX, zero-tolerance policy to \nother areas of our border so that illegal aliens who come across the \nborder are not just met and greeted, given free meals, and taken back \nhome, but actually are convicted of the crime that they committed when \nthey came across the border illegally. We have seen good results from \nthat program. And there are some other provisions that are important.\n  I have filed three amendments dealing with the fence. The first deals \nwith a GAO study of the cost of the fencing. We need to know how much \nmoney has been spent thus far--there is a lot of confusion out there--\nhow much fencing is now in place after all the money we have spent, how \nmuch it is costing and will cost the American taxpayers in the future, \nand whether there are better techniques and procedures by which we can \nbuild more fencing for less cost faster without significantly \nsacrificing quality. That is what that study would include. The \nGovernment Accountability Office regularly evaluates those kinds of \nissues, and I believe they will give us a valuable report that will \nhelp us in the future.\n  A second amendment calls for full funding of the fencing.\n  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 that I offered, which was signed into \nlaw, requires 700 miles of fencing. This amendment which I offered \nwould fully fund the 700 linear miles of southern border fencing \nrequired by providing $1.548 billion to be used for the construction of \ntopographical mile 371 through 700. That is what the law requires.\n  The Congressional Research Service and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity have told us that 700 linear miles in the act will actually \nrequire more miles topographically; so the 700 linear miles becomes \nclose to 854 topographical miles. So my amendment will fund the \nremaining 484 topographical miles of fencing not currently funded for \nconstruction by December 31, 2009.\n  I have drafted this amendment in two ways. One is to be paid for with \nan across-the-board cut, and the other is designated as emergency \nspending.\n  If we are able to adopt the amendment offered earlier today by \nSenator Graham and others, perhaps that will go a long way to solving \nthe problems I have raised, but, in fact, we could go further and \nshould go further.\n  My next set of amendments addresses State and local law enforcement's \nability to assist Federal law enforcement. My amendment allows for some \nof the grant moneys appropriated by the bill to go for State and local \ntraining exercises, technical assistance, and other programs under the \nlaw. This would be a pot of up to $294 million to be used to reimburse \nState and local expenses related to the implementation of the INA \nsection 287(G) agreements.\n  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, State and local \ngovernments can sign memorandums of understanding--they are referred to \nas MOUs in the Government. When two foreign nations do it, they call \nthem treaties. It is about as complex. MOUs are important--with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to have their law enforcement officers \ntrained to work with DHS and to enforce immigration law. That is how \nState and local people work together. My amendment encourages State and \nlocal governments to seek out these agreements and participate in them. \nThe Federal Government needs to welcome State and local law \nenforcement's assistance at every opportunity, not discourage it.\n  Alabama was the second State, I am pleased to say, in the Nation to \nsign such an agreement. We have trained 3 classes of approximately 20 \nState troopers each for a total of 60 State troopers who are now \n``cross-designated'' to work with the immigration agency, ICE. Each \nclass cost the State of Alabama about $40,000. The State of Alabama had \nto pay to train their officers in this fashion so they could \nparticipate with the Federal Government. They have spent about $120,000 \nto date to help the Federal Government enforce Federal immigration \nlaws. I think we can do better. We should encourage State law \nenforcement officers, and we should help fund this partnership program. \nI have no doubt in my mind that is the right way.\n  Then I have an amendment that affirms State and local authority and \nexpands of the immigration violators files in the National Crime \nInformation Center, that is not in the Gregg amendment. My amendment \nwould reaffirm the inherent authority of State and local law \nenforcement to assist the Federal Government in the enforcement of \nimmigration laws.\n  Confusion among the circuit courts, particularly dicta in a Ninth \nCircuit decision that appears to be somewhat contradictory to the Fifth \nand Tenth Circuits, is involved. That has led to a Department of \nJustice Office of Legal Counsel opinion that questioned some powers of \nState and local law enforcement. And then the Department of Justice \nwithdrew that opinion. So there is uncertainty--the Presiding Officer \nknows how uncertain it can get involving the prosecution of cases in \nmultiple jurisdictions--about what the power of local law enforcement \nis to participate in helping to enforce immigration laws.\n\n  The issue is very real. Just today in the Washington Times, there is \nan article about it. The article is entitled ``Virginia eyes plan to \ndeport illegals. Panel suggests a statewide policy.'' It is being \ndiscussed all over the country. They say in that article:\n\n       Other areas, such as the role of local and State police \n     officers in enforcing immigration law, are more ambiguous. It \n     is not clear what the State's role is in enforcing \n     immigration law, Mr. Cleator said.\n\n  He is senior staff lawyer for the Virginia State Crime Commission. He \nsaid it is not clear what the State role is, and there is some \nambiguity, less than most people understand, but there is a perception \nof ambiguity, and there is some ambiguity. That is why my amendment is \nneeded and important.\n  My amendment will place additional information in the National Crime \nInformation Center's immigration violators file so that critical \ninformation on final orders of removal, revocation of visas, and \nexpired voluntary departure agreements can be readily available to \nState and local law enforcement officers. They need that information so \nthey can make the right decisions when they apprehend somebody going \nabout their normal business on matters such as speeding and the like.\n  The National Crime Information Center is the bread-and-butter \ndatabase of local law enforcement, and they need this information \nproperly inputted into that computer center because the State law \nofficers will be the ones routinely coming into contact with unlawful \nand deported aliens during the course of their normal duties, such as a \nDUI charge. They want to know something about them, and the information \nis not being readily placed in that computer.\n  Everybody knows that virtually every law enforcement officer in \nAmerica who stops somebody for an offense--such as DUI, theft, \nburglary, robbery--runs the suspect's name in the National Crime \nInformation Center, and this is done to determine whether there are \npending charges against the suspect, whether the suspect had been \nconvicted of other crimes or if other charges will require that the \nsuspect be held in addition to the charge for the original stop. This \nis done every day through tens of thousands of inquiries to NCIC. I \nhave discovered that they are not putting a sufficient amount of the \nimmigration violation information in NCIC. We have to do that if we \nwant that a lawful system of immigration to work. If someone doesn't \nwant lawful immigration to work then they will not put that immigration \nviolators' information in NCIC.\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\n  Another issue I have raised is Operation Jump Start. This deals with \nNational Guard funding through the end of the year 2008 and improvement \nin the rules of engagement. There is funding in the Gregg amendment for \nthis matter, but it did not include rules of engagement language.\n  My amendment, and a similar amendment filed by Senator Kyl for \nanother bill, provides the funding, which is $400 million, needed to \nkeep the current National Guard presence of 6,000 guardsmen on the \nsouthern border through the end of 2008. The administration's plan is \nto reduce those forces by half--down to 3,000--by September 2007. So by \nnext summer, they want to have those numbers in half. The National \nGuard is working to deter illegal border crossings. They are big making \na difference there. They are also helping us create the impression that \nour border is no longer open, that it is closed and it is not a good \nthing for someone to try to come across it illegally. Removing the \nNational Guard members when they have been so successful would be \npremature.\n  If we take all these actions and keep the National Guard at the \nborder, we can help reach that tipping point that I referred to \nearlier.\n  In addition, my amendment will allow the National Guard members to \nhave a greater role in stopping illegal aliens along the border. \nNational Guard members should be permitted to aid in the apprehension \nof illegal aliens crossing the border, at least until a Border Patrol \nagent comes on the scene. Today, they are only permitted to use \nnondeadly force for self-defense or the defense of others. So they \ncannot apprehend illegal aliens that they see crossing the border \nbecause they cannot use force unless it is to defend themselves or \nothers. The rules of engagement prevent them from effectively \napprehending illegal aliens. My amendment will allow those brave and \neffective National Guard members to apprehend illegal border crossers \nuntil the Border Patrol officer can come to their location.\n  Another big deal is that we want to make sure criminal aliens are \ndeported. In effect, this language in the amendment I will offer and \nfiled is included in the Gregg amendment. It deals with this problem. \nThe American people understand the need to deport aliens, legal and \nillegal, who have committed crimes in the United States, crimes that \nmake them deportable. We have laws that say that if you are here in a \nnonpermanent status and you commit a crime, then you are to be \ndeported; nonpermanent status means that you do not have legal \npermanent status or citizenship in America. And one of the conditions \nof that admission is that you don't commit crimes. That is not too much \nto ask. That is our standard. Most countries have a similar standard.\n\n  And criminal aliens should be deported, as a matter of policy, at the \nend of their State or local criminal sentences. They should not be \nallowed to slip through the cracks and be released back into society. \nThat is not what our laws call for, but it is happening every day.\n  Additionally, State court judges should not be allowed to vacate \nconvictions or to remit sentences for the purpose of allowing the alien \nto escape the immigration consequences of their crimes. Those events \nthat criminal aliens are not being deported and that some criminal \naliens are avoiding the immigration consequences of their crimes are of \ngreat concern to the American people and Border Patrol agents who are \nout there working their hearts out.\n  So my amendment will double the funding--$300 million--that DHS has \nfor the institutional removal program, a program that allows DHS to \nidentify criminal aliens while they are in jail serving State and local \nsentences. Once they have been identified, they go through the \npaperwork, and the administrative removal process can be completed \nwhile they are in jail. This allows the criminal alien to be put \ndirectly into the Department of Homeland Security's custody at the end \nof their prison term, so that they can be quickly deported.\n  My amendment expands the criminal alien program by directing that the \nSecretary of DHS implement a pilot project to evaluate technology to \nautomatically identify incarcerated illegal aliens before they are \nreleased. Manpower alone won't get this job done. But if we start \ncorrectly with technology, we can make great progress. It can be a big \nimprovement in our current system.\n  In addition, my amendment ensures that when a criminal alien commits \na crime, then the original conviction and sentencing will stand when \nDHS has determined whether the alien is deportable based on their \ncrimes. This ensures that the trial judge's decision to change the \nsentence or the judgment of conviction won't be able to undermine the \nimmigration impact of the original judgment.\n  Madam President, we have a real problem. We have a situation in which \n27 percent of the persons in the Federal and State penitentiaries are \nforeign born--this is an amazing number to me--and they are there for \ncrimes other than immigration--for drugs, fraud, sexual abuse, violent \ncrimes. Large numbers of them--the majority of them--are persons who \nare not citizens. They have been involved in crimes of a serious \nnature, and they should be deported when they complete serving their \nsentence for those crimes. That is what is not occurring.\n  In fact, we have at this moment, we believe, some 600,000 absconders. \nThese are people who have been apprehended and ordered deported, who \nare told to report for deportation, or similar orders, and have just \nsimply absconded into the country and never shown up. That is a huge \nnumber of illegal aliens that we could eliminate, or reduce, if we \ncould handle this process of taking care of their deportation as soon \nas they have finished their criminal time in jail.\n  Currently, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of \nJustice have implemented a zero tolerance policy at the Del Rio sector \nof the border. This policy makes sure that every illegal alien is \nprosecuted for their illegal entry into the United States. It is a \nmisdemeanor for the first offense. It is a criminal offense, but it is \na misdemeanor for the first offense of coming into our country \nillegally. This policy has decreased illegal entry into the Del Rio \nsector by 58 percent.\n  Now, when you consider that last year we arrested 1 million people \nattempting to enter our country illegally, you get an understanding of \nwhat a 58-percent reduction in illegal entries means when that kind of \npolicy is enacted. Though there are nine border sectors, Del Rio is the \nonly one that has such a policy. My amendment would expand the success \nof the Del Rio project to the two border sectors with the highest \ncrossing rates--Tucson, AZ, and San Diego, CA.\n  My amendment also requires that until a zero tolerance policy is \nfully in place, the Department of Homeland Security must refer all \nillegal entries along the Tucson-San Diego sector to the respective \nU.S. Attorneys' Offices for prosecution. The U.S. Attorneys' Offices \nmust then provide a formal acceptance or declaration of that \nprosecution request, which would then allow a record so that Congress \ncan know what all is happening--whether additional resources are needed \nto fully implement this highly effective policy along the entire \nborder. I think that is a good step in the right direction.\n  Also, Madam President, we have the question of affidavits of support \nand their lack of use and my amendment deals with that. Since 1997, \nmost family-based and some employment-based immigrants have to have, \nand do have, a sponsor that guarantees the immigrant will not become a \npublic charge. In other words, they are admitted into the country, but \nonly on the condition that if they have financial needs, this sponsor \nwill take care of that, not the taxpayers of the United States. That is \na legitimate condition, I submit, to place on entrance into the United \nStates.\n  So the sponsor would enter into a contract with the Federal \nGovernment, promising to pay back any means-tested public benefits the \nimmigrant would receive. There are some exceptions--medical assistance, \nschool lunch, Federal disaster relief.\n  To my knowledge, the Federal Government has never gone after sponsors \nto ensure they follow through on the commitment they have made. My \namendment will require a study to be done by the \nGovernment Accountability Office to determine the number\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\nof immigrants with signed affidavits of support that are receiving or \nhave received Federal, State, and local benefits when those immigrants \nreally are not eligible and should have turned to their sponsors for \nsupport. A GAO study is needed to determine how much revenue the \nFederal Government could collect if they enforced these contracts and \ninsisted that the individual who sponsored the person into the country \nactually pays what they are supposed to pay.\n\n  We need to preserve means-tested public benefits for those who are \ntruly needy. We don't have enough money to take care of all the people \nin our country and shouldn't have to take care of people when they have \na sponsor who promised to take care of them and promised that the \nsponsors would pay back the money for any benefits that the immigrants \nreceived.\n  So those are some of the amendments I offered. There is much that we \ncan do to make our system of immigration at the border more effective. \nI would just cite that it is a matter of national security. We \nabsolutely know that we have many people who simply want to come to \nAmerica to work and don't want to cause any attack on the United \nStates, and they are good people. They simply would like to make more \nmoney, which is available in the United States, than if they stay in \ntheir home country. But we also know that since we are not able to \naccept everyone who would like to come to America, we have to have \nrules about who can come and who cannot come and those we let come have \nto obey our laws.\n  One of the first and toughest rules should be that we don't allow \npeople to come here who are terrorists, or have terrorist connections \nthat could threaten our country.\n  Next, we need to ask ourselves how many persons should come in \nlegally, and under what conditions, what kind of skills and abilities \nand education level and language skills they should have. That should \nbe part of a good and effective immigration policy.\n  I will just say, however, that any such rules are absolutely \nworthless if we have a wide open system where people come across \nillegally on a regular basis and they know they have a high probability \nfor success to come here illegally. Indeed, we know they do because we \nhave about 12 million people here illegally.\n  So those are some steps I suggest we can take that will improve our \nlegal system. I am pleased that a number of those will be included in \nthe Gregg-Graham amendment and will not require a separate vote.\n  I hope we will take this responsibility seriously. I see no reason we \nshould not undertake the actions that I have suggested, which have \nbipartisan support in the Congress. I hope they will not become part of \nsome grand agreement that everything else that we can't agree on has to \nbe a part of it. In other words, these provisions, which I think would \nhave broad bipartisan and public support, these provisions should not \nbe used as a vehicle to try to drag on things that people don't agree \nwith--certainly not at this time.\n  So I support these amendments. I am glad we do have the Graham-Gregg-\nMcConnell-Kyl amendment on the floor, and I support that. And I would \nask these amendments be considered in due course.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, before the Senate, I understand, is a \nGraham amendment dealing with border security. Then there is a second-\ndegree amendment that has been offered on top of that which effectively \nis where we are at the present time. I would like to make a few \ncomments about this whole issue that has been brought up by Senator \nGraham in terms of the security aspects at the border.\n  Those of us who supported a comprehensive program on immigration \nreform supported strong border enforcement because we know there are \n400,000 or 500,00 people who have come across the border, minimally, a \nyear. We don't know their names. We don't know where they go. They \ndisappear into American society. There is no question, on a matter \ndealing with homeland security, we have to be serious about dealing \nwith our borders. We understand that.\n  That is why it is so interesting to me, when I saw we had that \nopportunity 2 years ago, we had a great deal of fuss on the other side \nabout building a fence along the border and then, after they got their \nvote, the Republicans never funded that particular program.\n  When we had a chance a few weeks ago to do something on comprehensive \nborder control, again the Republicans, the other side, voted no; they \nvoted it down. Now we have the proposal to try to, I guess, make them \npolitically OK among the voters. We know this issue of undocumented and \nillegal immigration is a complex one, is a difficult one.\n  We know the primary reason people come across the border down in the \nSouthwest is because of the magnet of jobs in the United States. This \namendment does nothing about the magnet of jobs. We should not delude \nourselves, if we say we are going to support this particular proposal \nand then not deal with what is the basic cause of the hundreds of \nthousands of people who come here, and that is the magnet of jobs. This \namendment doesn't deal with the magnet of jobs. Maybe it has a good \npolitical ring to it out there on the hustings, that we are doing \nsomething, but as we have seen time and time again, as long as we are \nnot going to deal with the magnet of jobs, the efforts we have on the \nborder--we can build the fences, people have ladders to go over them; \nor you can build fences and people will burrow and go underneath them--\nas long as you have the powerful magnet of jobs, the efforts will fail.\n  We are going to have a vote on this issue, although I, for one, \nbelieve having strong border security is a key aspect of having \ncomprehensive reform. That is why a number of us are going to support \nan alternative to the Graham amendment, an alternative that recognizes, \nNo. 1, this is a complex problem--we are for border security and \ncontrol, to the extent we can--but, No. 2, that we have a situation \naffecting millions of Americans in agriculture and that is, if we are \ngoing to have border control we are going to have to be able to provide \nagricultural workers. That is why I hope the Senate will consider an \namendment which will have the border control provisions but also have \nwhat is called the AgJOBS provisions that will address what is the need \nin agricultural America.\n  Without it, as we have heard so eloquently from Senator Feinstein, as \nwe heard from Senator Larry Craig, we are going to have devastation in \nmajor parts of our country.\n  If you are going to have border security, you are going to have to \nhave some way for these workers to get in. The AgJOBS bill is the bill \nthat has had over 60 Members of the Senate who have been supporters of \nthat program. That seems to me to begin to make a good deal of sense.\n  Recognize, in dealing with this whole issue in a comprehensive way, \nthe most vulnerable people inside our borders, those individuals who \nare here and are undocumented in so many instances are young people, \nbrought here through no fault of their own because their parents \nbrought them here when they were under 16 years of age, who are here \nfor more than 5 years, serving 2 years in the military, graduating from \nthe high schools of this country--it is called the DREAM Act.\n  I see my friend and the principal spokesperson and sponsor of that, \nthe Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, on the floor. He speaks so \nwell to this issue. When we have the amendment before the Senate, I \nwill review some of the great, important successes of many young \nindividuals who came here undocumented and have worked long and hard \nand have graduated from high school, which is no mean feat when you \nhave more than a 50-percent dropout rate among the Hispanic community. \nThe fact that these individuals are here, want to be part of the \nAmerican dream, want to contribute to our Nation--the DREAM Act gives \nthem the hope and opportunity for the future, which so many who have \ncome here as\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\nimmigrants and as children, who want to be a part of the American \ndream, have felt.\n  This will be a proposal I hope we will have a chance to vote on. It \nwill have the border security aspects included in the Graham proposal. \nIt will recognize, if you are going to try to close the border, you are \nstill going to have the great agribusiness in our country that is going \nto demand workers. We have a way of responding to that, a way about \nwhich Senator Feinstein and Senator Larry Craig have spoken to this \nbody, a familiar path that makes a great deal of sense. That will be \npart of the proposal. Then we say to some of the most vulnerable \nindividuals here, we recognize the challenges you are facing.\n  The proposal we are going to offer is a downpayment on a day where we \nmight be able to come to a more comprehensive approach, which will be \nclearly in the interests of the Nation and in the interests of those \nwho have come here and hopefully are looking forward to being a part of \nthe American dream--pay their fines, pay their dues but be a part of \nthe American dream.\n\n  I also mention I was somewhat troubled by the provisions of the \nGraham amendment, which effectively will say, for those who have \noverstayed their visa--and we know that is about 46 percent of all the \nundocumented. You can't deal with the problem of the undocumented here \nin the United States and just close the border because almost half of \nthose who are undocumented here come from overstays. So let's not \nconfuse the American people and beat our chests and say we have taken a \nstrong security position by dealing with the border and not dealing \nwith the undocumented.\n  We have 12.5 million undocumented here. We simply do not have enough \ndetention centers in which to detain them.\n  We want to deal with the terrorists. We want to deal with the drug \nsmugglers. We want to deal with the hardened criminals. Rather than \nfocusing our attention on those goals, we would divert precious \nresources to what? Jailing women and children, taking the overstays and \nputting them into detention? We have an undocumented problem and what \nare we going to do? This is not the solution. This whole scenario \nsounds like another plan like we had in Iraq: Al-Qaida in Afghanistan \nwas the organization who attacked the United States and what did we do? \nWe went into Iraq, wasting our resources. This amendment is focused on \nroundups and mass detention, rather than target the real threats which \nare terrorism and crimes. This amendment on the Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill is not the answer.\n  It seems to me an alternative approach makes a great deal of sense. \nThis is a modest program. It is a well-thought-out program. It is a \ntried and tested program. It is a program where they have had hearings \nand the Senate is familiar with it. Let's do what is necessary at the \nborder. Let's do what is necessary to ensure that agriculture and those \nworkers who have worked in the fields are going to have the respect and \ndignity they should have. That has bipartisan support. Let's insist we \nare going to include the DREAM Act, which has strong bipartisan support \nas well.\n  Let's move on and accept that concept. That includes the basic thrust \nof the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. Then let's move \nahead with the Homeland Security bill.\n  I know my friend from Connecticut wishes to address the Senate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield briefly, without losing my right to the \nfloor, yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator is essentially embracing the \nconcept of moving forward independently with the DREAM Act, \nessentially; is that the position of the Senator?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We would have an amendment that would have border \nsecurity and AgJOBS and the DREAM Act together, put in together, so we \nwill deal with border issues but also recognize, if you are going to \nhave a strong border, if we are going to keep out agricultural workers, \nthat we have a major agricultural industry here, and we ought to accept \nAgJOBS which, I think at last count, has 66 cosponsors, Republicans and \nDemocrats. Also, we have an emergency with that particular proposal. \nAlso, look at those who are the most vulnerable people in this country, \nand those are the children who have been brought here through no fault \nof their own, trying to be a part of our system. Many of them are in \nthe Armed Forces of our country. It is called the DREAM Act. The \nSenator from Illinois has been a prime sponsor.\n  We think, with that combination, that will be much more responsive to \nthe real challenges we are facing, both from a security point of view \nand from an economic point of view, an agricultural point of view and \nfrom a humane point of view.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could simply make the point in the form of a \nrhetorical question: I am not sure the DREAM Act, as viable as it may \nbe, has a great deal to do with Homeland Security's job on the border. \nOf course the Lindsey Graham amendment, of which I was a sponsor, is \nfocused at Homeland Security's responsibility on the border.\n  But I appreciate the point of the Senator. I am not sure why he \nstopped there. Why doesn't he just reoffer the entire comprehensive \nimmigration bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This, I believe, is the downpayment. I remind my friend, \nand then I will yield the floor:\n\n       Enforcement alone will not do the job of securing our \n     borders. Enforcement at the border will only be successful in \n     the long term if it is coupled with a more sensible approach \n     to the 10 to 12 million illegal aliens in the country today \n     and the many more who will attempt to migrate to the United \n     States for economic reasons.\n\n  This is from the Coalition for Immigration Security. This is from a \nWhite House official charged with homeland security. This is a security \nissue, and we believe it is important.\n  The final point I mention to my friend from New Hampshire is a key \naspect of the DREAM Act is to encourage these young people to serve in \nthe military. At a time when we have critical needs in the military, \nthe opportunities for these young people to serve in the military will \ngive a very important boost to the Armed Forces of the country, and \nthat obviously is dealing with the security of the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment \nSenator Collins and I intend to introduce. I gather the parliamentary \nsituation is such that there will not be a grant of unanimous consent \nto set aside the pending amendment, so we did want to take this \nopportunity to discuss an amendment which would add $100 million to the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill for the purpose of funding \nefforts at the State and local level to make communications between our \nlaw enforcement personnel interoperable--they can talk to each other. \nThis is a pressing need for homeland security, for disaster response.\n  I know my friend and colleague from Maine cannot remain on the Senate \nfloor for long. So I yield to her for some comments about our \namendment. Then I will retake the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first, let me thank the committee \nchairman, Senator Lieberman, for his graciousness in yielding to me.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Lieberman's amendment to \nadd $100 million for an interoperability communications grant program. \nLast year, the Homeland Security Committee spent 8 months investigating \nthe flawed response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  It was very disappointing for the committee to learn that the same \nkinds of problems in the ability of emergency first responders to \ncommunicate with one another that were evident in the response on 9/11 \nstill existed that many years later and hampered the response to the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  When the 9/11 Commission reviewed all that went up to the attacks on \nour country on 9/11 and evaluated the response, it identified the \ntragic truth that many firefighters, police officers, and other \nemergency responders lost their lives on 9/11 because their \ncommunications equipment was incompatible. The police could not talk to \nthe firefighters, who could not, in turn, talk to the emergency medical \npersonnel.\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\n  We found exactly that same problem existing years later in the \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. In fact, we found that within the same \nparish of New Orleans, police and firefighters often had incompatible \ncommunications equipment. It should be evident if our first responders \ncannot talk to one another in the midst of an emergency, the response \nis going to be greatly hampered, and in some cases that means \nadditional loss of life. That is just unacceptable.\n  State and local governments recognize their problems with emergency \ncommunications, which is why the Department of Homeland Security \nreceives more requests for funding to upgrade and purchase compatible \nemergency communications equipment under the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative than for any \nother allowable use.\n  The experts tell us the only way we are ever going to get a handle on \nthis problem is if we dedicate funding for this purpose. The Homeland \nSecurity bill that is about to emerge from conference would establish a \nmultiyear program to achieve that goal. But we need to make a \ndownpayment on that program through this appropriations bill.\n  I know the leaders of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity have worked very hard, and there are many demands on the money \nthat is available. But I would urge them to take a look at our \nproposal.\n  Creating an interoperability emergency communications network is a \ncomplicated, expensive, and lengthy process. It is the type of \nmultiyear project that requires States to know how much money they will \nbe getting each year for several years in order to come up with the \nkind of regional plan that is needed to address this problem.\n  Even the most effective preincident planning will prove ineffective \nif first responders are unable to communicate with each other \neffectively in real time, on demand, during an actual incident, and in \nthe immediate aftermath.\n  I would point out that Senator Lieberman and I also sponsored an \namendment when the budget was on the Senate floor, which was adopted \njust 4 short months ago, that provided $400 million for this critical \npurpose. Yet, unfortunately, the appropriations bill before us contains \nno funding for interoperability communications grants.\n  Now, we recognize the competing demands, and that is why the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and I are proposing a modest program of only $100 \nmillion rather than the $400 million that was adopted during \nconsideration of the budget resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Lieberman and me in supporting \nfunding for interoperability emergency communications. This is a high \npriority for our first responder community, for those who are on the \nfront lines when disaster strikes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Maine for an \nexcellent statement.\n  First, I thank the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, Senator Cochran, Senator Murray, for working as hard and \neffectively as they have to provide funds that are critical to securing \nour homeland.\n  In fact, the committee added two and a quarter billion dollars for \nHomeland Security above the request of the President's budget. For \nthat, they are to be thanked. That is exactly the right thing to do at \na time when the threat of terrorism continues to be a clear and present \ndanger for our American homeland.\n  Senator Collins and I are offering this amendment because, as she \nsaid, we believe the committee has not provided anything for one of our \nNation's highest priorities, and thus an adjustment is needed and I \nspeak of interoperability of communications systems among law \nenforcement personnel, first responders, the very fundamental capacity \nin an emergency to pick up whatever means of communication they have \nand speak to the firefighters, police officers, and emergency \nresponders wherever they may be.\n  As Senator Collins indicated, just to build some history, in the \nSenate budget resolution conference report earlier this year adopted by \nthe Senate, we provided for $400 million to be spent next year for this \nprogram in helping States and localities to allow their first \nresponders to talk to each other in a crisis. That is the budget \nresolution. It is a first step, but it was an important step.\n  Senator Collins also referred to the conference committee on the 9/11 \nlegislation that passed both Houses of the Congress. We have been in \nconference for some period of time. I am happy to say we concluded the \nconference successfully within the last 24 hours, and a report is now \ncirculating among the members of the committee to have them sign it. I \ngather that a majority of members of the House committee have already \nsigned, and Senators, in their wisdom, are taking a little longer to \nread the report. But I am confident that before the end of the day we \nwill have a majority there, too, as well.\n  Well, the conference report on the \n9/11 legislation, which is before us, to implement as yet unimplemented \nparts of the 9/11 Commission Report, or those parts that have been \ninadequately implemented, and/or, frankly, ideas that the respective \ncommittees in the House and the Senate have had on our own initiative \nto strengthen our homeland security against the threat of terrorism, \nwhich as I said earlier is clear and present, as the most recent \nreports on al-Qaida and its intention to strike us make painfully \nclear, and to create the kind of apparatus that will protect the \nAmerican people in the event of natural disasters because there is an \nobvious overlap in what those capabilities will do.\n  So the 9/11 legislation conference report will be before the Senate \nsoon. It does authorize a new interoperability emergency communications \ngrant program. It should, hopefully, provide additional and much needed \nresources to help the Nation's first responders.\n  Now, I used the word ``hopefully'' advisedly because this new grant \nprogram the 9/11 legislation creates will not help our first responders \nunless we put some money into it. That is what this bill and this \namendment to this bill that Senator Collins and I are offering would \ndo. It would provide $100 million for the program in fiscal year 2008. \nIt is below the $400 million authorized in the budget resolution. But \nthis $100 million is a good start and an opportunity to essentially put \nour money where our promise was in the 9/11 legislation.\n  This actually is a very modest amount compared to the overall needs \nthere are across the country. Yet it is a good beginning. 9/11 taught \nus many lessons about what we need to better protect our homeland, and \none clearly was improve the ability of our first responders to talk to \none another.\n  I know none of us will ever forget \n9/11/01, that day we watched live on television as the extraordinarily \nbrave New York City police, firefighters, and other emergency personnel \nraced into the doomed buildings trying to save lives, many of them not \nactually on duty but knowing a crisis had occurred, running to help \ntheir fellow citizens, to help their fellow first responders.\n  But as we watched, we could not see what was happening inside the \nbuilding where another tragedy was occurring. Inside the World Trade \nCenter buildings, the uncommon heroism of the first responders was \nrunning into unnecessary chaos. The incredible bravery of those men and \nwomen was running into avoidable confusion, all of it caused by their \ninability to talk to one another on the communications systems they \nhad.\n  One fire chief told the 9/11 Commission:\n\n       People watching on TV that day certainly had more knowledge \n     of what was happening 100 floors above us than we did in the \n     lobby of that building.\n\n  The sad, tragic fact is we know that this failure of interoperability \nof communications cost lives, too many lives. There were other \ncommunications breakdowns that day that hampered the response efforts \nat the Pentagon and in Shanksville, PA. Then, as Senator Collins said, \nduring Hurricane Katrina, and the gulf coast, we saw a problem of \ncommunications that went beyond interoperability; it was the failure to \noperate in that crisis.\n  Phone lines, cell towers, and electrical systems were destroyed by \nthe storms, making it nearly impossible at times for many first \nresponders and\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\ngovernment officials on the gulf coast to talk to each other, to get \nthe public assistance, to rescue people in danger. This massive failure \nwas so bad that some emergency officials on the gulf coast were forced \nto resort to runners to communicate with their first responders in the \nfield.\n  Think of that. Here we are in the 21st century, and this great \nAmerican Nation that has spawned a revolution in global communications \ntechnologies, where in a catastrophic crisis, our first responders, \nwhose duty it is to protect us, had to resort to communications \ntechniques that we thought we had left behind on the battlefields of \nthe Civil War, and that was to resort to runners.\n  This amendment would provide the $100 million for this emergency \ngrant program created in the 9/11 bill. The funding would come from a \nsmall, across-the-board cut in all other Department of Homeland \nSecurity programs. That is the only way we can think fairly to do it. \nIt is real small, about a quarter of 1 percent of the DHS budget, to be \nexact 0.27 percent, a small amount to shift into a program that is \nnecessary to save lives when disaster strikes.\n  It is important to note that these funds will be provided to States \nonly after the Office of Emergency Communications in the Department of \nHomeland Security has approved statewide interoperability \ncommunications plans so we are not just going to have city A or fire \ndepartment B or ambulance company C apply and get their own grants. You \nhave to be part of a plan in every State.\n  I note again the $400 million in dedicated funding for this program \nthat was provided for in the Senate-passed and House-passed budget \nresolution earlier this year in anticipation of this new program. \nPerhaps because the 9/11 bill that has just been completed in \nconference was not finished when the Appropriations Committee met to \nadopt this Homeland Security appropriations bill, the committee did not \ninclude any funding for interoperability communications.\n  House appropriators did include $50 million to start the program. Now \nthe Senate must do its part.\n  We owe it to our first responders, the men and women whose duty it is \nto protect us and all the people they protect in cities and towns \nacross the Nation, to help them create the kinds of communications \nsystems that will enable them to talk to each other in crisis so they \ncan react swiftly, efficiently, and effectively when the alarm bell \nrings and duty calls them to respond.\n  At the appropriate moment, when it is possible to do so, Senator \nCollins and I will introduce an amendment to achieve the purposes I \nhave stated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves \nthe floor, I appreciate his leadership on the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations conference report and the bill generally and, of \ncourse, the work he has done on the other conference report, the only \ntwo we have had to speak of, on ethics and lobbying reform. He has been \nessential to moving these things along. We have approached these two \nmeasures on a very bipartisan basis which is, I am confident, the \nreason we were able to get them to the floor. The work of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has been exemplary.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I wish a number of things. One of the things I wish is that \nwe could legislate the way I remember the Senate legislating. There \nhave been editorials written, there was a cartoon this morning in the \nWashington Post, about all the many filibusters led by Republicans. We \ncame to our first appropriations bill. We have two individuals who are \nhistoric in their knowledge of the Senate, Senator Byrd and Senator \nCochran. I have lamented with my friend from Mississippi on a number of \noccasions how we would like to follow regular order. We try to do that \nas much as we can.\n  There are a number of ways to kill legislation. One is to get on the \nfloor and talk forever. That is the old-fashioned filibuster. The other \nway is to do it by diversion, other ways. That is what we have before \nus today. We have here a bill dealing with Homeland Security. We all \nknow border security is important, and we know the underlying bill is \n$2.3 billion more than the President requested, most of that money \ngoing directly to border security--3,000 new detention beds, 3,000 new \nBorder Patrol agents. It is a good bill. But my friends who want to not \nhave this bill have now done what would seem almost impossible: They \nwant to relegislate immigration. We have spent about a month on \nimmigration this year, about a month last year, far more than any other \nissue.\n  Now we have pending before us an amendment, the Graham amendment, \nthat in effect relegislates immigration.\n  Of course, there is a piece in there for border security. We all \nsupport that. But there are also pieces in that that take away basic \nrights people have, people who are American citizens. So it is \nunfortunate we are at this juncture.\n  I have no alternative, and I have thought of everything I could think \nof to try to avoid this collision. It is my understanding the Graham \namendment is pending; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Graham amendment is pending.\n  Mr. REID. The Graham amendment is in violation of Senate rules. It is \nlegislating on an appropriations bill. I raise that as a point of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry initially: Is the second-degree \namendment the pending amendment or is the Graham amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both amendments are pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the majority leader's motion to both amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order goes to the underlying \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is a point of order that this is legislating, this is \nthe rule XVI point of order; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I raise the defense of germaneness with respect to the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware of an arguably \nlegislative provision in the House bill, H.R. 2638, to which amendment \nNo. 2412, offered by the Senator from South Carolina, could conceivably \nbe germane.\n  Mr. GREGG. So the amendment is germane?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair does not believe that the defense of \ngermaneness is appropriately placed at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I disagree with the ruling of the Chair \nand, therefore, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I know we are not in debate, but I wanted to inform \nSenators, there has been an evacuation order issued on the Hart and \nDirksen buildings. We are going to go ahead and start the vote, but \nwhen the buildings allow the Senators to come, we will make sure they \nhave an opportunity to vote. We are not going to cut anybody off \nbecause they are locked in a building someplace.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like 3 minutes to quickly point out where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. When you finish, I won't need as much time as you. I will \ntake 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. So our colleagues understand the lay of the land, because \nit is a fairly complicated parliamentary situation, the Graham \namendment, which increases funding for Border Patrol by $3 billion, I \nwould point out that the majority leader, I believe, misspoke when he \nsaid the extra $2.2 billion in this bill went to border security. The \nextra $2.2 billion in this bill, the majority of it exceeds the \nPresident's request\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nin the area of first responders, and that is why we did not move that \nmoney out of the first responders to fund this. This is in addition to \nthe funding in this bill to fully fund 23,000 Border Patrol agents, \n45,000 detention beds, the virtual fence, the hard fence, and to make \nsure there are enough ICE enforcement officers. So it is a major \ninitiative in the funding area.\n  There is also authorizing language in here. It is the authorizing \nlanguage which I guess the majority leader has the most concerns about. \nBut that is the underlying bill. The question before the body is, as I \nunderstand it, the underlying bill, probably because the authorizing \nlanguage may not be germane. This will be a vote basically on the \nissue, in my opinion, of whether you want to increase funding for \nborder security by $3 billion, fully funding what is necessary in order \nto make the border secure, including undertaking specific authorizing \nlanguage which we think is important in order to give the Border Patrol \nand ICE agents the necessary tools they need in order to remove people \nfrom this country who have come to this country illegally or have done \nillegal acts while they are here. This is essentially a vote on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have expressed my affection for my friend \nfrom New Hampshire on many occasions. He is a wonderful Senator. I am \nvery aware of his great record of public service--Congressman, \nGovernor, Senator. But the statement he made is wrong. This is not a \nvote on immigration. This vote we are going to take today, if the Chair \nis overturned, will set a precedent for all future appropriations \nbills, all of them, lowering, if not eliminating, the legislation on \nappropriations threshold. So this will mean any appropriations bill \nthat comes through here, you can put anything on it. Some of us will \nremember--I know Senator Cochran will remember--I raised a point of \norder against something that Senator Helms did, and it was one of the \nbiggest mistakes I made because we overruled the Chair. It took years \nfor us on a bipartisan basis to go back to where we were.\n  On appropriations bills, you will be able to put in an appropriations \nbill anything you want. We will get back to the days of appropriations \nbills just putting anything you want in them. One of the good things \nabout the appropriations process is you should not be able to legislate \non an appropriations bill. That is what this is all about.\n  I also say to my friend from New Hampshire and all those people who \nbelieve this is a way to vote on immigration, it is not. It will lower \nthe standards here in the Senate significantly. I would say, the \nfunding aspect, none of us have any problem with that. We agree. That \nis one of the things I said publicly, that I appreciated the President \nwhen we had our immigration debate. He provided money that was \nemergency, direct funding of $4.4 billion for the border. I supported \nthat. It allowed us to pick up more votes. It was a very important \nthing. I applauded the President for having done that. I told the \nPresident after that legislation fell through how much I appreciated \nhis leadership.\n  But we need some leadership. This is going to lower the standards of \nthe appropriations process and the Senate. We accept the funding \nmeasure. We would agree right now. Do it by unanimous consent. We agree \nto that. Then let's have the immigration debate some other time. We \nhave spent 2 months on it already. Isn't that enough?\n  Mr. President, I want all Senators to know, Democrats and \nRepublicans, if the Chair is overturned, this will set a precedent for \nall future appropriations bills, lowering, most likely eliminating, the \nlegislating on appropriations threshold. We should not go down that \nroad. I want to pass some of these appropriations bills. We want to get \nthings done. Is this the picture we are going to have?\n  I will use leader time at this time. I came here this morning. I felt \nso good because we passed by unanimous consent the Wounded Warrior \nlegislation. The distinguished Republican leader said: Well, why don't \nyou add to that the pay raise for the troops? I said: It is OK, we will \ndo that. I walked out of here--if I had some muscles, Mr. President, I \nwould flex them because we really did well this morning. But the fact \nis, this afternoon we are back in the bog trying to claw through \nlegislation we should not have to.\n\n  We have filed cloture 45 times this year. Why? For this bill we have \nnow on the Senate floor, Homeland Security appropriations, we had to \nfile cloture on a motion to proceed to it. That is hard to comprehend, \nbut we did. We had to file cloture.\n  I do not want to file cloture on this bill because the first thing \nthat would happen is people would come and say: I have not had a chance \nto vote on an amendment.\n  So I don't want to file cloture on this bill. I want people to have \nthe opportunity to offer amendments and vote on them. But let's try to \nstay within the rules. This is legislating on an appropriations bill.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle want to overrule the \nChair, that is really too bad and that will go into part of the writing \nwhere people will talk about how this Republican minority--I understand \nour majority is pretty thin: 50 to 49. Come September, it will be 51 to \n49. That is pretty close. So it is not an issue where we are bulling \nour way over and through everybody. Every vote we take here is close. \nBut this is not the way to go.\n  This may make everybody happy, but then there will be no \nappropriations bills. We will just do a big omnibus at the end of the \nyear and do away with the appropriations process because now it does \nnot matter what bill we bring up--we can bring up the Veterans' \nAdministration, the VA, Military Construction appropriations bill, and \nwith that, we can put anything in that we want that does not have \nanything to do with the purview and the scope of that bill. That is \nwhat people are getting into here. It is a shame.\n  Mr. President, I ask the vote be started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the \njudgment of the Senate?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 277 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Brownback\n     Clinton\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate sustains the decision of the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the vote turning out the way it \ndid. First of all, I want the record to clearly reflect that the author \nof this legislation, my friend from South Carolina,\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\nLindsay Graham, offered it because he thought it was the right thing to \ndo. He has very strong feelings about a lot of issues and he expresses \nthem. One of those he feels strongly about is the issue of immigration. \nHe offered this amendment in good faith, and I want everybody to know \nthat is how I feel.\n  Procedurally, though, sometimes here we get in the way of each other. \nIn fact, that is what has happened. What I would like to do is ask \nunanimous consent that the money portion--the portion of the Graham \namendment that funds border security for all the things he and Senator \nGregg laid out--that we accept that by unanimous consent.\n  My friend from New Hampshire wants to look at the legislation they \nhave. I am hopeful that sometime tonight I can offer that in the form \nof a unanimous consent request. I wish to make sure everybody on both \nsides has the opportunity to look at the legislation. In effect, I \nagain state simply it would give more money for border security. I will \nnot harp on this, other than to say we in Nevada have a tremendous \nproblem. We arrest illegals, and there is no place to put them. So they \nare let loose. This money would allow us to build more detention beds, \nhire more border security officers, and it will add the first part of \nthe legislation that is absolutely necessary--that we do something \nabout immigration. We always talk about border security wherever any of \nus go. But then there are other things that would not happen today with \nthis legislation.\n  Hopefully, within the next hour or so, when Senator Gregg has had a \nchance to look at that--and I will clear it with Senator Kennedy and \nothers--we can, by unanimous consent, pass that portion of the bill \ndealing with financing border security.\n  I yield the floor at this time and, again, express my appreciation \nfor the bipartisan vote that we had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are on the verge of an important \nbipartisan accomplishment to actually seriously begin to secure the \nborder. I thank Senator Graham for his amendment. I thank the majority \nleader for his willingness to pass that portion of it that clearly is \ndirected at border security.\n  I think once we have had an opportunity to actually read the \namendment, which Senator Gregg and his staff and Senator Graham and his \nstaff are doing, we will have an opportunity to do something important \nfor the country later tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not sending this up in the form of an \namendment. I want this to be placed in the Record to indicate what we \nwould like to have accepted by unanimous consent. If there is an \nagreement on both sides, we will propose the amendment together. This \nis not an amendment, but I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate an additional $3,000,000,000 to improve border \n                               security)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                  TITLE  BORDER SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS\n\n       For an additional amount for ``U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection, Salaries and Expenses'', $1,000,000,000, to hire, \n     train, support, and equip additional Border Patrol agents and \n     Customs and Border Protection Officers and for enforcement of \n     laws relating to border security, immigration, customs, and \n     agricultural inspections, and regulatory activities related \n     to plant and animal imports.\n       For an additional amount for ``U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and \n     Technology,'' $1,000,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended.\n       For an additional amount for ``U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection, Air and Marine Interdiction, Operations, \n     Maintenance, and Procurement'', $100,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended.\n       For an additional amount for ``U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection, Construction'', $150,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, for construction related to additional Border \n     Patrol personnel.\n       For an additional amount for ``U.S. Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement, Salaries and Expenses'', $700,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, to hire additional agents to \n     enforce immigration and customs laws, procure additional \n     detention beds, carry out detentions and removals, and \n     conduct investigations.\n       For an additional amount for ``Federal Law Enforcement \n     Training Center, Salaries and Expenses'', $25,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended, to train newly hired Border \n     Patrol agents and other immigration and customs personnel \n     funded in this amendment.\n       For an additional amount for ``Federal Law Enforcement \n     Training Center, Acquisitions, Construction, Improvement, and \n     Related Expenses'', $25,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended, to provide facilities to train the newly hired \n     Border Patrol agents and other immigration and customs \n     personnel funded in this amendment.\n       These amounts are designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I can ask the leader a question, as I \nunderstand it, we are going to try to work out an agreement on the \nfunding and the language which is behind the funding that didn't \nauthorize the language----\n  Mr. REID. That is directed at border security, yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is that the money that increases border agents from 23,000 \nup to 30,000 and increases the number of beds to 45,000 and covers the \nfence, the virtual fence, and the number that funds ICE?\n  Mr. REID. We will take a look at your language, and you can look at \nours, but the answer to your question is yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think we are all concerned that we get \nborder security right. The Graham amendment offered us that \nopportunity. It looks like we may get there tonight.\n  Let the Senate understand there is a Catch-22 to what we are doing. \nWhile Americans want their border security--my guess is what the \nmajority leader is proposing we adjust to will pass by the unanimous \nsupport of this Senate. The Catch-22 is that American agriculture is \nnow in crisis, in part because we have failed to pass an immigration \nbill that addresses their guest worker need problem and the border \ncloses and the human labor flow stops. We want it stopped. We want the \nillegal movement to stop, but we need a legal system tied to this to \nsolve a problem.\n  Last agricultural season, underemployed by 25 percent, $3 billion \nlost at the farm gate, the consumer picked up the bill. Then we \nstruggled mightily to solve the problem, and we could not. Now we are \nheading into another harvest season, with 35 percent underemployment, \nwith a projected $5 billion to $6 billion loss in American \nagriculture--fruit, vegetables, and nuts left hanging on the trees and \noranges rotting in the orange groves.\n  The Senator from California and I have said, please, help us a little \nbit and reinstate a guest worker program with border security; give us \na 5-year pilot temporary program to solve a near disastrous problem for \nAmerican agriculture. We fumble through and we cannot do it. So what \nare America's farmers doing--the ones who can afford to? They are \ntaking their capital and equipment and they are moving to Mexico and \nArgentina and Brazil and Chile. America's investment will move south of \nthe border.\n  Here we are now, 60 percent dependent on foreign oil to fuel our \ncars. Are we going to become 60 or 70 percent dependent on foreign \ncountries to produce our fruits and our vegetables? If this Senate \ncannot get it right within a decade, that is where we will be--maybe \neven less time than that.\n  So while we debate border security--and while we are all for it, and \nwhile I have been aggressive in moving legislation with Senator Byrd, \nstarting 2 years ago, to tighten our borders--always in my mind tied to \nthat was reform of the guest worker program and getting a workforce for \nAmerican agriculture that was legal, that was transparent, that came \nand worked and went home. But we can't do that. We would not do it. We \nrefuse to do it because of grounds of political intimidation.\n  Shame on us if we destroy American agriculture because we cannot get \nit right. So the Senator from California and I are left with no \nalternative. Do we object to unanimous consent to secure the border? Of \ncourse we would not. We cannot and we should not. But we will ask this \nSenate to vote time and time again and either say you are for American \nagriculture or you are against it.\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\n  Therein lies the question this Senate has yet to answer, and they \nmust answer if we are to supply America with its fresh fruits and \nvegetables and the kind of abundant food supply that we have grown use \nto--but more important that we expect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, I thank the Senator from Idaho for those \ncomments. He is absolutely right in what is happening. It is happening \nto a great extent as well in California. Referring to this chart, I \nwish to show the Senate what has happened. Agriculture is moving to \nBaja, Mexicali, and the Nogales regions--more than 20,750 acres of \nagriculture have moved from the United States to this area here and \nmore than 8,600 employees have moved to this area in Mexico. Over here, \nmore than 25,350 acres have moved to the center of Mexico, with more \nthan 2,460 employees.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator deserves to be heard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague from California for this. I \nspeak on her behalf as well. Agriculture is in crisis. We have a $34 \nbillion industry. Labor is down by as much as 30 percent. What is \nhappening is farmers are renting land in Mexico. They don't want us to \nknow that. It is difficult to get these figures, but we got them, and \nthis is what is happening. Now, what will happen to the land in \nCalifornia, Idaho, Washington, and in other places? It will lie fallow. \nFarmers will soon decide they would rather farm in Mexico, with fewer \nrestrictions on pesticides and lower phytosanitary standards. Their \nland will be sold for development and we will lose our farmland in this \nNation.\n  The catastrophe, the crisis, is now. The harvest system is coming up \nnow. What Senator Boxer, Senator Craig, and many others ask is please \npass this 5-year pilot program and enable people who have worked in \nagriculture, who will continue to work in agriculture, to be able to do \nso legally. Reform the H2-A program so it functions for the rest of us.\n  The fact of the matter is, 90 percent of agriculture is undocumented \nlabor. Why doesn't the Senate recognize that? Why doesn't the Senate \nrecognize you cannot get Americans to do this work?\n  Why do we want to drown American agriculture? Why do we want to send \nit over the border?\n  What Senator Craig, Senator Boxer, and I are saying is, with this \nmoney, you take away our leverage to get this bill done, unless we can \nhave some kind of commitment that we can do this bill as a stand-alone \nbill or move it on another bill. We ought to just face that right now, \nthat Senator Craig and I would like to have a commitment that we can \nput this bill on another bill, or move it as a stand-alone bill without \namendments, and hopefully get it passed so agriculture in America can \nharvest their crops this fall. We ought to have a discussion because \nthis money we all would like to do, no question about it. We all want \nborder security. We all want to fund border security.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Feinstein. She and I have gone to the \nfarms. We have seen what is happening. We have seen the fruit just fall \nfrom the trees and wither when people are hungry. This is a ridiculous \nsituation.\n  The question I have for my friend is--it is rather rhetorical, given \nthe rules of the Senate--all of us have worked so hard for so many \nyears for the AgJOBS bill. Isn't it a fact that it has been years since \nHoward Berman in the House started this and we all got involved? And \nisn't it so that instead of being a contentious matter, AgJOBS has had \nstrong support, not only in the Senate but all over the country? Isn't \nit true that AgJOBS is supported not only by the owners of the ranches \nand the farms but also supported by all the unions and the labor \npeople? And isn't that a reason to pull together, to unite? Isn't it so \nthat it pulls together Republicans and Democrats?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. It \ndoes. It pulls together all of us. We believe we have 60 votes in this \nbody for AgJOBS because we believe there are 60 Senators at least who \nunderstand what the problem is, there is no question about it.\n  Senator Boxer has been on this issue for at least 7 years. Senator \nCraig, the Senator from Idaho, was the original sponsor of AgJOBS, \nalong with Senator Boxer and Senator Kennedy. That was 7 years ago. Is \nthat not correct, I ask the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Seven years ago. This bill is known by everybody in \nthis body, and everyone in this body should know there is a need. We \nbelieve we have the votes in the House to pass the bill as well if it \nis a stand-alone bill, a 5-year pilot that enables farmers to hire \nworkers.\n  Let me say one other thing. There is a myth out there that anybody \ncan do agricultural labor. If you stand by a freeway and watch people \npick lettuce, you will see precision movements, you will see an \norganized crew, you will see they are trained in how to do it, and you \nwill also see it is backbreaking labor that Americans will not do.\n  There is no industry in the United States that faces the crisis \nagriculture does right now, I say to Senator Boxer. She knows that. I \nknow that. We know what is happening to our farms and growers. Whether \nthey operate 50,000 acres or 50 acres, it is the same problem. It \ntakes, in California, 40,000 workers to harvest grapes. They are grown \nin four counties. It takes 40,000 workers to harvest 1 crop.\n  Does the Senator from Texas want me to yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. Madam President, I was going to ask if the \nSenator from California will yield because I do think there is a \nbipartisan consensus that we need to address AgJOBS. We need to have a \ntemporary worker program going forward that fills the need for the \neconomy of our country to continue to thrive.\n  I know the Senator from California has worked for years on this \nissue, as has the Senator from Idaho. I hope we can have a freestanding \nbill that would encompass agricultural workers and other temporary \nworkers, such as food processors.\n  I was visited this week by a food processor who very much wanted \ncomprehensive immigration reform and worked very hard for it. He is \ntrying to do the right thing. But he is very concerned about the \nbusiness being able to do the job it needs to do to get its product out \non the market. I think we are going to have an employer crisis in this \ncountry if we don't have a legal way for people to hire workers for \njobs that are otherwise going unfilled.\n  I commend the Senator from California, the Senator from Idaho, and \nthe Senator from Georgia who is on the floor as well who has worked for \nAgJOBS. We need a temporary worker program that, going forward, \nprovides for our economic basis. I hope we can have a freestanding bill \nthat will be amendable so that we can do that part of comprehensive \nreform.\n  I believe 90 percent of the people in this body want border security, \nwhich we may be able to achieve tonight, and the majority leader and \nthe minority leader have begun to get an agreement on that issue. Plus, \nI believe there is 90 percent agreement on a temporary worker program \nand taking care of the agricultural businesses. I hope those who are \nsaying immigration reform is dead are wrong in that we can do certain \nparts of it where there is an overwhelming consensus in this body.\n\n  I thank the Senator from California for bringing this issue up and \nsticking to it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Speaking through the Chair to the Senator from \nTexas--I see the majority leader is going to say something. Madam \nPresident, is he going to make us an offer?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I may say a few words so people know \nwhat the schedule is, first of all, this may surprise people, but we \ncare about agricultural jobs in America. Where most people see the \nbright lights of Las Vegas and Reno, we specialize in garlic and white \nonions. We have tremendous need for agricultural workers, and they are \nhard to get in central Nevada. So I personally am in favor of the \nAgJOBS\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\nbill. It is something that I know I have spoken with the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig, about on many occasions and the Senator from \nCalifornia on more occasions than she and I could ever calculate.\n  I am committed to doing something about AgJOBS. I hope we can do \nsomething soon. One of the bills we have to do in September is the farm \nbill. We have to do it. It has been 5 years. We have to renew it. Part \nof that has to be AgJOBS. If we can figure out a way to do it as \nfreestanding legislation, I am willing to do that. I want all those who \nare concerned about AgJOBS to know that I am on their side. I will do \nwhatever I can to help expedite this legislation.\n  I will also say, getting back to the Homeland Security legislation, I \nhave conferred with the managers of this bill, Senator Murray, Senator \nCochran, and Senator Byrd. It seems to me it would be in everyone's \nbest interest not to have any more votes tonight. If there is something \nthe managers can work out by voice vote, then we should certainly do \nthat.\n  What I think we should do tonight is, if people have amendments to \noffer on this very important piece of legislation, do it. Tomorrow is \nThursday. I remind everyone, we still have a lot to do. I spoke with \nSenator Inouye. I believe he was the last one to sign the conference \nreport on the 9/11 recommendations. That will be done. We should have \nsomething on ethics and lobbying reform. SCHIP, we have to be on that \nlegislation next week. We have to finish this bill.\n  Even though there have been a lot of starts and stops today, we have \nhad some progress.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. In 1 second, I will.\n  Unless the two managers have some objection, I would hope we could \nhave people offer amendments tonight. If their amendments requires \nvotes, we will set those for as early in the morning as we can. It \nwould be wonderful if we could finish this bill tomorrow. As I said \nearly on, I don't want to file cloture on this bill. I don't want to. \nThis is the first appropriations bill. We have to set an example of \ntrying to move forward.\n  I have just been notified that I am asked to go to the White House \nwith the Speaker on Wednesday to talk about appropriations bills. This \nwould be something really important to talk to him about on Wednesday, \nand we may be able to get one of them done.\n  Unless somebody has an objection to my suggestion, I think we will \nhave no more votes tonight.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe I had the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I didn't want to take the floor away from the Senator from \nCalifornia. I wanted to let people know what we were doing here.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, through the Chair to the majority leader, \nmy interest was piqued in what the majority leader had to say. My \nquestion is, Would the majority leader be prepared to give Senator \nBoxer, Senator Craig, Senator Hutchison, and me a commitment that \nperhaps the majority leader and the minority leader could sit down and \nagree to allow a vote on AgJOBS as part of the farm bill without \namendments, or some version of AgJOBS?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend, I am happy to make \nthat commitment. I will do everything I can to make sure it is part of \nthe farm bill. I will do what I can. I will talk with Senator Harkin. I \nwill talk with Senator Chambliss, who is on the floor. I am sure he is \nin favor. I ask through the Chair, is the Senator from Georgia in favor \nof the temporary worker program for agricultural workers?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I will respond this way: Obviously, I \nam in favor of a temporary worker program for agriculture. We have one \nnow. Senator Craig, Senator Feinstein, and I worked diligently to try \nto come to some accord on H-2A reform, but I have to tell the majority \nleader, we have never been able to reach that accord, and there are \nsome issues that are going to require some major amending before we \nwill be agreeable to bringing that bill up on the farm bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Georgia \nbeing so candid.\n\n  I say to the Senator from California, Senator Chambliss obviously is \nnot in agreement with her. I will make a commitment without any \nqualification that I will do whatever I can to make sure that is part \nof the farm bill. I will talk with Senator Harkin, that is sure, the \nchairman of the committee. It is important we do this, and the Senator \nfrom California has my commitment--all four Senators--to do whatever I \ncan. If it is not impossible, we may try to work something else out. \nRather than have it part of the farm bill, we may try to do something \nfreestanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield further? I wish to tell my friends \nthat I have discussed this with Senator Harkin. We had a meeting in my \noffice about California priorities. I talked with him about how much \nSenator Feinstein and I would like this bill. I think he is very open. \nI am sorry the Senator from Georgia does not feel as we do about it, \nbut I think we have a good chance of getting it in the farm bill, or at \nleast getting a version of it and, if not, getting it done \nfreestanding.\n  It is at a crisis point. Senator Feinstein has shown us that we are \nlosing our people, we are losing farms, we are losing workers, we are \nlosing whole economies, and it is just the start. Seven years ago, we \nknew this was going to happen. It is time to act.\n  I appreciate Senator Reid's commitments, and this is a man of his \nword. I hope we can all work with Senator Reid and also Senator \nMcConnell to bypass some of the negativity we have heard tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, also, Senator Chambliss is a reasonable \nman. You never know, he might wake up some morning and say maybe we \nshould help those onion farmers out in Nevada.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the majority leader yield for a question? First \nof all, I would love to invite the majority leader to Georgia to eat \nsome really good Vidalia onions, and I look forward to trying some of \nhis.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I hope it doesn't violate any of the \nethics rules, but somebody sent me a box of onions, and my wife and I \nate all we could and we gave some to our daughter. They were really \nquite good.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That was Senator Isakson. We are glad you enjoyed \nthem. My friend from California knows we have been trying to resolve \nthis issue not for weeks and months but for years. We have been working \non this issue. We have some major differences, as we have discussed. We \nhad hoped to have an immigration reform bill on which we could resolve \nthis issue. We moved a long ways in that direction.\n  Madam President, I would like to ask my friend from California a \nquestion.\n  As you know, I agree with everything you said, everything Senator \nCraig said about the dire straits in agriculture. We have a huge labor \nproblem, and we are in need, in California, in Idaho, in Georgia, and \nin every part of the country, for agricultural labor to harvest our \ncrops as we move toward the harvest season. The problem with the AgJOBS \nbill has always been it has an amnesty provision in it. It is called \nearned adjustment. That has been the major issue.\n  Does the Senator intend to include that earned adjustment provision \nin the 5-year pilot program that the Senator is talking about offering \nnow?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, through the Chair to the Senator from \nGeorgia, what we have said is, a version of the AgJOBS bill.\n  The AgJOBS bill was negotiated over 7 years between the growers and \nthe United Farm Workers Union and others. So it is a negotiated \nproduct. I actually thought that we had satisfied the Senator's \nconcerns in many of our discussions. I am trying to recall, but I \nbelieve there were at least three areas where we made some changes \nspecifically because of the Senator's concerns in the discussions that \nwe had.\n  So I thought we had agreement on the H-2A part of the bill, which I \nbelieve was your interest, in return for which, with respect to the \nearned adjustment part of the bill, I would be happy to discuss this \nwith you more. But the bill is based on, if a worker has worked in \nagriculture, he or she can submit documentation to that effect, for so \nmany hours over so many years, that individual can get what we call a\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\nblue card in the original bill and continue to work in agriculture for \na substantial additional period. If they satisfied the hours, the \nfiling, the taxes, and everything required of them, then they could \napply after that period for a green card. That is as far as our bill \nwent, the original bill.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, if I can again ask the Senator a \nquestion. That has been the problem area.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thought the problem area was citizenship.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is a pathway to citizenship, giving them priority \non getting the green card.\n  But let me say to the Senator from California, I think the fact that \nwe all recognize there is a problem and that we all want to get to the \nend which is a viable program that will allow all our farmers access to \na quality pool of people who are here in a legal capacity under a valid \ntemporary worker program, as long as it is truly a temporary worker \nprogram, and that those individuals are required to go back home at the \ntime their job is completed--then we don't have an argument.\n  But as long as you continue to give them a pathway to citizenship, it \nis going to be a problem. We have just had that debate. So I would say \nthis: I would hope between Senator Craig, Senator Feinstein, myself, \nand others who are interested, that if we could come up with an AgJOBS-\nlike, that would truly be a like version of AgJOBS, then perhaps that \nis a way that we could work our way through this year. It is going to \ntake some time to get that done, and we don't have much time. Time is \ngetting short. Here we are at the end of July almost, and harvest \nseason is upon us.\n  If we could come up with some agreement to get us through this year, \nto give us time, maybe, to work out in the long run a more permanent \nprogram that does not include that pathway to citizenship, I would be \nin agreement with the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might, through the Chair to the Senator from \nGeorgia, I would like to make one point.\n  I understand your concern is with the H-2A part of the bill. The \nother part of the bill is for different States because what happens in \nmy State is, these crews work different produce. They go from one \nharvest to another to another to another because the harvests are \nstaged at different times. So the bill has two component parts to it.\n  Of course, we are willing to talk. We are happy to sit down and talk. \nBut we tried to do that with you, as you know, and I thought we had a \nproduct that we agreed to.\n  My understanding is the Senator from Idaho would like to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I would like, for a moment, to react to \nthe Senator from Georgia. It is oftentimes confused that AgJOBS was two \nbills that were merged together--two problems solved. One was to create \na new, modern, guest worker--or I should say flexible guest worker \nprogram that fits the needs of American agriculture. That was over \nhere. We reformed the H-2A program. But over here was, what do you do \nwith 1.2 million illegals who are here and are now working in \nagriculture and have been here for 4 or 5 years? That was the other \nside of it.\n  We said: If you stayed here and worked and became legal and met these \nqualifications, there would be something at the end of the road because \nwe believe if you don't do that, if you say: Oh, yeah, you can stay and \nyou can work, but you have to stay in agriculture to do so--specific to \nagriculture--you have created indentured servitude. You and I do not \nwant that, nor do we want to be accused of that in any respect.\n  So we have to look at the two realities. The two realities are an H-\n2A program that does not meet the need of American agriculture today \nand a current workforce that is here and illegal.\n  How you bring legality to that workforce that is here and is illegal \nremains the question on which we differ. I think we have come awfully \nclose to agreeing on a new guest worker program. And in that, the \nSenator from Georgia is right: It is very clear: They come, they work, \nthey go home. That is a true guest worker program. Now, that is not \ntoday, that is tomorrow. Today is how do you meet the needs and solve \nthe illegality problem of those currently here? Therein lies our \nstruggle.\n  Somehow we have to be able to fix that and require compliance and not \nbe accused or meet the test of not producing indentured servitude by \nsaying the only way you can become legal is to stay in agriculture. \nThat is not very fair either. So I guess they all have to go home. Some \nwould like that, too.\n  You and I will never escape the definition of amnesty because anytime \nwe touch an illegal and give them anything, we will be accused by the \nanti-immigration forces in this country of having morphed a new form of \namnesty. At the same time, they are forcing us to refuse dealing with \nthe real problem and solving it, or at least they are forcing some to \nrun for cover in search of something that is impossible, and that is \nzero amnesty. You can't get there. I don't believe it is possible.\n  If you touch an illegal in any way, and in any way give them \nsomething that offers them some stability in the current environment, \ntomorrow morning Lou Dobbs will say: Amnesty. And it is a new creation \nhe thought of overnight while in one of his 1932 labor dreams.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, let me finally say to the Senator \nfrom California, again, we agree there is a problem. I think at the end \nof the day we agree what we want to do is give your farmers, my \nfarmers, Texas farmers, and all farmers and ranchers the ability to \nhave that quality pool of labor. And if there is a way to get there \nthat is truly a means by which those workers who are here are \ntemporary, I think that is going to be the key. Hopefully, we will \ncontinue the dialogue to see if we can't work something out.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may respond through the Chair to the Senator \nfrom Georgia, we had hoped, I say to the Senator, that we had worked it \nout. We believe there are 60 votes for the bill. We are happy, all of \nus--those of us who have worked on this bill--to sit down with you and \ngo over it again and hopefully have something for the September farm \nbill. I think it is important.\n  The problem with waiting until September is part of the harvest is \nover, and we have lost a crop. I cannot tell you how much is going to \nbe on the ground come September, but I can tell you in my State it is \ngoing to be a substantial amount. I worry about land lying fallow and \nthen being sold by farmers for development and the loss of rich, great \nAmerican farmland. I don't think that is what either one of us want.\n  We will try to work with you, Senator Boxer, Senator Craig and I, \nand, hopefully, we will be able to come up with something by September.\n  So I thank the Senator and the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2468 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2468.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense \nwith the reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To state the policy of the United States Government on the \nforemost objective of the United States in the Global War on Terror and \nin protecting the United States Homeland and to appropriate additional \n                         sums for that purpose)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       Sec. 536. (a) Policy of the United States.--It shall be the \n     policy of the United States Government that the foremost \n     objective of the United States in the Global War on Terror \n     and in protecting the United States Homeland is to capture or \n     kill Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and other members of \n     al Qaeda and to destroy the al Qaeda network.\n       (b) Funding.--\n       (1) Additional amount for counterterrorist operations.--\n     There is hereby appropriated for the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, $25,000,000.\n       (2) Emergency requiremen6t.--The amount appropriated by \n     paragraph (1) is hereby designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 204 of S.Con.Res.21 (110th \n     Congress).\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, the underlying bill that Chairman\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\nByrd and Ranking Member Cochran have put together is really good work. \nAs a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am pleased to have \nworked on this bill. Senator Murray has provided some extraordinary \nleadership to add to this appropriations bill some resources to match \nthe words that come out of this Capitol about securing our ports, \nsecuring our rail, and stepping up additional resources for our \nairports.\n  This underlying bill, the Homeland Security appropriations bill, \nreflects this goal and objective. For the most part, it meets it in a \nsubstantial way. But I would like to remind all of us here, my \ncolleagues, though it is hard to remember or to put in perspective, but \na few years ago, just over 5, we didn't have a Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. Until Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida established a \nnetwork and put 19-plus men on planes that took out buildings in New \nYork, a section of the Pentagon here in Washington, and crashed into a \nfield in Pennsylvania, this department didn't even exist.\n  This department has been put together to try to help this country \nstand up against a great and growing threat--a great and growing \nthreat. Unfortunately, according to the latest intelligence report--and \nI have the unclassified summary--this is not a diminishing threat. One \nwould think that, after the money we have spent prosecuting the war, \nthe diplomacy, and all the other things we are doing, this report would \nsay that al-Qaida is weakened. But it doesn't say that. It says al-\nQaida is strengthening. Of course, we know that Osama bin Laden is \nstill on the loose.\n  So I come to the floor to offer an amendment to the Homeland Security \nbill to try to refocus our attention on how this whole thing got \nstarted. It all got started by a guy named Osama bin Laden and the al-\nQaida network. My amendment says it should be the policy of the United \nStates to refocus our efforts to find him, to destroy him, and to focus \non the al-Qaida network wherever it is found.\n  There are pieces of it in Iraq, I am not going to debate that here. \nBut there are pieces of al-Qaida that are still focused, according to \nthis National Intelligence Estimate, right here in our homeland. So my \namendment is substantive in the sense that it simply restates, or \nstates for the first time but clearly, that it is the policy of the \nUnited States that the foremost objective of the global war on terror \nand protecting the homeland of the United States is to capture or kill \nOsama bin Laden and to destroy his network and other members of his \nnetwork. I understand this is not just the work of one person. It adds \n$25 million to the Central Intelligence Agency for that purpose. I know \nthere are other amounts of money that are being spent, and resources, \nsome readily obtainable and some that are classified. But there are \nadditional resources that need to be brought to bear on this and, most \nimportantly, a focus to help us remember how we got here in the first \nplace and what this Homeland Security bill should be doing, by \nprotecting our Nation and keeping focus on al-Qaida. That is the \nessence of my amendment.\n\n  I thank the leader for allowing me to offer it tonight. Anytime the \nSenate feels we can vote on this in accordance with the schedule will \nbe fine by me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I visited earlier with my colleague from Louisiana. I \nthink this is an awfully good amendment. It establishes a priority \nwhich should have been established long ago.\n  As you know, the President, when asked about Osama bin Laden, at one \npoint said, I don't care about Osama bin Laden. I don't care about \nOsama bin Laden. Now we have the National Intelligence Estimate that \nsays the greatest terrorist threat to this country is the leadership of \nal-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. If that is the case, it ought to be job \none to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. Eliminating the greatest \nterrorist threat to our country ought to be the most important goal. \nThat is what the Senator states in her amendment.\n  I spoke yesterday about this issue at some length, describing the \nkind of Byzantine position we are in with everyone telling us that here \nis the great threat to our country. Yet, on the other hand, we are \ngoing door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war with our \nsoldiers while there is what is called a safe harbor or secure haven \napparently in Pakistan or Afghanistan or somewhere on the border.\n  My point is there ought not be a square inch of safety anywhere, no \nsafe harbor, no secure hideaway anywhere on this planet for the \nleadership of al-Qaida.\n  I think this is a good amendment. I intend to offer the amendment \nthat I offered on the Defense authorization bill as well tomorrow. It \nwas passed unanimously and my hope is it will be accepted unanimously. \nSenator Conrad offered it, but the Defense authorization bill was \npulled. I intend to offer that amendment tomorrow, but my hope is the \nSenate will approve the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana \nbecause I think it advances this country's interest in defeating \nterrorism, and that is a very important goal.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. He has been a \nleader in helping us to stay focused by increasing the reward. We have \nto remember--I wish I had my poster but I don't, but this is what a \nsmall version of it looked like. I know the Chair may have a hard time \nseeing it, but this is what Osama bin Laden looks like. It is important \nfor us to continue to see his picture. He is on the FBI's ``Most \nWanted'' list. This was before he organized the attack against our \ncountry that has killed over 3,000 innocent civilians and, as we know, \nnow 4,000 of our soldiers, approximately, have lost their lives and \n38,000 to 40,000 wounded, trying to retaliate against this attack.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I intend to be a cosponsor of \nhis amendment. It is complementary to this one. Again, I offer it as I \nthink appropriate on this bill which lays out the resources to protect \nour homeland. Let's make sure those resources are used so there is a \nbig target on the back of this man Osama bin Laden and his very \ndangerous network that is still alive, unfortunately well, and \naccording to our own estimates growing as a threat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have spent this time wanting to get the \nlegislation passed dealing with border security. It would have been the \nGraham-Pryor amendment. We basically would have taken the amendment \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina, the first several pages of \nit, dealing with border security, the money part of it. My friend, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Texas, objects to that. That is \nunfortunate. He wants to add additional language to that. As I \nexplained to him, we have had many Senators want to add language.\n  But Senator Graham, he came to us after all the changes, the \nsuggested changes in the legislation, and he said: You take our bill as \nit is written. Now it was not easy to get that approved on our side, \nbut we did get it done. There is an objection now. I am sorry that \nthere will not be the money for border security, but that is the way it \nis. I regret that. I am sorry to have taken so much of the Senate's \ntime to do that. It is 7 o'clock at night. We are back to where we \nwere.\n  We will move forward. There are a number of amendments pending. My \nfriend Senator Alexander has waited around for a long time to offer his \namendment. My understanding is that Senator Vitter is here. Is he ready \nto go?\n  I apologize. I hope other Senators will come and offer amendments. We \nwill do our best to try to finish this bill tomorrow.\n  Is there anything my friend from Texas wishes to say in addition to \nwhat I have said?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I disagree with the characterization of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\ndistinguished majority leader. The objection to the proposed unanimous \nconsent was to only a portion of the original Graham amendment of which \nI was a cosponsor. It completely overlooked and ignored 45 percent of \nthe illegal immigration in this country caused by people who enter with \na visa that is legal but then they overstay. My suggestion to the \ndistinguished majority leader and other colleagues is that we not \nignore that 45 percent but, rather, include that as an acceptable \nexpenditure under current law for part of the $3 billion.\n  He has explained to me that there is objection on his side to \nincluding that 45 percent of illegal immigration as part of the \naccepted expenditures for this $3 billion. I am sure he has accurately \nreported what his conference or caucus has said. But my concern is that \nwe not spend money on the border security component and then pat \nourselves on the back and claim success when, indeed, the proposal \nwould have ignored 45 percent of the cause of illegal immigration. We \nneed an approach that will deal both with border security as well as \nthe interior enforcement caused by visa overstays.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say to my friend, I also think \nthis is a problem we should deal with. But I think the language as \nwritten in this legislation would allow that. I would be happy to join \nwith my friend in a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security. I \nwould be happy to meet with him when we get this done to tell him that \nthis legislation, in my opinion, and hopefully in the opinion of a \ndistinguished former member of the Texas Supreme Court, a great legal \nbackground, as we have propounded it would also allow this. We could \nmake a very good case to the executive branch of Government that that \nis so. I hope my friend would take that as an offer of good faith to \ntry to move this along.\n  I am convinced that if we pass what has been suggested by Graham and \nPryor--and the Senator from Texas knows this better than I do--this \ndoes cover the fact that the Department of Homeland Security certainly \nshould use some of this money to make sure we know where people are. It \nis absolutely wrong that we have people here who come on study visas \nand we lose track of them. That is one example. I know a significant \nnumber of Senators would agree. I think Secretary Chertoff would think \nthis is something he should do with part of that money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I welcome the opportunity always to work with the \ndistinguished majority leader on legislation, including this \nlegislation. But the fact is, the American people have lost confidence \nin the Federal Government when it comes to broken borders and our lack \nof enforcement of our immigration system. It is more appropriate that \nwe contain the requirements in the amendment itself and not in letters \nhe and I might write to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The fact is, the Department is not going to do anything \nunless we direct them to do so in legislation.\n  I regret the distinguished majority leader has to object to my \nrequest to include, in addition to border security, provisions saying \nthat the money could be spent for interior enforcement as well. If that \nis the way it is, that is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. It seems sometimes people like to have the issue rather \nthan solving the problem. This would have gone a long way toward easing \nthe friction on both sides toward problems with immigration. It hasn't. \nMy friend, I could say, will still have an issue to talk about. Maybe \nthat is more important to him than solving this problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thought we were getting along well until \nthat last comment by the majority leader. I want to solve this problem \ntoo. I think my record of involvement in the immigration and border \nsecurity issue has demonstrated that. I am not interested in scoring \npolitical points; I am interested in solving the problem. But I am \nsuggesting that the proposal by the majority leader will not solve the \nproblem. It solves 55 percent of the problem, not the remaining 45 \npercent.\n  I assure the distinguished majority leader that I am interested in a \nsolution. That is why I proposed that some of this money would be able \nto be allocated for interior enforcement, including the 632,000 \nabsconders, people under final orders of deportation who have simply \ngone underground or who have left the country and then reentered \nillegally, both of which are classified as felons under the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act. I would have thought that the majority leader \nwould think that an appropriate use for some of this $3 billion in this \namendment, to go after those felons, to make sure our laws are enforced \naccording to the letter of the law as written by Congress. I regret he \ndoes not see it the way I do. I guess that is where we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I visited with the managers about \nspeaking on some amendments.\n  The first amendment I am going to reference, I will just speak about \nit because it is still in Legislative Counsel, but we will have it \nshortly. That probably means tomorrow. But I wish to alert people to a \nproblem we have with Homeland Security that I would like to fix through \namendment. The amendment would restrict the Department of Homeland \nSecurity from using any funds appropriated in this bill for the \nenforcement of interim final chemical security regulations relating to \nthe stored quantity of propane gas between 7,500 pounds and 100,800 \npounds. I will put this in language that people, at least in rural \nAmerica, can understand.\n  We have a situation where you don't have natural gas, and that is on \nmost farms, a lot of small businesses, and small towns. Homes are \nheated with propane, 500-gallon tanks that are somewhere on the \nproperty, usually behind the house or, in the case of a farm, out by \nthe grain bins where you dry your corn or other grains using propane \ngas. Things of that nature are what I am talking about.\n  Let me be very clear; my amendment is limited and narrowly tailored \nin that it only limits use of funds for enforcing one listed chemical. \nThat one listed chemical is propane. Some people refer to it as LP gas, \nliquid propane gas--one and all the same.\n  It would allow the Department to use funds to enforce the regulation \nfor larger facilities, things that can honestly be said could be used \nfor terrorist activity, but not the propane tank behind some farmhouse \nor by some grain bin. This amendment is necessary to ensure that these \nregulations truly protect our homeland but not burden farmers and small \nbusinesses and create a bigger problem with regard to propane security \nthat I will mention in a minute.\n  This final rule was published by the Department of Homeland Security \non April 9, 2007, and became effective June 8 of this year. These \nregulations were required by Congress as part of the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill of 2007 and are known as the \nchemical facility antiterrorism standards. The regulations include an \nappendix that lists chemicals of interest to the Department and the \nstored quantities that will trigger reporting and screening \nrequirements for those who house the listed chemicals. Included in the \nlist of chemicals of interest is propane stored in quantities greater \nthan 7,500 pounds.\n  Propane is used by virtually every arm of agriculture, from small \nfamily farms to large agribusinesses across the country. Propane is \nused to dry grain, to heat facilities for livestocks and poultry, and \nto heat thousands of rural homes across the country. This listed \nquantity of 7,500 pounds is roughly 1,785 gallons.\n  For those who are not from rural America, the typical rural home has \nat least one thousand-gallon tank for heating and maybe has two or \nthree of these tanks for home heating and cooking, depending upon the \nsize of the home. Some family farms may have a home tank and multiple \nfarm tanks. Under the current regulation and thresholds, these rural \nhomes and farms would qualify as a chemical facility and would have to \ncomplete what is known as the ``top screen'' process to register the \nsite as a chemical facility. These are not homes in large metropolitan \nareas; they are rural homes where the nearest neighbors could be miles \naway. But under the current regulation, counting all tanks on one\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\nproperty, they would be subject to the screening requirements and also \nsubject to penalties if they failed to complete the screen.\n  Most people listening to me are probably saying: So what. If the \nDepartment lists the chemicals, these folks should register. Well, in \nits own regulatory analysis--I am quoting from the Department now--the \nDepartment calculates that the average cost to complete the top screen \nprocess will be between $2,300 and $3,500 per screen. That is not a lot \nof money to some large chemical facility, but to John Q. Public who \nowns three tanks on his farm to heat his home as well as to heat his \nsheds and barns and maybe dry grain, $2,300 to $3,500 is very real \nmoney.\n  Further, the top screen requires individuals to fill out a lengthy \nform that is highly detailed and may require help from attorneys to \nensure that the forms are filled out properly. Once this is completed, \nthe Department then makes a determination if the site will need to \ncomplete a security vulnerability assessment. If this assessment is \nnecessary, the Department then determines if a site needs a site \nsecurity plan for chemical security.\n  The bottom line is that many rural homes, farms, and small businesses \ncould be required to pay $2,300 to $3,500 as just a preliminary step to \ndetermine whether they are ``high risk'' for a terrorist attack. These \nlengthy forms, complex requirements, and high costs pose a harsh, undue \nburden upon rural America; hence my amendment and hence my begging for \nconsideration of this from my colleagues.\n  I also believe this regulation has a possibility of increasing \nthreats to our country as opposed to making it safer. As written, this \nrule and the current quantities of propane may lead many homeowners, \nfarmers, small businesspeople to limit how full they might keep their \nonsite storage tanks. For example, a home with multiple tanks may only \nfill a backup tank part of the way to stay under the threshold so they \ndo not have to fill out the top screen.\n\n  Now, as a result of that, that home, that small business, that farm \nmay have to increase the number of times its tanks are filled once or \ntwice during the winter months. This increase in the number of tank \nfills--because they are only going to be partially filled--means the \nnumber of trips propane trucks make is very much increased, leading to \nmore propane tankers per business and more propane tankers going down \nour highways.\n  Now, I ask all of you to consider, what is a more vulnerable threat \nto America, John Q. Public's family home in rural Iowa--or in any other \nState--or an increase in hundreds, maybe thousands, of extra propane \ntankers on America's highways and roads?\n  Now, I tried to solve this problem before this amendment. On June 25, \n2007, I sent a letter to Secretary Chertoff asking him to consider the \nimpact of including propane in quantities of 7,500 pounds in the \nregulations. I asked Secretary Chertoff to consider including an \nexemption for rural homes, farms, and small businesses that store and \nprovide propane in excess of 7,500 pounds. To date, I have only \nreceived a response saying the Department is ``giving careful \nconsideration'' to my letter.\n  Now, I appreciate the careful consideration being given to my letter, \nbut I wish to know what is being done to ensure there is no undue \nburden placed upon rural Americans and that these rules have the impact \nthat is intended. We all want to ensure our homeland is as safe as \npossible, but we need to do so without overburdening rural Americans \nand threatening the growth of a small business.\n  Further, as I pointed out, there is an additional possible safety \nconcern that may be a consequence of the regulation. As such, I will \noffer an amendment that would prohibit the use of any funds to the \nDepartment to enforce the current regulations for propane when the site \nof that propane has more than 7,500 pounds but less than 1,800 pounds, \nuntil it amends these regulations to provide an exemption for rural \nhomesteads, agricultural producers, and small business concerns.\n  Again, this amendment is narrowly tailored only toward propane and \ndoes not impact enforcement of the regulations for other listed toxic \nchemicals. Additionally, this amendment includes safety provisions to \nensure that if a threat is imminent to rural America, the Department \ncan inform Congress of such threat and continue with its current \nregulations. This amendment is necessary to ensure that Government \nregulations meet a commonsense test and do not unduly burden rural \nAmerica.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2444 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. President, I am now going to go to an amendment I do have written \nand would like to offer. I send amendment No. 2444 to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration. Mr. Inhofe should be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 2444 to amendment No. \n     2383.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds made available under this \nAct may be expended until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies \n to Congress that all new hires by the Department of Homeland Security \n are verified through the basic pilot program authorized under section \n401 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n  of 1996 or may be available to enter into a contract with a person, \n employer, or other entity that does not participate in the such basic \n                             pilot program)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 536.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be expended until the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     certifies to Congress that all new hires by the Department of \n     Homeland Security are verified through the basic pilot \n     program authorized under section 401 of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).\n       Sec. 537.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be available to enter into a contract with a person, \n     employer, or other entity that does not participate in the \n     basic pilot program authorized under section 401 of the \n     Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n     of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This amendment to this appropriations bill is to \nstrengthen our efforts to verify if people in the United States are \nlegal to work in this country.\n  Without a doubt, we have an illegal immigration problem. People are \ncrossing our borders each day to live and work in the United States. \nSome individuals may have innocent motives, some may not. Some may be \nliving in the shadows and wish to do our country harm.\n  We do not live in a pre-9/11 world anymore. We must do all we can to \nprotect our country. That is why I am proposing this amendment. It \nwould do two things very appropriate in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. It would require the entire Department of \nHomeland Security to use the basic pilot program--also known as the \nelectronic employment verification system.\n  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful for \nemployers to knowingly hire and employ aliens not eligible to work. It \nrequired employers to check the identity and work eligibility documents \nof all employees.\n  The easy availability of counterfeit documents has made a mockery of \nthe 1986 bill. Fake documents are produced by the millions and can be \nobtained very cheaply.\n  In response to the illegal hiring of immigrants, Congress created the \nbasic pilot program in 1996. This program allows employers to check the \nstatus of their workers by checking one's Social Security number and \nalien identification number against Social Security Administration and \nHomeland Security databases.\n  The immigration bill before the Senate last year and this year would \nhave required all employers to use the basic pilot program over a \nperiod of time by\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\nphasing it in. Both the administration and Congress were poised to pass \nlegislation mandating participation in this program. It has been argued \nthat the employment verification system is crucial to enforcing the \nlaws already on the books. Many say the system is a needed tool for \nemployers to check the eligibility of their workers.\n  Since 1996, the system has been updated, the system has been \nimproved. It is a Web-based program, and employers can go online \nquickly and very easily when hiring an individual. Employers in all 50 \nStates can use the program, and it is voluntary for the private sector. \nCurrently, over 18,000 employers use the basic pilot program.\n  Under current law, however, the Federal Government is supposed to be \nusing the employment verification system--emphasis upon ``current law'' \nand ``supposed to be using.'' We are talking about the Federal \nGovernment as an employer and whether we are setting a good example for \nthe private sector on checking whether people are legally in this \ncountry if they are going to work for us. Of the 18,000 users I have \nmentioned, Homeland Security says 403 Federal agencies are using this \npilot program. But my colleagues will be shocked to hear that very few \nof the 22 agencies at the Department--the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--are actually participating in this program.\n  I asked Secretary Chertoff in January of this very year about \nrequiring all agencies to use this system and extending the requirement \nto contractors who do business with the Federal Government.\n  The Department of Homeland Security responded by saying these 403 \nFederal agencies are participating in the basic pilot program. The \nDepartment said it was also on track to make sure all agencies were \nusing this system by the end of the fiscal year.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \nmy letter to the Secretary and the Department's response.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chertoff: Thank you for your time on Monday \n     to discuss the worksite enforcement actions against Swift & \n     Company. I appreciate the time you took to hear our concerns, \n     and discuss solutions to improve our efforts to reduce \n     identity theft by illegal aliens.\n       As I stated in our meeting, our government agencies must do \n     a better job of communicating with each other. That is why I \n     authored an amendment last year to the immigration bill that \n     would give your department access to taxpayer information \n     maintained by the Social Security Administration. I look \n     forward to pushing this measure into law.\n       Additionally, I want to reiterate my concerns about the \n     need for federal government agencies to use the basic pilot \n     program. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996 included a provision requiring \n     select entities to participate in the program. The law states \n     that ``Each Department of the Federal Government shall elect \n     to participate in a pilot program and shall comply with the \n     terms and conditions of such an election.'' I would like to \n     know how this law is being enforced, and how your department \n     is working to ensure compliance by all federal agencies.\n       Furthermore, I would like the Department's legal opinion \n     about the ability to require contractors and subcontractors \n     of the federal government to use the basic pilot program. \n     Last July, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \n     arrested nearly 60 illegal immigrants at Fort Bragg in North \n     Carolina. Last week, ICE arrested nearly 40 illegal \n     immigrants hired by contractors working on three military \n     bases (Fort Benning, Creech Air Force Base, and Quantico \n     Marine Base), one of which was reportedly a member of the \n     dangerous MS-13 gang. There are many similar stories of \n     illegal aliens being hired by contractors who work at \n     critical infrastructure sites throughout the United States. \n     Requiring those who do business with the federal government \n     should be held to the same standard as our executive \n     department agencies. I encourage you to take steps to ensure \n     that contractors are using the tools that we have provided, \n     and are participating in the department's electronic \n     employment verification system.\n       I appreciate your time and consideration of these views. I \n     look forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles E. Grassley\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n         Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, U.S. \n           Department of Homeland Security,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of Secretary Chertoff, \n     thank you for your letter regarding federal agencies and \n     government contractors using the Basic Pilot Employment \n     Verification Program (Basic Pilot).\n       Currently, there are 403 federal agencies that are \n     participating in the Basic Pilot. The majority of the federal \n     Basic Pilot participants are member offices of the \n     legislative branch, although there are several key executive \n     branch participants, such as the U.S. Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services headquarters office and components of \n     the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services, which oversees the Basic Pilot, is exploring \n     several approaches this fiscal year to use Basic Pilot to \n     verify all executive branch new hires. Also under \n     consideration is whether the Office of Personnel Management \n     (OPM) could conduct the verifications through the Basic Pilot \n     on behalf of all executive branch new hires or whether each \n     agency should individually conduct the verifications for its \n     own new hires. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \n     would be pleased to keep your staff apprised of the status of \n     this planning effort. DHS's goal is to ensure that all \n     executive branch new hires are verified through the Basic \n     Pilot by the end of FY 2007.\n       With respect to whether or not departmental contractors use \n     the Basic Pilot program, DHS is exploring options to \n     encourage contractor participation in the program.\n       I appreciate your interest in the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and I look forward to working with you on future \n     homeland security issues. If I may be of further assistance, \n     please contact the Office of Legislative and \n     Intergovernmental Affairs at (202) 447-5890.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Donald H. Kent, Jr.,\n                                              Assistant Secretary.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Since receiving the letter from Secretary Chertoff, \nthis is what I have found out: that this response--that 403 Federal \nagencies are using the program--was deliberately misleading. In fact, \ncongressional offices make up to 99 percent of the Federal users. Of \nthe 411 or more Federal Government users, 400 are congressional \noffices--136 in the Senate and 264 in the House.\n  So I am taking issue with the Department for their response to me and \nfeel this is deliberately misleading the Congress on the use of the \nbasic pilot program--when I get back a letter that says 403 Federal \nagencies are using the program, and 99 percent of them are here on \nCapitol Hill, not downtown.\n  According to staff at the Citizenship and Immigration Service, only \n11 executive branch agencies are using the program--only 11--and only 5 \nof the 22 agencies at Homeland Security are using the program--only 5.\n  The President visited a Dunkin' Donuts shop last year. The company \nannounced all of its franchises would use the basic pilot program to \nverify their workers. If Dunkin' Donuts can use the system, so can the \nFederal Government, particularly the Departments with the mission of \nprotecting the homeland.\n  We ought to be setting an example, the Federal Government, for all \nemployers. But within the Federal Government, the very department \nenforcing the law, suggesting it is being used, ought to set the \nexample.\n  I am ashamed to say the Department of Homeland Security--the most \nvaluable component of the executive branch in securing our Nation from \nterrorism--then is setting a very bad example.\n  Congress and the administration must be a model of good employment \npractices for the rest of the country. My amendment is needed to push \nexecutive branch participation in this program.\n  Now, there is a second part to my amendment. It would extend this \nprinciple to contractors who do work for the Federal Government. \nBecause the second part of the amendment would require all \ncontractors--in just the Department of Homeland Security--to use the \nbasic pilot program to check the eligibility of their workers.\n  Now, I think it ought to go beyond contractors for the Department of \nHomeland Security, but we are working on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill so I am limiting it to that. It is my opinion that \nthose who do business with Homeland Security agencies should also be \nrequired to use the electronic employment verification system. They may \nbe private-sector people, but they are working for the\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\nFederal Government and they are in place of Federal employees.\n  There have been many examples of aliens illegally in the country \nworking for Government contractors and being allowed to work in \nsensitive areas. I gave a number of examples last week during \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill when I tried to apply \nthis same principle to that bill when it was up.\n  But the Department of Defense, I want you to know, is not the only \nculprit. This week, a man from Houston was sentenced for harboring \nillegal aliens, some of whom had access to an Alexandria airbase and \nLouisiana National Guard facility under a Federal Emergency Management \nAgency construction contract.\n  The company employed 30 to 40 workers, contracted with FEMA, and was \nable to send illegal aliens to a worksite where they had access to a \nNational Guard facility and airbase.\n  There were many news stories about undocumented individuals working \nin the construction industry in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n  Then there was ``Operation Tarmac,'' launched by Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement in 2002, to enhance security at our airports and \nremove undocumented immigrants from these critical facilities.\n  The operation resulted in investigations of hundreds of thousands of \npeople and more than 900 arrests of unauthorized workers. Aliens \nillegally in this country were working as janitors, baggage checkers, \nand luggage handlers.\n  Whether it is FEMA or the Transportation Security Administration or \nBorder Patrol or the Citizenship and Immigration Service, we must make \nsure those hired by the agencies are legally able to work in the United \nStates.\n  While Immigration and Customs Enforcement has taken some steps to \nfind unauthorized workers at secure sites, illegal aliens should not be \nhired in the first place. We cannot allow people illegally in our \ncounty to check our bags or process immigration benefits.\n  One way to get at that problem, then, is to require Departments, \nparticularly the Department of Homeland Security, to use the basic \npilot program up front. There is no cost to employers. Instead, the \nAmerican public will be more protected than it is today.\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate voted unanimously to debar employers \nfrom Government contracts if they are found to hire aliens illegally in \nthe country. That vote signified an overwhelming opinion that our \nGovernment should only be doing business with those who take our \nimmigration laws very seriously. Therefore, this part of my amendment \nshould not be problematic.\n  I hope my amendment can be considered this week. It is not overly \nexpansive. It is to the Department we are appropriating money for. I \ndon't believe it is overly burdensome because the Federal Government is \npreaching to the private sector. They are preaching to the other \nGovernment agencies that we ought to be doing it. We in Congress have \nadopted it more than anybody else in the Federal Government has. If we \ncan do this in our hiring of people, surely other Government agencies \ncan.\n  I hope this amendment--I think a commonsense amendment--can be \nconsidered. I am happy to debate it, but I am finished presenting it. I \nhave it before the Senate and I will let the managers of the bill take \nthe course from that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIowa for his contribution to the debate and consideration of this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that it be set aside so that I may \ncall up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2405 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I thank Chairman Byrd, Senator Murray, \nand Senator Cochran for their leadership on this outstanding bill which \nwill help make America safer and, of course, we in New York \nparticularly care about homeland security. I want to commend the \ncommittee for putting together a bill that shows the Nation where our \npriorities lie. After years of shortchanging the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the committee has now put forth a bill that will sufficiently \nfund the Department, in my judgment. In the next year, DHS will finally \nbe equipped to do its job of making our Nation safer from harm.\n  The bill will make America safer by investing in high priority \nprojects--such as the kind of technology we need to keep us safe--while \nalso protecting us at our borders, in our skies, at our ports of entry, \nand on our subways, rail, and mass transit systems.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2416 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I am introducing an amendment that will \nrequire the Government to test an array of possible card technologies \nbefore creating new passport cards for land border crossings.\n  Under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, the Department of \nHomeland Security is moving toward new rules to require travelers to \nshow a passport or an approved alternative document at land ports of \nentry. As we all saw from the record passport backlogs over the past \nfew months, the Nation suffers when the administration makes big \nchanges at the border without adequate preparation. Yet with the new \npassport cards, DHS and the State Department seem to be rushing forward \nblindly again. They have already issued a proposed rule on passport \ncard technology, but when I questioned officials from DHS and the State \nDepartment, they admitted they had not done any on-the-ground testing \nof their proposed cards. This lack of testing is especially shocking \nbecause the administration is making a very unusual move in trying to \nuse a type of technology that has weaker security capabilities than \nsome of the other options that are out there. We don't know whether it \nwould work on the border unless we test it.\n  I think that with proper preparation and testing, we can have a \nborder document that is both secure and efficient, that preserves both \nsecurity and allows commerce to continue to flow freely across the \nborder. That is what I want to see. But if we let the DHS push this \nforward, I am concerned that travelers will get the worst of both \nworlds.\n  DHS in this case has it all backward. They need to do the testing \nbefore making a final choice of technology. We need to know that any \nnew cards will be reliable, secure, efficient, and easy to use. If the \nadministration won't do that testing on its own, then Congress must \nstep in. My amendment says DHS and the State Department need to do a \nserious evaluation comparison of two or more card technologies before \nthey issue a final regulation to start selling these cards to people. \nThis is a smart and straightforward way to make sure the administration \nis spending money wisely. I can't see why anyone would object to it, \nand I hope we can certainly agree without much controversy to pass it \ninto law.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2461 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and I call up amendment No. 2461.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2461 to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase the amount provided for aviation security \n                       direction and enforcement)\n\n       On page 2, line 11, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$94,000,000''.\n       On page 18, line 2, strike ``$5,039,559,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,045,559,000''.\n       On page 18, line 10, strike ``$964,445,000'' and insert \n     ``$970,445,000''.\n       On page 18, line 20, strike ``$2,329,334,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,335,344,000''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement \nProgram reimburses local law enforcement for security services that TSA \nrequires at all airports around the country. But due to a planned \nexpansion, the program is not fully funded at the level needed to \nmaintain the present level of service. Currently, 275 airports are part \nof the program, which is funded at $64 million. As the program moves \nfrom a reimbursement agreement model to a cooperative agreement model, \nTSA hopes to include 300 airports, but they will attempt to do this \nwith the same level of funding used for 275 airports. Most of these \nairports are smaller, rural. They are not the kind of airports that can \neasily come up with the tens of thousands of dollars that might be \nrequired. So this is a smart and straightforward way to make sure the \nadministration is spending money wisely. My amendment will make sure \nthe level of security service provided at airports does not suffer as \nmore airports become part of this important program.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2447 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and I call up amendment No. 2447.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reserve $40,000,000 of the amounts appropriated for the \nDomestic Nuclear Detection Office to support the implementation of the \n     Securing the Cities initiative at the level requested in the \n                          President's budget)\n\n       On page 49, line 22, strike the period at the end and all \n     that follows through ``2010:'' on page 50, line 2, and insert \n     the following: ``, of which $10,000,000 shall be available to \n     support the implementation of the Securing the Cities \n     initiative at the level requested in the President's budget.\n\n                         ``systems acquisition\n\n       ``For expenses for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office \n     acquisition and deployment of radiological detection systems \n     in accordance with the global nuclear detection architecture, \n     $182,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2010, \n     of which $30,000,000 shall be available to support the \n     implementation of the Securing the Cities initiative at the \n     level requested in the President's budget:''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am joined by my New York colleague \nSenator Clinton and my colleagues from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg \nand Senator Menendez, in offering an amendment to fully fund the \nSecuring the Cities initiative at the level of $40 million. This is \nwhat was requested by the President. Securing the Cities is an \ninnovative partnership between the Federal Domestic Nuclear Detection \nOffice and local law enforcement to set up a ring of radiation \ndetection devices around the perimeter of urban centers to stop dirty \nbombs or nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Detection Office chose the New \nYork region as the first area to pilot this approach, and local \nauthorities have been working together for months to plan and train. \nBut the committee proposes to provide only three-quarters of the \nfunding requested by the President.\n  When it comes to protecting cities from nuclear or radiological \nattack, we can't stop halfway. Securing the Cities is a cutting-edge \nplan to safeguard the people and assets of our most threatened city \ncenters. This program is moving ahead and it needs the full amount the \nPresident requested: $30 million to purchase equipment and $10 million \nfor planning and research. I hope the relatively small amount of money \nhere will be approved without much debate by my colleagues.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2448 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set aside \nand I call up amendment No. 2448.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2448 to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the domestic supply of nurses and physical \n                  therapists, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 536.

Mr. President, it should be a secret to no one that DHS \nis far behind in processing visas. One consequence of these lags is \nthat thousands of visas go unused every year. This amendment takes \napproximately 61,000 of these unused visas from past years and \nallocates them for two professions that have been hit very hard by the \nvisa crisis: nurses and physical therapists. Hospitals in New York, \nfrom the large ones in New York City to the small rural ones upstate, \nand hospitals around the country are feeling the crunch from the huge \nnursing shortage. There are now more than 100,000 nurse vacancies \nnationwide, by some counts.\n  This amendment doesn't do anything to change existing law, and \ndoesn't--I repeat, doesn't--create a single new visa. It is a one-time \nfix that does one thing: It takes one small pool of existing visas that \nnow isn't being used and sets it aside for two professions that \ndesperately need the help.\n  I look forward to working with the committee on these amendments, as \nI believe they are important additions to the great work the committee \nhas already done. I will ask for the yeas and nays at the appropriate \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the underlying DHS appropriations bill \nmakes available $5 million for facilitating 287(g) agreements. As the \nbill is currently written, the Secretary of DHS could ignore the will \nof Congress and refuse to use the money to facilitate 287(g) \nagreements. The current amendment would simply require that the \nSecretary use this funding for its intended purpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be temporarily laid aside \nso that I may call up my second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2449 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I send to the desk my amendment No. 2449.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To set aside $75,000,000 of the funds appropriated for \ntraining, exercise, technical assistance, and other programs under the \n heading State and local programs for training consistent with section \n             287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act)\n\n       On page 39, line 21, insert ``, of which not less than \n     $75,000,000 shall be used for training, exercises, and \n     technical assistance consistent with section 287(g) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1357(g))'' before \n     the semicolon at the end.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, the underlying bill provides over $51 \nmillion for training to support implementation of 287(g) agreements. My \namendment would make an additional $75 million available for this \npurpose by providing that a portion of the $294 million already \nappropriated under the bill for general State and local training grants \nbe used specifically for 287(g) training.\n  Mr. President, in recent months, I have heard from local law \nenforcement officials from every corner of my home State of North \nCarolina who, frankly, have had it. They are fed up. They are fed up \nbecause they are powerless to bring justice to illegal aliens who are \ncommitting crimes, such as drinking and driving and gang-related \nactivity. They are fed up that Federal agents lack the manpower to help \nthem process these criminals. They are fed up with the catch and \nrelease of dangerous individuals. Local law enforcement officers are \nfed up that when they try to solve these serious problems--that is, \nthey seek authority under a program called 287(g) to process illegal \naliens who committed crimes--they are put through the bureaucratic \nringer and often turned away.\n  Why would the Department of Homeland Security deny our local law \nenforcement agencies the tools that are readily available to them under \ncurrent law that would help address major challenges in their \ncommunities? Most simply, the answer is funding. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, or ICE, does not have the money to train and \nprovide assistance to these local entities that are textbook examples \nof places that desperately need 287(g) status.\n  In the aftermath of the immigration debate, it is abundantly clear \nAmericans have no confidence that their Government is taking the \ncritical steps to secure our borders or enforce the laws on the books. \nThe public will continue to distrust and rightly reject any so-called \ncomprehensive immigration reform until they wholeheartedly believe \nthese steps have been taken to keep their communities and families \nsafe.\n  The 287(g) program is an invaluable tool to achieving these goals, \nand it should be fully utilized. My amendments will help ensure that it \nis fully utilized, and without actually increasing the cost of the \nbill. I repeat, my amendments do not add any cost to this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these measures, and I truly hope \nthese commonsense amendments are fully considered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be laid \naside, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter \nfrom the Professional Services Council in support of my amendment to \napply standard contracting laws to the Transportation Security \nAdministration printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Professional Services Council,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 24, 2007.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry and Snowe: During the Senate's \n     consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, we understand that you will offer an \n     amendment to repeal the provision in the Aviation and \n     Transportation Security Act (P.L 107-71) that the \n     Transportation Security Administration's procurements are to \n     be governed exclusively by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's Acquisition Management System (AMS) and are \n     specifically exempt from coverage of most of the Federal \n     procurement laws and the Federal Acquisition Regulations \n     (FAR). This amendment is identical to the provision you \n     offered and the Senate adopted by voice vote last year during \n     the Senate's consideration of the fiscal year 2007 Homeland \n     Security Act; regrettably the provision was not enacted into \n     law.\n       As you know, the Professional Services Council (PSC) is the \n     principal national trade association for companies providing \n     services to virtually every agency of the Federal government. \n     Many of our member companies now do business with the \n     Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and other \n     components of the Department of Homeland Security. On behalf \n     of the more than 220 member companies, thank you for the \n     invitation to provide our views on this amendment.\n       On behalf of PSC, we support this amendment. Bringing TSA \n     at least under the common rules applicable to the Department \n     of Homeland Security and to the preponderance of the federal \n     agencies will increase competition, expand opportunities for \n     greater small business participation, provide greater \n     accountability and transparency in their procurement \n     processes, and provide greater options for addressing the \n     challenges of the department's acquisition workforce. Indeed, \n     there are clear advantages for all parties when agencies \n     operate under common rules and procedures. Moreover, as TSA \n     seeks to train its current workforce and further expand its \n     acquisition workforce, the degree of commonality between its \n     acquisition procedures and other federal agency practices \n     will have a real effect on the cost and efficiencies of \n     bringing in skilled professionals.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this matter. If you have \n     any questions or need any additional information, please do \n     not hesitate to let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alan Chvotkin, Esq.,\n                                Senior Vice President and Counsel.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2405\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Alexander as a cosponsor of his important amendment. I \nunderstand that Senator Collins and Senator Voinovich are also \ncosponsors.\n  This amendment is simple. It provides funding--$300 million--for \ngrants to the States for the continued development and implementation \nof the REAL ID program. This funding is fully offset by an across the \nboard reduction of all discretionary amounts included in the underlying \nbill.\n  Mr. President, the REAL ID program is critical for our national \nsecurity.\n  We know, from history, that the duplication and falsification of \ndrivers' licenses is a reality, and this fact is a national security \nconcern. As you may recall, all but one of the 9/11 hijackers obtained \nsome form of U.S. identification--some by fraudulent means--which aided \nthem in boarding commercial flights. We need confidence that the \nindividual that displays this card is, in fact, the rightful owner of \nit. And this card, the REAL ID, will provide that confidence.\n  The proposed regulation for the REAL ID program sets out common \nstandards for the security and information on the card itself. These \nstandards require: minimum data visible on the card, such as full \nnames; verification of identity documents, such as birth certificates \nand Social Security numbers; physical security features embedded in the \ncard to protect privacy and make tampering more difficult; security of\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\nmanufacturing facilities and background checks for employees handling \nthese applications and cards.\n  In my view, the Federal Government must be a good working partner \nwith the States, and this amendment, which provides funding for the \nprogram, is a step in the right direction. We must proceed with this \nprogram on a partnership concept of States and the Federal Government \nworking together. For that reason, I am pleased to learn that the \nNational Governors Association supports this amendment. This program is \nan important step in achieving some type of identification that will \nhelp America feel more secure in our daily requirements to identify \nourselves and to otherwise conduct our life here at home.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to offer my support \nfor the amendment to be offered by Senator Casey with regard to \nhomeland security grant timelines. This amendment would lengthen the \namount of time available to obligate funds provided in fiscal year 2008 \nunder the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Rail and \nTransit Security Grant Program from a maximum of 36 months to a maximum \nof 48 months.\n  I am advised that several transit agencies have encountered problems \nobligating homeland security grant funding within the current \ntimetable, particularly for large and complex projects such as \ninstalling underground emergency communications networks in subway \ntunnels.\n  The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority, SEPTA, in \nparticular, has encountered problems which have thus far prevented it \nfrom being able to utilize federal homeland security grant dollars to \ninstall an emergency communications network in its 20-mile subway \ntunnel system which runs underneath portions of the city of \nPhiladelphia. The absence of a communications system capable of \nfunctioning underground severely limits the ability of SEPTA and first \nresponders to deal with a potential emergency in Philadelphia's subway \ntunnels and does not provide an adequate level of protection for the \ntraveling public.\n  Specifically, SEPTA claims that a 3-year period is not sufficient \ntime to coordinate regional interoperability issues with the city of \nPhiladelphia and the surrounding first responder agencies. It is my \nunderstanding that preliminary engineering requirements and the time \nassociated with procuring the necessary technology further compound the \nproblem. Finally, SEPTA claims that it does not receive enough homeland \nsecurity grant funding in a 3-year period to complete such a complex \nproject.\n  This amendment will provide SEPTA and other transit agencies in \nsimilar predicaments with additional time to plan, coordinate, secure \ntechnology for and fund important and complex projects such as \nunderground communications systems. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9910-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

He was 35 years old.\n  Petty Officer First Class Chaney graduated from Bellevue West High \nSchool in 1990. He enlisted in the Navy in 1993 and spent 4 years of \nhis 14-year Navy career as a recruiter.

He \nworked with Secret Service for President George H.W. Bush's 80th \nbirthday celebration in 2004, where he met the former President and \nformer Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He also assisted Secret Service \nwith security during the 2004 Presidential election and met both \nPresident George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. Petty Officer First \nClass Chaney had been in Iraq for two months. We are proud of Petty \nOfficer First Class Chaney's service to our country, as well as the \nthousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq.\n  In addition to his brother Randy, Petty Officer First Class Chaney is \nsurvived by his daughter Brianna Chaney of Omaha, his father Larry \nChaney of Bloomington, MN, his mother Connie Chaney of Omaha, and \nbrother Jim Ecker of Oakland, IA.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Petty \nOfficer First Class Jeffrey Chaney.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Jacob Schmuecker\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to express my sympathy over the loss of \nU.S. Army National Guard SGT Jacob Schmuecker of Norfolk, NE.

He \nattended Northeast Community College before he joined the Nebraska Army \nNational Guard in 2001 as a member of the 134th Infantry Detachment in \nLincoln, NE.\n  He was mobilized for service in Iraq in August 2006 with the Nebraska \nNational Guard's 755th Reconnaissance and Decontamination Company based \nin O'Neill, NE.\n  Sergeant Schmuecker was a model leader. He had a strong concern for \nthe men that he led and hoped that if anything were to happen, that it \nwould happen to him.

We are proud of Sergeant \nSchmuecker's service to our country, as well as the thousands of other \nbrave Americans serving in Iraq.\n  Sergeant Schmuecker is survived by his wife Lisa and their three \nchildren, his parents Rodney and Patricia Schmuecker, three brothers, \nand three sisters.\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SGT \nJacob Schmuecker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9913-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING LADY BIRD JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when Lady Bird Johnson passed away on \nthe afternoon of July 11, 2007, the United States mourned the loss of a \ndignified and compassionate First Lady. Even though she is gone, she \nhas left us with the legacy of her beautification of America. Through \nher diligent efforts, Mrs. Johnson was not only an advocate for the \nnatural beauty of America but also of the beauty and strength of its \npeople. Sharon and I extend our deepest sympathy to her daughters Lynda \nand Luci, their families, her friends, and all of those whose lives \nhave been touched by her life's work.\n  As President Lyndon B. Johnson entered the White House in one of our \nNation's most harrowing moments, Mrs. Johnson stood by her husband with \npoise and courage that helped comfort a wounded nation. Her service to \nour country would go even further as she became a leading voice for \npreserving and defending America's natural resources. Here in the \nNation's Capital, people can't help but be reminded of Mrs. Johnson's \nvigorous work to adorn Washington, DC, with flowers, giving us an \naesthetic that all Americans could take pride in and enjoy.\n  I have always shared Mrs. Johnson's deeply held love for the beauty \nof the United States, from the mountains of West Virginia to the plains \nof Texas. It was because of her commitment to the environment and the \nsplendor of our country that the Beautification Act of 1965 was passed. \nShe strove to line our highways with wildflowers and still found time \nto enjoy walking through the national parks that she fought to protect.\n  In addition to her work with the environment, I truly admire her \nefforts to address poverty in the United States. Under President \nJohnson, the VISTA program was enacted, sending out volunteers to \nimprove the conditions of impoverished communities. I can proudly say \nthat as a VISTA volunteer in Emmons, WV, I saw firsthand the immense \nbenefits of this program for participants and for the communities they \nserve.\n  I will never forget her devotion to her husband, her family, and her \ncountry. I will never forget her passion fighting for civil rights and \nagainst poverty. Nor will I ever forget her determination to leave a \nbeautiful America for future generations.\n  Lady Bird Johnson, again, held my sincerest respect and appreciation. \nTo her family and the people of Texas, I offer my deepest sympathies. \nMrs. Johnson was a valuable public servant, an inspiration and a \nfriend. More than anything else, she was an irreplaceable First Lady.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9913-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the minimum \nwage increase, which takes effect today.\n  Today, millions of hard-working Americans will finally receive the \nfirst increase of a $2.10 raise in the Federal minimum wage. Today, we \nare putting an end to a decade-long stagnant wage that has kept those \nwho are working their hardest at the bottom of the ladder. Today, they \nare getting the chance that everyone in this country deserves--the \nopportunity to build a better life.\n  Now, $2.10 may not sound like much to most Americans. But that small \nincrease will make a difference in the pockets and in the lives of \nmillions of Americans. Those $2.10 add up to more than $4,400 more \nevery year enough to help a low-income family depending on a minimum \nwage income to afford 2 years of child care, a year and a half in \nutility bills, or a year of tuition at a public college.\n  I am also proud that my State of New Jersey has not waited for \nCongress to do what is right. Instead, New Jersey has taken it upon \nitself to increase the State minimum wage far in advance of Congress, \nwhich now is at $7.15 per hour. New Jersey's minimum wage has given \nmore than a quarter million workers the opportunity to build a better \nlife for themselves and their families.\n  And today, all Americans earning minimum wage will have that same \nopportunity to build a better life. In enacting the first minimum wage \nincrease in over a decade, Congress took a critical first step towards \ncorrecting a grave injustice. For far too long, we have let some of our \nhardest working employees--those who prepare our food, clean our \noffices, treat us at the doctor, and guard our buildings at night--see \ntheir wages erode by 10 years of inflation.\n  Ten years is far too long for those who work round the clock, hoping \nto save a little extra for groceries, for those working so they can buy \nschool supplies or clothes for their children, or for those saving so \none day they can live in a place they are proud to call home.\n  Today, we should also commit that never again will we let this \ninjustice persist for 10 years. The increase going into effect today is \nan important improvement, but it is not the end of the battle. An \nincrease in the minimum wage is only part of the solution.\n  We cannot ignore that the income gap has been widening--and now it \nhas taken on a new twist. We no longer have inequality just between \nthose living comfortably and those struggling to make ends meet. Income \nis now more concentrated at the top than it has been in the past 70 \nyears. In fact, as the wealthiest 1 percent have seen their income grow \nby 20 percent or more within the past few years, everyone else has seen \ntheir income grow by less than 4 percent.\n  And that inequality is ever too real for women and minorities, who \nare more likely to be minimum wage earners.\n  So while increasing the minimum wage is just one step toward closing \nthe income gap, it is an important step.\n  Ultimately, a wage increase is about fairness, about ensuring all \nAmericans, not just those at the top, can share in the American dream.\n  Before today, 13 million minimum wage workers did not have the chance \nto share in that dream.\n  Before today, 4 million Latinos and African Americans earned less \nthan $7.25 an hour with no expectation that their wages would rise.\n  Before today, nearly 7 million women, who make up well over half of \nminimum wage workers, would not have seen their wages increase.\n  And before today, a minimum wage earner with a family of three would \nbe making $6,000 below the poverty level. Before today, that family \nwould not have a way out of poverty and into prosperity.\n  We have changed the course, not just for minimum wage workers but for \nour country. We have finally taken steps toward providing greater \nequality and given our hardest workers and their families the chance to \nearn a wage of dignity and respect.\n  A wage increase is only a downpayment on our promise to all \nAmericans--it is a preview of what is to come. Democrats pledge to \ncontinue to change the course to ensure all Americans and their \nfamilies have a fair shot at achieving the American dream.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9913-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9913-S9914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING IRVIN L.

His leadership and vision were critical in the \ndevelopment of the new tribal headquarters in Chiloquin as well as a \nnew dental, medical clinic and pharmacy and the construction of many \nnew homes for tribal members.\n  Chairman Foreman has shown his dedication to the tribe and to the \npeople of Klamath County in many ways. His focus on rural economic \ndevelopment and his respect for our natural resources have earned him \nhigh respect in the community. Chairman Foreman is known as a man who \ncan be trusted and a man who will work with anyone to accomplish a \ncommon goal for the good of the community. His devotion to the Klamath \ntribes is evident in the fact that while he has recently retired as \nchairman of the tribes, he will remain a member of the Tribal Council \nat large to continue his service to the tribes.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the successes being exhibited \nby the Klamath tribes and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with \nChairman Foreman. The Klamath tribes have a saying that proclaims, \n``The Klamath Tribes. . . . Respecting the Past. . . . Living the \nPresent. . . .

Mr. President, as a native and resident of \nPendleton, OR, I have enjoyed a lifelong affection for the Pendleton \nRound-Up, which is quite simply America's finest rodeo. Pendleton \nWoolen Mills locally based and family owned for more than 140 years has \nsponsored the Round-Up both financially and with merchandise for as \nlong as I can remember. A great deal of credit for the continuing \nsuccess of both the Round-Up and Woolen Mills is owed to the leadership \nand vision of\nC.M. ``Mort'' Bishop, Jr. This remarkable Oregonian passed away on July \n11 at the age of 82. I wish to pay tribute to his life and legacy.\n  Mort was a proud member of what has been termed the ``greatest \ngeneration'' and, like so many of that generation, he wore our \ncountry's uniform into battle during World War II. As a U.S. marine, \nMort served with the 5th and 14th Battalions in the Pacific theater and \nparticipated in the liberation of Guam in July 1944.\n  After returning home from the war, Mort joined the family business: \nPendleton Woolen Mills. Mort helped guide this iconic Oregon company \nfor nearly 50 years, eventually succeeding his father as company \npresident. Most recently, Mort served next to his brother, `Brot,' as \nco-vice chairman.\n  Even while managing a demanding business, Mort always found time to \ngive back to his community and his State. From the Oregon Historical \nSociety to the Boy Scouts of America, from Willamette University to the \nOregon Wildlife Heritage Foundation and the University of Oregon \nFoundation, Mort generously gave his time, talent, and treasure to \ncountless worthy causes. But let there be no doubt, the cause held \nclosest to Mort's heart was the Pendleton Round Up. I knew that every \nSeptember I could count on seeing Mort and his wonderful family \nenjoying the nearly 100-year-old rodeo.\n  Mort also held a close friendship with the Confederated Tribes of the \nUmatilla Indian Reservation, who have played an integral role in the \nannual Round-Up. Indeed, the design inspirations for Pendleton Woolen \nMills blankets originate on the Umatilla reservation. In 2001, Mort was \nhonored as the grand marshall for the Round-Up's Westward Ho! Parade. \nThe Umatilla and Nez Perce Indian tribes have also honored him with the \nIndian name ``Caacaa Kuta,'' which means ``just right doer of things.'' \nAnd just 2 months ago, Mort was inducted into the Pendleton Round-Up \nHall of Fame.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have had Mort Bishop as a friend. I join \nwith many other Oregonians in extending our condolences to Mort's \nfamily. Mort is survived by four children, nine grandchildren, two \ngreat-grandchildren, and his brother- and sister-in-law. As long as \nthere is a Pendleton Round-Up and as long as there is a Pendleton \nWoolen Mills, Mort Bishop, Jr., will always be remembered as a ``just \nright doer of things.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9914-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9914-S9915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING BACKYARD FARMS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate an exceptional \nsmall business from my home State of Maine that is enabling New England \nconsumers to enjoy fresh, locally grown, and healthy tomatoes on a \nyear-round basis. Located in Madison, Backyard Farms is a large-scale \ntomato producer that has invested over $20 million into what is now \nMaine's largest building and one of the world's most technologically \nadvanced facilities.\n  Backyard Farms, which operates the largest greenhouse in New England, \nemploys 115 hard-working individuals who collectively yield an \nastonishing 1 million tomatoes per week--which adds up to 7,700 tons of \ntomatoes annually. With New Englanders consuming an average of 300 \nmillion fresh tomatoes per year, Backyard Farms has the potential to \ncapture an extensive share of this market. Backyard Farms' tomatoes are \ncertainly fresh, as it sells its product to stores less than 8 hours \naway. That means that tomatoes picked one day are on store shelves all \nacross Maine and New England the next.\n  In addition to its magnificent tomatoes, Backyard Farms is striving \nto make its facility a green--or energy efficient--building by using \nthe most environmentally friendly technology available. The 25-acre \ngreenhouse uses efficient technologies including rainwater reclamation, \nhigh-efficiency boilers, and thermal blankets to produce juicy \ntomatoes. Furthermore, Backyard Farms utilizes natural methods to grow \nits wonderful produce. Bees take care of the pollination, and tomatoes \nare kept healthy by implementing biological controls, such as parasitic \nwraps and ladybugs, rather than pesticides and fungicides. The work of \nthose at Backyard Farms proves that conservation does not necessarily \nhave to hinder effectiveness and efficiency.\n  Backyard Farms prides itself on the quality of its product. On each \nbox of tomatoes shipped to local stores, it is written, ``wicked good \ntomatoes from right nearby.'' This motto emphasizes Backyard Farms' \nlocal nature and its commitment to the community through its highly \nsustainable business practices. Backyard Farms plans to build 3 to 4 \nadditional greenhouses on at least 17 more acres. This would allow \nBackyard Farms to increase its produce output to include cucumbers, \npeppers, eggplant, and culinary herbs. Such an expansion would have an \nimmensely positive impact on the Maine economy by adding as many as 200 \nnew employees. I look forward to the groundbreaking for this expansion, \nscheduled to occur later this month.\n  It is particularly inspirational that Backyard Farms has proven that \na region known for its cooler temperatures and short growing season can \nin fact expand its agricultural production by combining advanced \ntechnologies with an innovative entrepreneurial spirit. Backyard Farms \nprovides us with a paragon of smart economic development. I commend \nchief executive officer Peter Sellew, cofounder Arie van der Giessen, \nand all of the employees of\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\nBackyard Farm and wish them continued success and prosperity in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9915-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING ZACHARY WEBB\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \nnew voting systems to provide a voter-verified permanent record, to \ndevelop better accessible voting machines for individuals with \ndisabilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in the November 2004 elections, Nevadans \nentered a new frontier for casting their votes. We became the first \nState in the Nation to require that voter-verified paper audit trail \nprinters be used with touch-screen voting machines.\n  Despite what critics of these machines might tell you, Nevada's \nelections were a success. The machines worked well and were well-\nreceived by voters. During a post-election audit, Nevada compared \n60,000 electronic ballots with their corresponding voter-verified paper \nrecord and found that they matched with 100 percent consistency. As a \nresult, all Nevadans who used these machines can be confident that \ntheir votes were counted accurately.\n  I understand better than most the importance of the integrity of the \nballot box. I was at the mercy of a paperless-machine election in my \n1998 race for the U.S. Senate. When the votes were tallied with a \ndifference of only a few hundred, I asked for a recount in Clark \nCounty, the only county at the time using electronic voting machines. \nThe result of the recount was identical to the first count. That is \nbecause there was nothing to recount. After rerunning a computer \nprogram, the computer predictably produced the same exact tally.\n  I conceded that race and was elected to Nevada's other Senate seat in \n2000. But that experience made me realize the importance of ensuring \nAmericans that their votes will count, it is absolutely fundamental to \nour democracy.\n  That is why I led the fight for voter verification paper trails in \nthe Help America Vote Act, known as HAVA, which President Bush signed \ninto law in 2002. When Congress passed HAVA, we expressed our \ncommitment to the principle of ``one person, one vote.'' One important \ncomponent of HAVA provided States with funds to replace aging voting \nmachines which had a tendency to malfunction. A voting machine that \nfails to record a vote properly affects voters in the same way as\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\nif the voters were denied access to the voting booth. Either way their \nvote is not counted.\n  Despite these gains, HAVA falls short in one critical area. It does \nnot require that electronic voting machines produce a paper trail of \neach ballot. A voter-verified paper trail would allow voters to review \na physical printout of their ballot and correct any errors before \nleaving the voting booth. This printout would be preserved at the \npolling place for use in any recounts. This is exactly what Nevadans \nexperienced when they voted in November.\n\n  This technology is important.\n  It increases voter confidence. With the close elections America has \nseen recently, it is important that each American trust the outcome of \nour elections. Machines that allow voters to review a separate paper \nrecord of their ballots give voters confidence that their votes have \nbeen cast and will be counted accurately.\n  Paper-trail technology ensures that no votes will be lost if a voting \nmachine fails. The paper record can be used as the ballot of record if \na machine malfunctions and fails to record the votes that were cast \nprior to a machine failing. This technology also gives State election \nofficials a necessary backup to verify results. Nevada's post-election \naudit ensures that each machine operated properly. This type of audit \nguarantees accuracy in a way that cannot be guaranteed otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, the language that is contained in HAVA has not \nresolved this issue for most other States. Now, I am working to ensure \nvoting integrity across the country. In introducing the Voting \nIntegrity and Verification Act, I want to ensure that HAVA is clear--\nvoters must be assured that their votes will be accurate and will be \ncounted properly. My bill requires that all voting systems purchased \nafter December 31, 2012 have an individual permanent paper record for \neach ballot cast.\n  Additionally, this bill will help to advance technology for persons \nwith disabilities to ensure that disabled voters enjoy the same \nindependence when exercising their right to vote as non-disabled voters \nenjoy.\n  Technology has transformed the way we do many things, including \nvoting. But we cannot simply sit on the sidelines and assume that our \ndemocracy will withstand such changes. Our continued work to ensure \nthat each vote counts here in the U.S. underscores the idea that we \nmust always be vigilant in protecting democracy, whether it is brand \nnew or more than 200 years old. The Voting Integrity and Verification \nAct protects democracy by protecting the sanctity of our vote.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Sanders, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Carper, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Brown, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1870. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify the jurisdiction of the United States over waters of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of recent U.S. Supreme Court \ndecisions, today I am introducing legislation to affirm Federal \njurisdiction over the waters of the U.S. as Congress intended when it \npassed the Clean Water Act in 1972. I want to thank Senators \nLautenberg, Levin, Kerry, Lieberman, Boxer, Menendez, Sanders, Cardin, \nDurbin, Reed, Dodd, Kohl, Whitehouse, Stabenow, Carper, Wyden, Leahy, \nBrown, and Schumer for joining me in introducing this important \nlegislation.\n  For 35 years, the American people have relied upon the Clean Water \nAct to protect and restore the health of the Nation's waters. The \nprimary goal of the act, to make rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and \ncoastal waters safe for fishing, swimming and other recreation, \nsuitable for our drinking water supply, and available for wildlife and \nfish habitat, has broad public support not only as a worthy endeavor \nbut also as a fundamental expectation of government providing for its \ncitizens. It is our responsibility to ensure that our freshwater \nresources are able to enhance human health, contribute to the economy, \nand help the environment.\n  We have made considerable progress towards ensuring the Nation's \nwaters are drinkable, fishable, and swimmable. However, today, the \nClean Water Act, one of our Nation's bedrock environmental laws, faces \nnew and unprecedented challenges.\n  Two controversial, closely divided U.S. Supreme Court rulings have \nreduced the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act, undermining \ndecades of clean water protections and disregarding Congress' intent \nwhen it originally passed the Clean Water Act.\n  At the heart of the issue is the statutory definition of ``waters of \nthe United States.'' Though recent court decisions have focused on \ndredge and fill permits under section 404, this definition is integral \nto the Federal Government's jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act as a \nwhole. This definition is the linchpin for state water quality \nstandards under section 302 and section 303, national performance \nstandards under section 306, toxic and pretreatment standards under \nsection 307, oil and hazardous substance liability under section 311, \naquaculture standards under section 318, State water quality \ncertifications under section 401, and national pollution discharge \npermitting requirements under section 402.\n  In the 2001 case Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army \nCorps of Engineers, SWANCC, in a 5 to 4 decision, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt limited the authority of Federal agencies to extend Clean Water \nAct protections to commercially nonnavigable, intrastate, ``isolated'' \nwaters based solely on their use by migratory birds. While the Court's \ndecision was narrow, the effect of the decision has been much broader: \nfor example, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, 20 \npercent of the Nation's wetlands outside Alaska are now at risk of \nlosing Federal protections.\n  Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court announced a sharply divided \ndecision in the consolidated cases of Rapanos v. United States and \nCarabell v. Army Corps of Engineers that jeopardizes many more of our \nNation's waters. Four justices joined an opinion that said only \npermanent or ``continuously flowing'' rivers and streams and by \nimplication, the wetlands next to them are protected by the Clean Water \nAct, ignoring the act's text and purpose. This line of reasoning would \nleave more than half of our Nation's waters without Federal \nprotections. To put these bodies of water into perspective, according \nto the Environmental Protection Agency, 110 million Americans get their \ndrinking water from sources that include the very intermittent and \nephemeral bodies of water that the four justices said were not \nprotected by the Clean Water Act.\n  Fortunately, five Justices rejected this radical rewrite of the act. \nHowever, Justice Kennedy, who provided the fifth vote to send the cases \nback to the lower courts, offered an entirely different test; one \nrequiring EPA and the corps to show a ``significant nexus'' between a \nstream, river, or wetland and a navigable water in order for the \nstream, river, or wetland to be protected. At best, this test is \nconfusing, will be resource-intensive to implement, and is likely to \nresult in many waters Congress always included under the Clean Water \nAct being left unprotected from pollution.\n  Fortunately, an unprecedented array of local, State, regional, and \nnational officials, professional organizations, and public interest \ngroups from across the country and the political spectrum have joined \nin the defense of the Clean Water Act. The unparalleled collection of \ninterested parties includes the attorneys general of 33 States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia; four former Administrators of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Russell Train, Douglas Costle, William Reilly, and \nCarol Browner; 9 current and former members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. \nHouse of Representatives who were directly involved in the passage of \nthe 1972 act and its reaffirmation in 1977; the Association of State \nWetlands Managers, the Association of State Floodplain Managers, the \nAssociation of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control \nAdministrators, and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; \nnumerous hunting, fishing, wildlife and outdoor recreation \norganizations and businesses, including Ducks Unlimited, the\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\nNational Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, the American \nSportsfishing Association, Bass Pro Shops, the Orvis Company, and the \nWildlife Management Institute, among others; and a number of local, \nregional, and national environmental groups. All of these interests \nfiled briefs in the most recent Supreme Court case, expressing strong \nsupport of the Clean Water Act's core safeguard: the requirement to \nobtain a permit before discharging pollutants into waters of the U.S.\n\n  With such strong support for the Clean Water Act, which is grounded \nin the language, history, and purpose of the law itself, I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in reaffirming Federal protections for streams, \nheadwaters, tributaries, and wetlands that have long been covered by \nthe act.\n  The issue before us is simple: Does Congress support restoring \nhistoric clean water protections as they existed for nearly 30 years \nprior to the Supreme Court cases? If so, Congress must act. In 1972, \nCongress established protections for all ``waters of the United \nStates'' and I am pleased to lead the charge in the Senate to reaffirm \nthose protections.\n  The Clean Water Restoration Act would reestablish protection for all \nwaters historically covered by the Clean Water Act, prior to the SWANCC \nand Rapanos decisions. The bill could not be more straight-forward. It \nmakes it clear that the Clean Water Act has always covered a myriad of \ninterstate and intrastate waters, by codifying the regulatory \ndefinition of ``waters of the United States'' that has been in use \nsince the 1970s. In fact, 30 years ago this month, the Environmental \nProtection Agency finalized the act's regulations, properly \nestablishing the scope of waters needing to be protected by the Clean \nWater Act in order to meet the national objective. The Clean Water \nRestoration Act would codify the regulations the federal agencies have \nused to enforce the Clean Water Act for over 30 years. This is \nnecessary to prevent the judicial branch from re-defining ``navigable \nwaters'' as something other than the ``waters of the United States.''\n  The bill's ``findings'' make it clear that Congress' primary concern \nin 1972 was to protect the Nation's waters from pollution rather than \njust sustain the navigability of waterways, and it reinforces that \noriginal intent. It also asserts Congress' constitutional authority, \nwhich extends beyond the Commerce Clause to the Property Clause, Treaty \nClause, and Necessary and Proper Clause, to protect the Nation's \nwaters.\n  While the Clean Water Restoration Act is critical to preventing the \ncourts from rewriting the law and thus further reducing the protections \nafforded to our Nation's waters under the Clean Water Act, the bill is \nremarkably simple and does not do many things.\n  The bill does not prohibit development or other activities that \ndischarge pollutants into waters. Complying with the Clean Water Act \nrequires following a process that seeks to evaluate proposed activities \nand minimize impacts by ensuring certain pollution standards or \nenvironmental criteria are met. The vast majority of permit requests \nare granted, and most are granted through expedited ``general'' permits \nrather than individual permits that require site-specific \ndeterminations.\n  The bill does not change the existing permitting process. Rather, the \nbill will provide much-needed clarity. The Supreme Court decisions have \ncaused a lot of confusion, and the Corps of Engineers nationally has \naround 20,000 jurisdictional determinations pending. The regulated \ncommunity, as well as state and federal agencies, will once again have \na clear understanding that Clean Water Act protections extend to the \nsame waters covered by the act for over thirty years.\n  The bill does not change the EPA and Corps' existing regulations or \nany aspect of the regulatory programs, in fact, as stated above, the \nbill defines waters of the U.S. based on the regulations that have been \nin place since the early 1970s.\n  The bill does not change the activities that are regulated. This \nmeans it does not change or overrule current exemptions related to \nfarming, forestry, ranching, and infrastructure maintenance that have \nbeen in place since 1977. Activities such as plowing, seeding, \ncultivating, and harvesting; and constructing and maintaining farm or \nstock ponds, irrigation ditches, and farm or forest roads have been \nexempted from permitting requirements and will remain so under this \nbill.\n  The bill does not create duplicative State and Federal permitting \nprocesses. The Clean Water Act created an important Federal-State \npartnership, and States can choose to assume from the Corps the dredge \nand fill permitting program, Section 404, or the EPA's NPDES permitting \nprogram for point sources, Section 402.\n  The bill does not preempt state and local authority under the Clean \nWater Act. However, without the bill many State programs are in \njeopardy because many States developed their own clean water laws so \nthat they hinge entirely on the Federal Clean Water Act, and do not \nhave separate state programs to fully address any voids left by the \nremoval of Federal clean water protections. Also, some states prohibit \ntheir state laws from being any more protective than the Federal law. \nThis means that if the Federal Clean Water Act's protections are \ncurtailed, then the State's protections are also reduced.\n  Statements that this bill would ``expand the scope of the Clean Water \nAct'' are disingenuous at best. For over 30 years, all ``waters of the \nUnited States'' have been regulated and Congress should not stand by \nwhile the courts and certain special interests roll back the critical \nprotections afforded by the Clean Water Act.\n  Congress must provide the needed leadership to clarify the intent of \nthe Clean Water Act. Such action must ensure that all waters of the \nU.S., waters that are valuable for drinking, fishing, swimming, and a \nhost of other economically vital uses, not just navigability, remain \nprotected. After decades of progress, now is not the time to turn back \nthe clock. I hope my colleagues will join me in reaffirming an \nimportant clean water pledge to the America people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Water Restoration Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To reaffirm the original intent of Congress in enacting \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 \n     (86 Stat. 816) to restore and maintain the chemical, \n     physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the \n     United States.\n       (2) To clearly define the waters of the United States that \n     are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     (commonly known as the ``Clean Water Act'').\n       (3) To provide protection to the waters of the United \n     States to the fullest extent of the legislative authority of \n     Congress under the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Water is a unique and precious resource that is \n     necessary to sustain human life and the life of animals and \n     plants.\n       (2) Water is used not only for human, animal, and plant \n     consumption, but is also important for agriculture, \n     transportation, flood control, energy production, recreation, \n     fishing and shellfishing, and municipal and commercial uses.\n       (3) Through prior enactments, Congress established the \n     national objective of restoring and maintaining the chemical, \n     physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the \n     United States and recognized that achieving this objective \n     requires uniform, minimum national water quality and aquatic \n     ecosystem protection standards to restore and maintain the \n     natural structures and functions of the aquatic ecosystems of \n     the United States. Since the 1970s, the definitions of \n     ``waters of the United States'' in the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency's and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' \n     regulations have properly established the scope of waters \n     needed to be protected by the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) in order to meet the national \n     objective.\n       (4) Water is transported through interconnected hydrologic \n     cycles, and the pollution, impairment, or destruction of any \n     part of an aquatic system may affect the chemical, physical, \n     and biological integrity of other parts of the aquatic \n     system.\n       (5) Protection of intrastate waters is necessary to restore \n     and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity \n     of all waters in the United States.\n       (6) The regulation of discharges of pollutants into \n     intrastate waters is an integral part of the comprehensive \n     clean water regulatory program of the United States.\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\n       (7) Small and intermittent streams, including ephemeral and \n     seasonal streams, comprise the majority of all stream miles \n     in the United States and serve critical biological and \n     hydrological functions that affect entire watersheds. These \n     waters reduce the introduction of pollutants to large streams \n     and rivers, provide and purify drinking water supplies, and \n     are especially important to the life cycles of aquatic \n     organisms and the flow of higher order streams during floods.\n       (8) The pollution or other degradation of waters of the \n     United States, individually and in the aggregate, has a \n     substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce.\n       (9) Protection of intrastate waters is necessary to prevent \n     significant harm to interstate commerce and sustain a robust \n     system of interstate commerce in the future.\n       (10) Waters, including streams and wetlands, provide \n     protection from flooding. Draining or filling intrastate \n     wetlands and channelizing or filling intrastate streams can \n     cause or exacerbate flooding that causes billions of dollars \n     of damages annually, placing a significant burden on \n     interstate commerce.\n       (11) Millions of people in the United States depend on \n     streams, wetlands, and other waters of the United States to \n     filter water and recharge surface and subsurface drinking \n     water supplies, protect human health, and create economic \n     opportunity. Source water protection areas containing small \n     or intermittent streams provide water to public drinking \n     water supplies serving more than 110 million Americans.\n       (12) Millions of people in the United States enjoy \n     recreational activities that depend on intrastate waters, \n     such as waterfowl hunting, bird watching, fishing, and \n     photography, and those activities and associated travel \n     generate hundreds of billions of dollars of income each year \n     for the travel, tourism, recreation, and sporting sectors of \n     the economy of the United States.\n       (13) Activities that result in the discharge of pollutants \n     into waters of the United States are commercial or economic \n     in nature. More than 14,000 facilities with individual \n     permits issued in accordance with the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), including industrial \n     plants and municipal sewage treatment systems, discharge into \n     small or intermittent streams.\n       (14) States have the responsibility and right to prevent, \n     reduce, and eliminate pollution of waters, and the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act respects the rights and \n     responsibilities of States by preserving for States the \n     ability to manage permitting, grant, and research programs to \n     prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, and to establish \n     standards and programs more protective of a State's waters \n     than is provided under Federal standards and programs.\n       (15) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is a necessary and \n     proper means of implementing treaties to which the United \n     States is a party, including treaties protecting species of \n     fish, birds, and wildlife.\n       (16) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is a necessary and \n     proper means of protecting Federal land, including hundreds \n     of millions of acres of parkland, refuge land, and other land \n     under Federal ownership and the wide array of waters \n     encompassed by that land.\n       (17) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is necessary to \n     protect Federal land and waters from discharges of pollutants \n     and other forms of degradation.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1362) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (7);\n       (2) by redesignating paragraphs (8) through (24) as \n     paragraphs (7) through (23), respectively; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(24) Waters of the united states.--The term `waters of \n     the United States' means all waters subject to the ebb and \n     flow of the tide, the territorial seas, and all interstate \n     and intrastate waters and their tributaries, including lakes, \n     rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, \n     sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, \n     playa lakes, natural ponds, and all impoundments of the \n     foregoing, to the fullest extent that these waters, or \n     activities affecting these waters, are subject to the \n     legislative power of Congress under the Constitution.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et \n     seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``navigable waters of the United States'' \n     each place it appears and inserting ``waters of the United \n     States'';\n       (2) in section 304(l)(1) by striking ``navigable waters'' \n     in the heading and inserting ``waters of the united states''; \n     and\n       (3) by striking ``navigable waters'' each place it appears \n     and inserting ``waters of the United States''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to provide for special transfers of funds to States \nto promote certain improvements in State unemployment compensation \nlaws; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Snowe, Rockefeller, Warner, and Cantwell in introducing the \nUnemployment Insurance Modernization Act, a bipartisan proposal to \nreform our unemployment insurance system.\n  In today's troubled economy, too many working families are just one \npink slip away from falling into poverty. The most recent recession hit \nworkers particularly hard, wiping out millions of good jobs, many of \nwhich never came back. Today, almost 7 million Americans are \nunemployed.\n  Fundamental shifts in the economy, including globalization and jobs \nbeing shipped overseas have caused declines in entire industries, with \nthe result that large numbers are losing their long-time jobs and \nstruggling to find new opportunities for work. But their options for \nnew jobs are limited, and nearly one in six unemployed Americans are \nout of work for longer than 6 months. Another 1.5 million unemployed \nworkers aren't even counted in the official unemployment statistics, \nbecause they have become frustrated and have given up their job search.\n  The Federal Unemployment Insurance program was created in the \nDepression-era to help keep workers out of poverty between jobs. It has \nbeen a bedrock of security for working families in difficult times, \nproviding much needed benefits to millions of workers each year. It has \nhelped them pay the rent and put food on the table when they lose their \njob and face long periods of unemployment. It also has helped reduce \neconomic fluctuations by building up a reserve of funds in good \neconomic times that can be used as a cushion to soften the blow of job \nlosses during recessions.\n  The problem is that the current unemployment insurance system has not \nkept pace with the changing economy and left millions of Americans \nwithout benefits. In 2006, just 35 percent of unemployed Americans \nreceived unemployment benefits. In addition, today's much more mobile \nworkforce means that employees are now at greater risk of suffering \nunemployment.\n  These problems particularly affect low-wage workers. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, low-wage workers are only half as \nlikely to receive UI benefits as other unemployed workers, even though \nlow-wage workers are twice as likely to be unemployed.\n  Modernizing unemployment insurance cannot single-handedly overcome \nall of the economic challenges facing our Nation, but it's a critical \nstep in dealing with the hardships so many working families are facing.\n  The current unemployment insurance program was designed as a \npartnership between states and the Federal\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\nGovernment. States are given extraordinary flexibility to tailor the \nprogram's benefits to their unique situations, and many of them have \nbeen the laboratories of democracy in improving their unemployment \ninsurance systems. Their experiments have often been successful in \nmaking the system more responsive to workers' needs.\n  Some have improved coverage for low-wage and part-time workers. \nOthers have made their systems more family-friendly, or have helped \ndislocated workers expand their skills through training.\n  Our Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act builds on these \nsuccesses by offering States strong financial incentives to adopt the \nbest of the new programs.\n  First, the bill encourages States to cover more low-wage workers. In \n30 states, many unemployed low-wage workers are not eligible for UI \nbenefits because their most recent earnings are not counted. But \nfailure to count these earnings may deny benefits altogether to some \nworkers, and reduces the amount that many other workers receive. Our \nbill provides incentives for States to fix this unfair practice.\n  Changing family life has also left many workers unable to collect \nunemployment benefits. Today, two-wage earner families are the norm, \nnot the exception. When a parent moves to a different city to take a \nnew job, the spouse usually has to quit work as well to keep their \nfamily together. But spouses cannot collect unemployment benefits in \nmost States, nor can victims of domestic violence, if they have to \nleave work to find safety elsewhere, out of reach of their abuser. Our \nlegislation encourages States to provide benefits in these cases as \nwell.\n  In addition to expanding the eligibility for benefits, our bill also \nsupports state efforts to reemploy workers laid off by declining \nindustries. Currently, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program offers \nretraining benefits to some workers directly affected by trade, so that \nthey can learn new skills and find worthwhile jobs in other industries. \nBut employees who are only indirectly affected by trade often receive \nno benefits. Our bill helps close that gap by encouraging States to \noffer additional benefits to unemployed workers attending State-\napproved training programs.\n  Finally, our legislation provides needed funds to States to manage \ntheir unemployment insurance programs and reach out to workers. Many \nStates are now forced to shut their unemployment offices because they \ncan't afford to keep them open, leaving unemployed workers without any \ncounseling to find new work or learn about the benefits available to \nthem. These employment offices also provide a way for other programs, \nsuch as Trade Adjustment Assistance, to reach out to affected workers.\n  The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act will provide greater \nsecurity to countless working families who are being left in the cold \ntoday. It will help long-term unemployed workers get the training they \nneed to find new jobs. It will give States the resources and \nflexibility they need to revitalize their programs and serve working \nfamilies more effectively.\n  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are joining to \nintroduce this important legislation. We all agree that now is the time \nfor these reforms. In the global economy, it is more urgent than ever \nfor every American worker to be able to contribute to the economy. To \nachieve that goal, we need to make sure that all unemployed workers \nhave the support they need to get back on their feet and rejoin the \nworkforce. Our future prosperity depends on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1872.

A bill to prohibit extraterritorial detention and rendition, \nexcept under limited circumstances, to modify the definition of \n``unlawful enemy combatant'' for purposes of military commissions, to \nextend statutory habeas corpus to detainees, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. One of the defining challenges of our age is to \neffectively combat international terrorism while maintaining our \nnational values and our commitment to the rule of law, and respecting \nindividual rights and civil liberties. To fight terrorist organizations \nwhose tactics include blending into our cities and communities and \nattacking civilian populations engaged in the activities of everyday \nlife, we must have robust and agile intelligence capabilities. \nRendition, detaining a terrorist operative in one foreign country and \ntransfering him to the United States or to another foreign country to \nface justice, has proved to be one effective means of taking terrorists \noff the streets and collecting valuable intelligence.\n  Despite its effectiveness, however, the U.S. Government's use of \nrendition has been controversial. Foreign governments have criticized \nthe practice as ungoverned by law and on the basis of its alleged use \nto transfer suspects to countries that torture or mistreat them or to \nsecret, extraterritorial prisons. The toll the rendition program, as \ncurrently practiced, has had on relationships with some of our closest \nforeign partners is evident from their responses.\n  Italy has indicted 26 Americans for their alleged role in a \nrendition. Germany has issued arrest warrants for an additional 13 U.S. \nintelligence officers. A Canadian Government commission has censured \nthe United States for rendering a Canadian/Syrian dual citizen to \nSyria. The Council of Europe and the European Union have each issued \nreports critical of the U.S. Government's rendition program and \nEuropean countries' involvement or complicity in it. Sweden and \nSwitzerland have each initiated investigations as well. Today, the \nUnited Kingdom issued a report predicting that the U.S. Government's \nrendition program would have ``serious implications'' for the \nintelligence relation between the U.S. and U.K., one of our most \nimportant foreign partners. Rendition, as currently practiced, is \nundermining our moral credibility and standing abroad and weakening the \ncoalitions with foreign governments that we need to effectively combat \ninternational terrorism.\n  The controversial aspects of the U.S. Government's use of rendition \nhave also not escaped the notice of the propagandists and recruiters \nwho fuel and sustain international terrorist organizations with a \nconstant stream of new recruits. Allegations of lawlessness and \nmistreatment by the U.S. make their job easier, adding a refrain to \ntheir recruitment pitch and increasing the receptivity of their target \naudience.\n  Our counterterrorism authorities should not only thwart attacks, take \ndangerous terrorists off the streets, and bring them to justice; these \nauthorities should also strengthen international coalitions, draw \nMuslim populations around the world closer to us, and deprive \nterrorists of a recruitment narrative. In our long term effort to stem \nthe tide of international terrorism, our commitments to the rule of law \nand to individual rights and civil liberties are among our most \nformidable weapons. They are what unite foreign governments behind us \nin effective counterterrorism coalitions. They\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nare what unite public opinion in support of our counterterrorism \nefforts and in condemnation of the terrorists and their tactics. They \nare what prevent the recruitment of the next generation of \ninternational terrorists.\n  This bill maintains rendition as a robust and agile tool in our fight \nagainst international terrorism, but it brings that tool within the \nrule of law, provides additional safeguards against error, and \nprohibits rendering individuals to countries that will torture or \nmistreat them or to secret, extra-territorial prisons.\n  The bill establishes a classified application and order process, \npresided over by the FISA court that: 1. ensures that each rendition is \npreceded by a searching inquiry into the identity of the individual to \nbe rendered and his role in international terrorism and 2. prohibits \nrendition to countries that torture or mistreat detainees or to secret, \nextraterritorial prisons beyond the reach of law. It ensures that \ncitizens of, and individuals lawfully admitted to, the U.S. receive the \ndue process and individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It \nensures that a terrorist suspect detained by the U.S. has the \nopportunity, through a writ of habeas corpus, to argue in a court of \nlaw that he is being held in error.\n  This bill also closes a hole intentionally left open by the \nPresident's recent Executive Order on the treatment of detainees. The \nPresident's order is notably silent on some of the more controversial \ntechniques the CIA has allegedly used in the past, such as \nwaterboarding, extreme sleep deprivation, extreme sensory deprivation, \nand extremes of heat and cold. When we countenance this treatment of \ndetainees, we diminish our ability to argue that the same techniques \nshould not be used against our own troops.\n  We cannot continue to equivocate and dissemble on this matter. We \nneed to send a clear message that torture, inhumane, and degrading \ntreatment of detainees is unacceptable and is not permitted by U.S. \nlaw. Period. Therefore, my bill prohibits all officers and agents of \nthe United States from using techniques of interrogation not authorized \nby and listed in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Intelligence \nInterrogation.\n  As I said at the outset, this bill grapples with one of the defining \nissues of our age, how to effectively combat terrorism without \nsacrificing our national values and abandoning the rule of law. If we \ncontinue to pursue a rendition program ungoverned by law, without \nsufficient safeguards and oversight, we will perpetuate a short term \nsolution that exacerbates the long term problem. We will take \nindividual terrorists off the streets at the expense of the foreign \ncoalitions that are essential to our efforts to combat international \nterrorism, at the expense of facilitating the recruitment of a new \ngeneration of terrorists who are just as dangerous and far more \nnumerous.\n  This is not a trade-off we have to make. We can have a robust and \nagile rendition capability governed by the rule of law and subject to \nsufficient safeguards and oversight. That is what the National Security \nwith Justice Act creates. I invite my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and in the other branches of Government to work with me to refine \nthis legal framework so that we not only take today's terrorists off \nthe streets, we strengthen our standing and credibility among foreign \ngovernments and the global community, and we prevent tomorrow's \nterrorists from being recruited.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Virginia is fortunate to have 8 \nnative sons that went on to become President of the U.S. This is a \ndistinction that has led our fair Commonwealth to be known as the \n``Mother of Presidents.'' The bipartisan bill we introduce today honors \nthe most recent of the eight and a native of Staunton, Virginia: \nWoodrow Wilson.\n  Woodrow Wilson was one of the most influential statesmen, scholars, \nand Presidents in American history. His impact on domestic and \ninternational affairs is undeniable. Only now, nearly 100 years after \nhis presidency, are we able to fully appreciate the contributions \nPresident Wilson made to the U.S. and to the world.\n  As a professor and President of Princeton University, Wilson created \na more accountable system for higher education. Through curriculum \nreform, Wilson revolutionized the roles of teachers and students and \nquickly made Princeton one of the most renowned universities in the \nworld.\n  As a scholar, Wilson wrote numerous books and became an accomplished \nessayist. Highly regarded for his work in political science, Wilson's \ndissertation, entitled Congressional Government, is still admired today \nas a study of federal lawmaking. He did this notwithstanding the fact \nthat he could not read until he was ten years old and may have suffered \nfrom a learning disability such as dyslexia.\n  As a statesman and President, Wilson compiled a record of domestic \nlegislation that set the groundwork for modern America and reflected \nhis belief in the ideal that: ``Liberty does not consist . . . in mere \ngeneral declarations of the rights of man. It consists in the \ntranslation of those declarations into definite action.'' He \nspearheaded groundbreaking reform in finance, trade, industry and \nlabor, including anti-trust and child labor laws and women's suffrage. \nDuring his two terms in office, he oversaw the birth of the Federal \nReserve System and the Federal Trade Commission.\n  In spite of Wilson's significant contributions to American history \nand his instrumental role in shaping the framework of the modern \ninternational landscape, there exists no authorized Presidential \nlibrary dedicated to his achievements.\n  For the last 70 years, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library \nFoundation in Staunton, Virginia has admirably served as caretaker of \nWilson's papers and artifacts, dedicating itself to the preservation of \nWilson's legacy. But it has done so without the resources afforded to \nother Presidential libraries in the Federal system. Over time, the \nFoundation has outgrown its current space and facilities. Now, with \neach day that passes, the prevailing physical infrastructure severely \nlimits educational capabilities and opportunities to share the profound \nlegacy of President Wilson. Indeed, the foundation has even become \nreluctant to take on many new major new Wilson collections because its \ncurrent controlled archival system is filled to capacity and cannot \nprotect additional collections in the absence of the new facility.\n  Accordingly, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Authorization \nAct authorizes a one-time capital grant from the National Archives for \nthe establishment of an independent Woodrow Wilson Presidential \nLibrary. This library will serve as the center for education and study \nof Woodrow Wilson's life and legacies, and will enable people from this \ncountry and abroad to learn more about the life and work of our \nNation's 28th President. To be clear, this bill would establish the \nWoodrow Wilson Presidential Library as an independent, privately-run \ninstitution operating outside the existing Presidential Library System.\n  The Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Foundation will use the \nFederal funds to offset costs associated with the construction of a \n29,000 square foot Presidential library honoring President Wilson. As \nplanned, the library would include a research library, archives, \nlecture hall, reception hall, orientation theater, ceremonial space, \nand exhibit hall. These funds authorized under this legislation \nrepresent the full Federal share of the project. Significantly, the \nbill does not authorize ongoing operating subsidies on any other \nongoing expenses. This is a one time authorization.\n  The foundation's endeavor to construct the Woodrow Wilson \nPresidential Library will create the only site in the country dedicated \nto the exploration of the full life and legacies of the 28th President, \nat his birthplace in Staunton, VA. A new library will alleviate stress \non existing foundation facilities and to allow for increased \neducational outreach to the benefit of students in Virginia and across \nthe U.S. Construction of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library would \nachieve the following objectives:\n\n       Make possible collaboration with the National Archives and \n     other presidential libraries, thereby fostering increased \n     awareness and study of American history and the institution \n     of the Presidency. Integrate cutting-edge digital archive \n     development. Promote tourism to Staunton and the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia to the benefit of all local economies.\n\n  Sensitive to the budgetary constraints faced by the National \nArchives, let me reiterate we have crafted this legislation to minimize \nand cap the financial burden on the Federal Government posed by this \nproject. First, the bill ensures the existence of a strong public-\nprivate sponsorship by mandating that any Federal dollars are matched \ntwo-for-one by the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Foundation and \nonly after the nonfederal funds are certified to be in possession of \nthe nonprofit entity, an arrangement that Congress has used in the \npast.\n  This legislation States that the Federal Government shall have no \nrole or responsibility for the operation of the library and guarantees \nthat the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library will operate outside the \nexisting Presidential Library System. This is not an effort by the \nnonprofit foundation to secure annual operating subsidies along the \nlines of what Congress provides all Presidential Libraries in the \nexisting system.\n  This legislation enjoys broad, bipartisan, bicameral support in \nCongress and broad support among individuals, organizations and \nofficials across the country. This bill is identical to legislation \napproved by the House of Representatives by voice vote in the 109th \nCongress on September 28, 2006, and which the entire Virginia House \ndelegation has reintroduced in the 110th Congress. I would note that \nthe Governor of Virginia has written Senator Warner and me to endorse \nthe project. So too have other regional officials, historians, and \nrepresentatives of other Presidential sites throughout the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, including Monticello, Poplar Forest, Montpelier, Ash-Lawn, \nand Mount Vernon.\n  This project has the potential to benefit not only the greater \nStaunton region, but Virginia and the Nation as a whole, both from a \nhistorical/educational sense and by strengthening an important cultural \nasset in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. We are advised that a new \nbuilding will be an open, welcoming forum for the hundreds of thousands \nof American and foreign visitors who will visit each year to learn \nabout Woodrow Wilson and his\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\ndemocratic legacies. The project sponsors believe that the country's \nbest museum designers will work with historians to turn the story of \nWoodrow Wilson into an unforgettable experience that is fun, \neducational, and permanently memorable.\n  In order to increase the awareness and understanding of the life, \nprinciples and accomplishments of the 28th President of the U.S., I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure that Wilson's \nlegacy is more accessible and available for a wider audience for years \nto come. I am hopeful that the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs will consider this legislation favorably and that \nwe can enact it during the remainder of this Congressional session. \nWith the 100th anniversary of his election just 5 years away, this is \nthe time for Congress to accept its responsibility to help preserve \nPresident Woodrow Wilson's legacy and to improve its accessibility for \ngenerations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1878\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GRANTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WOODROW WILSON \n                   PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY.\n\n       (a) Grants Authorized.--Subject to subsections (b), (c), \n     and (d), the Archivist of the National Archives and Records \n     Administration may make grants to contribute funds for the \n     establishment in Staunton, Virginia, of a library to preserve \n     and make available materials related to the life of President \n     Woodrow Wilson and to provide interpretive and educational \n     services that communicate the meaning of the life of Woodrow \n     Wilson.\n       (b) Limitation.--A grant may be made under subsection (a) \n     only from funds appropriated to the Archivist specifically \n     for that purpose.\n       (c) Conditions on Grants.--\n       (1) Matching requirement.--A grant under subsection (a) may \n     not be made until such time as the entity selected to receive \n     the grant certifies to the Archivist that funds have been \n     raised from non-Federal sources for use to establish the \n     library in an amount equal to at least double the amount of \n     the grant.\n       (2) Relation to other woodrow wilson sites and museums.--\n     The Archivist shall further condition a grant under \n     subsection (a) on the agreement of the grant recipient to \n     operate the resulting library in cooperation with other \n     Federal and non-Federal historic sites, parks, and museums \n     that represent significant locations or events in the life of \n     Woodrow Wilson. Cooperative efforts to promote and interpret \n     the life of Woodrow Wilson may include the use of cooperative \n     agreements, cross references, cross promotion, and shared \n     exhibits.\n       (d) Prohibition of Contribution of Operating Funds.--Grant \n     amounts may not be used for the maintenance or operation of \n     the library.\n       (e) Non-Federal Operation.--The Archivist shall have no \n     involvement in the actual operation of the library, except at \n     the request of the non-Federal entity responsible for the \n     operation of the library.\n       (f) Authority Through Fiscal Year 2011.--The Archivist may \n     not use the authority provided under subsection (a) after \n     September 30, 2011.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Jim Webb, \nto introduce legislation that seeks to establish the Woodrow Wilson \nPresidential Library.\n  President Woodrow Wilson was born in Staunton, VA, in 1856. He was \nfirst elected to the Presidency in 1912 and was reelected in 1916. \nThroughout his lifetime, Wilson advocated engagement with other nations \nin the search for peace, expansion of economic opportunities to more \nAmericans, commitment to democratic principles at home and abroad, and \nprotection of the Nation's people and institutions. He created the \nFederal Reserve and was President when women were finally granted the \nright to vote. President Wilson's legacy and historical significance \nare forever linked with his profound efforts in World War I and its \naftermath, particularly with his attempts to broker a lasting peace in \na fractured Europe. He was a man of ideals, always maintaining a \n``simple faith in the freedom of democracy.'' It is the utter strength \nof his faith in democracy that continues to inspire our Nation today.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have witnessed the growth and \ndevelopment of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and have seen \nfirsthand the benefits it has provided for its community, the \nCommonwealth, and the country. The library has done remarkable work in \npreserving and protecting historical documents related to Woodrow \nWilson's life. Equally remarkable has been its ability to share his \nlife with communities around the world.\n  As you know, Virginia is often referred to as the ``Birthplace of \nPresidents,'' as it has produced more Presidents than any other State \nin the Union, eight in total. I want to respectfully acknowledge our \nmost recent President from the Commonwealth of Virginia through the \nrecognition of this Presidential library. I can think of no better \nplace to preserve his life's work than where his life began.\n  I thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this important \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to honor President Wilson's legacy by \njoining me in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/25/senate-section/article/S9927-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9927-S9929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2402.
