Mr. President, we are now 5\\1/2\\ years into the war in \nIraq. We have been at war longer now than we fought in World War II, \nand we are creating hundreds of new veterans each and every year. Yet, \ntoo often, what we have seen is that this administration has failed to \nacknowledge the price our veterans and their families are paying in \nservice. From the shameful conditions at Walter Reed Hospital a year \nago, and VA facilities across the country, to a lack of mental health \ncounselors, to a benefit claims backlog of months and sometimes years \nfor our\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nveterans, our veterans have had to struggle to get the basic care they \nwere promised. And now, just this week, in the last few days, we got \nmore evidence that this administration has been covering up the extent \nof the toll this war has taken on our troops.\n  Internal e-mails that became public in a court hearing showed that \nthe VA has vastly downplayed the number of suicides and suicide \nattempts by veterans in the last several years.\n  Last November, an analysis by CBS News found that over 6,200 veterans \nhad, sadly, committed suicide in 2005. That is an average of 17 a day. \nWhen they were confronted then, the VA said: Oh, no, no, no, those \nnumbers are much lower than that. Now we find that according to \ninternal e-mails from the VA's head of mental health, Dr. Ira Katz, \n6,570 veterans actually committed suicide in 2005, an average of 18 a \nday. Those e-mails also revealed that VA officials also knew that \nanother 1,000 veterans who are receiving care at our VA medical \nfacilities attempt suicide each month. Those numbers offer tragic \nevidence that our Nation is failing thousands of veterans every year, \nand they reflect an administration that has failed to own up to its \nresponsibilities and failed even to own up to the true impact of the \nwar on our veterans.\n  What is most appalling to me is that this is not the first time the \nVA has covered up the problems facing our veterans who have sacrificed \nfor our country. Time and again, this VA told us one thing in public \nwhile saying something completely different in private. It is \noutrageous to me that our VA officials would put public appearance \nahead of people's lives. Yet it appears that is what is happening again \nand again.\n  When we as Members of Congress sit down to try to determine what \nresources we need to give to the VA, we have to truly understand what \nis going on. If there is a problem, we have to act. It is our duty and \nthe duty of this administration to care for our veterans. By covering \nup the true extent of the problem, the VA has actually hindered our \nability to get those resources to the veterans who need them. That is \nirresponsible, and it is wrong.\n  I have come to the floor today because we now have an opportunity to \nextend benefits to our veterans. These benefits that are in the bill \nthat is before the Senate today will help them with job training, \ninsurance, housing, and other matters. The bill that is before us \noffers veterans peace of mind and will help them to readjust as they \ncome home to civilian life.\n  The Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act the Senate is currently \nconsidering expands traumatic injury insurance. It increases job \ntraining--vital to many of our veterans who are coming home. It extends \nhousing benefits to veterans with severe burns, something we have to \ndo. And critically, it restores limited pension benefits to Filipino \nveterans who fought for our country in World War II.\n\n  This is a bill that we have done in our VA Committee that normally \nwould come to the floor and pass straight through this body by \nunanimous consent. It is budget neutral, and it works to provide long \noverdue care for some of our Nation's heroes. But, instead, this bill \nhas languished for 9 months. Why? Because the Republicans chose \nobstruction over our veterans. The majority leader and our chairman, \nSenator Akaka, have worked since last August to try to come to an \nagreement. They have tried to come to the floor and work out amendments \nand figure out a way to move this bill forward. But for 9 months the \nRepublicans preferred to play political games and block this critically \nimportant bill. It is just part of an overall pattern we have seen on \nthis floor with numerous bills we have been trying to bring forward.\n  Today, finally we have come to an agreement--late, but finally have \ncome to an agreement--and the Republicans have agreed to move this bill \nforward.\n  Later this morning, we are going to have the opportunity to vote for \nlegislation that extends important benefits to help our veterans \ntransition back into civilian life. It expands home-improvement \nbenefits to completely disabled servicemembers before they enter the VA \nsystem to help them adapt to their new homes. This will prevent months \nor even years of delays while they transition from the military into \nthe VA care. The bill we are considering extends monthly educational \nassistance for veterans who are pursuing an apprenticeship or on-the-\njob training, and it requires the National Academy of Sciences to study \nthe risk of developing multiple sclerosis as a result of serving in \nconflicts since the gulf war. This last piece is one I have worked on \nextensively, as I have worked with gulf war veterans in my State from \nthe early nineties who are now coming in with high rates of multiple \nsclerosis, to find out if there is a connection. It is a critical piece \nof legislation.\n  But I am disappointed that the Republicans object to the provision in \nthe bill before us that extends VA benefits to Filipino World War II \nveterans. Those now very elderly Filipino veterans were called to \nservice by our country and by President Roosevelt in 1941. They served \nright alongside our U.S. troops. They fought to protect our interests \nas they were asked to in the Pacific. They consider themselves to be \nAmerican troops, and we consider them to be part of our military.\n  We have a moral duty to repay their sacrifice by providing them with \nthe care they have earned, just as we should do with all of our \nveterans. But in 1946, when the war was over, our Nation turned its \nback on them and stripped away their rights to their veterans benefits. \nThat act of Congress denied those men the access to health care and \nlimited compensation to half of what their U.S. counterparts received. \nI believe that act of Congress was wrong, but I believe it is just as \nwrong that 62 years later we still have not corrected that injustice.\n  Some on the other side are saying those benefits are too generous. \nThose veterans have been denied benefits for over 60 years. How can we \nsay giving them a few hundred dollars in the last remaining months of \ntheir lives is too much? Sixty-two years later, those veterans are in \ntheir twilight years. They need and they deserve the care this country \nought to give them. We cannot make up for lost time for these veterans, \nbut certainly we can right this injustice. We have the opportunity \ntoday to do what is honorable, what is moral, and treat our Filipino \nveterans as the heroes they are, and it is long past time that we did.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill later this morning when we \nvote on it and to oppose the Burr substitute amendment which would \nremove those provisions for our Filipino veterans.\n  Our veterans have waited 9 months for this bill to come before the \nSenate. Our Filipino veterans have waited more than six decades. Our \nveterans have all earned these benefits by sacrificing for us. They \nshould not be forced to wait any longer.\n  To our VA which has continually hidden the facts from us, we need \nthem to be honest and forthright. This country wants to be there to \nsupport our veterans, and we cannot do that if we are being given \nmisinformation.\n  So my message to the VA is: We stand beside you as a country to work \nto make sure our veterans get the care and support they need. We expect \nyou to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever leader time I \nmay use.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3338-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3338-S3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                208TH ANNIVERSARY OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Library of Congress celebrates \ntoday its 208th anniversary. On this day in 1800, President John Adams \napproved the appropriation of $5,000 for the purchase of such books as \nmay be necessary for the use of Congress.\n  The original collection included just 740 volumes and 3 maps, which \nare stored right here in the Capitol. In fact, what is now the \nreception area of the Republican leader's office was the Library's very \nfirst home. When British troops burned the Capitol building in 1814, \nthey used the books and maps of the Library to ignite the flames, and \nall 3,000 volumes in the collection were destroyed.\n  Several years ago, when British Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed a \njoint session of Congress, he visited the leader's suite and told then-\nmajority\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\nleader Bill Frist that although it was coming a bit late, he was sorry \nfor the fire incident.\n  Today, the Library of Congress is the largest library in the world. \nThere are more than 138 million items, including books, recordings, \nphotographs, maps, sheet music, and manuscripts. At the Library of \nCongress, access to this wonderful resource is no longer limited to \nMembers of Congress. Today, the general public can browse everything \nfrom Presidential papers to books in over 470 languages, dating as far \nback as the 15th century.\n  Two hundred eight years after its launch, the Library is renowned for \nits original mission of making resources available and useful to the \nCongress and the American people and sustaining and preserving a \nuniversal collection of knowledge and creativity for future \ngenerations. Over 3,500 staff members work for the Library, and we \nthank them for doing so much to keep our rich history and heritage \nalive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3339-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LOWER GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another issue, 2 years ago today, \nDemocrats announced they had a commonsense plan to lower gas prices. \nWhen Democrats took over control of Congress last January, the average \nprice of a gallon of gas was $2.32. Today, it is $3.53, according to \nAAA. Apparently, their commonsense plan is not working as intended.\n  In fact, since taking control of Congress last year, Democrats not \nonly failed to deliver on their promise to lower gas prices, they have \nrepeatedly pushed for policies that in fact would raise, not lower, \nprices at the pump. Every week, I hear from Kentuckians who are feeling \nthe squeeze each time they fill up their tanks. High gas prices hurt \nfamilies, hurt commuters, hurt truckers, who are paying record prices \nfor diesel, and drive up the prices of daily necessities, including \nfood. Yet some of our friends, reverting to form, appear to have no \nplan except to increase taxes on energy companies, which of course will \nraise prices for consumers, not lower them.\n  At a time of record-high gas prices, Democrats want to tax them to \neven higher levels. The reality is high gas prices are the result of \nmisguided policies that have been in place for many years and will take \ntime to bring down. For example, for too long we have kept too much of \nAmerica's oil and gas resources locked up, literally off limits and \nunavailable to help America's families meet their energy needs. This \nhas left us 60 percent dependent on foreign sources of oil and \nvulnerable to price hikes and the whims of foreign governments.\n  We took a small step last Congress when we opened an area in the Gulf \nof Mexico to energy production, but there is much more we can and \nshould do if we want to have a meaningful impact on supplies and prices \nin the long term. Back in 1995, when President Clinton vetoed a bill \nopening a very small portion of the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge to \nexploration, the price of oil was $19 a barrel. Over a decade later, \nwhen a million barrels a day from ANWR would have been flowing to U.S. \nconsumers, oil is $118 a barrel. While there is not much Government can \ndo to lower gas prices overnight, this was a policy that, had it not \nbeen vetoed 13 years ago, could be making a difference today.\n  Democrats have also blocked proposals to increase refining capacity, \nwhich would lead to additional supplies and lower prices. We have had \nsome successes when we have acted in a reasonable, bipartisan way, as \nwe did when we raised the fuel economy standards and increased the use \nof renewable fuels in last year's Energy bill. But we will not have a \nbalanced, effective, sensible energy policy until we also address the \nissue of making more of America's energy here at home available to \nAmerican customers.\n  So we want to know what is the Democrats' commonsense plan to lower \ngas prices? It was announced 2 years ago. What is it? We haven't seen \nit yet. What is taking them so long to unveil it? The American people \nare waiting and paying more at the pump each day they wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3339-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3339-S3340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Corporal Christopher Tyler Warndorf\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a young man \nfrom Kentucky who was lost in the performance of his duty. CPL \nChristopher Tyler Warndorf, of Burlington, KY, was tragically killed on \nAugust 29, 2006, in Iraq's Al Anbar Province, after an explosion set by \nterrorists went off.\n  A U.S. marine, he was 23 years old. Corporal Warndorf's mother Tina \nexplains the circumstances of her son's death and how he died a hero.\n\n       The suicide bomber's plan was to come through the gates of \n     their base. Tyler stopped him before that happened.\n\n  For his bravery in uniform, Corporal Warndorf received several \nmedals, awards, and decorations, including the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, and the Purple Heart.\n  Looking back, it is clear Tyler's service to his country, and indeed \nhis entire life, was a gift. Tina remembers how she and Tyler's father \nChristopher Joseph Warndorf were once told they could not expect to \nhave children.\n\n       A month before we were to be married, the doctors told us \n     children would not be possible. We were ecstatic when we \n     found out we were going to have a baby. It was a pretty high-\n     risk pregnancy and a tough delivery. Tyler came in fighting \n     and left fighting.\n\n  Tina and Christopher went on to have three children in all--Nicholas \nand Katelyn soon joined eldest son Tyler, who went by his middle name \nbecause Tina didn't want to hear her son called Little Chris.\n  As a child, Tyler had to wear braces to straighten his legs. But that \ndidn't stop him from going on to play sports and becoming a leader of \nother kids both on and off the playing field.\n  Tina remembers:\n\n       Tyler was often teased for being so small. When he went out \n     for football, he was so small none of the gear would fit him. \n     The coach got gear from the peewee football league and told \n     me he was on the team because of his heart, his soul, and his \n     determination.\n\n  In addition to playing football and soccer as a kid, Tyler was active \nin his church, the First Church of Christ in Burlington. He convinced \nhis family to join as well and made friends through the church's youth \ngroup.\n  Tina remembers how little trouble Tyler gave her growing up.\n\n       He always told me where he was going to be. I wish all \n     parents could have that relationship with their kids. Tyler \n     set the bar with Katelyn and Nick because they saw how I \n     trusted him. There was never a reason to worry.\n\n  Tyler was interested in bridges and architecture and for a while set \nhis sights on becoming a structural engineer. After a family visit to \nCalifornia, he thought about going to school there. But then came the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and those plans changed.\n  Tina said:\n\n       When 9/11 happened, he came and told me he was going to \n     join. He loved the Marines. He excelled at it.\n\n  Tyler enlisted in the Marine Corps in the fall of 2003, a few months \nafter graduating from Conner High School. He spent the whole summer \nbeforehand running and getting in shape. He was assigned to Lima \nCompany, 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, based \nin Camp Lejeune, NC, and was eventually sent to Iraq under the First \nMarine Expeditionary Force, Forward.\n  As a marine, Tyler deployed once to Haiti and twice to Iraq. While \nserving in Haiti, Tyler was appalled to see children forced to scavenge \nfor food and eat out of garbage cans. He sent to his family a list of \nfood to send, which he passed out to the neediest kids.\n  Tyler did not let the thousands of miles between Iraq and Kentucky \nweaken the bonds between him and his family. His little sister Katelyn \nreceived a special birthday present when she turned 13. Tyler had 13 \nwhite roses delivered to her class at Conner Middle School, while over \nthe intercom a tape of Tyler singing ``Happy Birthday'' played. It was \na touching gift from a big brother who, had he been there, would surely \nbe looking over Katelyn's report card, as he had in the past. ``He made \nsure we got good grades,'' Katelyn remembers of Tyler. ``If not, he \nwould give us a talking-to.''\n  Tyler's family was blessed to receive a phone call from him in Iraq \nbefore his tragic death, on the happy occasion of a new niece born into \nthe family. ``My daughter and I got to talk to him 45\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nminutes before he was killed,'' Tina recalls. ``If anything, it was \ncomforting, because if it had been weeks, it would have been really \nhard.''\n  The support the Warndorf family received during Tyler's funeral was \nof tremendous solace.\n  Tina said:\n\n       I didn't expect what we received. Streets were lined the \n     entire way to the funeral. I had no idea. For the visitation, \n     the people gave me strength. Over 4,000 people visited. They \n     will never know how much their support and kindness meant.\n\n  One of those supporters was Tyler's captain, who used to invite Tyler \nto his house for dinner on weekends. He told the Warndorfs that Tyler \nwas such a wonderful person, he was as proud of him as if he had been \nhis own son.\n  My prayers go out to the Warndorf family for the loss of this fine \nyoung man. We are thinking today of his mother Tina; his brother \nNicholas; his sister Katelyn; and many other beloved family members and \nfriends. Tyler was predeceased by his father Christopher Joseph \nWarndorf.\n  Tyler leaves behind many grateful people who were happy to have known \nhim and felt his presence in their lives. His mother Tina expresses \nthis feeling best of all, so I will leave my colleagues with her words:\n\n       Many soldiers commented on how amazing he was. This made me \n     very proud. He was my confidant, my son, and my best friend. \n     At least we got to have him at all.\n\n  The Senate salutes Christopher Tyler Warndorf for his service to his \ncountry. He reminded those who knew him what it was to be a hero, and \nwe will forever honor his noble sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3340-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3340-S3342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF THE FARM SECURITY AND RURAL INVESTMENT ACT OF \n                                  2002\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2903 introduced earlier \ntoday by myself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2903) to amend Public Law 110-196 to provide for \n     a temporary extension of programs authorized by the Farm \n     Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 beyond April 25, \n     2008.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the bill \nat the desk to insert the date May 9, 2008, in both paragraph 1 and \nparagraph 2, in lieu of May 2.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the \nmodification?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am inclined to object. This is no \nreflection at all on the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and the \nranking member. We are now 6 months into working on a new farm bill. In \n2 weeks, we will probably start grain harvest in the panhandle of \nTexas. Last week, I came to the floor in a sense of frustration and \nurgency for American agriculture, for the Congress to complete its \nwork. I am told by the chairman and the ranking member that a great \ndeal has been accomplished this week and a sense of urgency is \nbeginning to build. I would be willing to extend current farm policy \nfor another week while the principals work on the finalization of a new \nfarm bill because their work product is a good one. I am not here to \ndestroy it. I am here to say, on behalf of American agriculture, they \nare sensing urgency--it is time Congress senses urgency. Six months \nnegotiating a bill in most people's minds is about long enough.\n  So for a full 2-week extension, I will object. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Idaho that in \n1996 when that farm bill came up, it was 6 months late. It was signed \ninto law April 4, 6 months past due. I do not recall the Senator from \nIdaho raising any objections. He was here at that time. And that was an \neasy farm bill. This is a very tough one. It is tough because there are \ntax measures that have come into it--not of my doing, not of the doing \nof my ranking member. But the Finance Committee and others got involved \nin this, so we have tax measures that have been a long, drawn-out \nprocess. This has sort of been out of our jurisdiction.\n  Senator Chambliss and I have been dogged in getting the work done on \nthe Agriculture bill, and we have. I say to my friend from Idaho, if \nthis were only the Agriculture bill, we would have had this done a long \ntime ago. This has to do with tax measures. As such, neither Senator \nChambliss nor I have control of that; we are not chairman or ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee or Ways and Means.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, so they were 6 months overdue in 1996. \nSo we are over 6 months overdue right now. We are very close to getting \nthis agreement done. We worked today, worked yesterday, and things are \ncoming together. We made real progress. It has been slow, but it has \nbeen real. We have reached a number of agreements, and we are very \nclose to putting this together.\n  Why would we want a 2-week extension? The House is not even in \ntomorrow, for one thing. Then we have to finish this. We have to go \nback into full conference. There are some items that are going to \nrequire a little bit of debate and some votes. Even if we were to \nfinish this bill by next Wednesday, which I think is possible, it is \ngoing to take another week just to do the paperwork and get everything \ntogether. It is humanly impossible--humanly impossible--legislatively \nimpossible to get everything done in 1 week. That is why I asked for 2 \nweeks, because that is realistic. It is unrealistic, at this point in \ntime, on Thursday, to say we can get everything done by next Thursday. \nIt is just impossible. I want to be realistic.\n  I do not want to play any games around here. Frankly, we could finish \nour work, we can get the stuff done, but we can't get it all nailed \ndown, the paperwork done, all that stuff that has to be done to clean \nup everything to get it to this body and get it to the House for a vote \nby next week--legislatively impossible.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, you can either be realistic or \nunrealistic, you can help us out and be supportive of a process that \nhas taken a lot of time and effort by both Senator Chambliss and me, by \nRepublicans and Democrats. We have been working very hard on this, and \nwe are very close to getting it done. To put on just a 1-week extension \nis just unrealistic.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Chairman yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In everything I say, it is not a reflection on the work of \nthe Senate, it is a reflection of reality, and 1996 doesn't have \nanything to do with it. This is 2008, and agriculture today is \nconsiderably different than it was in 1996.\n  Today on the news you are actually hearing some supermarkets talk \nabout the shortage of a food supply. I don't know if we have ever \ntalked food supply shortages--ever in my lifetime--for American \nconsumers.\n  If what the Chairman tells me is accurate, and I have no reason to \ndoubt him--and Senator Chambliss has done a wonderful job of keeping me \nand our colleagues informed--but collectively you have told this Senate \nmore in the last 10 minutes than we have heard in a month from the \ncollective principals on where we are with the progress. If by next \nweek you have completed your work and we are simply ready to ink it and \nget it into a final package--I told Senator Chambliss I wouldn't be on \nthe floor today if that had happened this week. But it has not \nhappened.\n  You have made progress. What is wrong, Mr. Chairman, with coming back \nhere at the end of next week, reporting your work product and saying: \nGive us another extension and we will put it in final. That is a report \nto American agriculture, the kind they now deserve, more than they did \n6 months ago. This is the fourth extension you have asked for, and I am \nsimply saying I will give you one more,\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\nbut you said it--the House is going out tomorrow. Is that a sense of \nurgency, that they are not staying here and working and completing the \nwork? Give them 2 weeks and they will go out another 3 days.\n  America's farming community senses urgency at this moment. I hope we \ndo. I know you do, and I know the ranking member did. In no way is this \na criticism of your work product and your work effort. You have done a \nmarvelous job. But I think it is time collectively Congress get their \nwork finished.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We just have a disagreement on this issue. I guess, due \nto the objection--I guess we will be back here probably again next week \nasking for another extension.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Let me say by way of reporting where we are on this \nbill to all of our colleagues that we have 13 titles on the farm bill. \nWe have now closed six of those titles. I think by the end of the day \nthere is the opportunity for us to close at least a couple more of \nthose titles, maybe even more. Despite the fact that the House is going \nout today and we are still going to be here, the principals involved in \nthis from the conference standpoint as well as staff are going to \ncontinue to work through this all through the weekend, as all of our \nstaff have done for all of these 6 months. Staff has been unbelievable, \ntrying to wade through this.\n  But here is our practical problem. We have never had this problem \nwith the farm bill. This is the third one I have been involved in as a \nMember of Congress--I have also been participating in several others--\nand I have never seen this situation before; that is, we had to go to \nthe Finance Committee and Ways and Means Committee to ask them for some \nspending savings and some revenue measures to allow us to write a farm \nbill that is truly a meaningful safety net for our farmers and \nranchers.\n  But just as important, because 66 percent of the funding in this farm \nbill is going to our nutrition programs--our food stamps, our school \nlunches, our food banks, all of which are so integrally important and \nall of which are within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee--\nwe have had to look to Ways and Means to finance like we never had to \nbefore.\n  Second, the Senate had a tax package that is $7 billion on our bill \nthat did not appear in the House bill. We had a lot of disagreement, a \nlot of argument about that. But as of last night, I think we made some \nreal progress. As I have already told my friend from Idaho, I think his \ncoming to the floor last week and trying to tighten the screw and \nsaying he would object to another extension has had an impact on that, \nand I am not unappreciative of the efforts of Senator Craig.\n  But here we are today on the very verge, I think, based upon a \nmeeting Senator Harkin and I were in this morning. As soon as we leave \nhere, we go back into another meeting. We are going to stay there until \nwe get some of these key issues resolved. We are now getting to the \npoint where, I think, within a short term--I hope it is Monday, I hope \nit is no later than that--it may be, but I hope we can come back in and \nstand on this floor and say that we have reached an accord and that we \nare going to be writing that bill over the course of the next 10 days, \n2 weeks, whatever it may be that it takes to physically get the job \ndone from the committee paper standpoint. But we are very close. And I \nthink there is an opportunity to get this done. It is not going to be \ndone, completed, in the next week, but I have no problem with a 1-week \nextension because I do think it will keep the pressure on. It will \nrequire us to ultimately get something done.\n  Another factor in here is the White House. The White House has to be \ninvolved because the President has to sign whatever product we send to \nhim.\n  Another problem is, if it were up to Senator Harkin and me, we would \nhave had this bill done long ago. We had the shortest session in the \nSenate Agriculture Committee when we reported this bill out of the \ncommittee under your leadership. We got it done in a day and a half. We \nwent into conference, and we appointed our conferees fairly quickly. It \ntook the House almost 6 months to appoint their conferees. We have 11 \nconferees, the House has 49 conferees, all of whom have to be available \nto be in 1 room at the same time and all of whom had the opportunity to \ndiscuss their particular part of this bill. It has been a nightmare \nfrom that standpoint, but we are getting closer.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Idaho being reasonable with us as far \nas us getting a 1-week extension, and I would implore that we move \nforward with it, send it to the House, and hopefully get this \nconcluded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to echo a little bit what my friend \nfrom Georgia just said. I will say in all candor to my friend from \nIdaho that his action last week had an effect. I will be very frank \nabout that. It did not go unnoticed in our deliberations. Frankly, I \nthink it caused us to do a lot of things in the last week. So I give \nthat to my friend from Idaho.\n  I guess the only reason I was a little upset, I think sometimes when \nwe try to do some things that are unrealistic--I think the specter of \nwhat you said last week was pretty realistic, and that caused us to do \nsome things. I guess my only problem with this is that I think everyone \nrecognizes that even though we are very close, we can get this done \nbefore next week, it cannot get done legislatively, the paperwork. \nSometimes if you hold something out that is unrealistic, people tend to \npooh-pooh it and say: Oh well, we will get another extension and we can \ndribble along. But if you know the curtain is coming down, then things \nhappen. That is why I asked for 2 weeks. People know that is realistic. \nWe have to get it done. It has to be done. But if it is 1 week, then, \nwell, we will come back next week, and hopefully we can get whatever \nextension is necessary to get the paperwork done and everything.\n  I want to say again, Senator Chambliss and I--all of us on the \nAgriculture Committee worked very hard. The groundwork was laid when \nSenator Chambliss was chairman of the committee. When it changed hands \nafter the last election and I was privileged to take over as chairman, \nwe worked together. We passed a great farm bill in the Senate, \nsomething I was very proud of, and I think Senator Chambliss--all of us \nwere. We passed a farm bill with 79 votes.\n  Now, a lot of times people around the country--you hear them say: \nCan't you people quit your bickering and get things done? Well, I \nthought we did that on the farm bill. You can't get much better than 79 \nvotes. That is the most votes the farm bill has ever had on the Senate \nfloor. So Republicans, Democrats, East, West, North, South--different \nregions all were supporting it. So you would think the administration \nmight have said: Well, gee, with that, maybe we ought to work with them \nand get it done. But we got a veto threat right away.\n  So, again, I thought we had a good product here when we passed it in \nthe Senate. But, understanding that the House did not have the same \nviews as we did, we had to go to conference. But I can say this again, \nthat I hope in another farm bill that will come up 5 years from now, \nthis is not going to happen again, that this is not going to happen \nagain with the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee \nbasically controlling our agenda. They are good people. I do not want \nto cast aspersions on any committee or anything like that. But they \nhave their agenda, they have what they want to do.\n  The Agriculture Committee did its work. As Senator Chambliss said, if \nit had been just our bill, the Agriculture bill, we would have been \ndone with this a long time ago. Our differences, whatever they are, are \nminor. We had basic agreements on different parameters and things such \nas that. So we had a good bill, and we have made good progress.\n  The other thing I wanted to say as long as I have the floor is that \nthe President is not doing us any favors by the White House issuing the \nstatement that we should have a 1-year extension. For some of the \nreasons that I think the Senator from Idaho pointed out, prices going \nup and things like that, people expect us to do something. And one of \nthe big parts of this whole farm\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nbill--in fact, the biggest part of this farm bill is nutrition. Over 60 \npercent of this farm bill is nutrition; it is food stamps, it is the \nTEFAP program, the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, WIC, it \nis all of these programs that help low-income people put food on their \ntable. Yet we know, with the increasing prices of food, people are \nhurting, low-income people are hurting in this country.\n\n  Well, with a 1-year extension, we give no relief at all to low-income \nfamilies. In this bill, what we have agreed upon so far is roughly \nabout $10 billion more--not base--$10 billion more in nutrition \nprograms. Now, if we have a 1-year extension, that is gone. So I think \nwe have an obligation here to help people who are low-income, who maybe \nhad a job and lost it, who need to go on food stamps for a short period \nof time to be able to help their families. Well, if we have an \nextension, that will not happen.\n  Energy. We hear a lot of talk--I think it is misguided--about some of \nthe food going for ethanol and that is causing a lot of problems. That \nis not it at all. That is not it at all. A lot of people have the \nmistaken idea that the corn that is being made into ethanol is the corn \npeople eat. That is not so. People do not eat that. It is not the kind \nof corn you buy and you eat on your plate at night. This is the corn \nwhich is fed to chickens and cows and hogs. Most of the hungry people \nin the world are not hungry because they are not getting meat; they are \nhungry because of subsistence diets. So the ethanol thing is kind of a \nbugaboo; that is a phony issue out there. But we recognize the limits, \nand we recognized that in the Energy bill we passed where we mandated a \nrenewable fuels standard, but we said that, of that, no more than 15 \nbillion gallons a year from present sources, corn. So therefore we want \nto move aggressively into cellulosic ethanol, using wood products and \nwaste products and things such as those for making ethanol. This bill \npushes us in that direction, moves us aggressively in that direction. \nWell, if we have a 1-year extension, we will lose yet another year or \ntwo on that.\n  Lastly, let me mention conservation. Millions and millions of acres \nare coming out to be used for crop production. You cannot stop it. \nThese are contracts that farmers had to set aside land. The contracts \nare up. Because of the high prices of wheat and corn and beans and \nother commodities, farmers now see they can make money by planting row \ncrops. That is fine. That is good. That will help keep the prices of \nfood down. We need that productive capacity.\n  That is what was so good about the Conservation Reserve Program. It \nwas like a reservoir, that if we needed it at some time, we could use \nit. Well, now is the time. We are going to use it. And more crops will \nbe planted on this land. But some of these lands are fragile, they are \nhilly, they are highly erodable. So therefore we need to put some \nincentives in there for farmers to do it right, to put in grass \nwaterways, to put in buffer strips, to do minimum tillage, to do all \nthat is necessary to conserve our soil and clean up our water. We can \nhave production, and we can have good conservation. This bill puts a \nlot more money into the very conservation programs that will allow \nfarmers to go out and plant and grow and yet be good conservationists. \nYet, if we have a 1-year extension, we do not have that.\n  So for that and for a lot of other reasons, I wish the White House \nwould quit talking about that and say: Look, you have a good bill. You \nhave done a lot of work. We will work with you. We will get this bill \ndone, and the President will sign it into law. That is the kind of \ncooperation we need from the White House right now and not the veiled \nthreats of a year extension, things like that.\n  I think the Senator from Idaho is right, we have been so locked up in \nmeetings on this that perhaps Senators and their staffs and others have \nnot really been brought up to speed on what we are doing. I want to \ntake this opportunity to bring them up to speed as to where we are in \nall of these negotiations.\n  We are very close. We are meeting right now again at 10:30 and will \nproceed on today, tomorrow, through the weekend if necessary to get \nthis done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate, and any statements related to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, no objection, but this was the original at \nthe desk, not the one amended by the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for that report. I do not know if \nthere is anyone here in ag country who does not want your work product \nto become policy as soon as possible.\n  I think the colloquy this morning has been extremely valuable. Please \ngo back to work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (S. 2903) was ordered to a third reading, was read the third \ntime, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this is National Small Business Week. This \ncountry has nearly 27 million small businesses in total, and their \ncontributions to the country are remarkable. They create the majority--\nthe vast majority--of jobs, they drive the economy, and they are part \nof the solution to lead us out of economic downturns. But if we are \ngoing to really pay appropriate tribute to small business during Small \nBusiness Week, we frankly need to do more than simply provide lip \nservice; we need to promote policies that work for small businesses, \nnot policies that favor large businesses under the guise of helping \nsmall ones.\n  In the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, we have \nworked on behalf of small business on a bipartisan basis. Senator \nSnowe, the ranking member, and I and the entire committee passed \nunanimously three bills to improve small business services that help \nAmerica's job creators expand their payrolls. Unfortunately, these \nbills have been blocked for a full year by some in the Senate: S. 1256, \nthe Small Business Lending Reauthorization and Improvements Act of \n2007; S. 1662, the Small Business Venture Capital Act of 2007; and S. \n1671, the Entrepreneurial Development Act.\n\n  S. 1256, the Small Business Lending Reauthorization Improvements Act, \npassed the Small Business Committee 19 to 0 on May 16, 2007, almost a \nyear ago. This legislation authorizes the Small Business \nAdministration's major lending programs which are the largest source of \nlong-term capital for small businesses in the country. The bill also \nstrengthens the microloan program, a concept that has proven \nunbelievably effective around the world in helping men and women lift \nthemselves and their families out of poverty by accumulating assets, \nbuilding wealth, and creating jobs. That is very important because the \nincome gap, the economic gap, is growing year by year. When an\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\naverage White family's net worth is $67,000 but an average African-\nAmerican family's income is only $6,100, we have a long way to go in \nterms of creating wealth and fairness. The SBA loans fill a gap left by \ntraditional bankers and play a significant role in meeting the capital \nneeds of business owners in underserved areas. If S. 1256 is enacted, \nwe will be able to leverage $87 billion in loans to more than 100,000 \nsmall businesses and reduce redtape for borrowers and lenders.\n  S. 1662, the Small Business Venture Capital Act of 2007, passed the \nSmall Business Committee 19 to 0 on June 26, 2007, 10 months ago. This \nbill would simplify the Small Business Investment Company Debenture \nProgram so it is more attractive to investors and allow the SBA to \nstabilize losses in the SBIC Participating Securities Program. The \nversion of the bill we are trying to pass does not reauthorize the SBIC \nParticipating Securities Program, as some in the past have suggested in \npublic debate. They used that as one of the justifications for opposing \nefforts to pass the bill last December. The bill focuses on improving \nthe SBIC debenture program, which is an initiative that has actually \ngiven us extraordinary job creators, such as FedEx, Intel, Calaway \nGolf. They have more than repaid the cost of anything to the Federal \nGovernment through taxes paid and jobs created.\n  In addition, S. 1662 reauthorizes the New Markets Venture Capital \nProgram. This program addresses the market gap in venture capital for \ncompanies located in low- and moderate-income, rural, and urban areas--\ni.e., high unemployment areas--as well as the need for smaller deals \nthat neither traditional venture funds nor the SBIC Program will make. \nIt has proven successful so far, and we need more community development \nventure capital to create sustainable, high-quality, local jobs. This \nbill would allow the SBA to start anywhere from 10 to 20 more funds. \nWithout this Government partnership, these investments are not going to \nbe done. So at a time when our economy is pressured and hurting, when \nwe need to create jobs, it doesn't make sense for the Senate to be \nblocking something that came out of committee 19 to 0, in a totally \nbipartisan effort. The bill also aligns the New Markets Venture Capital \nProgram with the New Markets Tax Credit Program, which is exactly what \nCongress intended.\n  S. 1671, the Entrepreneurial Development Act, passed the Small \nBusiness Committee 19 to 0 on June 26, 2007, also 10 months ago. This \nact reauthorizes and improves the Small Business Administration's \nentrepreneurial development programs such as small business development \ncenters, women's business centers, and SCORE. Poor management decisions \nare the No. 1 reason businesses declare bankruptcy. In a shaky economy, \nthe topnotch counseling provided by these services is critical to \nensuring that small businesses survive the economic downturn and \ncontinue to provide jobs and income to families and communities.\n  This bill also increases assistance for small businesses wishing to \nconduct trade. Small businesses are 97 percent of all exporters, and \nfor each additional $70,000 in exports generated, one additional U.S. \njob is created. These jobs pay 18 percent more on average than \nnontrade-related jobs. So small business success helps the economy and \ncreates jobs.\n  Lastly, this bill creates a number of pilot programs to help small \nbusinesses deal with rising health care costs and regulatory burdens, \nall of which hinder small business success. It creates new programs in \nsupport of Native American entrepreneurship and takes steps to improve \nsmall business ownership by minorities in highly skilled fields such as \nengineering, manufacturing, science, and technology, and it guides them \ntoward entrepreneurship as a career option.\n  These bills I have described have the ability to help more than 1 \nmillion small businesses. They would help with credit, with venture \ncapital or with counseling. It makes no sense at all to have one or two \nfolks in the Senate holding up the ability to move forward on these \nwhen our economy needs innovation and, frankly, the job creation these \nbusinesses create. With 80,000 jobs lost in March alone and almost \n300,000 jobs lost since January, there is no time to waste.\n  I hope we can get these bills done and do so shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about two issues with respect \nto our veterans community. First, I express my strong support for S. \n1315, as reported by the committee, and my thanks, as a member of the \nveterans committee, to Chairman Akaka for all the work that went into \nthis legislation.\n  I wish to spend a little time talking about the provision of the bill \nthat is in question. As someone who began working on veterans law as a \ncommittee counsel in the late 1970s, I understand the concerns of the \nSenator from North Carolina about the provision with respect to \nFilipino veterans who are living in the Philippines who would receive \npension benefits from this bill. I emphasize that I believe the \nchairman has done a great job in trying to balance a list of powerful \ncompeting considerations that go to the aspect of basic fairness to \nthose who served.\n  This issue has been around a long time. People have struggled with a \nway to resolve it. The fairness aspect cuts both ways. As Senator \nInouye and others have been so clear in pointing out, the question of \nassisting Filipino veterans for their service in World War II is \ncomplicated by the notion of the political status of the Philippine \nIslands at the time. They were, in fact, a territory of the United \nStates politically, and they served under the command, in many cases, \nof American commanders and not simply in affiliated allied status as, \nfor instance, the veterans of the South Vietnamese Army during the \nVietnam war.\n  This situation is unique. It is complex, and it does create a series \nof obligations by our Government toward these people.\n  There is precedent of sorts for this activity. I go back to 1976, \nwhen President Ford signed into law a provision that gave limited \nveterans' status to Polish and Czechoslovakian freedom fighters who \nserved during World War II, not with the United States military at all \nbut had migrated to the United States. The logic was given at the time \nthat since Poland and Czechoslovakia had fallen under Communist rule, \nthey had lost the government that would have been able to give them \nveterans' benefits, and our Government did provide limited veterans' \nbenefits to those people.\n  What we are talking about in this bill is the notion of according \nveterans pension rights to Filipino veterans of World War II living in \nthe Philippines. It is important to emphasize to my colleagues that \nunder veterans law, pension is not a gratis benefit such as, for \ninstance, a Social Security pension that is given no matter one's \neconomic status. In veterans law, pension is given based on need. This \nhas been the focus of the debate for more than 30 years, as to how do \nyou define, under American law, the cutoff in terms of standards of \nliving inside the Philippines.\n  This is where Chairman Akaka and his staff have worked so assiduously \nto come up with something that is fair. In order to apply for a \nveterans pension, you have to be in financial need. And the amount you \nreceive is basically to get you to a certain level that gets you above \nthe poverty level. So the average annual pension in the United States \nfor an American veteran is just under $10,000 a year. You can get up to \nnearly $15,000 a year in the United States in your veterans pension \nprogram, and under some extremely unusual cases, you can get up to \n$18,000. What we are talking about, the way the committee staff has \nworked this out in terms of equity, is giving the Filipino veterans \nliving in the Philippines a $3,600-a-year pension based on need, once \nthey go into the U.S. formula. It is not a perfect solution, but I do \nbelieve it is an equitable solution. I intend to support it.\n  The second issue I would like to discuss relates to a piece of \nlegislation that was introduced a couple days ago by Senator Burr, with \nSenators Graham and McCain as cosponsors. It is apparently designed to \nbe an alternative to S. 22, the comprehensive GI\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nbill I introduced nearly 16 months ago, which was recently modified and \nreintroduced to reflect the collective view of a wide range of experts, \nboth inside Government and in the veterans community. S. 22, the bill I \noriginally introduced, now enjoys strong bipartisan support. We have 57 \ncosponsors in the Senate. That includes 11 Republicans. Among the \ncosponsors on this bill are the Senator from Missouri; Senator Warner, \nformer chairman of the Armed Services Committee; and many others, \nSenator Hagel, who, along with myself, is the only ground combat \nveteran from the Vietnam war. A majority of the House is cosponsoring \nthe exact version of S. 22 that we reintroduced. Most, if not all, of \nour leading veterans organizations have endorsed S. 22. In fact, it is \nimportant to note that the major pieces in this legislation were \nspecifically endorsed in the recent Independent Budget submitted by a \nconsortium of our top veterans organizations.\n  The proponents of this newly introduced legislation, Senators Burr, \nMcCain, and Graham, maintain S. 22 would be too generous to today's \nveterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, would be too difficult to administer, \nand would unduly harm the retention of our active duty military people. \nI emphasize that these assertions are incorrect. I would say to all \nthose Senators, whom I deeply respect--and I enjoy a long friendship \nwith Senator McCain that goes back 30 years--we have a lot of issues to \ndebate in this Senate. We have a lot of issues to debate in the \ncampaign this year. But this should not be one of them.\n  S. 22 is hardly too generous, unless people are prepared to say that \nthe World War II GI bill was too generous. To the contrary, we have \ntaken 15 months, with daily cooperation with all the major veterans \ngroups and with many Members of the Congress. We have listened to them. \nWe have refined this legislation in many important ways, and it is our \nbest collective, bipartisan effort to mirror the types of benefits that \nwere given to those who served in World War II.\n  Nor would this bill be too difficult to administer. There was a list \nof concerns about our bill when they introduced this other version, \nwhich is the reason that compels me to explain this. We worked closely \nwith the Department of Veterans Affairs and with committee staff on the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. We have addressed every major \nconcern. For these reasons, Chairman Akaka of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and Chairman Levin of the Armed Services Committee have \ncosponsored this bill.\n  Finally, there is no indication this bill would unduly harm active \nduty retention. Recent statistics from the Army and Marine Corps show \nthat 70 to 75 percent of soldiers and marines who enlist return to \ncivilian life at, or before, the end of their first enlistment. This is \nthe pool that is having readjustment difficulties, and this is the pool \nwe are trying to assist with this legislation. The military is already \ndoing a very good job of managing its career force. It is not doing a \nvery good job of assisting this large group of people as they attempt \nto readjust to civilian life, and this is the primary focus of S. 22. \nWith respect to active duty retention, a good GI bill will increase the \npool of people interested in serving, lower first-term attrition, and \nwould have a negligible impact on retention itself.\n  I see my time is about to be called by the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3344-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3344-S3347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to note an \nanniversary. Although you may have noticed there has been no gift \ngiving, no celebration, no remembrances of the day, the promise was \nmade. That is because the people who made the promise failed to keep \ntheir promise. They failed to bring the change they promised.\n  Now, to what promise am I referring? I am referring to the day, 2 \nyears ago today--April 24, 2006--when then-House minority leader Nancy \nPelosi announced ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down \nskyrocketing gas prices.'' She told the American people that if they \nput Democrats in charge of the House and the Senate, we would all see \nlower gas prices. The then-minority leader, the senior Senator from \nNevada, said, on that same day, that it was just ``about priorities.''\n  Well, it is time to get real about energy. Democrats running for \noffice across the Nation in 2006 said change would come with a \nDemocratic Congress. Well, we certainly got change all right. Since the \nDemocrats have come to power in the House and Senate, pain at the pump \nhas increased by 50 percent. Americans who paid, on average, $2.33 a \ngallon in January 2007 now pay $3.53 a gallon, on average--hardly a \nchange any of us bargained for. However, $3.53 is just the national \naverage. Some are paying much more. To just take a few States, in \nCalifornia, it is $3.87; in Nevada, it is 3.60; in Illinois, it is \n$3.67; in New York, it is $3.67. Mr. President, $1.30 more for a gallon \nof gas is certainly not the kind of change I would believe in or \nsupport.\n\n  What is this doing to hardworking families struggling just to get by? \n``With gas hitting record highs, drivers [are] feeling squeezed,'' as \nmy home State Kansas City Star reported this week. For example, Carol \nLicata, a 75-year-old retiree, told in the story of how a larger part \nof her fixed income is now going toward gas. She said that ``to get to \nthe doctors . . . it's an awful lot of money . . . I don't drive that \noften, but I have to take necessary trips . . . and [gas] takes a big \nchunk out of our budget.''\n  Fixed-income seniors, though, are not the only ones suffering record \npain at the pump. Consider the plight of low-income workers struggling \nto get to work. Their affordable housing is a great distance, maybe, \nfrom where they have a good-paying job. Maybe they are driving from the \ninner city out to a suburban job or from a distant suburb, where \nhousing prices are lower, to the city. Either way, modest-income folks \nwith the least ability to pay higher gas prices are hit especially \nhard.\n  What about truckers? For all the hard work they put in on the open \nroads, they never seem to make more than a modest living. Now they are \nbeing hit with even higher diesel prices. At $4.20 a gallon, diesel \nprices are 40 percent higher than they were a year ago.\n  Unfortunately, this pain at the pump is just one more burden families \nand workers are bearing at the same time as a housing meltdown, higher \nfood prices, higher health care prices, higher power bills, higher \nheating bills, and I expect, this summer, higher air-conditioning \nbills.\n  So what is the Democrats' ``commonsense plan'' to lower gas prices \nand help working families? With record-high gas prices, it is clear we \nare still waiting for the ``commonsense'' part of the solution. About \nthe only thing we have heard proposed from the other side is to \nincrease taxes on oil companies. Since when does raising taxes on \nsomething increase its supply or lower its price? Never. Again, that is \nall we hear.\n  What is so sad is the fact that we are sitting on top of a big part \nof the solution. We can lower the prices by tapping the millions of \nbarrels of oil just waiting for us here in America.\n  In Alaska, above the barren Arctic Circle, Democrats refuse to allow \nus to tap millions of barrels of oil in an environmentally safe manner. \nThey say drilling in an area smaller than the size of Dulles Airport \nwould have too great an impact on an area the size of the State of \nSouth Carolina. Congress, in 1996, passed a budget resolution which \nwould have allowed the opening of ANWR. However, President Clinton \nvetoed that resolution, pointing out that he opposed and would not \nsupport opening ANWR. Had ANWR been opened, there would be a million \nmore barrels of oil a day flowing into the United States.\n  Now, speaking of South Carolina, Democrats refused to let us get at \nmillions of barrels of oil and natural gas a safe distance off our \ncoastal shores, literally unseen because it is over the horizon. Some \nsay this is another example of ``not in my backyard,'' or ``NIMBY,'' \nbut this is really a case of not in ``your'' backyard because the \npeople, for example, of Alaska and Virginia are happy with and want to \ntap the oil and gas on their lands and off their shores.\n  But Democrats still refuse to unlock the vast untapped natural \nresources\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\nhere at home. Our dependence on foreign sources of energy grows \ngreater, and families continue to suffer. Is it any wonder Americans \nare fed up? Democrats are looking at thirsty Americans and saying: You \nshould drink less or drive less. Now, do not get me wrong, I support \nand have supported aggressive but achievable automobile fuel efficiency \nincreases, incentivizing low-emission vehicles such as hybrids and \nplug-ins, and more fuels from renewable sources, but these are long-\nrange solutions that will not pay dividends for years.\n  Some say opening our reserves would not pay dividends for years. \nWhile it will take time for the oil to start flowing, there would be a \nmessage. Right now, the market is factoring in the present U.S. \nattitude which says we will do nothing to increase our supplies of oil. \nA change in our attitude would change their attitude for the future. \nSaying we are going to increase supply and cut demand would help \nrelieve the pressure. I think we need to support it.\n  Another pressure I support relieving is continuing to add to the \nstrategic petroleum reserves during times of record-high prices. We \nneed to stop supplying these strategic petroleum reserves when gas hits \n$3 a gallon.\n  Unfortunately, my friends on the other side, predominantly, support \nlegislation that will send gas prices even higher. I am referring to \nthe Warner-Lieberman climate bill the majority plans to bring to the \nfloor in early June. In pushing forward that bill, Democrats are \nwilling to say that $3.53 a gallon gas is not enough. They will be \ntelling the American people that gas prices should be even higher.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency recently estimated that \nLieberman-Warner will force gasoline prices to rise $1.44 per gallon \nhigher. For those of you keeping score at home, that would mean $5-a-\ngallon gasoline. It boggles the mind, the majority advocating $5-a-\ngallon gas in just over a month, but that is what they would be doing \nsupporting that bill. That is not the kind of change our families and \nworkers need. That is not common sense. That is why there are no \nflowers today, no fancy dinner tonight. On this anniversary, there will \nonly be more pain at the pump.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri for making enormous common sense on a subject where, frankly, \nthe Congress can only be characterized as having a schizophrenic \napproach to our energy crisis today. Congress always seems to talk a \ngood game, but when it comes to actually doing something about it, the \nsolutions seem to be few and far between.\n  I, too, think it is important to remember that since Speaker Pelosi \nmade that promise 2 years ago, we have not had anything happen in the \nCongress that would indicate that this ``commonsense plan to help bring \ndown skyrocketing gas prices'' is any closer today than it was 2 years \nago. You would think, if any party has a commonsense solution to help \nreduce the pain at the pump, they would be eager to unveil it and to \ndebate it on the floor, to show it off. But, of course, as we finished \nout the 2006 session of Congress, we got no such bill.\n  So again, as elections are heating up, and, as we all know, our \nconstituents back home are feeling the pain at the pump--and whereas \nthere is a lot of concern today about food prices--a lot of the \nincrease in food prices is caused because of increased costs of \nproduction on the farm, primarily energy costs. Again, we see that as \nit becomes a political football, it has become something to talk about \nin election season. But when it comes to the fact that now our \nDemocratic friends have control of both Houses of Congress, we have \nseen no action--zero action--taken to reduce the price of gas.\n  The price of gas, as we know, has continued to go up. Here is a chart \nthat indicates--right here on Capitol Hill--that back in, I guess we \ncan call it, the good old days, unleaded regular was $3.09 a gallon. \nToday, in April 2008, it is $3.49 a gallon, right here in Washington, \nDC. In some parts of the country, it is approaching $4 a gallon.\n  While $3.09 is certainly not a low price by anybody's reckoning, it \ncertainly looks pretty good today. But, frankly, we have not seen our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle work with us to support any \nlegislation that would be calculated to bring down the price of gas at \nthe pump. As a matter of fact, this is calculated into the inaction as \na result of the energy policies by the majority, and you see it costs \nthe average American family $1,400 a year in additional energy costs, \nadditional gasoline costs.\n  So while the majority, which really runs the Congress, is quick to \nblame others for high oil prices, it is, in fact, their inaction that \ncontinues to raise gas prices. I wonder how long it will be before our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle--who won the last election, who \nclaimed a mandate as a result of that election--are actually going to \nact like the majority that they now are and help work with us to bring \ndown prices at the pump. How long will it be before they stop pointing \nthe finger of blame and start looking in the mirror for the solutions?\n  The only way we are going to resolve this schizophrenia when it comes \nto our energy policy is by Republicans and Democrats working together \nto pass commonsense legislation which will have the effect of bringing \ndown the price of gasoline at the pump. I will talk about some of those \nin a minute.\n  The simple truth is, those who have been entrusted with the majority \nin the Senate and the House have failed to act to lower energy prices \nat all. Rather than show us their commonsense solution, as Speaker \nPelosi talked about, they have opted to pursue political posturing, \nwhich has done nothing to deal with the problem. So, as we see, the \nproblem just gets worse and worse and worse.\n  Now, our side does not have all the answers, but we have proposed \nsome good solutions, I think, which would help address America's \ngrowing energy crisis that we should and could act upon to start \nbringing the price of gas down.\n  Let me say, first of all, there are several reasons why the price of \ngasoline is so high today. First and foremost is skyrocketing \nconsumption in other parts of the world. This commodity is in great \ndemand, and we are competing literally with the entire world for this \nscarce commodity known as oil that is then refined to make gasoline. Of \ncourse, we know there remains political unrest in producing countries \nas well.\n  Every one of these problems could be mitigated, if not solved \noutright, by promoting and investing in America's natural resources \nrather than continuing to be so dependent on imported oil and gas from \ndangerous parts of the world and from our enemies such as Hugo Chavez \nin Venezuela.\n  We are a politically stable nation with the resources to invest in \nmaintaining our infrastructure and to add production that would greatly \nincrease the available oil and gas supply. All of that adds up to lower \ncosts at the pump and more money in the pockets of American citizens.\n\n  There is a lot Congress can do that would be positive, but the one \nthing we can't do is to repeal the law of supply and demand. When you \nhave a fixed supply and the demand goes up, the price invariably goes \nup. I don't know why Congress refuses to acknowledge that simple law of \neconomics of supply and demand, and add to the supply.\n  First and foremost, we need to increase American energy production \nright here at home. Unfortunately, we see time after time and, again, \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle block commonsense energy \npolicies that would give American companies access to valuable \nresources such as oil deposits in the Arctic, in Alaska, the Outer \nContinental Shelf, on Government lands, and shale oil sites that have \ngreat promise in terms of the volume of oil that can be produced, the \nmajor component of gasoline. Of all of the cost drivers in gasoline, it \nis the price of oil that causes the greatest increase. If we could \nincrease the supply of oil by increasing America's supply of oil by \ndeveloping the resources we have in our country, it would vastly \nimprove the situation we are in now.\n  In addition to lowering prices at the pump and increasing domestic \nenergy production, it would also create more jobs in America. At a time \nwhen Congress is passing economic stimulus programs, spending enormous \nsums of taxpayer money, one of the best things we\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\ncould simply do is to change the policies that would allow us to \nexplore and develop our own natural resources rather than depend on \nimported oil from foreign sources. Personally, I have always liked to \nsee the ``Made in America'' label when I buy a product. Wouldn't it be \nnice to see that on the side of a gas pump here at home? Think of the \nthousands of jobs that could help kick-start our economy if we actually \nencouraged American energy production and less dependence on foreign \nsources.\n  Beyond increasing the supply of oil, we also need to increase our \nrefinery capacity, the place where that oil is then made into gasoline. \nWe haven't built any new refineries in this country since the 1970s \nbecause of restrictive policies of the Federal Government. One of the \nmost costly steps in producing gasoline is refining oil to make it \nusable in vehicles. Since we have limited refining capacity--again, the \nlaw of supply and demand--a fixed supply and increasing demand is \ndriving up the cost of gasoline because we don't have the refinery \ncapacity to make the gasoline out of the oil. So prices continue to go \nup.\n  Finally, any American energy policy must, of course, include \nalternative sources of energy. We need to look to technology in our \nAmerican legacy of innovation and research to help reduce our need on \noil and gas, whether domestic or foreign. But that is not going to \nhappen overnight. It is not going to happen even in the near term. But \nlong term, clean coal technology, nuclear energy, even biofuels and \nwind energy can help reduce the strain on our gas supply by taking some \nof the energy load off of oil.\n  We need to be careful not to cherry-pick a few politically correct \nsolutions. We have already seen the increase in the cost of food, in \nsignificant part because of food being used for fuel. Even with the \nbest of intentions of an ethanol policy, it has created an impending \ncrisis when it comes to using food for fuel.\n  I think it is time for us to take definitive steps to help reduce the \ncost of gasoline at the pump. We have some solutions, if we would get \nsome cooperation on the other side of the aisle. Since the Democrats \nare now in charge, we would expect them to lead, to keep the promise \nthat Speaker Pelosi made 2 years ago. We wish to help them come up with \na commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. But \ncontinued obstruction, continued schizophrenia, and continued reliance \non politically correct solutions which sometimes end up backfiring is \nnot the way forward. The American people are looking to us for a \nsolution and it is high time we deliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I want to follow my colleague from Texas \nin pursuing that very same discussion on the issue of energy. I was \nhere before the Presiding Officer joined the Senate and I remember \ndaily diatribes about how Republicans being in charge was leading \nAmericans to have higher gas prices. In fact, I recall a great deal \nbeing made about what the gas prices were then, when they reached $3 a \ngallon in April of 2006, and I recall a big show up here at the gas \nstation on the corner, right here on Capitol Hill, about how if \nDemocrats were in charge, this wouldn't be happening; it was only \nbecause Republicans were in charge that gas prices had reached $3 a \ngallon. Now we are looking at a situation where they are $3.69 in April \nof 2008, 2 years later.\n  The Democrats, as my colleague from Texas said, the House and the \nSenate leadership, with great enthusiasm, took control of both Houses \nof the Congress and promised the American people they would lower gas \nprices, they would change the dynamics, and they would deliver. We were \npromised an alternative to paying $3 a gallon. I don't think what they \nmeant was to pay $4 a gallon, but it was an alternative to pay less.\n  American families are hurting. AAA reports that today's price of \n$3.50 a gallon is the highest average price they have ever had on \nrecord. Families are paying record high gas prices and we still haven't \npassed a sensible energy policy that gets to the heart of this matter. \nUntil that policy is passed, we ought to do what we can to offer \nAmericans who are frustrated with the current prices some much needed \nrelief.\n  Currently, oil is nearly $120 a barrel. High fuel prices are \ntranslating into higher prices for groceries. What families need is \nrelief. We need to do what we can to stem the rise of gasoline prices \nat the pump.\n  One of the ways I think we could do that and benefit our economy at \nthe same time is a summer holiday from the 18-cent-a-gallon Federal gas \ntax. I have joined with several of my colleagues in supporting a gas \ntax holiday from Memorial Day to Labor Day. What a concept. Wouldn't it \nbe nice. By suspending the gas tax 18 cents a gallon on gas and 24 \ncents on diesel, it would be putting money back into the pockets of \nAmerican families. This would help those who have to drive great \ndistances for work.\n  Many people in Florida who want to find affordable housing have to be \na long ways from work. Florida doesn't have the kind of mass transit \nsystem many places in the Northeast and other parts of the country \nhave. They have no option but to get in a car. When they do, they get \nhammered at the gas pump. People in the trucking industry are finding \nincreasing problems in meeting their needs because diesel fuel costs \nare so high, so the cost of transporting goods is also going up. One of \nthe things that benefits my State greatly is when the American family \njumps in their car and goes for a summer vacation. As the gas prices \nbegin to hurt the pocketbook of the American family, fewer and fewer of \nthem will have the joy of enjoying a vacation and more and more \nFloridians, already threatened by a weak economy, would have an \nadditional problem of seeing vacationers not come to our attractions \nand beaches and maybe hurt our tourism economy as well.\n  Something else we can do is to seriously consider suspending the \nproduction of so-called boutique fuels. This is a requirement by States \nthat mandate the use of different fuel blends to meet clean air \nstandards. As States develop more and more requirements, the blends of \nfuel increase in number and now there are dozens of these fuel blends. \nEach one of them puts a strain on oil refineries which already are \nstretched to the max. States need to work to reduce the number of \nboutique fuels and increase their cooperation with oil refineries to \nharmonize fuel blend requirements. In other words, we all want clean \nair, but every State's version of how we get there ought to not be an \nindividual act, but ought to be harmonized so we can then shorten or \nlessen the number of additional fuel blends that have to be made.\n  In addition, we need to expand refinery capacity in this country. We \nhaven't built a new refinery in 30 years, yet we keep saddling our fuel \nsystem with more and more mandates. We do need to find a way where we \ncan create more avenues for refining fuel. Our industry refines \napproximately 18 million barrels a day, but we use over 20 million \nbarrels a day. That means we have a shortfall between what we can \nrefine, what we can actually do in that regard, and what must be \nimported from other parts of the world. So as unthinkable as it is, the \nUnited States has to import refined fuel. We shouldn't be in that fix; \nwe should be able to stay ahead of the demand.\n  We need long-term solutions to our energy problems. There are \nalternative sources of fuel, such as cellulosic ethanol, where it is \nsynthesized using agricultural waste, biomass, and other byproducts \nthat are renewable sources of energy and that do not compete with the \nfood chain, which is an increasing problem we are finding. Florida \ncould play a huge role in developing these fuels of the future and fuel \ntechnologies.\n\n  I was pleased that our energy bill last year included a very robust \nfocus on these new emerging technologies that will require 21 billion \ngallons of cellulosic ethanol by the year 2022. Florida has a real \npotential to be a leader in biomass production, and we are quickly \nbecoming leaders in this field.\n  So for the long term, we have taken some steps necessary to provide \nAmericans with more alternatives to paying high gas prices at the pump, \nbut more must be done. We must increase, where possible, more domestic \nproduction. We\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\nneed to also continue to expand avenues of research and opportunities \nfor new fuel breakthroughs. I continue to believe that America's \ningenuity is our greatest strength and we can look to ways in which we \ncan utilize that ingenuity to find ways so we might conquer this \naddiction, as it might be called, to refined fuel. We must do better. \nWe also have to help the American family to get away from $3 and $4 a \ngallon for gasoline. It is time we find a way to help the American \nfamily.\n  Beyond that, I think there is one thing every American can do today, \nand that is to conserve. If we were to conserve fuel and do that in a \nsignificant way, I know we would lower the prices of gas, not only of \nfuel in the barrel but also at the pump. I think all Americans have an \ninterest in conservation and we should seek and lead our people to do \nmore and more conservation, because until we have alternative fuels \navailable, this may be the very best way in which we can lower our fuel \nprices.\n  We need leadership. We look for leadership from the majority party, \nand we hope part of that will include opening additional sources of \nexploration in America, where possible and where prudent, in \ncompatibility with our environment; creating more options for fewer \nfuel blends, and more refining capacity; also, looking to cellulosic, \nbut also conserving more energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there is \n60 minutes of debate equally divided on the Burr amendment. Who yields \ntime?\n  The junior Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I see that my colleague is here, Senator \nInouye of Hawaii. Before I make my statement on S. 1315, I yield time \nto the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in 1898, when the United States defeated \nSpain in the Spanish-American War, we found ourselves suddenly becoming \na colonial power. In opposition was the Philippines. Until the end of \nthe war, World War II, we exercised jurisdiction over the Philippines \nlike a colonial power.\n  However, in July of 1941, when we noted the presence of war clouds \nover the Pacific and Asia, we called upon the Filipinos to consider \nvolunteering to serve the United States under American command. \nThirteen days after December 7, we issued a command order inviting \nFilipinos to volunteer--it was a crucial time--and 470,000 Filipinos \nvolunteered. From that number, we developed the Commonwealth Army of \nthe Philippines--200,000. We set aside 200,000 of them to serve as \nguerrilla fighters and about 50,000 to serve as guards and patrols on \nthe shore and along the borders.\n  History now shows us the Japanese attack, and as a result we had two \ntragic battles, Corregidor and Bataan. Before these battles were \ndetermined and ended, General MacArthur, the commander, was ordered to \nleave the Philippines, and he left with his staff and arrived in \nAustralia. The Filipinos were left to do their part without proper \narmament, proper medicine, and with inadequate food. But they fought.\n  I think all of us remember the Bataan Death March when 75,000 were \nordered to march 65 miles without food, medicine, or water. Along that \ntrip, only 54,000 survived--the rest died. I think all of us recall the \nheroic movies that were filmed as a result of that march. The Bataan \nDeath March became part of the vocabulary of the United States.\n  We saw Americans being bayoneted, hit, and killed. But the facts show \nthat of the over 75,000 who had to undergo and suffer the Bataan Death \nMarch, 15,000 were Americans and 60,000 were Filipinos. They are the \nones who got bayoneted. They are the ones who were slaughtered and \nkilled.\n  Well, these Filipinos were willing to fight for the United States, to \nstand in harm's way on our behalf. They fought throughout the war as \nguerilla fighters. They suffered thousands of casualties. Those who \nwere fighting for America's cause and fighting under the command of \nAmerican officers, strangely, could not receive American medals.\n  Now, if one should go to Baghdad, if he is wounded, he gets a Purple \nHeart. If he does something heroic, he gets a Bronze Star or Silver \nStar or DSC. Once in a while, someone gets a Medal of Honor. Well, in \nthis case, these matters were not recognized.\n  The war ended on September 2, 1945, when the Japanese signed the \nsurrender on the deck of the USS Missouri. At that moment, we did not \nhave an ambassador nor an embassy, but we had a high commissioner who \nwas not authorized to accept applications for citizenship. Remember, \none of the promises was citizenship.\n  So about December, Washington sent an official of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to receive applications from Filipinos. Well, he \nhad no staff; he had to do it all on his own. But within a month, \nWashington decided to recall him. So here we had line upon line of \nFilipinos waiting to submit their application but no one to receive it.\n  Then, in early February of 1946, the Congress of the United States \npassed a measure signed by the President repealing and rescinding the \nact that we passed in July of 1941, and the Executive order that was \nissued right after December 7, in which we promised Filipinos if they \nfought for us, shed their blood, risked their lives and limbs, if they \nwished they could become citizens of the United States and get all of \nthe veterans' benefits.\n  Keep in mind Manila was the most devastated city in World War II, so \nthere were no veterans hospitals. That came later.\n  Well, this veterans bill has a provision in it--a provision of \nhonor--in which, finally, after over 65 years, we will restore our \nhonor and tell the Filipinos: It is late, but please forgive us. There \nare few remaining of the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who \nvolunteered and risked their lives. At this moment, I think there are \nabout 18,000 left. As I speak, I am certain some are on their deathbed \nand dying.\n  This provision has some rather insulting provisions, but the \nFilipinos are willing to take it. Some of my colleagues have suggested \nthat the cost of living in the Philippines is less than the cost of \nliving here, so their pension should be one-third of an American GI's, \nwho did the same thing, with the same injury--but one-third. That is \nall right. But to suggest only those who were in combat, I don't know \nwhat that means.\n  For example, in Iraq, whether you are out on the street or on the \nboulevard in a truck or in the so-called Green Zone, you are on the \nfront line. Bombs can hit you anywhere. It is the same thing with a \nguerrilla fighter. Where is the front line for a guerrilla fighter? Is \nit the jungle? Is it the city? Is it his home?\n  My colleagues, I hope we will take this opportunity today to restore \nthe honor of the United States and undo the broken promise and make it \ngood. There are a few Filipino World War II veterans left. At least we \ncan face them and say: Yes, it took us a little while, but we are going \nto carry out our promise. Let's do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii has 20 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am very pleased that S. 1315, as reported \nby the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the proposed Veterans' Benefits \nEnhancement Act of 2007, is finally before the Senate for consideration \nand action.\n  I want to express my huge gratitude to the majority leader, also the \nminority leader, and especially to my friend, the ranking member, for \ncoming to an agreement for our offering today.\n  This comprehensive legislation would improve benefits and services \nfor veterans both old and young.\n  The Veterans' Affairs Committee reported S. 1315 to the full Senate \nin August of last year. At that time, my belief was that debate and \nconsideration of this legislation by the full Senate, would take place \nduring September. That did not happen. Now we have a good agreement.\n  As I have described in detail this week, further action on the bill \nhas been blocked because of opposition from the other side of the aisle \nto certain benefits for Filipinos who fought under U.S. command during \nWorld War II.\n  Mr. President, the people of the Philippines did not shy from the \ncall to fight during World War II. They were true brothers in arms who \nfought valiantly under U.S. command in World War II. This bill, at long \nlast, recognizes the valor of all Filipino veterans in sacrifice to \nthis noble cause and loyalty to their American commanders.\n  On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive \norder ordering all military forces of the Commonwealth of the \nPhilippines into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States \nunder the command of a newly created command structure called the U.S. \nArmed Forces of the Far East.\n  According to orders from General MacArthur, Philippine units once \nmustered into U.S. service would be paid and supplied from American \nsources.\n  The unique relationship between the Philippines and the United States \nmade the Philippine islands particularly susceptible to Japanese \naggression during the war.\n  Historians agree that the Japanese strategy was based upon a plan to \ndestroy or neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, and to \ndeprive the United States of its base in the Philippines. Were it not \nfor the U.S. presence, the Philippines would not have presented the \nJapanese with a strategic threat and turned into a battlefield.\n  The Philippine forces under U.S. command suffered heavy casualties as \na result of the Japanese invasion. It is estimated that 10,000 \nFilipinos died during the Bataan Death March, along with 3,000 U.S. \nsoldiers. The Philippines, throughout the war, suffered great loss of \nlife and tremendous physical damage.\n  By the end of the war, the capital city of Manila was in ruins and up \nto one million Filipinos had been killed.\n  In October 1945, General Omar Bradley, then Director of the Veterans' \nAdministration, affirmed that all Filipinos who served under U.S. \ncommand were entitled to all benefits under laws administered by that \nagency.\n  However, in 1946, the U.S. Congress, through the Rescissions Act of \n1946, withdrew veteran status from certain Filipino veterans of World \nWar II.\n  Upon passage of the Rescissions Act, President Harry Truman expressed \nhis disapproval of the withdrawal of benefits from Filipino veterans. \nHe stated:\n\n       There can be no question, but that the Philippine veteran \n     who is entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to \n     those received by the American veteran, with whom he fought \n     side by side.\n\n  The action by Congress in 1946 to strip Filipino veterans who served \nunder the American flag during World War II of the recognition and \nbenefits that were their due was a grave injustice. It is especially \nregrettable that this injustice has existed for so many years.\n  I wish to speak briefly about the purpose of pension benefits and \nmore specifically about the pension benefit in the pending bill.\n  Veterans' pension benefits are provided to allow veterans to live in \ndignity and meet their basic needs. The amounts proposed in this \nlegislation would permit Filipino veterans who have been denied their \nrightful status as United States veterans for too long to finally live \nin dignity.\n  Unlike other World War II veterans, these veterans have been denied \npension benefits for over 60 years. It is also important to note that \nthese benefits are not retroactive.\n  The amounts proposed are sufficient to give aged Filipino veterans a \npayment that would allow them to meet their basic needs for adequate \nnutrition and medicine.\n  The pension proposed for Filipino veterans is less than one-third of \nthe basic amount provided to veterans living in the United States, in \nrecognition of the lower cost of living in the Philippines. Measured \nagainst the aid and attendance standard, the proposed benefit is about \none-sixth of the amount provided to veterans in the United States.\n  Because the income and asset verification procedures used in the \nUnited States are not available in the Philippines, and it is not \nfeasible to develop an administratively efficient system in the \nPhilippines to monitor the income and assets of pension recipients, the \nbill provides a flat benefit amount substantially lower than that paid \nin the United States.\n  I believe firmly that the proposed amount is a reasonable benefit \ntaking into account all of these factors.\n  As I have said time and time again, this legislation would correct an \ninjustice that has existed for over 60 years. I, like President Truman, \nbelieve it is the obligation of the United States to care for those who \nhave fought under the U.S. flag. It is past time to right that wrong.\n  As my fellow World War II veteran, the senior Senator from Alaska, \nsaid only yesterday, this is about honor. I believe it is the moral \nobligation of this Nation to provide for those who served under the \nU.S. flag and alongside the U.S. troops during World War II.\n  The soldier's creed is to leave no fellow warrior behind. I believe \nin that creed. I believe it is important to acknowledge the valiant \nservice of those Filipino veterans of World War II who served under \nU.S. command.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me time, please?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I yield the Senator what time he may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act of \n2007 would recognize the service and sacrifice of Filipino veterans who \nfought under our flag in World War II. I join my good friends and \nfellow World War II veterans, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka, in \nsupporting the restoration of veterans benefits to these heroic \nindividuals.\n  Filipino troops fought as American nationals, under the American \nflag, alongside American soldiers, and under the command of American \nGEN Douglas MacArthur, earning themselves the status of U.S. veterans.\n  Like most American troops, Filipino soldiers were effectively drafted \ninto the U.S. military.\n  When war with Japan became imminent, President Franklin Roosevelt \nordered the military forces of the Philippines into the service of the \nU.S. Armed Forces. The President held this authority because the \nPhilippine Islands were a U.S. possession and the power was written \ninto our law.\n  The position of these Filipino soldiers was similar to the thousands \nof courageous Alaskans who volunteered to serve in the Alaska \nTerritorial Guard and protect Alaska before it became a state.\n  Nearly 60 years later, in 2000, Congress determined that the service \nof the Alaska Territorial Guard was ``active duty'' service, making \nthem eligible for the same veterans benefits Filipino veterans now \nseek.\n  Just 10 hours after the attack on the U.S. at Pearl Harbor, Japan \ninvaded the Philippines. In the years of war that followed, Filipino \nsoldiers fought alongside American troops with uncommon valor and \nloyalty to the United States.\n  Stories of their heroism and sacrifice are abundant. Outnumbered by \nthe Japanese and forced out of Manila, Filipino soldiers and U.S. \ntroops held\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\ntheir ground for months before being forced to surrender on the Bataan \nPeninsula and in Corregidor.\n  Nearly 80,000 Filipino and U.S. soldiers were taken prisoner and \nforced to walk to a prison camp over 65 miles away in what became known \nas the infamous ``Death March.'' As many as one in three of these men, \nweakened by disease and malnutrition and tortured by their captors, \ndied before reaching their destination.\n  After their American leader, GEN Douglas MacArthur, was ordered to \nAustralia, thousands of Filipino guerilla soldiers continued resisting \nJapanese occupation for nearly 3 years. When MacArthur and allied \nforces returned, Filipino soldiers fought fiercely until Japan's \nsurrender.\n  One million Filipino combatants and noncombatants died in World War \nII. In comparison, approximately 400,000 U.S. troops lost their lives \nin all theaters of the war.\n  As President Truman would later say of the Filipino troops: ``Their \nassignment was as bloody and difficult as any in which our American \nsoldiers engaged.''\n  Congress should remember the vital contributions of Filipino veterans \nto the success of the allied forces. Their resistance distracted the \nJapanese in the Islands, preventing them from deploying elsewhere and \npossibly reaching the U.S. mainland.\n  These soldiers bought precious time for General MacArthur to mount a \nsuccessful counterstrike.\n  After the war, the U.S. Veterans' Administration determined these \nservice members met the definition of ``active Service'' in the U.S. \nArmed Forces and were eligible for full VA benefits.\n  Under the Rescission Acts of 1946, however, many Filipino veterans' \nWorld War II service no longer qualified as `active duty' service. \nCongress stripped these soldiers of the benefits they had earned. \nFilipino veterans and their advocates have fought for the Restoration \nof these benefits for more than 60 years.\n  This bill contains provisions that would restore U.S. veteran status \nto all Filipino World War II Veterans, increase service-connected \ndisability compensation, and provide a reduced flat rate pension to \nmany Filipino veterans residing in the Philippines.\n  Nonservice-connected pension and death pension benefits are available \nto all qualifying U.S. veterans regardless of race, national origin, or \ncitizenship status.\n  Many Filipino World War II veterans and their survivors have been \nexcluded from receiving these benefits. This bill proposes a reasonable \nand fair way to assist to these veterans.\n  The expense of this reduced benefit is justified by the contribution \nof Filipino veterans to this country. If not for their service, the \nfate of the United States could have been very different. For this, \nthey should be treated as American veterans.\n  The proposed benefit would cost only a fraction of what it would have \nif pensions were made available to alL Filipino veterans who were \nentitled. The Embassy of the Philippines claims there were 470,000 \nFilipino veterans after the war.\n  Today only about 18,000 of these veterans--most in their eighties--\nstill survive.\n  Filipino World War II veterans residing in the Philippines have been \ndenied eligibility for pension benefits for more than 60 years. A \npension benefit about one third the size of that available to veterans \nin the United States is not overly generous.\n  I hope Congress will recognize the service of all our Filipino World \nWar II Veterans just as we have for the Alaska Territorial Guard.\n  It is time we show our Nation's gratitude for the role Filipino World \nWar II veterans played in our history, fighting alongside soldiers from \nthe U.S. and helping us secure victory over tyranny.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, \nfor the comments he made. I do believe this is a matter of honor. I \nunderstand how some of the younger Senators might view this as being \ncostly, but I wish to put it in perspective.\n  As I pointed out, there were approximately 1 million Filipinos killed \nin action in the defense of our country in World War II. Approximately \na half a million survived. Actually, during the war, as I have also \npointed out, President Roosevelt said all Filipinos were subject to \nservice in our Armed Forces; in effect, he conscripted the Filipinos to \nserve.\n  Those who survived were treated at first as our veterans on the \nmainland. Subsequently, it was determined that those who came to our \ncountry, to the mainland, would be treated fully as veterans of all \ntypes in the country were treated. We have to remember, this was an \nall-male military, primarily a draftee Army of over 16 million men.\n  First the VA determined all Filipino veterans were subject to the \nsame laws as in the United States. If a person came to the United \nStates as a veteran from the Philippines, he was automatically given \ncitizenship and entitled to full benefits of all the veterans laws, \nincluding the GI bill, the right to have money to build a home, and a \nlot of other benefits were involved in those actions taken by Congress \nto try and deal with the returning veterans and help them regain their \nlives.\n  Later, it was determined that those benefits would not be paid to \nmany of those who stayed in the Philippines. We have been trying for \nmany years to restore those payments. I commend the Senators from \nHawaii for trying to do so.\n  Actually, we had a parallel situation in the Alaska Guard. The Alaska \nGuard was primarily made up of Eskimos and Alaska Native people who \npatrolled the borders of Alaska. I remind the Senate that we have half \nthe coastline of the United States. Those people who were in the Alaska \nGuard patrolled with their dogsleds without any uniforms being issued \nto them. It took us a period of time until we were able to recognize \nthem, and we did so. We finally awarded those people in the National \nGuard their rights as veterans of the United States military forces.\n  This is something we have to do, as far as I am concerned. The \nprovision in this bill restores the benefits these Filipino veterans \nhave earned. I do believe, as I pointed out the other night on the \nfloor, the Senate should know that Senator Inouye and I went to the \nPhilippines this year and met with some of these people. I am 85 this \nyear and my friend is 84, and we were the youngsters at the meeting. \nThese Filipino veterans who are surviving are our age or older. Most of \nthem are infirm. There are 18,000 left out of the 470,000 plus, almost \nhalf a million survivors. This bill restores their benefits.\n  How long can they last? People who have talked about the cost of this \nbenefit I think misunderstand the situation. This is not a cost of \ntoday's economy. This is not a cost for today's taxpayers. This is a \nburden that should have been borne before.\n  These people have not had these benefits during all of these years, \nand they have asked us now, as a matter of honor, to restore their \nrights before they leave this planet.\n  I, for one, appeal to the Senate. As I said, there are now only five \nof us from World War II left in the Senate. When I came here, there \nwere more than 70. There would be no question--I didn't know this \nactually happened, I have to tell you. We discovered a year ago, when \nSenator Akaka raised it, that this situation exists in the Philippines. \nI do believe it is an action that must be taken. These people not only \nnow are our allies, but they have warmly supported our efforts \nthroughout the world. I do believe to recognize the service and \nsacrifice of these Filipino veterans who fought under our flag in World \nWar II is absolutely essential. These benefits are going to the heroes \nof the Philippines who are now surviving.\n  Lastly, I again point out to the Senate, those who lived through that \ntime know if they had not made this sacrifice, if they had not lost \ntwo-thirds of their men in World War II, we would not have had the time \nto rebuild America. We would not have had the time to bring in the \nforces, to train the people who finally carried the war throughout the \nworld to two tyrants, to Hitler and to the Japanese.\n  We have not had a world war since that time, and I do hope the world \nwill never see another world war. But these people were the keys to the \nPacific. Without them, we would have certainly been at war another \ncouple of years at least and certainly would have seen an exchange of \natomic weapons by that time. They gave us the time to survive,\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nand I think we ought to give them their rights before they leave this \nplanet.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Chairman Akaka is a good man and a fair man. He is a wonderful \nchairman. He has produced a bill which has a tremendous amount of good. \nI am in deep respect of Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens. This \ncountry owes both, as well as all World War II veterans, a tremendous \nthanks for their commitment.\n  As Senator Stevens mentioned ages, it made me think, on Monday my dad \nturned 87. He fought in the Pacific. He did it because it was the right \nthing to do. I believe protection of our veterans is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Let me, if I may, focus everybody on what S. 1315 is. I ask a chart \nbe put up. One might hear this debate and think this is all about a \nspecial pension for Philippine veterans who live in the Philippines who \nhave no service-connected disability. There is a difference. This bill \nis so much more.\n  It is $332 million in Philippine benefits, of which $221 million is \ndevoted to a new special pension that does not exist. There is a term \nlife insurance program for our veterans of $83 million over 5 years and \n$326 million over 10 years; state approving agencies, $60 million; \nmortgage life insurance for our veterans, $51 million, retroactive \ntraumatic injury, on-the-job training benefits, supplemental insurance, \nhousing grants for burned injured, auto grants for burned injured, COLA \nfor surviving spouses, and much more.\n  I wanted to highlight those items that are mandatory spending in the \nbill.\n  This is a good bill. Regardless of the outcome of my amendment, I \nwant my colleagues to support final passage of this bill.\n  Having said that, I highlight the fact that we do have a difference \nas it relates to the pensions. Before I get into the specifics of why I \nbelieve, not as some have portrayed it that I believe it is too costly, \nI believe that, one, there was not a promise made. We did not imply it. \nIt was not an impression that people had; that, in fact, when we look \nback at those individuals who served in this Chamber who made the \ndecision on the Rescissions Act, they looked at the history very well. \nThey looked at what Franklin Roosevelt said and the documents that \nbacked it up. They looked at what General MacArthur said and the \ndocuments that backed it up. And they felt this was not the way for us \nto go.\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield a short period of time to my \ncolleague, Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Burr's leadership on \nthis issue. I, too, express my appreciation, and I have to say our two \nSenators from Hawaii are beloved by all Members of this Senate and \npeople whom we respect enormously, as well as the Senator from Alaska.\n  My father was a veteran of World War II, and the service each of \nthese veterans has provided for our country and for our freedom and \nsecurity is something we can never thank them for enough.\n  I agree with Senator Burr that this bill is largely a very good bill, \nand I am proud to have contributed some provisions that helped enhance \nveterans' benefits, primarily by cutting redtape that would allow \ndisabled Active-Duty Military personnel to get housing benefits before \nthey officially retire from Active Duty; making family members eligible \nfor housing grants if they are caring for a wounded warrior--and I \nespecially want to recognize the good work of Rosie Babin, the mother \nof Alan Babin, of Round Rock, TX, who brought this to my attention, and \nso now we have this provision--and ensuring that burn victims are \neligible for housing grants--and this is an area where I want to \nrecognize the work of Christy Patten, the wife of Everett Patten, from \nKentucky, who was hospitalized at the Brooke Army Medical Center with \nburns he received from an IED, and I thank them for the help they \nprovided me in working with the Veterans' Affairs Committee to make \nsure they were provided for here.\n  I appreciate the good work our Filipino allies contributed to our \neffort in the Far East, but I have to say that the problem I have with \nthis bill, and the reason why I agree with Senator Burr, is that the \nU.S. Treasury is not bottomless, and the funding that is being provided \nto create this new pension for these Filipino allies, which were of \ncourse fighting not only with us but for themselves and for the freedom \nof their country, is that it would literally be at the expense of U.S. \nveterans.\n  The $221 million that is addressed by Senator Burr's amendment would \nactually go back in to supplement benefits for United States veterans. \nAnd while we appreciate and honor and do nothing but show our respect \nto all of our allies who fought alongside of us in World War II, \ncertainly that doesn't mean we are going to grant pension benefits to \nall of our allies, starting with the Filipino veterans, or the British, \nor the Australians, and all the other allies that fought with us in \ndefeating Hitler and the threat in Japan.\n  Frankly, I can't see our priorities are correct if we do this at the \nexpense of American veterans. That is why I support the amendment by \nSenator Burr, and I hope our colleagues will vote for it, because \ncertainly our American veterans should be our priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Let me highlight one area from these 11 points of the substance of \nSenator Akaka's bill, and it is the creation of a new special pension \nof $300 a month to Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines who \nhave no service-connected disability and who did not serve in the \nUnited States services.\n  Now, the reason I want to draw that distinction--and I will ask for \nthe next chart--is there are four groups of Filipino veterans. It is \nimportant to understand that the group we refer to as Old Scouts \nenlisted in the U.S. Army. Because they enlisted in the U.S. Army, they \nare extended every benefit a U.S. veteran has. We had three other \ngroups, though, the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized \nGuerilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts. Of those three categories, \nnone were enlisted in the U.S. service.\n  Senator Inouye was correct, they were under U.S. command. There were \na lot of people in the Second World War who were under the U.S. \ncommand. But the official account lists this as the Commonwealth Army \nof the Philippines. Now, the question that is at the heart of the \nmatter here is: Were Filipino veterans promised VA benefits? According \nto the information provided in a 1998 congressional hearing, the \nDepartment of the Army examined its holdings on General McArthur and \nPresident Roosevelt and found no reference by either of these wartime \nleaders to post-war benefits for Filipino veterans.\n  Let me draw a distinction. For any Philippine veteran who has a \nservice-connected disability, they are compensated today, whether they \nlive in the United States or whether they live in the Philippines. For \nthe soldier in the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, those whom \nSenator Stevens referred to from the Bataan Death March or side by side \nin the foxhole, and who had a service-connected disability, they \nreceive compensation from the U.S. Government today, and have \ncontinually. The reference that they only got part of what the U.S. vet \ngets is, in fact, accurate. Because of the difference in the two \neconomies, it was structured to recognize their economy and not to \nprovide more than an equal share to U.S. veterans.\n  In this bill, we make a change, and that is why, when I alluded to \nthe fact there is $320 some million designated for Filipinos but only \n$221 million designated to the special new pension, the other $100 \nmillion Senator Akaka has recognized that 50 cents on the dollar is \nvery difficult to substantiate. What he does is he raises it dollar for \ndollar with U.S. veterans.\n  Let me put that in perspective. For a 100-percent disabled veteran in \nthe Philippines today, it means today they get $1,200 a month. After \nthis bill passes, they will get $2,400 a month, in an economy where the \naverage annual income is $2,800 a month. We will take every \nservicemember, regardless of which of those three branches of the \ncommonwealth army they served in, and they will be in the elite class \nfrom\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\na standpoint of income. I support that. I support Senator Akaka's \nchange in the law.\n  But the root issue raised is: They were promised something more. Was \nit Congress's intent to grant full VA benefits to Filipino veterans? \nFirst, it is important to note that it was a 1942 VA legal opinion \nwhich concluded that Filipino veterans had served ``in the active \nmilitary or naval service of the United States'' and on that basis were \neligible for VA benefits. Senator Carl Hayden, who in 1946 was the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations, had this to say about \nVA's legal determination regarding Philippine Army veterans during the \ncommittee proceedings in March of that year:\n\n       There is nothing to indicate that there was any discussion \n     of the meaning of that term, probably because it is generally \n     well recognized and has been used in many statutes having to \n     do with members or former members of the American armed \n     forces. It would normally be construed to include persons \n     regularly enlisted or inducted in the regular manner in the \n     military and naval service of the United States.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       But no one could be found who would assert that it was ever \n     the clear intention of Congress that such benefits as are \n     granted--under the GI Bill of Rights--should be extended to \n     the soldiers of the Philippine Army. There is nothing in the \n     text of any of the laws enacted by Congress for the benefit \n     of veterans to indicate such intent.\n\n  He goes further to say:\n\n       It is certainly unthinkable that Congress would extend the \n     normal meaning of the term to cover the large number of \n     Filipinos to whom it has been suggested that the Servicemen's \n     Readjustment Act of 1940 applies, at a cost running into \n     billions of dollars, aside from other considerations, without \n     some reference to it either in the debates in Congress or in \n     the committee reports.\n\n  Maybe this is the debate in Congress.\n  This issue was raised in 1997, and in June of that year, when the \nClinton administration was asked to testify on this, Stephen Lemons, \nActing Under Secretary for Benefits, was quoted in the hearing as \nsaying this:\n\n       History shows that the limitations on eligibility for U.S. \n     benefits based on service in these Philippine forces were \n     based on a carefully considered determination of the \n     government's responsibilities toward them.\n\n  They testified against extending that benefit.\n  In 1948, there was a House hearing, and in that House hearing there \nwas an exchange between witnesses and Members of the House. There was a \nFather Haggarty who came to testify, and I read from the official \naccounts of that hearing. This is Father Haggarty:\n\n       It was constantly promised, as the ambassador mentioned, in \n     radio broadcasts, official American broadcasts to the \n     Philippines in the war. It was definitely promised by General \n     McArthur, General Wainwright, and also it has been \n     acknowledged, I believe, that the Philippine groups \n     recognized the guerrillas, acting as members of the United \n     States Armed Forces, were entitled at one time to complete GI \n     bill of rights. That is, they were included. I believe that \n     is correct, and were later left out.\n\n  Mr. Allen, Member:\n\n       May I say there, Father, I know you are sincere about it, \n     but I think you are in error. Because there are three or four \n     of us here on the committee who were present when the GI bill \n     was written, and I don't think that ever entered into it.\n\n  So the individuals who wrote the GI bill in a committee hearing are \nverifying that was not even discussed, much less their intent.\n  There are a number of documents that have existed as committees have \nheld hearings over a period of time from the Department of the Army, \nfrom the Roosevelt library. There have been searches everywhere to try \nto find any documentation that would lead one to believe that there was \na promise, that there was an insinuation, and the fact is, whether it \nis Roosevelt documents, whether it is Army documents, whether it is \nGeneral MacArthur's personal documents, no one can find anything, other \nthan ``we believe this existed.''\n  What factors influenced Congress's decision to limit certain VA \nbenefits to Philippine veterans in what is known as the Rescissions Act \nof 1946, where it was made perfectly clear in legislation that this was \ngoing to happen? Well, you have heard it from the authors of the GI \nbill. ``We never intended this to be extended.'' The Congressional \nResearch Service testimony in April of 2007 provided the following \nconclusion based on its review of the congressional history.\n\n       It seems clear that Congress considered the Rescissions Act \n     in the context of providing for the comprehensive economic \n     development of the soon to be sovereign Republic of the \n     Philippines.\n\n  President Truman, in signing the Rescissions Act, reminded everyone \nin the United States that we shared responsibility with the Philippine \nGovernment for the welfare of Philippine veterans, but recognized that \ncertain practical difficulties exist in applying the GI bill of rights \nto the Philippines.\n  Again, the second President in the line suggesting that this was not \nthe intent.\n  As I said earlier, we extend disability compensation to any Filipino \nveteran, regardless of Commonwealth Army or of the U.S. Army, who was \ninjured in service or disabled because of service. Now, what have we \ndone? What specifically has the United States done since we left the \nPhilippines?\n  After the war, the U.S. provided $620 million--in today's dollars \nthat is $6.7 billion--for repair of public property and war damage \nclaims and assistance to the Philippine Government. VA compensation for \nservice-related disabilities, as I said, and survivor compensation was \nalso provided, and again paid at a rate that reflected differences in \nthe cost of living.\n  We are changing that. We are raising it to 100 percent. The United \nStates provided $22.5 million--$196 million in today's dollars--for the \nconstruction and equipping of a hospital in the Philippines for the \ncare of Filipino veterans. In addition, the U.S. Government provides \nannual grants to support the operation of the hospital, which was later \ndonated to the Philippine Government. The grants continue to exist \ntoday.\n  Survivors of the Filipino veterans who died as a result of service \nare eligible for educational assistance benefits. Filipino veterans \nlegally residing in the United States are eligible for full-rate \ndisability compensation, full-rate cash burial benefits, full access to \nthe VA health care clinics, medical centers, and burial in our national \ncemeteries.\n  I am not sure anybody can leave this debate and say we have not done \nour share. So we are back to one issue: the special pension. We are \nback to the creation of a special pension for some number of Filipinos \nwho served or were affiliated with the Commonwealth Army of the \nPhilippines that would place them in a pension category of $300 a \nmonth.\n  I will ask for the last chart to go up. I made this case 2 days ago \nextremely hard, and I want my colleagues to listen. The proposal to \nraise $300 is on top of what is currently paid by the Filipino \nGovernment to every veteran. That is $120 a month. That $120 a month in \nthe Philippines puts every veteran 400 percent above the poverty line \nin the Philippines. Let me put it in perspective to the United States. \nFor our veterans who receive a special pension because of income, that \npension equates to 10 percent above the poverty line. Today, the $120 a \nmonth equates to 400 percent above the poverty line.\n  What we are being asked to do in 1315, and what I am cutting from \n1315 and allocating to our veterans, is $300 a month, which would raise \nthe Filipino veterans to 1400 percent over poverty.\n  Mr. President, that is 27 percent over the median annual income of a \nFilipino.\n  I might once again say, for U.S. veterans under special pensions, \nthey are 10 percent above poverty; they are at 21 percent of median \nincome--under, not over. This one change, this one creation of a new \nprogram, puts the whole group at 1400 percent over the poverty line and \n27 percent over the median income. This is on top of the $1,200, if \nthey are fully disabled, that they are currently getting each month. \nWhat Senator Akaka will do in his bill, and I support, raises that to \n$2,400 if they are 100 percent disabled.\n  I say to my colleagues, we are not here to create another class in \nthe Philippines. I hold Senator Inouye's and Senator Stevens' belief \nthat we owe these individuals so much--but so do we to our veterans, to \nmy dad who just turned 87 who fought in the Pacific. Senator Craig, in \nthe committee markup, attempted to reach a compromise. He offered $100 \nversus $300. It was rejected. The chairman knows I do not have any ill \nwill over that; a decision was made, and it was rejected on a party-\nline vote.\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n  I hope--and I say this to the chairman today--I hope this is the last \ntime while I am here when the Veterans' Affairs Committee brings a bill \nto the floor that does not have the bipartisan consensus that history \nhas proven, and I think he and I can accomplish that.\n  We inherited something on which we were incapable of coming to some \ncompromise, so we have a tough decision to make. That decision today is \nabout, frankly, our veterans or their veterans. Are we going to enhance \nthe benefits for housing grants and for car grants or are we going to \ncreate a new special pension for Filipino veterans who live in the \nPhilippines who have no service-connected disability? It is an issue \nof, Is it equitable?\n  What my amendment does is simple. It eliminates this new special \npension and takes the $221 million and increases the grants that we \nhave in adaptive housing for our burned veterans and for car grants.\n  We respect and we are grateful for the brave Filipino fighters, but \nthis is about today, not yesterday. It is about the needs of our \nveterans, the equity of our generosity. It is not about broken \npromises, it is about recognizing priorities. It is not about young \nMembers looking and saying that is too much money. No, it is about \nyoung Members looking and saying: You know what, when you can't fund \neverything you have to prioritize.\n  I urge my colleagues, I implore my colleagues, support my amendment \nand make sure we put our priorities in the right place. Then vote for \npassage. Support the chairman in his efforts for passage and know that \neach one of us will have upheld our responsibilities to our warriors, \nthose individuals who protect us every day we are here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the Veterans' Benefit Enhancement Act we \nare debating contains a number of important benefits to provide for our \nveterans. It would expand eligibility for traumatic injury insurance, \nprovide job training, and help disabled veterans make their homes more \naccessible. That is all worthy.\n  There is also another issue. In 1941, President Roosevelt called on \nthe people of the Philippines to fight for their freedom and ours, and \nthousands of brave Filipinos answered the call. They carried out \noperations to liberate their homeland and joined us in support of our \nefforts in the Pacific theater. They fought and died at Corregidor, \nthey were with us on the beaches of Bataan, and in the death marches. \nThey were there when General MacArthur promised he would return, they \nfought using guerrilla tactics to tie down the Japanese, and they \nfought under General MacArthur when he came back and said, ``I have \nreturned.''\n  Throughout the war, Filipino soldiers fought under the American flag, \nserving with valor, strength, and dignity. President Roosevelt \nguaranteed those brave soldiers that the United States would come to \ntheir aid in times of peace, just as they had come to our aid during \ntimes of war.\n  He guaranteed them equal veterans' benefits--a fair promise, \nconsidering their service and considering the law of the land, as they \nwere full members of the U.S. military.\n  But in 1946 in one of the most misguided legislative actions at the \ntime, Congress took away the benefits that the President of the United \nStates had promised them, benefits they had rightfully earned.\n  Of the approximately 250,000 Filipino veterans who fought for us in \nAmerica, only 18,000 are still alive today. Many of them are searching \nfor ways to pay for health care and struggling in ways they never \nshould. These veterans have more yesterdays than tomorrows. They are \nwell into their eighties, and in terms of our budget, what this bill \nwould cost over the next 10 years we are spending in Iraq every 18 \nhours. Those who say it will cost too much are the same voices who said \nit would cost too much to do what Democrats did under the leadership of \nSenator Akaka when, for the first time, we fully funded the veterans \nindependent budget.\n  When we bring this bill to a vote, we will be answering a very simple \nbut powerful question: Does our Nation keep its promises? We need to \nright an injustice of the past and show our allies, for future purposes \nas well, when we tell people to join us in our fight against terrorism, \nto join us in our fight against other challenges in the world, that \nAmerica honors its obligations to those who fight for the values and \nprinciples we collectively share.\n  This is a critical time to send a message to friends of freedom \nacross the world that we remember our allies, and we pay our debts.\n  Our distinguished colleagues in this Senate who have served during \nWorld War II have said this is not simply a question of budget, this is \na question of honor. These individuals of honor put their lives on the \nline for our Nation, and now the honor of our Nation is on the line.\n  Let's just show a fraction of the bravery they did and vote to \nrestore to them what they were promised, what was the law, and what \nthey rightfully earned.\n  Now, like lawyers, there are some who are picking on points here or \nthere to build a case against these benefits. In my mind it is a case \nmade of sand. Let's vote to bring an honorable ending to this story and \nin however small a way let us pledge now to give them dignity in the \ntwilight of their lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Akaka's bill as it is to be \nable to keep our word in the world.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act \nthat we are debating contains a number of important measures to provide \nfor our veterans. It would expand eligibility for traumatic injury \ninsurance, provide job training, help disabled veterans make their \nhomes more accessible. And that is all worthy. But there is also \nanother issue.\n  In 1941, President Roosevelt called on the people of the Philippines \nto fight for their freedom and ours, and thousands of brave Filipinos \nanswered the call. They carried out operations to liberate their \nhomeland, and joined us in support of our efforts in the Pacific \nTheater. They fought and died at Corregidor. They were with us on the \nbeaches at Bataan, and in the death marches. They were there when \nGeneral MacArthur promised he would return, they fought using guerilla \ntactics to tie down the Japanese, and they fought under General \nMacArthur when he came back and said, ``I have returned.''\n  Throughout the war, Filipino soldiers fought under the American flag, \nserving with valor, strength, and dignity. President Roosevelt \nguaranteed those brave soldiers that the United States would come to \ntheir aid in times of peace just as they had come to our aid during \ntimes of war. He guaranteed them equal veterans' benefits--a fair \npromise, considering their service, and considering the law of the \nland, as they were full members of the U.S. military.\n  But in 1946, in one of the most misguided legislative actions of the \ntime, Congress took away the benefits that the President of the United \nStates had promised them--benefits they had rightfully earned. Of the \napproximately 250,000 Filipino veterans who fought for us in America, \nonly about 18,000 are still alive today. Many of them are searching for \nways to pay for health care, and are struggling in ways they never \nshould.\n  These veterans have more yesterdays than tomorrows. They are all well \ninto their eighties. In terms of our budget, what this bill would cost \nover the course of 10 years, we are spending in Iraq every 18 hours.\n  So those who say it costs too much are the same voices who said that \nit would cost too much to do what Democrats did under the leadership of \nSenator Akaka, when for the first time we fully funded the veterans \nindependent budget. When we bring this bill to a vote, we will be \nanswering a very simple but powerful question: Does our Nation keep its \npromises?\n  We need to right an injustice of the past and show our allies for \nfuture purposes as well; when we tell people join us in our fight \nagainst terrorism, join us in our fight against other challenges in the \nworld that America honors its obligation to those who fight for the \nvalues and our principles that we collectively share. This is a \ncritical time to send a message to friends of freedom across the world: \nwe remember our allies and we pay our debts.\n  Our distinguished colleagues in the Senate who have served during \nWorld\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nWar II have said, this is not simply a question of budget. This is a \nquestion of honor. These individuals of honor put their lives on the \nline for our Nation, and now the honor of our Nation is on the line. \nLet us show them just a fraction of the bravery they did, and vote to \nrestore them what they were promised, what was the law and what they \nrightfully earned.\n  Now, like lawyers there are some who are picking on points here and \nthere to build a case against these benefits, in my mind is a case made \nof sand. Let us vote to bring an honorable ending to this story and in \nhowever small a way, let us pledge now to give them dignity in the \ntwilight of their life. I really urge my colleagues to support Senator \nAkaka's bill as it is, and be able to keep our word in the world.\n  If I have any remaining time, I yield it back to Senator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the underlying bill that the \nSenators from Hawaii and North Carolina have put together is a step in \nthe right direction: increasing life insurance benefits, increasing \ndisability benefits--particularly for traumatic brain injury--and doing \nthat retroactively.\n  There is another portion in here that makes a lot of sense. If under \ncurrent law a veteran who is deployed to a war zone can get out of his \napartment rental contract, why should not he be able to get out of his \ncell phone lease contract? That provision is in here. That is in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Let me tell you what is not in here--I am going to have to take this \nup on the Defense authorization bill--taking care of the widows and the \norphans in the offset between survivor benefits plans and dependents' \nindemnity compensation--SVPDIC. The veterans' survivors, the widows and \norphans, are entitled under both by law--but by law they offset each \nother. Thus widows and orphans are suffering. We will address that in \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  I want to expand on what the two Senators from Hawaii have said. \nThere is one thing that America should never do, and that is break her \nword. When we have allies who are side by side with us in war, and they \nare depending on our word that we are going to take care of them, it is \nthe obligation of America to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of providing \nbenefits to Filipino veterans who served our Nation during World War \nII. S. 1315, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 introduced \nby Senator Akaka, specifically includes a provision that would restore \nhealth and pension benefits to Filipino veterans who fought for the \nUnited States during World War II. This provision is based on S.57, the \nFilipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007 originally introduced by Senator \nInouye and which I am proud to cosponsor. I have supported rectifying \nthis injustice since I entered the Senate in 2001.\n  Senator Burr's amendment would strip the provision benefitting \nFilipino veterans from S. 1315. I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  In 1942, President Roosevelt issued an order conscripting Filipino \nsoldiers into the U.S. Armed Forces. More than 250,000 Filipino \nsoldiers joined the U.S. Armed Forces in the months before and days \nfollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor. These men served on the \nbattlefield and fought courageously alongside American soldiers \nthroughout World War II, took part in the guerilla resistance, and \nsuffered in prisoner-of-war camps including the infamous Bataan Death \nMarch in which untold numbers of Americans and Filipinos soldiers \nsuffered and died under brutal conditions.\n  The United States promised these Filipino veterans the same health \nand pension benefits as those of American servicemembers, but after \nWorld War II ended, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946, \nrescinding benefits that the Filipino soldiers were entitled to receive \nas U.S. veterans. Since then, these veterans have been fighting for \nthese benefits which were unjustly revoked by the 1946 Rescission Act.\n  I reiterate the statements I made recently in honor of the 66th \nanniversary of the Bataan Death March that this is a matter of \nrestoring the honor and dignity of these courageous veterans. I will \ncontinue to support and fight for the Filipino veterans equity bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, how much time do we in the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes. The time of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina has expired.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, on July 26, 1941, President Roosevelt issued an \nExecutive Order ordering all military forces of the Commonwealth of the \nPhilippines into service of the Armed Forces of the United States. This \nhappened after a bit of history.\n  In 1898 the Philippines became a colony of the United States. It was \non March 24, 1934, that the Tydings-McDuffie Act passed Congress. That \nprovided for independence for the Philippines. It was mandated in that \nbill that there would be a 10-year period--that is to 1944--when the \nPhilippines would formalize and shape and develop its entity. But what \nwas mandated was that the United States would provide the control and \nsupervision of the national defense of the Philippines, and also of its \nforeign affairs.\n  This was in that bill in 1934. The 10-year period ended in 1944. So \nthe United States was very much a part of the Philippines. In 1941, \nunder the declaration and Executive Order of President Roosevelt, they \nserved in the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East. All of the military \nforces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines remained under the \ncommand of the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East throughout World War \nII and until the Philippines was granted independence on July 4, 1946.\n  Our Nation has a long history of caring for aging veterans, \nparticularly those who served the country during a time of war. \nPhilippine veterans of the Second World War are now in their twilight \nyears, and many are struggling to make ends meet, especially with \nglobal food prices on the rise.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support for S. \n1315, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. This is a \ntremendously important piece of legislation, and I commend Senator \nAkaka and the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their work.\n  This bill says to the men and women who have served and suffered \nhorrible injuries and paid the price of war, ``We have not forgotten \nyou. You and your families deserve the respect and care of a grateful \nNation, and we will do all that we can to see to it that you live lives \nof dignity.'' Among other things, this legislation enhances life \ninsurance benefits to disabled servicemembers, improves benefits for \nveterans who need to renovate their homes to accommodate their \ninjuries, and increases education benefits so our veterans will have an \neasier time going back to school and getting good jobs when they finish \nmilitary service.\n  But just as important as taking care of our newest generation of \nveterans, this bill also takes care of some of the oldest veterans who \nwere a part of the ``greatest generation.''\n  In 1941, President Roosevelt issued an order that directed the \nCommonwealth Army of the Philippines to fight alongside our Armed \nForces, as he was authorized to do under the Philippine Independence \nAct of 1934. Some 250,000 Filipinos would swear allegiance to the \nUnited States of America in the months before and the days after Pearl \nHarbor.\n  Under our flag, they went on to fight and die on the same \nbattlefields as U.S. troops. They gathered intelligence, organized a \nguerilla resistance against the Japanese invasion of their island home, \nand assisted in rescue operations of American prisoners of war.\n  When the fighting stopped, the members of the Filipino Army were to \nhave been eligible for full veterans' benefits, just like American \nveterans. In October of 1945 GEN Omar Bradley, who at the time was the \nhead of the Veterans' Administration, affirmed that the Filipino \nsoldiers would be treated no differently and were to receive all the \nbenefits that they rightly deserved.\n  Unfortunately, the Rescission Act of 1946 changed all that. It stated \nthat the Filipinos who fought alongside Americans had not performed \n``active service'' and that they had no standing or claim to any \n``rights, privileges, or benefits.''\n  Mr. President, there are now only about 18,000 of these heroic \nFilipinos left. About 13,000 of them are still in the Philippines, \nwhere they have waited over 60 years for the United States Government \nto provide the benefits they were promised and are owed for serving our \nNation and defending the cause of freedom. That is what this \nlegislation does. It also extends the benefits available to all U.S. \nservicemembers to the 5,000 Filipino veterans living here in the United \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, for the past 9 months, the other side of the aisle has \nbalked at allowing this legislation to come up for a vote. I am \ncertainly thankful that they have no problem with extending full \nbenefits to Filipino veterans living here. But sadly they feel that \n$300 a month for a single person and $375 for a married person is too \nhigh a pension for someone who lives in the Philippines but fought for \nthe United States 60 years ago and hasn't received a penny since. \nInstead they are insisting on no pension at all for these veterans.\n  However, I am glad that we have now moved to the bill, and we can \ndebate the merits of this vital legislation that will address the needs \nof those who have paid the price of war.\n  Senator Inouye, who has so faithfully lead this effort for the past \n16 years and knows what it means to have fought under our flag in World \nWar II, recently stated, ``What happened 61 years ago was not right; it \nwas shameful and disgraceful. . . . The legislation is about fairness \nand dignity--core American values. It is also about correcting an \ninjustice that has stood for way too long.''\n  I could not agree more, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill \nand bring these well-deserved and urgently needed benefits to those \nveterans--both young and old--who have fought on our behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The clerk will read the bill for the third and final time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage and urge my colleagues to support the pending measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, for the information of our membership, we \nwill be having a rollcall vote, then, at 2:15 p.m., and the time, now, \nwill be divided between Senator Enzi and myself on the issue of the \ngenetic nondiscrimination legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering the \nfirst major new civil rights bill of the new century. Five years ago \nthis week, we celebrated a milestone that once seemed unimaginable: the \ncompletion of the Human Genome Project, which sequenced and mapped all \nthe genes in the human body. This Friday is DNA Day, when we pay \ntribute to this amazing accomplishment, which was the dawn of a new era \nin the life sciences. Mapping the human genome has provided \nextraordinary insights for modern medicine, and it has opened the door \nto immense new opportunities to prevent, diagnosis, treat, and cure \ndisease. Its discovery may well affect the 21st century as profoundly \nas the invention of the computer or the splitting of the atom affected \nthe 20th century.\n\n  But with this invaluable new information comes a tremendous \nresponsibility. A person's unique genetic code contains the most \npersonal aspects of their identity. As we begin to decipher this \ninformation, Americans have legitimate fears about how this deeply \nprivate information will be used. Surveys show that people are already \ndeclining to take medically valuable tests out of fear that they will \nface discrimination or invasion of their personal privacy. These fears \nare not unwarranted. As Francis Collins, the leader of the NIH project \nto sequence the human genome, has said:\n\n       Genetic information and genetic technology can be used in \n     ways that are fundamentally unjust. Already, people have lost \n     their jobs, lost their health insurance, and lost their \n     economic well-being because of the misuse of genetic \n     information.\n\n  The remarkable medical advances of the genetic age will be valuable \nonly if people are not afraid to take advantage of them. The promise of \nthis new science will be in jeopardy if our laws fail to contain \nadequate protections against abuse and misuse of genetic information.\n  The bipartisan bill now before the Senate takes a substantial step to \npreserve the value of new genetic technology and to protect the basic \nrights\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\nof every American. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act \nrecognizes that discrimination based on a person's genetic identity is \njust as unacceptable as discrimination on the basis of race or \nreligion. No American should be denied health insurance or be fired \nfrom a job because of genetic testing.\n  The bill before us provides comprehensive protections. It prohibits \nhealth insurers from using a patient's genetic information to deny \nhealth insurance coverage or raise premiums. It bars employers from \nusing genetic information to make employment-related decisions. It \nprohibits insurers and employers from seeking genetic information or \nrequiring individuals to take genetic tests. It bars disclosure of \ngenetic information by insurers or employers, and it contains effective \nremedies so that anyone who has suffered genetic discrimination can \nobtain relief. By granting these protections, the bill gives the \nAmerican people the opportunity to reap the rewards of improved health \ncare through genetics without fear of unjust use of their personal \ngenetic makeup.\n  This bill has been the product of a decade of dedicated effort by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. My sincere thanks go to Senator \nSnowe and Senator Enzi for helping to lead this bipartisan effort with \nme, and to Senator Reid, our majority leader, and the Senate \nleadership, for their commitment to moving this bill forward. Thanks to \nSenator Gregg and Senator Dodd and Senator Harkin, who also made \nimportant contributions through their leadership and expertise. I \ncommend our House colleagues--Speaker Pelosi, Representative Slaughter, \nRepresentative Biggert, Chairman Miller, Chairman Rangel, and Chairman \nDingell--for their strong support, and also our former colleague, \nSenator Daschle, who was a leader in his term here in the Senate. It is \na remarkable achievement to get this bill to the President's desk. The \nadministration cooperated with us throughout the process, and we are \ngrateful for its support on this important legislation.\n  We stand today on the threshold of a major new breakthrough in \nmedical technology. With personalized medicine that genetic science \nmakes possible, patients can receive therapy precisely tailored to \ntheir own genetic makeup with reduced side effects and greater potency. \nBut the effectiveness of these new technologies is undercut by people's \nlegitimate fears and the lack of strong protections.\n  Just this week, doctors announced important findings on the genetic \nfactors that may contribute to Parkinson's disease. There are new \ndiscoveries in genetic variations that may confer a reduced risk of \nheart failure and new insights into the genetic switches that may one \nday control cancer. But one great barrier stands in the way of these \nextraordinary advances that are possible in this new field of \ndiscovery: the reluctance of patients to receive the benefit of this \nnew science and the fear that is already keeping patients from \nvolunteering for this research.\n  Even the crown jewel of our Federal research enterprise, the National \nInstitutes of Health, has been affected by this fear. The threat of \ngenetic discrimination is so real that it is even listed on the \ninformed consent document that the NIH provides to patients considering \nenrolling in the clinical trials of the new genetic medicines. This is \nwhat the chart says:\n\n       We will not release any information about you or your \n     family to your insurance company or employer without your \n     permission. However, instances are known in which genetic \n     information has been obtained through legal means by third \n     parties. This may affect you or your family's ability to get \n     health insurance and/or a job.\n\n  Can you imagine individuals going out to the NIH and saying: I will \nvolunteer in order to be a part of a research program, only to find out \nthat their genetic information could be leaked? What happens if it is \nleaked? The insurance companies will say: Look, this individual has a \nbetter chance of getting breast cancer, diabetes, bipolar disorder, or \na whole series of different types of cancer, so why are we going to go \nahead and insure that individual? Or if we are going to insure him, we \nare going to charge a good deal more.\n  Some of this genetic information is valuable to know for medical \nhistory. For example, if mothers have certain types of genetic markers, \nthe daughters might want to find out whether they have the same kind of \nproclivity. Yet if they go out and have the test so that they know \nwhether to start thinking about treating that particular health \nchallenge, they know they will be discriminated against. They won't be \nable to get a job because an employer will say: Why should I hire that \nperson when they may very well develop breast cancer, and why should I \nhire that person because if they develop breast cancer, then it will \ncost my company a good deal more to pay for that individual's health \ninsurance. That is the reality today. That is happening today.\n\n  There has been an explosion of progress in terms of genetic research. \nNew opportunities for personalized medicine are opening, which is \nreally going to be the pathway in the future. With personalized \nmedicine, patients will no longer have to receive treatments that work \nfor the average person--but may not work for them. Instead, they will \nreceive therapies precisely tailored to their own genetic makeup, with \nreduced side effects and far greater potency.\n  Individualized medicine is the way of the future. With that, there is \ngoing to be a great deal more information about an individual's health, \nbut also the attendant challenge and problem that this information \ncould be used to adversely impact that individual. That is what we want \nto avoid, and that is what we want to protect against.\n  We know there are numerous barriers to new discoveries that Congress \ncan do little about: the complexities of disease, the uncertainties of \nscience, and the rarity of true inspiration. But this is one major \nproblem which is entirely within our power to solve. We can make a \ndifference, and we can do it today. With effective protections against \nthe misuse of genetic information, this amazing new technology can \nrealize its potential and bring better health care to all people \nthroughout our world. I hope all of our colleagues will join in \nadvancing the potential of genetic research by supporting the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act.\n  I want to show on the chart all of the different groups that are \nsupporting this legislation. It gives us a very clear idea of the \noverwhelming support of the medical profession. Family physicians, \npediatricians, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, the American Heart Association--virtually the whole health \ncommunity strongly supports this bill. The National Partnership For \nWomen and Families and other women's groups and civil rights groups are \nsupportive, as are the many specialized medical groups that know about \ngenetic diseases.\n  Genetic discrimination issues are often tied to national origin. We \nhave the Tay-Sachs disease that affects many members of the Jewish \ncommunity; sickle cell anemia, which affects many African Americans; \nCooley's disease, which affects many of those who come from \nMediterranean countries, and a host of others. These are genetic \ndiseases. That is why a number of the different groups are so concerned \nabout this, because they have seen the discrimination.\n  I will just give ease to our colleagues. This chart shows when we \nhave considered the legislation at other times. We considered it in \n2003--the Senate did--and in 2005, and look at the overwhelming votes, \nRepublicans and Democrats, even in the House in 2007. But we haven't \nbeen able to get the House and Senate together at the same time. So \nthis has been going on since 2003, and we are in 2008. We have the \nopportunity with this legislation to get the job done, and the \nPresident has indicated he is going to sign it so we can achieve this \nextremely important undertaking.\n  Let me just review some of the other statements about why this is so \nimportant. We remarked here just a few moments ago about the dangers \nthat are out there in terms of people being concerned about the \nviolation of their privacy based on genetic information. Is this really \na problem? This is a chart which shows that 72 percent of Americans \nthink laws are needed to protect genetic privacy. The American people \nare really way ahead of us in the Congress on this issue. They \nunderstand that their genetic privacy is enormously important. They \nhave an inner\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\nsense, which is well-founded, that their genetic privacy can be abused. \nWe have 72 percent of Americans who think we need laws.\n  This chart shows that Americans want their genetic information kept \nprivate. Ninety-two percent of Americans think their employer should \nnot have access to their genetic information for the reasons I have \noutlined. If you don't have these protections and employers are able to \nfind out that certain individuals they are employing have a greater \nproclivity to develop disease, there is a very good chance they will \ndiscriminate against those individuals. That has been the case.\n  Eighty percent of Americans think their health insurer should not \nhave access to their genetic information. The reason for that is a very \nsound reason, which is they believe if the insurer has that kind of \ninformation, the cost for the health insurance, which is \nextraordinarily high today, will go up even further. So the American \npeople are way ahead of the Congress in getting this. With this, Mr. \nPresident, we will be meeting their particular needs.\n\n  I want to show this chart. Francis Collins, for many of us in this \nbody--and I think for the health community--is one of the great giants \nin health research. He is the person who has been at the heart and soul \nof the research on the Human Genome Project and in understanding the \npower of genes. He has made an absolutely extraordinary contribution in \nterms of science and public policy. He is a tireless advocate and a \nwonderful asset for all of us here in the Senate, on both sides of the \naisle, in strong support for this legislation.\n  As he points out:\n\n       Discrimination in health insurance, and the fear of \n     potential discrimination, threaten both society's ability to \n     use new genetic technologies to improve human health and the \n     ability to conduct the very research we need to understand, \n     treat, and prevent genetic disease.\n\n  That says it all. It talks about the danger, in terms of \ndiscrimination, and also about the ability to do the research. You \ncould be discriminated against in terms of your job or in terms of the \nincreased costs in your health insurance, or if you were involved in \nresearch, volunteering for research--the dangers that this kind of \ninformation would be out there and could be used against you.\n  Mr. President, I remember--and it wasn't that long ago--when we \nlistened to Dr. Collins. He was talking about the progress made in \ngenetic research. They were talking about markers at that time. I think \nsome of the earliest progress was made in terms of developing \ninformation about breast cancer and who had the proclivity to develop \nbreast cancer. That was truly remarkable. Since that time--and it has \nonly been a few years--we have seen that expand to prostate cancer, \ndiabetes, bipolar, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's. Think \nof that. That list is growing virtually every day. We are eventually \ngoing to be getting health care systems that will say: If you have \nthese kinds of diseases, we have the particular targeted kind of \npersonalized medicine to help you either recover or to protect you in \nterms of the future. That is going to happen, Mr. President. It is \ngoing to happen sooner rather than later.\n  This gives you an idea of how rapidly this kind of research is moving \nalong and how this kind of research, in the hands of top-rated \nphysicians and researchers who know how to treat these illnesses and \nsicknesses, will make a difference in terms of improving the quality of \nhealth care on the one hand. It is so dramatic, as is the danger of \nabuse by unscrupulous employers or health insurance companies on the \nother hand. That is what this legislation is really all about. That is \nwhy this is so important and why it has strong bipartisan support.\n  In many respects, this is going to be one of the most important \npieces of health legislation we pass in this Congress. We have other \nvery important health proposals, but this will make an enormous \ndifference in terms of the march for progress for good health care. We \nlook forward to a strong vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is an exciting day. We are going to \nmake a difference in health care for this country--not sick care; \nhealth care--and this will unlock a door that will allow people to get \nthe kind of genetic testing where they can tell if something down the \nroad might happen to them and prevent it, or at least weaken the effect \nof it.\n  As time goes on, we will find more causes that will relate back to \nthe genome and people will be able to immediately check if that new \nproblem could relate to them and they can solve it before it happens to \nthem. That is health care. That gets us away from sick care.\n  I finished a tour in Wyoming. I called it the 10 stops for 10 steps \nof health care. I collected ideas from across this body on ways we \ncould solve health care problems in America. It is 10 steps. They can \nbe done separately. If they are done separately, each step will get us \ncloser to lower costs and better access. If all of them are done, we \nwill have every American insured.\n  We need to get into prevention, particularly of chronic illnesses, \nand this bill will do it. Right now, people are afraid to get their \nblood tested. Sometimes they are forced to have their blood tested. \nInsurance companies sometimes want a blood test. That blood test will \ntell far more than it ever did in the history of the world, and that \ncan have some dire consequences, except for this bill. This bill will \nprotect people. This bill, first of all, ensures that if an insurance \ncompany takes that test and they find out anything, the person whose \nblood it was gets to find out everything. A lot of times they learn \nnothing. That is not fair. This will assure that doesn't happen.\n  Another thing that happens is sometimes there is a little clause--\nusually there is a clause--which says if it is a preexisting condition, \nthe insurance company doesn't have to cover it. Well, this keeps that \ninformation of what could possibly happen to you from becoming a \npreexisting condition until it actually happens. That gives the \nindividual the chance to do something about it first. If it doesn't \nhappen, it isn't a preexisting condition. That is what this bill will \ndo.\n  Now, another bill we need to be working on, of course, that I cover \nin my 10 steps, is health information technology. That fits with this \ngenome project. I have asked many times: How many of you have your \nmedical records with you? You know, I have yet to have anybody say they \ndo. With the technology we have in this country, everybody ought to be \nable to have all their health care and their genome on a card such as \nthis, that they can carry with them everywhere.\n  If the health IT bill passed, you could be on vacation from Wyoming \nout here in DC, and if something happened, that card would be readable \nout here. So a doctor here could know everything he needs to know to \nfix you as well as possible. That is a step we have to have in health \ncare. We are very close to getting it.\n  The old privacy issue crops up every once in a while. It isn't a \nmatter of privacy. Your privacy needs to be protected and it is \nprotected. There is always a problem of data security. Right now, \nrecords are in hospital files and in doctors' offices, and hundreds of \npeople can come through there. Yes, the records are kind of protected, \nbut people can look at them, and you would never know. If it is in \nhealth information technology and somebody gets to look at it, you will \nknow. In order to sell health information technology, companies need to \nbe working on a daily basis to make sure that information is secured. \nThey are out of business if it is not.\n  So that is not a problem, and that is a bill we need to put through \nin a process such as this. I think there is near unanimous agreement on \nboth sides of the aisle that needs to be passed, and we ought to have \nthe hour or hour and a half or 2 hours of debate on that and get that \none done. Then people truly could have their information on a card they \ncarry with them all the time. They could even add their own comments \nand the things they learn about themselves on their card.\n  There is a better reason for passing it than that, though, and that \nis there are a lot of duplication tests these days. You go to one \nprovider and he says: I have to do that test. It is an expensive test. \nHe says: Because of this test, I need to send you to a specialist, and \nthe specialist says: It is going to take so long to get that record \nover here, we\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nare going to do the test over again. Some of these tests are $3,000, \n$5,000 or $10,000. The RAND Corporation says if we could eliminate the \nduplication of tests, we could save $140 billion a year. Even in this \nbody, that is real money. We need to do that. That would be another \nstep. It is just as close as this genetic nondiscrimination has been \nfor a long time.\n  Of course, one of the rules around here is the first 90 percent of a \nbill takes 90 percent of the time, and the other 10 percent takes 90 \npercent too. That is where we have been on this. But we have finally \nbridged the last hurdle. We have gotten understanding among all the \npeople in this body--no small task--so everybody has been speaking \nfavorably on this bill and with good reason. It has been a long time \ncoming.\n  I should mention that is another thing we kind of do that is a little \nunusual. We preconferenced with the other side. We have already talked \nto the people over there who will manage any debate on that side, and \nthis bill is going to pass the House the same way it is passing the \nSenate. We have already checked with the White House, and it is going \nto be signed. So I wish to congratulate the chairman of the committee \nfor the way he has been working on this bill. This is the way bills are \nsupposed to be done, in my opinion.\n  We have worked together on a lot of bills, and the ones that go \nthrough committee and we work out these details, wind up going through \nhere in a hurry. We have learned something from being in a hurry. \nPreviously, a lot of bills that have gone through here, we have let \nthem go by unanimous voice vote. We didn't have the benefit of having \nthat opportunity to explain this, consequently we haven't gotten much \npublicity. If the publicity doesn't go out on it, the people don't know \nabout it. We are not interested in publicity for the publicity, but we \nare interested in people knowing what this bill does that will help \nthem and that will encourage them to use the genome. That is why we \nneed this.\n\n  I congratulate Senator Kennedy for all of his work on this--kind of \nfollowing the 80-percent rule. He and I are able to agree on 80 percent \nof everything. Then we pick out one issue and we can usually agree on \n80 percent of that and, more importantly, we can get the groups that \nare interested in that to agree with that same part. If you have groups \nout there that are opposing something, the bill probably doesn't have a \nlot of chance of getting through here. We covered quite a range of base \nbetween the two of us, and that makes it possible to bring a lot of \npeople along.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy, Senator Gregg, and Senator Snowe for their \nefforts to reach a bipartisan agreement on this bill. I particularly \nthank Senator Coburn for working hard to make this historic bill \nbetter. He did some important work, working with the business \ncommunity, and his knowledge as a doctor, to make it better. I \nappreciate all of that effort. I appreciate the effort of the Senators, \nthe effort of their staffs.\n  I especially recognize the efforts of my HELP Committee staff \ndirector, Ilyse Schuman. The first job she had when she came to work \nfor me 6 years ago was to work on this bill. I said it often takes 6 \nyears to get an idea through the Senate. I never believed that until I \nfigured out that she has been working on it 6 years. It should not take \nus that long to get some of these ideas to stick.\n  I also thank Andrew Patzman, who is my former health insurance \nstaffer, who also played a major role in the development and forward \nprogress of this bill.\n  I thank Shana Christrup, Keith Flanagan, Brian Hayes, and Kyle Hicks \nof my staff for their hard work on this bill. In addition, I wish to \nthank some of Senator Kennedy's staff: Michael Myers, David Bowen, \nLauren McGarity, and Portia Wu; also Stephanie Carlton of Senator \nCoburn's staff, who was absolutely essential; Bill Pewen of Senator \nSnowe's staff; Meg Hauck of Leader McConnell's staff; Jen Romans of \nSenator Kyl's staff, and Jay Khosla and David Fisher of Senator Gregg's \nstaff, for their hard work.\n  We get to come in and take the credit. They work on these for hours, \ndays, even through weekends sometimes.\n  I also thank Kim Monk, formerly of Senator Gregg's staff, and David \nThompson, formerly of Senator Gregg's and my own staff; and lastly \nspecial thanks to Bill Baird of the Senate's Office of Legislative \nCounsel, and Pete Goodloe, formerly of the House Office of Legislative \nCounsel and now with Chairman Dingell's staff, because their \nextraordinary legal drafting and problem-solving skills and their years \nof hard work helped to make this bill possible.\n  I thank everybody for their work on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It certainly has been an exceptionally long journey to reach this \npoint where we are today in the Senate. We are at least in sight of \nenactment of this watershed legislation to prevent genetic \ndiscrimination. In fact, it will open an entirely new universe of \ninfinite possibilities for Americans for years to come.\n  I commend the majority leader for making this legislation a high \npriority for the Senate's consideration today, as well as the minority \nleader, Senator McConnell, for his concurrence and support, and my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, the lead Democratic cosponsor and chairman \nof the HELP Committee. He has labored passionately and tirelessly so \nthat every American can realize the protections embodied in the \nlegislation. He marshaled this bill through committee, and we have \nendeavored to work together throughout this Congress on both sides of \nthe aisle, in both bodies, to ensure that we would be able to be in a \nposition in the Senate to vote on this legislation.\n  Senator Enzi has been absolutely crucial, as well, to our success. He \nis the former chairman of the HELP Committee and is now the ranking \nmember. He helped to obtain an array of support from so many Americans \nacross this country, as well as organizations that include health \nproviders, businesses, and health plans, which are central to providing \na strong coalition for support.\n  Similarly, Senator Gregg, former HELP Committee chairman in 2003, has \nworked to further the cause of defending Americans from genetic \ndiscrimination as well.\n  Together, these colleagues--and more--helped the Senate on two \nseparate occasions to overwhelmingly pass this legislation, in both \n2003 and 2005. It has been a long effort to realize this fruition \ntoday.\n  It was a dozen years ago when I first introduced this legislation to \nprotect individuals from discrimination in health insurance based on \ngenetic information. At that time, there were several of us who \nrecognized the tremendous threat posed by this practice, including \nthose I have mentioned and former Senate majority leader, Senator \nFrist, and former minority leader, Senator Daschle, who at the time \ncertainly foresaw that the misuse of genetic information would create a \nnew form of discrimination.\n  Yesterday, we attended the unveiling of the portrait of Senator \nDaschle. One of his former staffers indicated that it is appropriate \nthat the time of that unveiling coincides with this legislation pending \nbefore the Senate. It was so important to him.\n  Today, I am certain many colleagues, past and present, are delighted \nthat we are in a position today to pass this legislation. We are on the \nbrink of forestalling this discrimination before it becomes firmly \nentrenched.\n  It is also important, as Senator Kennedy cited yesterday, given that \nthis Friday is National DNA Day, which will mark the 55th anniversary \nof the publication of the landmark paper describing the structure of \nDNA. Since that breakthrough, our understanding of genetics has \nexpanded exponentially. Over the past decade, our progress in \nunderstanding genetics has been moving at a dizzying pace, particularly \nfollowing the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. That \nknowledge can work either for the benefit or harm to individuals, as we \nknow.\n  Today, my colleagues are dedicated to ensuring the meaning of the \nwords of the Hippocratic Oath to ``do no harm.'' Today, the Senate \nwill, for the third time, ban discrimination based on genetics.\n  Passage of this legislation by the House of Representatives was 1 \nyear\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\nago, where Representative Slaughter and others worked to shepherd this \nlegislation through three committee markups to an overwhelming House \npassage of 420 to 3. The President has called for enactment of the \nlegislation to prevent this discrimination. Ninety percent of Americans \nbelieve insurers and employers should not be allowed to discriminate \nbased on genetic information. Now it is the Senate's turn.\n  We now have an agreement between the Senate, the House, and the \nPresident. Indeed, this bill represents a triumph of bipartisan \ncollaboration and truth. Although there was broad agreement in \nprinciple to protect individuals from discrimination, some debated the \nlanguage in our bill, taking issue with whether it would affect the \npolicy that was intended. We have listened to the concerns, and we \nworked with them and responded. I thank, in particular, Senator Coburn \nfor working with us in a collaborative fashion to resolve these issues \nand to allow the debate to proceed and finally vote on final enactment \nof the legislation.\n  Too much is at stake to create uncertainty and ambiguity. The \nprotections we enact must be effective. Having worked closely with both \nHouse and Senate colleagues, the legislation is nearly identical to the \nlegislation passed in the House. We have addressed the remaining \nconcerns that were raised by many, including the administration. I \nthink it did not change in any way. The fundamentals of this \nlegislation, in fact, probably acted to improve it in some categories. \nWe have clarified that entities could communicate genetic information \nconsistent with the HIPAA privacy regulations, the Health Insurance \nPortability Accountability Act. We worked to ensure that health plans \nmay continue to utilize the presence of actual manifested diseases and \nissue rating coverages. That is the case today. We don't change that.\n\n  We are at the threshold of a new era, without question. For the first \ntime, we act to prevent discrimination before it has taken firm hold. \nThat is why this legislation is unique and groundbreaking. In the past, \nCongress has acted to address discrimination, but with this bill we are \nmaking a statement and taking a stand and saying that we look to the \nfuture, and genetic discrimination will not be allowed to flourish, \ntake root, and stand between Americans and the vast potential that \ngenetic information can provide for the greater quality of life.\n  Genetic discrimination is based on the unchangeable. By its nature, \nthe basis on which one discriminates, with respect to genetics, is not \nreadily apparent. In fact, the individual discriminating must search \nfor information on which to act. So there is no question that it is a \ndeliberate and willful effort. For example, if you see the breast \ncancer gene information on women, in order to deny women health \ninsurance or raise the cost of that coverage, the question of your \nintent seems indisputably clear. It is not inadvertent but a willful \ndiscrimination against women with greater risk of breast cancer--women \nwho should benefit from that knowledge and intervention, they should \nnot be punished for it. Because these data must be available for such \ndiscrimination to take place, it is clear why this legislation not only \nprohibits the act of discrimination but rightly respects circumstances \nin which one may request a genetics test or possess an individual's \ngenetic information. That is all the more critical today because there \nis an ever-expanding universe of such genetic data, information which \ncould be utilized to improve health, reduce costs, and to extend lives. \nBut it is absolutely useless if it, instead, discourages individuals \nfrom either participating in vital research or realizing the remarkable \nbenefits that research is producing.\n  Just a few years ago, it was virtually impossible to find genetic \ninformation on which to discriminate. You might be asked if you had a \nfamily history of a disorder. Today, the medical and scientific \nlandscape has changed dramatically, and our laws must change with it. \nWe have long known about a small number of genes that play a role in \nsome diseases, such as Huntington's disease and the early onset of \nAlzheimer's. Yet the progress of discovery and study was maddeningly \nslow and tedious. The Human Genome Project changed all of that.\n  Today, with new technology, we are witnessing an explosive increase \nin our understanding of genetics and human health. That growing \ngenetics knowledge offers the historic potential of cures and \ncustomized therapies. Even more promising, genetic advances will enable \nus to actually prevent the development of diseases. But this potential \nand the billions spent in discovering genetic relationships and the \ndevelopment of treatments and preventive agents will certainly be in \nvain if Americans don't choose to access these advances. To do so, \nAmericans must agree to undergo genetic testing. There are more than \n1,100 genetic tests today. So that only tells you the exponential \ngrowth that will be created and occur in the future. Would you undergo \nthat testing if you knew the information about your genetic makeup \ncould be used against you to deny you employment or health coverage?\n  Mr. President, some say that kind of discrimination is but a future \npossibility, that we can afford to wait until genetic discrimination \nbecomes manifest. But it already has done so. We have a veritable \nlitany of examples of heartbreaking circumstances where individuals \nchose not to seek and utilize genetic information for fear of \ndiscrimination.\n  I learned this from the real-life experience of one of my \nconstituents more than 10 years ago. Her name is Bonnie Lee Tucker. \nBonnie Lee wrote me about her fear of having the BRAC test for breast \ncancer, even though she has nine women in her immediate family who were \ndiagnosed with breast cancer and she herself is a survivor. She wrote \nto me about her fear of having the BRAC test because she worried it \nwould ruin her daughter's ability to obtain insurance in the future.\n  Bonnie's experience certainly demonstrated how our expanding \nknowledge of genetics could truly be both beneficial and harmful. I \nrecognize we simply must act to prevent the latter.\n  Bonnie Lee is not the only one who has had that fear, as we all \nlearned. Most disturbingly, when the National Institutes of Health \noffered women genetic testing, nearly 32 percent of those who were \noffered a test for breast cancer declined to participate, citing \nconcerns about health insurance discrimination. That is a sad \ncommentary today when we cannot maximize the value of scientific \nprogress, we cannot apply it to those who would benefit most.\n  We have documented cases where some attempted to mandate genetic \ntesting. Even when this is designed to improve the delivery of health \ncare, it must be recognized that once that information is disclosed and \nis unprotected, a future employer or insurer may not necessarily apply \nthat information in such a benign way, as we have all learned.\n  Yet we have recognized that if an individual accepts a genetic test, \nthey may be able to take action as a result--preventing disease or \npremature death in the process or also reducing the burden of high \nhealth care costs.\n  I recall the testimony before Congress, as Senator Kennedy, of Dr. \nFrancis Collins, the Director of the National Human Genome Institute. \nHe has been such an extraordinary leader in helping us realize the \ncritical role genomics will play in human health and the arena beyond.\n  In speaking of the next step for those involved in the genome \nproject, he explained that the project scientists were engaged in a \nmajor endeavor ``to uncover the connections between particular genes \nand particular diseases to apply the knowledge they had just \nunlocked.''\n  In order to accomplish this, Dr. Collins said:\n\n       We need a vigorous research enterprise with an involvement \n     of a large number of individuals so we can draw the most \n     precise connections between a particular spelling of a gene \n     and a particular outcome.\n\n  It is undeniably evident that this effort cannot be successful if \npeople are fearful of possible repercussions from their participation \nin genetic testing. The bottom line that given the advances in science, \nthere are two separate issues at hand.\n  The first is to restrict discrimination by health insurers. The \nsecond is to prevent employment discrimination based simply on an \nindividual's genetic information. Some of us saw this danger and the \nharm it can pose to millions of Americans, and that is why\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\nmore than a decade ago, Representative Louise Slaughter and I \nintroduced legislation in our respective bodies to ban discrimination \nin health insurance. At that time, the completion of the human genome \nseemed to be in the very distant future. But the science has certainly \noutpaced congressional action. As we know and as mentioned in the \nSenate on two different occasions, we passed this legislation \nunanimously on the floor of the Senate. Unfortunately, we could not get \nit beyond. So here we are today on the verge of doing it once again. \nThis legislation does reflect the bipartisan bicameral efforts we are \nentering into: a new era of human health, that we have engaged in this \nprocess mightily over the last 16 months to forge an even stronger \nconsensus on the fundamental agreements of genome.\n  Since the time of the introduction of our first bipartisan bill in \nthe Senate, we have worked to reiterate the agreements on which this \nlegislation is based and to build an even stronger foundation for this \nlegislation, for fundamental to this bill is establishing strong \nprotections, both in health coverage and in employment, without \nunraveling established law.\n  With regard to health insurance, the issues are clear and familiar. \nThe Senate debated them previously in the context of consideration of \nlarger privacy issues. Indeed, as Congress considered what is now the \nHealth Insurance Accountability and Portability Act of 1996, we also \naddressed the issues of privacy of medical information.\n  Moreover, any legislation that seeks to fully address genetic \ndiscrimination must consider the interaction and new protections with \nHIPAA. In fact, our legislation uses the exact same framework. As this \nbill makes clear, we do not create an onerous burden in recordkeeping. \nSpecifically, we clarify the protection of genetic information, as well \nas information on the request or receipt of genetic tests from being \nused by an insurer against an individual. That is key because we must \nrecognize that genetic information only detects the potential for \ngenetically linked disease or disorder and does not equal a diagnosis \nof a disease.\n\n  At the same time, it is also credible that this data be available to \ndoctors and other health care professionals when necessary to diagnose \nor treat an illness. This is a distinction that begs our acknowledgment \nas we discuss protecting patients from potential discriminatory \npractices by insurers.\n  On the subject of employment discrimination, unlike our legislative \nhistory on debating privacy health matters, the record regarding \nprotecting genetic information from workplace discrimination is not as \nextensive. To that end, our bipartisan bill creates these protections \nin the workplace, and there should be no question that great harm can \noccur when genetic information is used inappropriately.\n  As demonstrated by the Burlington Northern case, the threat of \nemployment discrimination was very real and, therefore, it was \nessential that we take this information out of the realm of employers' \nreach before the use of this information becomes more widespread. In \nthat instance, employees were tested without their knowledge of what \nthe testing was going to be used for. Ultimately, it turned out it was \nfor carpal tunnel syndrome. But there was no way they were required, \nmandated by the employer to undergo that testing.\n  In this aspect, the Congress has to provide the protections to ensure \nthat these discriminatory actions do not become widespread. On this \naspect, the Congress has substantial employment case law and \nlegislative history on which to build. Indeed, as we consider the \nremarkable growth in genomics and the harm which could result with its \nuse, we agree we must extend current law discrimination protections to \ngenetic information.\n  We reviewed the current employment discrimination code and decided \nwhat remedies would be available for instances of genetic \ndiscriminations and if they would differ for those available in other \ninstances under current law, such as the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, which are enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n  As a result, the pending legislation creates new protections by \nparalleling current law and clarifying the recent remedies available to \nvictims of discrimination. Ensuring that regardless of whether a person \nis discriminated against because of their religion, their race, or \ntheir DNA, individuals will all receive the same protections under the \nlaw, as they should.\n  Some have been concerned that despite clear prohibitions and \nreasonable remedies and penalties in disputes, there will be incentives \nto seek greater or lesser penalties justified under statute, and the \nlegislation defines those boundaries. It will be the presence of these \nprohibitions and penalties which will ensure we do not see a growth in \ngenetic discrimination. Indeed, I believe some who have questioned the \nnecessity of this legislation may continue to do so, pointing to no \noverwhelming problem before us, that it is essentially a solution in \nsearch of a problem.\n  The bottom line is this legislation will prevent and preempt harm. \nThey will recognize in the final analysis, given the open-ended, \ninfinite possibilities that will be created by genetics, that if we \nprovide these protections, individuals will have the incentive to \nincreasingly avail themselves of medical knowledge which will not only \nimprove their health, but actually reduce health care costs.\n  The fact is, for employers who have had concerns about this \nlegislation, they should also recognize how it will significantly \nreduce health care costs. Isn't it essential to utilize our investments \nin advancing medical knowledge to prevent disease, disability, or even \ndeath? To the contrary. The fact is we need the incentives to ensure \nindividuals will use genetic testing. So to that end, IBM pledged a few \nyears ago not to use genetic information in hiring practices and \ndeciding eligibility for health insurance coverage. This, again, \ndemonstrated admirable understanding of how such discrimination can \nharm both the individual and business, and IBM has found that policy \nworks.\n  It has been more than 6 years since the completion of the working \ndraft of the human genome. Like a book which is never opened, the \npotential of our expanding genetic knowledge will not be realized \nunless individuals can take advantage of it without adverse \nconsequences.\n  The pending legislation is a shining example of what we can \naccomplish when we set aside our partisan differences. In fact, we \nachieved remarkable success in this endeavor. I stated this earlier. \nThe House of Representatives passed it by 420 to 3. That is an \nextraordinary tally reflecting, I think, the broad-based support this \nlegislation enjoys.\n  Today 46 Members of the Senate--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--are sponsors of this legislation and a broad coalition of \nthe Genetic Alliance that includes more than 600 member organizations.\n  We are at a historic crossroads on a paramount issue that can make \nthe difference between life and death for countless Americans. People \ndeserve to have protections from genetic discrimination, and this \nlegislation deserves swift enactment in the Senate.\n  As science and medicine hurl headlong into the 21st century, we have \na responsibility to ensure our laws keep pace to ensure the benefits of \nthis extraordinary era of advancements that can be realized by everyone \nwithout penalty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to address this issue as well. Before \nshe leaves the floor, I commend the Senator from Maine who has been \nlong involved, going back more than 10 years on this issue. I had the \nprivilege joining with her 10 years ago as a cosponsor of legislation \nin 1997. This is a colleague who has been deeply involved in this issue \nfor a long time. I recognize her early contribution to this debate. I \nthank her for her comments.\n  I rise today to express my strong support for the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act--better known as GINA--to urge its speedy passage \nby this body. When I first joined Senator Snowe in the fight for \npassage of this legislation, our Nation was at the dawn of a burgeoning \ngenetic age, a time when we could only dream of the technologies that \nwould exist 10 years later. Those genetic technologies are here now and \nhere to stay.\n  Genetic testing and genomic services are being advertised directly to \nconsumers even as we speak.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\n  These ads are hard to read, but I am going to try to hold them up for \npeople to see. Maybe others have put up similar ads. Here are some of \nthe advertisements that appear in local newspapers that advertise \nservices. One is for $99. I don't know what the cost is on this one. It \nis a BRAC analysis dealing with breast cancer. These are a few ads to \nshow what is happening across the country.\n  This is good news, but also dangerous in some ways because people are \nmaking decisions about their conditions and their futures sometimes \nbased on very shoddy information. It is troubling to me people are \nbeing drawn into this situation without understanding the full \nimplications.\n  Genetic testing and genomic services are being advertised, as I said, \nto consumers. So the need for this legislation has never been greater. \nThis is a very important moment for us to act.\n  I also wish to take a moment to commend the leadership of Senator \nSnowe who, as I said earlier, was involved in this issue early on. \nAlso, Senator Pete Domenici. He and I were involved with a bill in 1997 \nas well, about the time I joined Senator Snowe on her legislation. \nSenator Domenici was very interested in this subject. And, obviously, I \ncommend the work of Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi. Their leadership \nand skillful negotiations have allowed for passage of this legislation. \nI commend Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, as well for his \nsupport and commitment to the passage of this legislation. While he is \nno longer a Member of this body, I commend Senator Tom Daschle, who was \nvery interested in this subject matter and offered legislation as a \nSenator, also as leader. While we recognized his contributions a day or \nso ago with the hanging of his portrait as a former leader of this \nbody, he was deeply involved in this issue, and I would be remiss if I \ndid not recognize his contribution as well, as a former Member of this \nbody whose work enabled the Senate to achieve passage of this \nlegislation in previous Congresses.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle saw the need years ago for \nlegally enforceable rules to maximize the potential benefits of genetic \ninformation and to minimize its potential dangers. But despite passage \nof the legislation in the Senate twice and the House once, it is still \nnot the law of the land. Up until today, passage of this legislation \nhas been blocked by one Senator. While I am heartened that efforts to \nobstruct passage of a bill so widely supported in the House and the \nSenate have been overcome, I am disappointed that the valuable \nprotections provided by this legislation were denied to the American \npeople until now.\n  In the decade that has passed while this legislation has been \npending, the sequencing of the human genome was completed, yielding a \ndizzying number of discoveries about genes associated with diseases and \naccelerating genetic research. Scientists are finding that nearly all \ndiseases, including common diseases, such as diabetes and heart \ndisease, have a genetic component. Determining the underlying genetic \ncomponents of disease is fueling the development of new treatments and \ncures.\n  As an aside, years ago, at Yale Medical School, I attended a briefing \nby the professionals there. They were doing studies on young girls, \ndetermining in twins the ability to detect very early on a genetic \npredisposition to breast cancer. A remarkable breakthrough was \noccurring with the wonderful news that we could possibly moderate \nlifestyles and improve them accordingly to avoid the onslaught of that \ndreaded disease. Obviously, there were concerns as well about such \ninformation becoming available without adequate protections with \nrespect to insurance and employment opportunities as well as the \nconclusions people might make as a result of that information. But, \nnonetheless, I was very impressed with the work being done years ago in \nthis whole area of identifying the genetic components of diseases.\n  Additionally, genetic tests for hundreds of disorders are already \navailable, with many more in the pipeline. Some of these tests predict \nthe likelihood of developing a disease or condition, providing unique \nopportunities for interventions that may delay the onset or wholly \nprevent that disease from occurring. In the not-so-distant future, \nroutine use of genetic information is going to give doctors an \nunprecedented ability to tailor treatments to the individual patient.\n  However, the potential benefits of such advances in medicine will not \nbe realized if people refuse genetic testing or do not participate in \ngenetic research because they fear discrimination by an employer or by \nan insurance company. Indeed, surveys have repeatedly shown that \nAmericans do fear the possibility of genetic discrimination. They are \nafraid of losing their jobs or health insurance coverage because their \nemployer or insurance company learns of a genetic risk for a disease, a \ndisease they do not currently have or may never get at all. The fact \nyou have a predisposition does not in any way guarantee it is going to \nhappen. It is merely a predisposition. Yet that information, obviously, \ncould affect the cost of insurance available to you if insurance is \navailable at all or whether you were going to get that job you would \nlike to have. Many people are also afraid of affecting their children's \nability to get jobs or obtain insurance.\n  So without adequate protections against discrimination, people may \nforgo genetic testing, even in cases where the results have the \npotential to save their lives or the lives of their family.\n  Our genetic code is the most personal of all information. We do not \nyet fully understand what it can reveal about us as individuals and \nabout whom we may or may not become. All Americans have the right to \nuse this information to make better health care decisions and not fear \nfor its misuse.\n  The potential for misuse, of course, is very real. State laws provide \nonly a mixed bag of safeguards, leaving inadequate or no protection at \nall against discrimination for many of our fellow citizens. Existing \nFederal protections against genetic discrimination under the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act or the Americans with \nDisability Act are inadequate to comprehensively protect against misuse \nof genetic information.\n  That is why this bill is so important, and why, again, the authors of \nit, the early sponsors of it, deserve great commendation by all. It \nwould provide significant protections against the misuse of genetic \ninformation by health care providers and employers, ensuring that all \nAmericans will not lose or be denied health insurance, jobs or \npromotions based on their genetic makeup.\n  Specifically, it prohibits enrollment restriction and premium \nadjustment on the basis of genetic information or genetic services. It \nprevents health plans and insurers from requesting or requiring an \nindividual take a genetic test. With respect to employment \ndiscrimination, the legislation prohibits discrimination in hiring, \ncompensation and other personnel processes and prohibits the collection \nof genetic information. The legislation protects each and every one of \nus because we all potentially have a genetic makeup that makes us more \nsusceptible to some kind of an ailment, and that possibility should not \nbe an obstruction to an insurance policy or a job.\n  While this legislation represents an enormous step forward and is a \nvast improvement over current law, many remain concerned about the \nmeasure's privacy protections, and we intend to continue monitoring \nthem over time. Specifically, the legislation imposes important \nlimitations on the collection of personal genetic information by \ninsurance companies, but it would still allow them to collect such \ninformation without consent once an individual is enrolled in a health \nplan. While insurance companies are expressly prohibited from using \nthis information for the purposes of underwriting, frankly, I remain \nconcerned, once this information is collected, it may be difficult to \ncontrol how it is used and who has access to it. As we have seen with \nnumerous high-profile data breaches at the Veterans' Administration and \nthe National Institutes of Health, the greater the number of people who \nhave access to information, the greater the challenge of protecting \nthat information.\n  As this bill becomes law--and I genuinely hope it will and am \nconfident it will--all of us will be following the implementation and \nthe extent to which it ensures privacy is protected. We will not \nhesitate to revisit the issue in the future, as I suspect we may have \nto.\n  I am the author of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, along with\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\nmy colleague Senator Hatch of Utah, which the Senate passed unanimously \nlast December and is expected to be signed into law by the President in \nthe coming days. In fact, I am told that might occur today. This \nlegislation would expand and improve the number and quality of \nscreening tests for genetic and metabolic conditions offered to \nnewborns, which I feel so strongly about, throughout our country. These \ntests are critical because if a newborn tests positive for one of these \nrare conditions, treatment must begin immediately to prevent a lifetime \nof disability or even death. Because many of these conditions are \ngenetic, the protections guaranteed under this bill are critical to \npreventing discrimination against these infants and their families by \ninsurers or employers.\n  The newborn screening legislation authored by Senator Hatch and \nmyself, possibly signed into law today, will be enhanced tremendously \nby the adoption of this legislation because several of those tests, as \nI said, are genetic. So it is my strong hope GINA will be sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Again, my compliments to Senators Kennedy and Enzi and their staff \nfor the work they have done on this, and, of course, to Senator Snowe \nfor being a pioneer years ago in this area.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN, Mr, President, I am pleased that we have finally reached \nan agreement on the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act, GINA, \nand that it will soon become law.\n  April 2003 marked a scientific discovery significant enough to \ntransform both science and society. April 2003 brought the announcement \nthat a vast team of scientists had determined the exact sequence of the \nhuman genetic code and placed that information in public databases. \nThis is an achievement the last generation could only dream about.\n  Scientific understanding of the links between genes and disease will \nsoon give rise to a flood of new answers and cures for those that \nsuffer from disease. We are on the cusp of a new, unprecedented era of \npersonalized medicine.\n  As a practicing physician, I look forward to the better care and \ncures that I'll be able to give my patients with new technology \ndeveloped from the use of genetic information.\n  While there have been very few documented cases of genetic \ndiscrimination, GINA will eliminate the fear of genetic information. \nAll Americans need to know that their predictive genetic information--\nthat they have no ability to change or control--will not be used \nagainst them in health care and employment decisions.\n  These protections will finally be enacted with the passage of GINA \ntoday in the Senate, House passage to follow, and then finally a bill \nthat can be signed by President Bush.\n  Appropriately drafted legislation is an important key to unlocking \nthe tremendous potential to save and improve lives through the exciting \nfield of medical genomics. GINA has long been a bipartisan vision.\n  I want to be crystal clear that I have supported the vision of GINA \nin the past, and I will support it again today.\n  While I did place a hold on GINA for a while, that hold meant we \nweren't finished crafting the legislative language on GINA. I reserved \nmy right to debate and perfect it--after taking the time to read and \nunderstand the language of GINA and the House action on GINA.\n  It is like working on an appropriations bill--I support funding the \ngovernment but that doesn't mean I support throwing $3.1 trillion into \nit. There is some work that has to be done before we send a bill to the \nPresident. As lawmakers, we have the responsibility to make sure we \nwrite laws that do exactly what we're telling the American people they \ndo. I feel confident that today's version of GINA does that.\n  I would note that when we finally started negotiating the substance \nof my concerns with GINA, we were able to get them resolved in 2 weeks. \nThat was a much faster and more effective way of getting GINA done than \nwhat we've seen over the last year--slandering my reputation in the \nmedia and trying to slip the unfinished version of GINA into last \nminute appropriations bills.\n  I am pleased that Senators Kennedy and Enzi recognized this and \nexercised leadership in bringing everyone to the table to get a \nsolution that everyone could support. That's the kind of transparency \nand debate that the American people deserve.\n  Today's Senate passage of GINA marks a significant step forward so \nthat the American people may fully benefit from the promise of genomics \nand personalized medicine. GINA removes the barriers to the full \npotential of personalized medicine.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Enzi, for \nhis work, the chairman for his work, and I particularly recognize \nSenator Snowe. I know Dr. Francis Collins, head of our Human Genome \nProject, and the key thing he has talked about from the outset of it \nwas the need for this type of legislation which Senator Snowe has \nchampioned for a long time. I am delighted to see it passing here. \nThere is strong support for it.\n  I want to particularly point out a provision in the bill that was \nadded on the House side by Representative Bart Stupak from Michigan, \nthat would prevent the use of genetic information from unborn children \nand children in the process of being adopted. We can see a situation \nwhere somebody would apply for work, a lady who is pregnant, the child \nhas Down syndrome, and that information being used against her in being \nable to get employment. That is built within the bill and I am \ndelighted that is in there so we do not have that type of \ndiscrimination taking place as well.\n  I have spoken previously about the very real pressure that exists in \nthese types of situations, where people get a Down syndrome designation \nand then the pressure in the system to abort the child. Senator Kennedy \nand I have a bill that I am hopeful we will be able to get passed on \nnondiscrimination taking place in these situations, getting more \ninformation out to the parents and an adoption registry of people who \nwant to adopt Down syndrome children, who want to adopt children who \nhave these difficulties.\n  At the same time, I think we need to know that today there is a real \ntragedy on a massive scale going on in the country of genetic \ndiscrimination. That is happening today in this country. We know that, \ntoday, 90 percent of the women who are pregnant with Down syndrome \nchildren, once they get that genetic designation of the child, the \nchild will not be allowed to live--90 percent is the level that is \ntaking place there, of that genetic information and its use. The \nnumbers are similarly high for prenatally diagnosed children with spina \nbifida, cystic fibrosis, and dwarfism. It has all been well documented \nby the American Journal of Medical Genetics and the journal Prenatal \nDiagnosis. So we have an increase in genetic testing, up to 120 \ndifferent tests, and then a number of these children in this situation \nnot being allowed to live.\n  It is a bit personal with one of my staff members. Stacey Cervenka is \nhere with me, who was born blind and is concerned that in the future \nour children are going to be prenatally diagnosed as being blind, deaf, \nand not allowed to get here. I do not think that is the kind of country \nwe want to be in.\n  That is why I am so happy this bill is passing, so we do not have \ngenetic discrimination of people. I think it should extend to the full \nrange of a lifetime of genetic discrimination. That is why I have \noffered a bill with Senator Kennedy to partially address this issue, \nthe Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, to \nensure families get the necessary information in these situations and \nalso the connection to the help and support services they need. It also \nprovides for national registry for those willing to adopt children with \nthese conditions.\n  We all should be concerned when one's genetic information is being \nused for discrimination. We know we are better than that as a society. \nThe real question is whether every life at every stage and every place \nhas that value and is worth protecting and fighting for. I think it is. \nI think we as a body believe that. One's genetic composition does not \ndetermine one's value. Those with disabilities have the same inherent \nhuman dignity and value as everyone else. Genetic discrimination\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\nagainst anyone is unacceptable, particularly those who are next \ngeneration, our children.\n  I might add, as a close, that as reported this week, the Governor of \nAlaska, Governor Sarah Palin, gave birth to a child named Trig, who \nhappens to be a Down syndrome child. I wish to share what she said on \nthis occasion:\n\n       Trig is beautiful and already adored by us. We knew through \n     early testings he would face special challenges, and we feel \n     privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow \n     us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives. We have faith \n     that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential \n     to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.\n\n  What a great thought for all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today is a groundbreaking day for millions \nof Americans and for the future of health care. I am pleased to \nstrongly support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007, \na bill that I am proud to be an original cosponsor of.\n  I also want to recognize the outstanding leadership of Senator Snowe \nand Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, who have been working on this bill \nfor many years. The House passed its bill last year by an overwhelming \nmargin of 420 to 3. Tomorrow will mark 1 year since that House vote. It \nis my hope that today, the Senate will pass this bill by a substantial \nmargin as well.\n  Years ago medical researchers began to discover the vast array of \npersonal health information that could be determined through genetic \ntesting, with the discovery of the human genome. By decoding the human \ngenome, scientists have identified many of the gene sequences \nassociated with disease, leading to new knowledge about the underlying \ncauses of illnesses.\n  Last November, Duke University researchers announced the discovery of \n200 ``silenced genes,'' a unique group of genes that they believe play \na profound role in health status. These are genes that may increase the \nlikelihood that a person will develop mental illness, cancer, diabetes, \nor other major diseases, or they may serve to prevent the development \nof certain diseases. There are approximately 1,000 different tests \navailable now, and private insurers are beginning to include some \nclinical genetic tests as part of their health insurance benefits \npackages.\n  Genetic testing holds extraordinary promise for individuals and for \nthe doctors who treat them. It allows us to identify the predisposition \nto develop a certain disease. It allows us to decide which medical \nspecialists to seek out, which preventive screenings to begin earlier \nthan standards may recommend for the general population, which signs \nand symptoms of illness to be particularly alert to, and which \ndiagnostic or predictive testing to pursue even when symptoms may not \nbe present. It can be extremely helpful in cases, such as Huntington \nDisease, where gene testing is necessary to make a certain diagnosis. \nIt also allows health care practitioners to make informed decisions \nabout the optimal medical care to provide a patient with an inherited \ndisease. And beyond the patients themselves, genetic testing can help \npredict the risk of disease to parents, siblings, and children.\n  Over the years, Americans have come to realize what these \ndevelopments would mean for them. Unfortunately, at the same time we \nalso began to realize that genetic testing can be used against us in \nthe workplace and by health insurers. For example, the results of the \nBRCA-1 test for breast cancer can be used to deny employment to a woman \nor to refuse to issue her comprehensive health insurance coverage. And \nso it is completely understandable that patients decline tests that \ncould provide them life-saving information because they fear \ndiscrimination.\n  What a waste of resources and medical information if, after all the \nwork done by biomedical research and supported by billions of our \ndollars, the people who can benefit most from these discoveries do not \ntake advantage of them.\n  Just this week, a new report revealed the poor health status of \nAmericans. Our health status is worse than it should be, and our health \ncare costs are far higher than they need to be because we are not \ntaking advantage of the technology available to us to fight disease. \nPassage of GINA will help change that.\n  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 took \nsome important first steps to protect employees and health consumers \nfrom discrimination along these lines, but current law does not go far \nenough. For example, now, employers may require clinical genetic tests \nas a qualifier for employment. Passage of GINA will change that also.\n  Most State legislatures have taken action to prevent health insurers \nfrom discriminating based on genetic testing. My State of Maryland, for \nexample, prevents individual and group health insurance policies from \nestablishing rules for eligibility based on genetic information. \nInsurance companies are not permitted to require applicants or \nenrollees to take genetic tests or provide genetic information, or can \nthey use genetic information for risk selection or for determining \nhealth insurance rates. Maryland law also prohibits insurance companies \nfrom disclosing information without the informed consent of \nsubscribers. Many other States have passed similar laws.\n  But because of ERISA pre-emption, millions of other Americans who are \nnot protected by State laws still need our help. ERISA plans--those \nthat are not fully insured but are instead self-insured and regulated \nby the Federal Government--are not covered by State laws. In Maryland, \nnearly 40 percent of insured workers have health insurance coverage \nthat is not protected against genetic discrimination.\n  Nationwide, the numbers are even larger. According to the Employee \nBenefit Research Institute, nearly 55 percent of all workers are \ncovered by a self-insured health plan, and in larger firms, those with \n5,000 or more employees, 89 percent of workers are covered by self-\ninsured arrangements in 2006, up from 62 percent in 1999. So just in \nthe last 8 years, we have seen substantial increases in the number of \nworkers who are subject to genetic discrimination in health insurance, \neven though the States where they live and work have taken steps to \noutlaw it. That is another of many reasons why passage of this bill \ntoday is necessary.\n  We know that the medical technology exists to help us defeat deadly \nand debilitating illnesses. It is time for Federal law to change so \nthat Americans are free to use this technology.\n  In the 109th Congress, while I was still a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate passed this legislation unanimously. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in strong support of this bill today and \nprovide the American people with the protections they need to receive \nthe quality health care they deserve.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act. Medical science has made amazing progress over \nthe past century and a half, and I hope that we can pass this \nlegislation, which will allow our nation to harness the promise of \npersonalized medicine through an understanding of individual genomes, \nwhile ensuring that Americans are protected against the misuse of such \npowerful knowledge.\n  The past 140 years have marked an increasingly frequent series of \nscientific breakthroughs regarding that intricate and vital component \nof life called deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n  In 1869, Friedrich Miescher found the microscopic substance that \nwould come to be called DNA within the nuclei of cells. In 1952, Alfred \nHershey and Martha Chase confirmed that DNA plays a role in heredity. \nThe following year, James Watson and Francis Crick used images produced \nby Rosalind Franklin to propose what many believe to be the first \naccurate model of the structure of DNA, the now-familiar double helix. \nIn 1977, Fred Sanger boosted the ``phi X'' bacteriophage into the \nlimelight by making it the first organism to have its genome sequenced.\n  With the advent of genome sequencing came the need for a common \nlocation to store all that information. Efforts to develop the Los \nAlamos Sequence Database, which was established in 1979, led to the \nestablishment in 1982 of the GenBank to store genome sequences, which \nwas jointly funded by the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, and the Departments of Defense and \nEnergy.\n  In 1990, the Human Genome Project, a bold new international \ncollaboration, was established. While there is more\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\nwork to be done, by about February of 2003, approximately 92 percent of \nthe human genome had been sequenced. As scientists discover more about \nthe human genome, we learn more about disease and illness. \nUnderstanding the relationship between our genes and disease has \nalready led to improvements in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and \neven prevention where possible. In 2006, George Church announced the \nPersonal Genome Project, which seeks to record the complete genome of \neach volunteer. The ability to unlock an individual's genome could, \ncombined with the knowledge developed through genetic research, allow \nfor personalized medicine to a degree that would have been unheard of \nonly years ago.\n  Though there are many diseases we do not yet fully understand and \nthough much additional research is needed, we have at our grasp the \nability to make stunning breakthroughs in medicine by looking inside \nourselves, to our own genes. With the incredible advances in modern \nmedicine resulting from our new understanding of, and ability to \nanalyze, our own genes comes great responsibility.\n  Genetic information about an individual could be used for great good: \nit could hold the keys to identifying the best way to treat each person \nfor their illnesses. However, we must be careful to guard against the \nuse of this information to discriminate against those of differing \ngenetic compositions. It would be absolutely unacceptable, for example, \nfor an employer to use genetic information in making hiring decisions \nor determining pay. Likewise, it would be unconscionable to allow \ninsurance companies, whose business combines both health and risk \nassessment, to utilize genetic information for the purpose of denying \ncoverage for, or charging higher rates to, an individual merely because \nof that person's unalterable building blocks of life, their DNA.\n\n  Probabilities and statistical measures derived from analysis of the \nhuman genome may be able to help us to be proactive and preventive in \ncaring for patients. However, we must not allow discrimination on the \nbasis of that information. There is always the chance that an \nindividual will never develop a particular disease and, therefore, \nnever incur the cost of treating the disease that never developed. It \nwould be unjust to force an additional burden upon an individual as a \nresult of the potential, as opposed to the fact, of developing a \nparticular disease.\n  Unfortunately, the risk of discrimination is real. Our history has \nshown us that some employers have discriminated on the basis of a range \nof impermissible categories. As a result, Congress has passed laws such \nas the Civil Rights Act, CRA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, \nand the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA. These laws have \nmade significant steps in reducing discrimination in employment, but \nproblems remain and Congress continues to work to pass additional \nantidiscrimination legislation to expand those protections.\n  Likewise, the economics of the health insurance industry, in its \ncurrent form, demand that Congress act to pass legislation to protect \nindividuals from being discriminated against, perhaps because their DNA \nindicates a possible disease or disorder that the insurance provider \nwould rather not cover. Or perhaps merely because people with certain \ngenetic markers might require more attention and care--and therefore \nrepresent a higher cost to the insurer--than others. I believe we have \na moral obligation as a Nation to ensure that all Americans have access \nto quality, affordable health care. Part of that obligation includes \nensuring that no American is denied health care because of their DNA.\n  We do not determine our own DNA. We are born with it. We cannot allow \ndiscrimination on the basis of such a fundamental aspect of life and \none in which we had no choice. Beyond the genes that set the backdrop \nfor our physical existence, we are, each of us, unique beings with the \nfreedom to choose our paths in life. We must not allow the use of \ngenetic information to constrain our freedoms.\n  The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act provides essential \nprotections to preserve our individual freedom and protect our rights. \nI support this bill and I hope that it will receive speedy passage in \nthe House of Representatives and that the President will act quickly to \nsign this critical legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, passage of the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act, GINA, is the culmination of many years of work. \nThis effort began over a dozen years ago and would not be possible \nwithout the work of many Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Senator Daschle worked tirelessly on this legislation during his time \nas Democratic leader. Senator Jeffords was also a dedicated champion of \nthis bill. Passage of this legislation today would not be possible \nwithout the perseverance of the bill's sponsors, Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions, HELP, Committee Chairman Kennedy, HELP Committee \nRanking Member Enzi, and Senator Snowe. Senators Dodd and Harkin have \nalso been central to this effort. Congresswomen Slaughter and Biggert \nalong with Congressmen Miller, Dingell, and Rangel have been leaders on \nthis issue in the House. Thanks to their collective commitment to GINA, \nthis crucial piece of legislation is finally on the verge of becoming \nlaw.\n  I also want to acknowledge the Coalition for Genetic Fairness and the \nmany other organizations representing patient groups, medical \nprofessionals, scientists, researchers, families, and employees who \nadvocated tirelessly on behalf of the protections offered by this \nlegislation. They never let us forget about the urgent need to enact \nGINA and the dire consequences of neglecting this issue.\n  There are too many individuals and groups to mention by name, but I \ndo want to single out one individual in particular. Dr. Francis \nCollins, Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, has \nbeen an important voice in this debate. Dr. Collins' groundbreaking \nwork in advancing the science of genomics has led us to powerful new \ninsights into the links between genes and common diseases such as \ndiabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn's disease. He has \ndedicated himself to securing Federal protection against genetic \ndiscrimination so that the American people do not have to fear \ndiscrimination because they have had genetic tests or participated in \ngenetic research.\n  Every one of us stands to benefit from this landmark legislation. \nGenetic research is advancing at a remarkable pace. The sequencing of \nthe human genetic code has already allowed doctors to develop better \nways to diagnose, prevent, or treat some of the most dreaded diseases \nknown to man. In 2007 alone, researchers discovered more than 70 gene \nvariants associated with common diseases such as diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, and cancer. Each of these discoveries suggests \nnew options for both the treatment and prevention of these diseases. \nHowever, these exciting advances are being threatened by fears of \ngenetic discrimination.\n  This concern has been communicated to me in hundreds of meetings, \nletters, and phone calls from constituents.\n  For example, a woman from Las Vegas who is affected by pulmonary \nhypertension, a continuous high blood pressure in the arteries that \nsupply the lungs, wrote the following:\n\n       Life expectancy for PH patients who do not receive \n     treatment averages 2.5 years, but with early, appropriate \n     treatment, some patients are now able to manage their PH for \n     twenty years or more. . . . GINA will allow patients with a \n     family history of PH to pursue genetic testing and receive \n     life-saving treatment without fear of related discrimination.\n\n  And a man from Las Vegas, who suffers from Polycystic Kidney Disease, \nPKD, a life-threatening genetic disease affecting the kidneys, wrote:\n\n       Fear of genetic discrimination keeps many PKD families from \n     testing for the presence of the disease or seeking treatments \n     that could prolong their kidney function. In addition, fear \n     of genetic discrimination has adversely affected many \n     clinical drug trials now underway in the PKD research field. \n     These clinical trials desperately need volunteers to \n     participate, but many with PKD are fearful their \n     participation in such trials will be used against them by \n     their insurers and/or employers.\n\n  For genetic research to fulfill its true potential, patients need \nstrong protections against genetic discrimination. GINA will establish \nstrong protections against discrimination based on genetic information \nin health insurance\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\nand employment. As a result, patients can receive the best possible \nmedical treatments without having to fear that genetic information will \nbe used against them by their insurers or by their employers. The bill \nwill also allow researchers to pursue the promise of genetic research \nby ensuring the confidentiality of genetic information by participants \nin clinical trials. GINA will enable all Americans to take full \nadvantage of potentially life-saving genetic testing, and will pave the \nway for full realization of the promise of personalized medicine.\n  The House will soon take up and pass this legislation, and I urge \nPresident Bush to sign this bill into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair let me know when I have 30 seconds left? \nI yield myself the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Brownback for reminding us about our \nbill dealing with Down's syndrome. It is a very worthwhile effort and \none that is enormously compelling. I give him the assurance we want to \nwork very closely with him. We are trying to get a counterpart in the \nHouse of Representatives and trying to get this done during this \nsession. We thank him for his strong leadership in that area. He has \nbeen working on it for a long time.\n  Mr. President, we are in a new era of the life sciences, and the \ntruth of that statement can be seen in fields from medical imaging, to \nnew biologic drugs and even to the use of DNA technology to improve our \nenvironment and reduce greenhouse gasses. But in no area of research is \nthe promise greater than in the field of personalized medicine.\n  With personalized medicine, patients will no longer have to receive \ntreatments that work for the average person--but may not work for them. \nInstead, they will receive therapies precisely tailored to their own \ngenetic makeup, with reduced side effects and far greater potency.\n  The cost of developing new drugs is likely to be significantly \nreduced. No longer will a potentially promising drug be consigned to a \ndusty warehouse because it fails to work well on average, if it has the \npotential to treat patients with a particular genetic condition.\n  A main barrier in the way of such extraordinary advances is the \nreluctance of patients to seek the benefits of this new science and the \nfear volunteering for this research.\n  Three stories recounted to the advisory committee on genetic issues \nat the Department of Health and Human Services make the point.\n  Tonia Phillips has the BRCA-1 mutation. He told the committee that \nbased on her genetic risk for ovarian and breast cancer, she elected to \nhave a hysterectomy and a prophylactic double mastectomy. Ms. Phillips \nworks for a small company of just four people. After her surgery, the \nhealth insurance premium for the company increased by $13,000 year. Her \nemployers asked her to switch to her husband's health insurance policy, \nand even offered to increase her salary if she would switch policies. \nShe refused. The company then adopted a policy requiring employees to \npay half their insurance costs. If GINA is passed, changing the terms \nof employment based on genetic information would be illegal.\n  Paula Funk, a 33-year-old mother from Arkansas, told the committee \nthat of her 24 female relatives, 13 have developed breast cancer. She \ndecided to pay out-of-pocket and be tested for BRCA-1 anonymously. She \ntested positive, had a prophylactic double mastectomy, and plans to \nhave her ovaries removed in the near future. Paula and her husband \nopened their own computer business but were prepared to abandon their \nplans unless they could get a group health plan for their two-person \ncompany, because they knew she wouldn't qualify for individual \ninsurance based on her BRCA-1 status. Her concern now is for protection \nagainst discrimination for her two young daughters, Audrey and Anna, \nwho will someday have to make the difficult decision about being \ntested. If GINA is passed, Audrey and Anna would not have to fear \nlosing their health insurance based on a BRCA-1 test result.\n  Judith Berman Carlyle, a 48-year-old woman with a family history of \novarian cancer, was afraid that she wouldn't be able to obtain health \ninsurance if she tested positive for the variant of the BRCA-1 gene \nthat is related to breast and ovarian cancer. Instead of being tested, \nshe decided to have prophylactic surgery to remove her ovaries, \nbelieving that the surgery would be less likely to cause her to be \ndropped by her insurer. Later, having obtained health insurance, Judith \ndecided to be tested for BRCA-1 before having a prophylactic double \nmastectomy. Her test was negative. If she had known this information, \nshe might not have chosen to have her ovaries removed and might have \nopted for increased screening measures.\n  Earlier this year, the Pulitzer Prize was awarded for an \nextraordinary series of articles on the promise and challenge of this \nnew science. One article dealt with the fears of discrimination faced \nby those who undergo genetic tests, and the measures they take to \nprotect themselves. Those articles included new revelations about the \nharm caused by the fear of discrimination.\n  Victoria Grove, of Woodbury, MN, told how she concealed crucial \ninformation about her genetic tests from her doctor, for fear it would \nbe used to deny coverage. As a result, she did not receive proper \ntreatment for her lung condition.\n  Kathy Anderson's parents refused to let her be tested for a genetic \ncondition that affects blood clotting, for fear of discrimination. When \nKathy was prescribed a common birth control pill, she developed massive \nclots--a life threatening illness that could have been avoided if she \nhad had the genetic tests.\n  For Judith Carlisle, the consequences of not taking a genetic test \nwere tragic. She has a strong family history of breast cancer, but was \nafraid that a genetic test to detect a particular gene mutation would \nprovide proof to insurance companies and employers that she was a \nhealth risk. So she refused to take the test.\n  Still, she worried about the risks of cancer, so she had a \nhysterectomy to prevent that risk. Only later, when she took the gene \ntest, did she discover that her fears had been misplaced. The test \nshowed that she had no elevated risk of cancer.\n  We've also heard other stories in the years of debate on this bill.\n  Phil Hardt is a grandfather in Arizona with hemophilia B, a bleeding \ndisorder, and Huntington's disease. His human resources manager told \nhim to withhold that information from his employer, or he would never \nbe promoted or trained. In addition, his grandchildren would be denied \nhealth insurance because the genes they might have inherited.\n  Rebecca Fisher is a mother and early onset breast cancer survivor \nwith a family history of the disease. She recounted how her employer, a \nsmall, self-insured community hospital, was more concerned that the \ncost of her bone marrow transplantation and other health care had \nexceeded the cap for that year, than with her health or productivity as \na worker.\n  Thousands of other patients who refuse to receive the benefits of \nthis new technology have similar stories. The time for delay is over--\nand I urge my colleagues to pass this needed legislation.\n  I again acknowledge the great work and effort of my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Enzi, the work he and his strong staff have provided. \nWe know we would not be here without his strong commitment to this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation was stuck for a time in the legislative cauldron of \ngood works, but it was never lost. Through his efforts we had the good \nopportunity to work out some of the final differences and we have the \nopportunity to get it passed today. I am very grateful to him.\n  Senator Snowe has been a long-time leader in this. Her leadership has \nbeen referred to and all of us who have been interested in this thank \nher for her long-time dedication and commitment to it.\n  I want to mention some of the other people and say a final word. Dr. \nCollins, who has been the leader of the Human Genome Project, has been \nsuch a strong voice in passing this legislation; Sharon Terry, the \nDirector of the Genetic Alliance; Kathy Hudson, who works at NIH and \ngave us excellent technical assistance; Representative\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\nLouise Slaughter, who has a long-time commitment to this program--I \nthank her and Michelle Adams, who has worked with her; Representative \nJudy Biggert and her staffer Brian Peterson; Shana Christrup, Keith \nFlanagan, and Ilyse Schuman--all have worked with Senator Enzi, and I \nthank them personally for their strong help working with me and with \nour staff; Kim Monk and David Thompson with Senator Gregg, who was a \nstrong supporter of this bill when he chaired the HELP Committee--I \nthank him; Pete Goodloe from Congressman Dingell, Michelle Varnhagan \nfrom Congressman Miller; Cybele Bjorklund, who worked with Charlie \nRangel and previously worked with us on our staff when we were \nfortunate to have her efforts here in the Senate; Kate Leone and \nJennifer Duck had worked for Senator Daschle--they are not now here, \nbut we acknowledge their work at an important time in this bill's \nhistory; Stephanie Carlton for Senator Coburn staff, her efforts are \nappreciated as well.\n  On my staff I thank Portia Wu, Lauren McFerran, Holly Fechner, \nMichael Myers, Laura Kwinn, and especially David Bowen. All have been \ninvaluable.\n  This bill opens a new frontier in medicine, in which can read the \ngenetic makeup of patients to stop diseases before they ever happen. \nThis legislation opens the door to modern medical progress for millions \nand millions of Americans. It means that people whose genetic profiles \nput them at risk of cancer and other serious conditions can get tested \nand seek treatment without fear of losing their privacy, their jobs, or \ntheir health insurance.\n  It is the first civil rights bill of the new century of the life \nsciences. This is the era of life science, with extraordinary \npossibility over these next years.\n  With the passage of this legislation we take a quantum leap forward \nin preserving the values of new genetic technology and protecting the \nbasic rights of every American. We will ensure that our laws reflect \nthe advances we are making each and every day in medical science. The \npromise of new science will be in jeopardy if our laws fail to maintain \nadequate protections against abuse and misuse of private genetic \ninformation.\n  It was a hard-fought battle to get here. This bill has been the \nproduct of a decade of dedicated efforts by Members of both sides of \nthe aisle. I am honored to work with many of my colleagues, \nparticularly Senator Enzi, Senator Snowe, and Congresswoman Slaughter \non this bill. I hope it will get overwhelming support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4573\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. President, I call up the Snowe-Kennedy-Enzi substitute, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President I wish today to applaud the passage of \nthe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation that prohibits health insurance \ncompanies and employers from discriminating against individuals based \non their genetic information. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to commend Hadassah for their relentless advocacy over the \npast 11 years on this important civil rights issue. Hadassah is a \nfounding member of the Coalition on Genetic Fairness and has been a \nleader fighting to outlaw genetic discrimination.\n  As a Senator from Maryland, the home of the National Institutes of \nHealth and cutting edge companies like Celera Genomic, genetic testing \nand its implications for Marylanders and all Americans is especially \nimportant to me. This bill provides necessary protections so that \npeople will take advantage of the potential that genetic testing can \noffer, without losing their job or their health insurance. Montgomery \nCounty in Maryland was the first county in the Nation to pass genetic \nnondiscrimination legislation. It has been a longer road for Congress. \nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was the first bill passed \nout of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, \nCommittee in this Congress. I sit on the HELP Committee and we have \nworked on this bill since 1996. We have conducted five hearings on \ngenetic discrimination and this bill has passed out of our committee \nthree times. The Senate unanimously passed this bill in 2003 and 2005. \nIt is time that this bill is signed into law.\n  Thirty years ago, the idea of mapping the entire human genome seemed \nliked science fiction. But we now have a map of it. Fifteen years ago, \nthe thought of testing individuals for a genetic predisposition to an \nillness seemed decades away, but here we are in 2008 with the \ntechnology and knowledge to do that. Someone with a genetic \npredisposition for a disease could begin preventive measures in diet \nand lifestyle, years before symptoms even appear.\n  But with this new technology comes responsibility--the responsibility \nto protect the people that these theologies seek to help. What good is \nknowing that you have a genetic predisposition for diabetes if you lose \nyour health insurance because of it? How does knowing that you may be \nmore\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\nlikely to develop breast cancer help if you can't get a job because of \nthis information? Individuals should also have the information they \nneed to make informed decisions about whether to get a genetic test.\n  A person must not be denied insurance coverage or employment based on \ntheir predictive genetic information. That is why I support this \nstrong, enforceable genetic nondiscrimination legislation that \nestablishes meaningful remedies for individuals and their families--\nremedies which act as powerful disincentives for insurance providers \nand employers to discriminate. I am proud the Senate has acted to help \nensure that individuals can choose to get genetic tests that could help \nsave or prolong their lives, without fear of discrimination in the \nworkplace or by health insurance providers. We need to make sure the \ninformation from genetic testing reaches its true potential: that a \nwoman can be screened for a genetic predisposition to breast cancer or \na man can be screened for his risk for a heart attack without fear of \ntheir health insurance premiums rising or losing their jobs.\n  Again, I want to thank Hadassah for all of their hard work on \npreventing genetic discrimination and I also want to thank Senator \nSnowe for her leadership on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Unfortunately, colleagues across the aisle voted to block us from \nconsidering what is an important bill that relates to fairness, fair \npay, equality, and recognition of the hard work of women all across \nthis country. We weren't even allowed to bring this to the floor of the \nSenate to begin the debate. It wasn't only about pay discrimination; it \nwas about fundamental fairness for working families, as so many of \nthose working families are headed by women. The vote last night sends \nthe wrong message to families who are struggling to stretch their \npaychecks to pay for higher gas prices, groceries, health care costs, \nall of the things they need to survive and care for their families, \nchildcare costs, on and on and on. Voting to block this bill from even \ncoming up for consideration says to these women and their families that \nthis body does not understand and is not on their side when they have \nbeen treated unfairly or taken advantage of on the job.\n  I am proud of the fact that Senator Reid, our majority leader, saw \nfit to bring this bill forward as a priority in the crush of time we \nhave to consider legislation in the Senate. I am proud of Senator \nKennedy for his passion and leadership in bringing this bill out of \ncommittee and fighting so vigorously, and all of my women colleagues \nwho came to the floor to stand up for women across America. \nUnfortunately, we were stopped from even proceeding to the bill. I am \nhopeful at some point we can come back and colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle will decide, rather than turning their backs on millions \nof women across the country, that they will join us in doing what is \nright to guarantee that if a woman is working hard every day, putting \nin the same amount of hours, lifting the same boxes and doing the same \nkind of work, she will know she is protected and feel confident the law \nis on her side that she will receive equal pay.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated vote. This has been a pattern. \nWe have spoken many times about what has been happening in the last \nyear and a half. We now have seen 68 Republican filibusters. We had a \nfilibuster that stopped us from proceeding. We have a fancy title for \nit, called a cloture vote on a motion to proceed. But the reality is, \nRepublican colleagues on the other side of the aisle have filibustered \nour ability to move forward on equal pay for women in the workplace. \nThis is one of 68 different times in the last year and a half that we \nhave brought forward something critically important to families, from \nextending unemployment insurance to addressing health care, education, \nand economic issues, focusing on those things that directly affect \nfamilies every day.\n  We know around here the way the rules work. You can filibuster and \nyou can stop something if you don't have 60 votes. Unfortunately, we \ndon't at this time have 60 votes to stop filibusters. There have been \nso many that we have put this on a board with Velcro so we can change \nit. We have to change it way too many times, because this number goes \nup every week. We are now at 68. This is an historic record in the \nSenate that we would see this many filibusters to block moving forward \nan agenda for change that the American people are desperately asking \nfor.\n  We will continue to bring these issues forward that are absolutely \ncritical. We will continue to bring forward areas of investment in the \nfuture and creating jobs and tackling health care costs and access and \nchildren's health insurance and quality education and tax fairness and \nall of these other things that are so critical for the American \npeople--fair trade, so that we are exporting products and not jobs.\n\n  We are going to continue to bring this forward. But we are going to \ncontinue--unfortunately--to see this number go up. It is important the \nAmerican people understand what is happening.\n  Now, we also, earlier today, saw something else happen--it did not \nquite come to the point of blocking in terms of a motion to proceed but \nefforts of delay, waiting, obstructing, over and over again. Earlier \ntoday, we passed a bill to help our Nation's veterans by almost a \nunanimous vote. We should be proud of having done that on a bipartisan \nbasis. But this bill was reported out of committee last year. It was \nblocked for 7 months--7 months--by colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. Then we had to spend a week trying to get this bill done. There \nwas the procedural motion, again, to force us to vote on whether to \neven consider the bill, and then that vote was unanimous--unanimous. \nYet that vote was forced so the time would run so we would slow-walk a \nbill we have been waiting to take up for veterans and their families \nfor 7 months.\n  People expect better from us. I am very hopeful we will come together \nand begin to see the change the American people want to have happen and \nbe the focus of this body.\n  Mr. President, I will speak for a moment about the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act because this issue of equal pay, of fairness in the \nworkplace, is not going to go away. We are going to come back and we \nare going to come back until we get this Court decision fixed.\n  Lilly Ledbetter was one of the few female supervisors in a Goodyear \ntire plant in Gadsen, AL. She got up early in the morning. She sweated \nthroughout long shifts, which often stretched to 18 hours or more when \nanother supervisor was absent, just like her male counterparts. For \nyears she endured insults from her male bosses because she was a woman \nin a traditionally male job.\n  Late in her career with the company, Lilly discovered that Goodyear \npaid her male counterparts 20 percent to 40 percent more than what she \nearned for doing the very same job for all of those years. She filed a \nlawsuit, just as she should have, and the jury awarded her full \ndamages.\n  She was right. This was against the law. This was unfair. We need to \nvalue work and value equal work. The court sided with her.\n  However, the Roberts Supreme Court overruled the jury, stating that \nMs. Ledbetter was not entitled to anything because she waited too long \nto file her claim. The Supreme Court ruled that victims of \ndiscrimination have only 180 days of the last discriminatory raise to \nfile a lawsuit for discrimination--even if they did not know about it, \neven if they knew nothing about it.\n  So in Lilly Ledbetter's case, it did not matter that her employer \ndiscriminated against her for years and that she had been, for years, \npaid less than her male counterparts. Instead, the\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\nRoberts Supreme Court reversed decades--decades--of precedent and the \nintent of the law. It also overturned the policy of the EEOC under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations.\n  After the Ledbetter case--until we fix this--workers are powerless to \nhold their employers accountable for unlawful, unjust, unfair, unequal \nconduct. It creates an incentive for employers to discriminate against \nworkers because now if they can hide the discrimination for just 180 \ndays, then they are home free and the worker can do nothing about it.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will fix this injustice and put \nFederal law in the same place it was the day before the Court decision. \nThis has been American law. It has been American law about fairness and \nequal pay. All we are trying to do is reverse this extreme decision of \nthe Supreme Court and put it back in current law.\n  The economic impact of unfair pay practices on working families is \nstaggering. Today, women still make 77 cents for every $1 men make. In \nMichigan, it is even lower: 70 cents for every $1.\n  The current job climate has been particularly hard on women and \npeople of color all across America. The unemployment rate for women has \nrisen sharply, and their wages are falling faster than men's. For \npeople of color, the unemployment rate is even higher. African \nAmericans' unemployment rate is almost twice the national average. The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would help correct this unfairness, this \ndisparity.\n  Just as important as upholding the rights of women, the Fair Pay Act \nis needed because the Ledbetter case would affect all kinds of \ndiscrimination cases. At the end of the day, it simply puts the law \nback where it was and creates the opportunity for fairness and \nequality.\n  Let me say that when a woman goes to the store in Michigan, she does \nnot pay less for milk. When she goes to the gas station, she does not \npay less for gas. She does not pay less for the food or the electric \nbill. She does not pay less in any area. Yet until we fix this \noutrageous Supreme Court decision, she can be paid less for the very \nsame job.\n  Mr. President, let me also say a few words about the bill we passed \nearlier today for veterans. That bill was almost unanimously passed, \ndespite being held up for 7 months.\n  For too many of our servicemembers, that last day on Active Duty is \njust the first day of a difficult transition back to civilian life.\n  Our veterans deserve every benefit they get, and more. But too often \nour veterans return home to find out their insurance is inadequate or \nit is very hard to figure out their educational benefits because they \nare spread out over numerous different agencies.\n  Perhaps most important, under current law, our permanently disabled \nveterans who are recovering from injuries cannot even count on the \nFederal Government to help them finance necessities such as wheelchairs \nor wheelchair ramps for their homes.\n  When the men and women of our Armed Services put on the uniform, they \nare making a promise to defend America. In return, we promise them that \na grateful nation will be there for them when they come home. What they \ndo need--and what we owe them--is a system that works for them, not \nagainst them.\n  That is why the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act that was just \npassed today is so critically important. It addresses many of the \nproblems that plague this difficult transition to stateside life and \nprovides necessary improvements to education and health care and \ninsurance programs.\n  This bill would expand the number of individuals qualifying for \nretroactive benefits for traumatic injury protection coverage. This is \nimportant for all of our veterans because we are now learning that this \nkind of injury is happening more often than we thought, and it can have \na devastating impact.\n  Just last week, a new veterans center was opened in Saginaw, MI. This \ncenter will not only assist our veterans returning from combat but will \nalso serve our veterans from as far back as World War II--the war my \nfather fought in. These veterans should also be eligible for benefits \nif they are victims of traumatic brain injury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The act would expand eligibility for home improvement and structural \nalteration assistance. It would also improve survivor benefits for the \nsurviving children of our service men and women and a number of other \nthings.\n  I am glad we passed this legislation. I am sorry it was held up for 7 \nmonths, and then all this week there was obstructionism and delay \nbefore we could get to it. But I am glad we got it done.\n  I am deeply disappointed that earlier this week we saw another \nfilibuster that stopped us from proceeding to an equally important \nbill, and that is a bill that relates to equal pay and protection under \nthe law, when women are working hard every single day and find \nthemselves in a situation where they are receiving less than male \ncounterparts for the same job. It is wrong. It needs to be fixed for \nthe women of America and their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to the \nopportunity to bring this to the floor again, and, hopefully, we will \nbe able to get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I have a great deal of appreciation for the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan. I know how sincere she is, and I \nknow she feels very deeply about what she has just spoken. But this \nbusiness of 68 clotures is hitting below the belt.\n  Time after time, the majority leader has filed bills--many of which \nhave not even gone through committee, have not had 1 day of hearing, \nsome of which have been filed for political purposes just to create \ntough votes--and then filed cloture immediately.\n  In the old days--I have been here almost 32 years--nobody did that. \nThen they call it a filibuster when they are the ones who filed cloture \njust for the purpose of being able to say there is a filibuster.\n  Almost invariably the bills that are good go through. Republicans \nwill object sometimes because we want to be able to offer at least \ngermane amendments. In this body, we have, in the past, even been able \nto offer nongermane amendments. But that is a no-no right now because \nthe majority is concerned some will bring up amendments that might be \nembarrassing to the majority.\n  Well, having talked about ``embarrassing to the majority,'' why do \nyou think the Ledbetter case was brought up through this statute? First \nof all, it did not have 1 day of hearings, as far as I know. It \ncertainly was not put through a committee. It was brought up under rule \nXIV--which is a right to do--and then the bill itself was classically \npoorly written.\n  The fact is, this bill would have done away with the statute of \nlimitations and made it almost impossible for any business to defend \nitself even in class action lawsuits. But it was brought primarily \nbecause the friends in some areas of the plaintiffs' bar wanted it \nbrought so they could bring more suits in our society.\n  But to basically do away with the statute of limitations so that you \ncould bring suits 10, 15, 25 years later, when all of the documentation \nis gone, the witnesses are gone, there is no way the company can defend \nitself, and it is an automatic slam dunk for plaintiffs' lawyers--some \nplaintiffs' lawyers, because most great plaintiffs' lawyers are not \ngoing to play this game--and then call that a good bill, there is \nsomething wrong with it.\n  With regard to the veterans bill--my goodness gracious. Let's think \nabout this. With regard to the veterans bill, we are all for veterans--\nevery last one of us. But, again, cloture was immediately filed. We \nwere not able to bring up amendments. Finally, in the end, what did we \ndo? We spent all day yesterday doing nothing in order to accommodate \ntwo Presidential candidates on the Democratic side. Now, I\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\nhave no problem with that, with that accommodation, but we could have \nworked all day yesterday on the veterans bill and scheduled that vote \nthe same time at the end of the day, as we did. But it was basically a \nwasted day in the Senate, other than hearings that might have gone on. \nTo waste a whole day and then blame us for it, that is not right.\n  We all know why the Ledbetter bill was brought up. In many respects, \nit is just to score political points or it would have gone through the \ncommittee. Had it gone through the committee, had we done a good \nstatute of limitations change, had we made some other changes that make \nsense in the law, I think we would have passed a bill that would have \nmade Lilly Ledbetter at least realize that her actions were not in \nvain. But the way it was done looks to me as if it was done for \npolitical purposes and to score political points. We could have worked \nit out. At least I think we could have worked it out. But there was not \neven a chance to do that.\n  Let me just say this: I believe we have too much of this business \nthat every time the majority files a bill and then files a cloture \nmotion, they then call us filibusterers. That is not right, and it is \nnot true. Frankly, we all know it is not true.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3377-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AIR FORCE LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we live in cynical times, and today I \nwant to address that cynicism; namely, a small number of media reports \nthat, some have suggested, call into question the command abilities of \nthe senior leadership of the U.S. Air Force.\n  In addition, I was dismayed to learn that a Member of the Senate has \ncompounded these misrepresentations by recently authoring a letter that \nmakes inaccurate assertions about matters that have already been dealt \nwith by the proper military authorities and investigated by the \ninspector general of the Department of Defense.\n  Let me address the underlying matter directly. It has been my \nprivilege and honor to represent the people of Utah in this august body \nfor now more than 31 years. During that time, I have had the pleasure \nto meet many of our Nation's military leaders, their families, and, of \ncourse, military period. However, I can say without reservation the \ncurrent generation of Air Force leaders is among the finest I have ever \nknown in all my years in the Senate.\n  Under the steadfast and capable leadership of Secretary Michael Wynne \nand GEN Michael Moseley, the leaders of our Air Force are resolute in \nthe defense of this country, tenacious in their support and care for \nthe young men and women who serve under them, and dedicated to \nmodernizing the ancient--or should I say aging--equipment of their \nforce.\n  These are leaders to be proud of, not criticized the way they have \nbeen. They are leaders to have confidence in. They exemplify the Air \nForce's unofficial motto: ``Nothing Comes Close.'' They are the \nrightful heirs to the title: ``The Right Stuff.''\n  This does not mean errors do not occur. In any organization, \nespecially one with more than 350,000 servicemembers, some will make \nmistakes, a few will veer from the straight and narrow; and, sadly, a \ntiny minority might even betray the public trust. That said, I believe \nthe true measure of military leadership is not to wipe away every \npossible temptation and sin of mankind; it is to create a culture where \nmalfeasance, once identified, is dealt with firmly, swiftly, and \njustly.\n  For example, the current Air Force leadership met this standard when \nit was recently tested by the wrongdoing of a civilian official during \nan initial attempt to replace our Nation's aerial tankers that are, on \naverage, 47 years old. Once Senator McCain brought this malfeasance to \nthe attention of the Air Force, the service responded by holding \naccountable those responsible. These individuals were prosecuted to the \nfull extent of the law. Yet from that troubled time, the current Air \nForce leadership rallied and conducted one of the most transparent, \nopen, and fair procurement competitions in recent memory. That is stuff \nof which real leaders are made.\n  I was also disappointed to read the characterizations of some press \nreports regarding the speech given by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \nduring his trip on Monday to the Air War College. When one reads some \nof these reports, one could only conclude that Secretary Gates was \nissuing a rebuke to the Air Force's leadership. This is most \nperplexing. Although I have not spoken to Secretary Gates about his \nspeech, I have read the official transcript. My impression of his \naddress was that Secretary Gates was not issuing an admonishment--not \nat all. In fact, I believe the Secretary was seeking to do what all \ngood Secretaries of Defense strive to obtain: a more effective and \nefficient force through new and creative thinking.\n  Now, this conclusion is ironically bolstered by later reports from \nthe same news service that published the initial reports I find so \npuzzling. These later reports quote the Pentagon press secretary as \nsaying one of the major alleged reproaches was not directed at the Air \nForce as a service, but to ``the military as a whole.''\n  As I said earlier, we live in cynical times. Unfortunately, it has \nbecome customary for many in political circles to hurl unfair and even \nuntrue criticisms at one another. One could argue this is the price of \na vibrant democracy. However, this sort of behavior is unbecoming when \nit wrongly distracts our military leaders, especially during a time of \nwar.\n  The Air Force leadership, under Secretary Wynne and General Moseley, \nhas done an extraordinary job of protecting our Nation and supporting \nour other armed services in this war on terror. I, for one, am thankful \nwe have such leaders in positions with such heavy responsibility. So \ntoday I rise to thank them. I thank Secretary Wynne. I thank General \nMoseley. They are thanks I believe they deserve from the entire Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would withhold.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to commend Chairman Akaka on the \nlegislation that was passed in the Senate earlier today, S. 1315.\n  This bill makes a number of commonsense improvements to the benefits \npackages we offer America's veterans. I am pleased to have voted for \nthis bill as it came out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I am also \npleased to have supported it on the floor today. It is long past due to \ngive our disabled veterans the ability to purchase affordable life \ninsurance. That is what this bill does. It provides up to $50,000 in \nlife insurance for any veteran younger than the age of 65 who has a \nservice-connected disability.\n  The bill also adds a host of new benefits to help critically injured \nservice men and women get their households refurbished if they become \ndisabled. That can mean putting in wheelchair ramps, remodeling a \nkitchen or a bathroom, and countless other chores. Again, it is a small \nmeasure, but for a soldier who has lost an arm or a leg or a marine who \nhas suffered severe burns, it means the world.\n  It is long past time to increase burial benefits to help families \ndeal with the growing costs of providing a final resting place for \ntheir veteran loved ones. This bill does that by authorizing double the \ncurrent allowance for the burial of a veteran who dies from a service-\nconnected disability to $4,000. It also triples the $300 benefit for \nnonservice connected disabilities. With the average funeral cost now \naround $6,000, this is a small gesture to the loved ones of our \nveterans, but it matters a great deal.\n  At a time of record national debt and chronic annual budget deficits, \nI am particularly pleased this bill is deficit-neutral. It does not \nincrease taxes.\n\n  With all the good in the bill, it is little wonder the Veterans' \nBenefit Enhancement Act is supported by every major veterans service \norganization. This bill passed out of the VA Committee unanimously last \nsummer, and I am pleased by the bipartisan support it got today. We now \nneed to turn our attention to the veterans health care legislation that \nI am told will follow this bill. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing \nless.\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\n  When our children sign up for military service, whether they do it at \na local recruiting office or by going to a service academy or anything \nin-between, we make a deal with them. We ask them to put their lives on \nthe line. We ask them to serve and to sacrifice at an increasingly \ndifficult pace. We ask them to fight wars. We ask them to keep peace \nand to keep our Nation free and they go. They go and they do a better \njob than any other military in the world. In return, we promise that \nwhen their service is over, we will care for them and compensate them \nif they have been injured in their service to our country. With our \nNation now at war, we have a great moral obligation to do right by the \nmen and women who serve our country in harm's way. This legislation \nhelps keep the promise to our veterans.\n  One other point I wish to add that relates to what the senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Utah talked about. I have only been here \nfor 15 or 16 months, but I will tell my colleagues that one thing I \nhave noticed and one thing that has surprised me over the last year and \na quarter is we debate whether to debate all too much. The fact is, \nwhether we agree or disagree on an issue, what is important is we have \nan opportunity to vote on an issue--to make our stand and vote on an \nissue.\n  What happened last week was a prime example, where we had a \ntransportation bill--corrections to a transportation bill--and we spent \nall week because it was being delayed and delayed. I sat in the chair \nlast Thursday night when the majority leader, the Democratic leader, \ncame down to the floor and said: I have to file cloture on this \nveterans' bill--the one we passed--because I have approached the \nminority and they have not gotten back to me and I do not want to take \nthe chance of wasting a day.\n  We have work to do here. We have done some good work today, and I \nhope we can have many more days such as today, where we can vote on \nlegislation that impacts the people of this country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Madam President, I rise this afternoon to talk for a few \nminutes about health care in America--the cost of health care in \nAmerica, the access to health care in America, and to talk \nprospectively about the first 4 years of the next President of the \nUnited States. It is pretty obvious, because of the complexity of \nhealth issues and because of a political campaign year, we are not \ngoing to get to a resolution this year.\n  It is obvious our country has a crisis. It is obvious we have to move \nforward. It is obvious to me that whoever the next President of the \nUnited States is, the very first thing they are going to have to tackle \nis affordable, accessible, and quality health care.\n  The health care issue is one that has a million angles to it. I am \nnot going to talk about all those angles today. Secondly, I am not \ngoing to stand up here and tell my colleagues that I think I have all \nthe answers. However, I do think it is time that all of us who have \nsaid: Well, I am not for government-provided health care--that is not \ngood enough. If you are not for it, you have to be for something. You \ncan't have the easy way out. There have been a lot of people who say: I \ndon't want single-payer health care; I don't want the Government to do \nto health care what they did at the IRS, but I don't have any good \nideas.\n  It is time we came up with some goods ideas. We are going to have to \ndo what is maybe different and philosophically and politically \nchallenging to Republicans and to Democrats. But first what we ought to \ndo is look to successes around the country that have solved some of the \ncornerstone issues in terms of the costs of health care.\n  One of those is the cost of medical malpractice and what is commonly \ncalled tort reform. The minute a politician mentions tort reform, they \nget everybody's attention, but in particular, a trial lawyer's. I am \nnot a trial lawyer basher. Some of my best friends are trial lawyers. I \nalways tell people: Everybody hates lawyers, but they love their \nlawyer. When you need a lawyer, you want a good one. I wish to bring a \nperspective to the tort issue as it deals with medical malpractice to \ntry and point out there have been solutions found--solutions that do \nnot prohibit an injured person from being compensated for the damages \nthat were caused to them, while at the same time quantifying and \ncapping at a predictable amount for those actuaries the cost of what \nthese runaway awards have been doing to us.\n  We have tried on the floor of the Senate, on more than one occasion, \nto address this, in part. We tried with legislation in the 109th \nCongress to limit or to cap noneconomic damages in OB/GYN cases. The \nreason we targeted OB/GYN and obstetrics cases was because they \nconsistently have runaway insurance premiums; we consistently have \nproblems in our States where there are not enough doctors to deliver \nthe babies for families in our communities because there are not enough \ndoctors who can afford the medical malpractice insurance as it rises.\n  Unfortunately, we never passed that in the Senate, although in two \ndifferent amendments we tried. In my judgment, it would have helped \nwith the situation. Today, I want to talk about a good example from my \nState of Georgia and about some things I think we can do in the \nCongress.\n  In 2005, our State Senate in Georgia passed a Senate Bill 3, by a \nvote of 39 to 15, and it went to the house and passed by a vote of 136 \nto 34. Obviously, it was bipartisan. We have had 2 years' experience \nwith that bill. The experience has demonstrated what we had hoped it \nwould: No injured person was aggrieved or denied coverage or recovery, \nbut the cost of health care on medical malpractice became more \npredictable and rates stabilized.\n  The points in that bill that passed in Georgia are precisely the \npoints we ought to look at in terms of the Federal court system. Point \nNo. 1, eliminate joint and several liability in a medical malpractice \ncase. For those who may not know what that is, it means if somebody is \ninjured, or alleges they have been injured, and they file suit against \nthe person who injured them, in the normal course of our litigious \nsociety, they also sue everybody else who is even remotely related to \nthat particular situation. I was a real estate broker in Georgia. If we \nsold a new house to a family and the first time it rained after they \nmoved in the basement leaked, they sued the builder, but they sued me, \ntoo, so they had a wide sweep to try to recover. I understand that. \nThere are times when joint and several is appropriate, because \nsometimes more than one party in an injured class situation is involved \nin the injury and should be held accountable. But to summarily make \njoint and several apply without any conditions is wrong.\n  What we put in the Georgia law was that the plaintiff must identify a \nsingle defendant in the suit, unless he proved clearly and convincingly \nthat the hospital or the physician and others in the system were also \nnegligent. That is not unreasonable. We want to make sure that if \nsomebody is injured by a doctor, they can recover. But then to hold the \nhospital, or the hospital authority, or the county health authority \nliable, when they were not part of the procedure, we don't think that \nis right. That is one of the reasons you have a tremendous cost of \nmalpractice insurance.\n  Second, to strengthen expert witnesses, who are critical in any court \nsituation where you are trying to prove damages. But experts ought to \nbe experts. For example, if you have a traumatic brain injury, the \nexpert testifying on behalf of the plaintiff and the expert testifying \non behalf of the defense ought to both have neurological training. It \nis not right for a dentist, who happens to be an MD, to testify in a \nneurological case. So by putting in requirements in terms of witnesses, \nyou establish a situation where you have clear, responsible testimony, \nand you cannot use a ``quasi'' person to give you irresponsible \ntestimony.\n  Third, limit liability for emergency department physicians and \npersonnel. I want to talk about this for a minute. Talking about \nGeorgia again, we have\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\nGrady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, one of the largest public hospitals \nin the United States. It was on the verge 6 months ago of closing \nbecause almost everybody who goes there is indigent or a nonpaying \ncustomer. They may be on Medicare or Medicaid, but in every accident \nthat happens on the freeway system there, they take the injured to that \ntrauma center. It is the largest burn center in the Southeast. Grady \nMemorial Hospital is losing so much money that it was on the verge of \nbankruptcy. The community has come together, with volunteer citizens \nsuch as Pete Corell and Tom Bell in our city, who deserve tremendous \ncredit. They created a nonprofit organization to take over the \norganization of the hospital and raise capital, and I believe we are \ngoing to save that great trauma center and that great hospital.\n  Frankly, they operate under terrible circumstances in that trauma \ncenter. To have the type of liability in a trauma center that people \nwant to hold you accountable for today with medical malpractice \nliability, with no Good Samaritan laws for those people isn't right. If \nsomebody is brought in after a tragic wreck and there are not qualified \nexceptions for a physician to treat that person, you are never going to \nhave the type of immediate response care that you need. You don't have \nthe time to practice defensive medicine in a trauma situation, which, \nby the way, I will get to defensive medicine next. It is one of the \ncontributing causes to the cost of health care. Defensive medicine is \npracticed primarily because of the court system.\n  I had a problem a few years ago. I went to the doctor and they said, \nwell--they gave me this and it didn't work, so they gave me that and it \ndidn't work. So they gave me a full-body CT scan. I had a swallowing \nproblem. I wondered why they did a full-body CT scan. He said he wanted \nto be sure he had done everything he could. He had to practice \ndefensive medicine, when a scan from the chest up would have been fine. \nThat is one of the reasons you have runaway malpractice awards and the \nlitigious nature of our society. It is a skewed system and you have \ncosts running through the roof.\n  We need to elevate the burden of proof from the ``preponderance of \nthe evidence'' to ``clear and convincing evidence.'' We did that in \nGeorgia 2 years ago. I don't know about you, but if I am accused of \nsomething, I don't want somebody to decide because the preponderance of \nthe evidence said I was wrong; I want it to be clear and convincing. \nThat is the way it ought to be, in terms of medical malpractice as \nwell.\n  Then the real hot potato--the one everybody goes ballistic on--is \ntalking about capping noneconomic damages. Georgia did something \nunique. They capped noneconomic damages at $350,000. That is the pain \nand suffering. Noneconomic means if you were injured, all the costs of \nthat injury, the costs of the treatment and the corrective treatment, \nand all the economic losses you have, you get all of that. Noneconomic \nis when they add on another penalty to the guilty person for the pain \nand suffering. Georgia capped it at $350,000. They gave an overall cap \nof $1.050 million, allowing the judge to lift the $350,000 if the \nevidence in the court case proved a higher damage was necessary. That \nis the point I want to address in the Federal court law.\n  I have three children. My second son, Kevin, in 1998 was in a \nterrible automobile accident in rural Georgia. He was on a camping trip \nwith a 16-year-old buddy. They were going down a country road in Greene \nCounty, 2 a.m. in the morning--which is another subject I will get to \nas a father later on--and a deer crossed the road. A deer will stop in \nthe headlights. The deer took off. My son was a passenger, and the \ndriver decided to follow the deer rather than the road, hit a ditch, \nand my son went through the front windshield. He had four operations. \nHe had to get grafts, bone marrow treatments, and he had internal \ninfections. He has more metal in his right leg than I have in my \nautomobile. The doctors put him back together. Making the case about \nlitigation, I have to tell you that was a case where my son was hurt \nand there was negligence. I was angry. In Georgia, we have something \ncalled no-fault insurance, which means you have $15,000 in coverage, \nwhich covered the emergency room, and there is no more coverage. \nEverybody is on their own. But we had obvious negligence. In that case, \nfortunately, the young man who was driving, who was negligent--his \nfather, although he had minimum coverage for the accident, had a \ngeneral liability policy. He said: My son was wrong and your son is \ngoing through terrible pain. Let's sit down and go to my insurance \ncompany and negotiate, through a professional arbitrator, what is the \nright general liability award for your son. We did that. We negotiated \nit and used an index of nationally approved negotiators, in terms of \nwhat damage would have been right. We agreed to it and my son still has \nthat reserve in case he has further complications from the damage done. \nNo liability responsibility, but a cost that was appropriate for the \ninjury, rather than gained through a court case and a litigious action.\n\n  It is my personal opinion that we should cap noneconomic damages in \nthe Federal court and medical malpractice in the following way: Change \nthe current law. The current law allows a judge to reduce the amount of \nthe award if he doesn't think it was right. The judge can reduce it. I \nthink we ought to cap liability on medical malpractice at a million \ndollars for the noneconomic damages, but then say the judge can lift \nthat cap if the evidence in court proves gross negligence. That changes \nthe dynamics of litigation. Instead of suing and going for big bucks \nbecause you can, you will realize that the burden of proof is to \njustify the big bucks based on your circumstances and the facts of the \ncase, and you don't intimidate people into negotiating high \nsettlements. Instead, you put the burden on clear and convincing \nevidence, which, in my case, as I have said, is the only way to go.\n  Medical malpractice is certainly not the only cause of the higher \ncosts of health care in America. Solving medical malpractice costs \ndoesn't address all of the other factors, but it is a component part. I \nam willing to sit with others and talk about all those other things we \nbeat our gums about but never do anything about that are components of \nthe cost of health care.\n  I will talk about what we need to do in terms of Medicare \neligibility. When somebody signs up for Medicare when they are 65 years \nold--you are supposed to go in 90 days before your 65th birthday; I am \ngetting close, so I am looking at these things--I think you ought to be \nrequired to execute a durable power of attorney when you become \neligible. Eighty percent of the cost of health care to me, to you, and \nto anybody else happens in the last 60 days of life. More often than \nnot, people are not in a condition to make a decision for themselves. \nBecause of laws, and because we are a compassionate nation, the \nphysician will keep you alive as long as he can. If you had a chance, \nyou might rather say if I am being hydrated and given nutrition but \nwill never become conscious again, I give the doctors the authority to \nmake the appropriate medical decision. The money that would save is in \nthe ``gazillions'' of dollars--if there is such a number. It would help \nus to manage that cost.\n  Secondly, we need accountability on the part of the American \npolicyholders, and wellness and disease management. My second son's \nfather-in-law is a Swede. He came to America and now lives here full \ntime. He bought a medical insurance policy independently, because he is \nretired. About 6 months ago, he called me and we went out to dinner. He \nordered a salad, broccoli, and asparagus, and he didn't put any sugar \nin his tea. I said: What are you doing? What kind of a diet are you on? \nHe said: It is my health insurance, not my diet. My policy will go up \nto $500 a month if I don't get my cholesterol below 200. His vital \nsigns are a component of health care and, if he wasn't taking care of \nhimself, he would pay a higher premium for the benefits he needed. We \nneed to look at disease management and wellness and accountability.\n  I came to the floor to talk about what is going to be the biggest \nissue in the first term of the next President, the biggest crisis. If I \nam fortunate enough to win reelection in 2010, the Nation's Medicare \nsystem is going to be broke before I leave the Senate. This is not an \nissue we need to talk about in the future. The time is now. It is time \nfor good men and women of both political parties to put all of the \nissues on\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nthe table and not just talk about what they are not for but start \ntalking about the solutions that can make a difference in the quality, \naccessibility, affordability, and health care for the people of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3380-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3380-S3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD FOOD CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the world is facing a global food crisis, \nand it is growing worse by the day. Each morning, we see a new front-\npage headline reminding us of the urgency of the situation. It \nthreatens not only the health and survival of millions of poor people \naround the globe, many of them children, but it also threatens the \nstability of governments in some parts of the world where hunger and \nfood shortages are most acute. It threatens global security and even \nour own national security.\n  The world food crisis is a human catastrophe. Families are suffering. \nMothers and fathers are struggling to feed their children. A recent New \nYork Times story described a father in Haiti's capital city, Port-au-\nPrince, whose children had recently eaten only two spoonfuls of rice \napiece one day and nothing the next day. The father said in this \ninterview:\n\n       They look at me and say, ``Papa, I'm hungry,'' and I have \n     to look away. It is humiliating. It makes you angry.\n\n  Three-quarters of the people in Haiti live on less than $2 a day, and \none in five children is chronically malnourished. People are desperate \nfor nourishment of any kind.\n  The New York Times story went on to say that one booming business \namid all the gloom is the selling of patties made of mud, oil, and \nsugar, typically eaten by the most destitute.\n  One Haitian man said:\n\n       It's salty and it has butter, and you don't know you are \n     eating dirt. It makes your stomach quiet down.\n\n  Mr. President, I said last week that we were on the brink of a \nhumanitarian crisis, and I am afraid we have crossed that threshold. We \nare now witnessing that humanitarian crisis. World Bank data shows \nglobal food prices have jumped 83 percent in the last 3 years. These \nare the average commodity prices paid by the nongovernmental \norganization CARE.\n  CARE is known around the world. CARE packages, after World War II, \nbecame a symbol of American caring and a symbol of international \ncompassion. CARE is paying more and more for the food they buy. In just \na brief period of time--from December 2007 to April 2008--the costs \nhave gone up dramatically in sorghum, in wheat, rice, peas, lentils, \nand vegetable oil. This chart really tells the story of what has \nhappened in just 4 months. Other data shows wheat prices have tripled \nin the last 3 years. Poor families in Yemen are spending more than a \nquarter of their income just to buy bread for their children.\n  The price of rice has tripled in just the last 18 months. There is \neven rationing of the sale of rice in the United States. You may have \nseen the papers this morning. Some major warehouse-type operations are \nlimiting the amount of rice Americans can buy. In Bangladesh, a 2-\nkilogram bag of rice--a little over 4 pounds--which might feed a small \nfamily for a couple of days now consumes about half the daily income of \na poor family. In the Philippines, hoarding rice is now punishable by \nlife in prison. In rural El Salvador, the World Food Program estimates \nthat rising food prices have cut the caloric intake of the average meal \n40 percent from 2 years ago.\n  The World Food Program is the food aid branch of the United Nations \nand the world's largest humanitarian agency. It operates in about 80 \nnations, providing food to about 90 million poor people a year. Two-\nthirds of them are kids. Because of rising food prices, the World Food \nProgram can afford to buy only 50 percent of the food for \nschoolchildren that it could purchase a year ago.\n  This is the worst global food crisis in more than 30 years, since the \nArab oil embargo in the early 1970s caused sharp spikes in world food \nprices. The blue shaded areas on this map show 36 nations on four \ncontinents now facing a growing risk of hunger and the social unrest \nthat comes with it. The flames indicate places where riots or protests \nare already taking place. It may not be easy for those following this \nto see, but if you can imagine, almost one-fifth of the world's \ncountries are facing a food crisis, and many more are facing protests \nand demonstrations. In Africa, 21 countries are unable, for a variety \nof reasons, to meet their own food needs. In Asia, nine countries are \nfacing food shortages; four Latin American nations; and in Europe, food \nshortages in Moldova and Chechnya. The list of these countries is here, \nand it is a long list. It shows you how this is stretching across the \nworld, particularly in the poorer sections.\n  Aid organizations are seeing these effects on the ground. CARE staff \nwith 20 years' experience in the field say they have never seen a \nsituation this bad, and there are no immediate prospects for relief.\n  Last week, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon described the world \nfood situation as having reached emergency proportions. He and World \nBank President Robert Zoellick have warned that the food crisis ``could \nmean 7 lost years in the fight against worldwide poverty.''\n\n  We spend a lot of time on the Senate floor talking about security, \nespecially in the context of Iraq. But security is not won or lost only \non the streets of Baghdad or on the battlefields of Afghanistan. \nSecurity is at stake in the bread lines of Egypt, the rice markets in \nThailand, and the withering cornfields in Zimbabwe. The global food \ncrisis is also a looming security crisis, one that threatens the \nstability of many already fragile governments. Pockets of fierce \nprotest could trigger outbreaks of sustained violence, even war.\n  Referring to the same chart, the flames on this map show what has \nbeen experienced over the last 16 months in terms of riots and \ndemonstrations.\n  Haiti and Egypt, two nations where food prices have doubled in the \nlast 2 years, have already seen violent unrest linked to these soaring \nfood prices. Here are photographs of recent food riots, one in Haiti, \nanother in Egypt.\n  Just a word. I went to Haiti a few years ago with former Senator Mike \nDeWine of Ohio--my first visit. I had been prodded into going there \nbecause I traveled to Asia and Africa, and someone finally said: Why do \nyou travel so far looking for the worst poverty in the world when it is \nin your backyard, on the island of Haiti? So I went there, to the \nisland of Hispaniola, which has Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and \nthey were right. I had never seen worse poverty anywhere in the world, \nand it is in our backyard. And now these people are digging through a \ndump trying to find something to eat in Haiti.\n  Here, in Egypt, they have two lines of troops holding back a food \nriot that occurred there.\n  Haiti recently ousted its Prime Minister after days of violent \nprotest over soaring food prices. Nine thousand U.N. peacekeepers were \nordered recently not to fire on civilians as widespread looting and \nshooting continued.\n  In Egypt, the Government has had to dispatch riot police to break up \nfood protests. The military has even been put to work baking bread in \nan effort to prevent even more anger over soaring food prices.\n  Senegal is regarded as one of Africa's most stable democracies, but \neven there, rising anger over food prices is directed at the \nGovernment. Recent demonstrations in Senegal turned violent as police \nin riot gear struck and used tear gas against protestors who were \nprotesting for food.\n  Parts of India were enduring riots over the high cost of rice as far \nback as 6 months ago.\n  Recent history reminds us how closely our security is linked to the \nsecurity of these farflung places. Sending help in the form of food aid \nto these countries whose people are starving is clearly the right thing \nto do, but it is also the smart thing to do. If we stand by and watch \nthese violent uprisings cause governments to fall, this growing crisis \nwill pose a threat to the security of the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\n  Surveys by Pew Research show favorable opinions of America suffered \nsteep declines since 2000, and not just among old enemies but among \nrecent allies: in Great Britain, from 83 percent favorable toward the \nUnited States down to 56 percent in 2006; in Germany, from 67 percent \nto 37 percent; in Indonesia, from 75 percent to 30 percent; in Turkey, \nfrom 52 percent to 12 percent; and in Jordan, which we consider to be \nan ally and friend, only 15 percent of the people have a favorable \nopinion of our Nation. Yet amid these troubling numbers, the study also \nshowed moments of improved attitudes toward America, generated by U.S. \naid for tsunami victims in Indonesia and elsewhere.\n\n  We need to take heed that some countries in the world that share our \nvalues and have common goals in life think little of our country. They \nare wrong. They don't understand our values. They don't understand who \nwe are. We have a chance to help them understand by coming to the aid \nof those living in poverty and those facing starvation and depravation \naround the world.\n  The causes of today's soaring global food prices and food shortages \nare many, they are complicated, and they are interrelated. For the sake \nof world security, more work is needed to understand these causes and \ndevelop long-term solutions to feed a hungry world. But we cannot wait \nfor comprehensive solutions to start dealing with today's crises. We \nneed to focus on what we can do at this moment. We need to put an end \nto this emergency.\n  The Department of Agriculture announced last week that it will \nrelease $200 million in commodities from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian \nTrust. Bill was a friend of mine. He always had a soft spot in his \nheart for these programs, and I am glad this one is named after him. \nMr. President, $200 million is an important step that will help, but it \nis not enough.\n  Last week, I met with Josette Sheeran. She runs the World Food \nProgram. What a tough assignment at this moment in history. She says \nthey are at least $755 million short of what is needed to respond to \nthis global crisis. Beginning next month, for lack of money, the World \nFood Program may be forced to suspend its school feeding programs in \nCambodia. This last chart shows women in a small village in India \nreaching out desperately for rice sold by Government officials. ``The \nworld's misery index is rising'' as a result of the food crisis, \nJosette Sheeran of the World Food Program said last week.\n  Senators Biden and Kerry have joined me in asking the White House for \n$550 million for this global food crisis. I have joined Senator Bob \nCasey and others in asking the Appropriations Committee in the Senate \nto provide this help in the supplemental funding bill which we will be \nconsidering very soon.\n  Other countries are rising to the challenge. Last week, France \nannounced an additional $100 million; the UK pledged $60 million; and \nNorway, $20 million. Such contributions are important.\n  Another important step would be for the United States and donor \nnations to allow a percentage of food aid to be purchased in local food \nproducts. It may be that the food is there and if purchased can be \ngiven to the people rather than delaying the delivery by shipping \nthings from faraway destinations. I urge my colleagues to support this \nrequest.\n  For those who say $550 million is just too much to spend to avoid \nglobal shortages and unrest, I remind them that is just about what we \nspend in 1 day in the war in Iraq--1 day. We are talking about the \namount of money needed to try to avert a global food crisis.\n  A little over a week ago, the world's economic ministers met here in \nWashington to discuss the state of the world economy. They declared \nthat food shortages and skyrocketing prices posed potentially greater \nthreats to economic stability than the turmoil in capital markets. They \ncalled on wealthier nations to help prevent starvation and disorder.\n  We have a choice. We can stand back and watch this disaster unfold or \nwe can demonstrate to the world what we stand for. We can show the \nworld that we understand hunger and violent unrest are also forms of \ntyranny and terrorism and we are committed, the United States, to doing \nour part to help end them.\n  This is not charity. International food assistance in the face of the \nglobal food crisis is the right thing to do, the smart thing to do, and \nthe American thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nApril 18, 2008, article from the New York Times as well as the April \n22, 2008, article from the Irish Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 2008]\n\n             Across Globe, Empty Bellies Bring Rising Anger\n\n                            (By Marc Lacey)\n\n       Port-au-Prince, Haiti.--Hunger bashed in the front gate of \n     Haiti's presidential palace. Hunger poured onto the streets, \n     burning tires and taking on soldiers and the police. Hunger \n     sent the country's prime minister packing.\n       Haiti's hunger, that burn in the belly that so many here \n     feel, has become fiercer than ever in recent days as global \n     food prices spiral out of reach, spiking as much as 45 \n     percent since the end of 2006 and turning Haitian staples \n     like beans, corn and rice into closely guarded treasures.\n       Saint Louis Meriska's children ate two spoonfuls of rice \n     apiece as their only meal recently and then went without any \n     food the following day. His eyes downcast, his own stomach \n     empty, the unemployed father said forlornly, ``They look at \n     me and say, `Papa, I'm hungry,' and I have to look away. It's \n     humiliating and it makes you angry.''\n       That anger is palpable across the globe. The food crisis is \n     not only being felt among the poor but is also eroding the \n     gains of the working and middle classes, sowing volatile \n     levels of discontent and putting new pressures on fragile \n     governments.\n       In Cairo, the military is being put to work baking bread as \n     rising food prices threaten to become the spark that ignites \n     wider anger at a repressive government. In Burkina Faso and \n     other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, food riots are breaking \n     out as never before. In reasonably prosperous Malaysia, the \n     ruling coalition was nearly ousted by voters who cited food \n     and fuel price increases as their main concerns.\n       ``It's the worst crisis of its kind in more than 30 \n     years,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the economist and special \n     adviser to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. \n     ``It's a big deal and it's obviously threatening a lot of \n     governments. There are a number of governments on the ropes, \n     and I think there's more political fallout to come.''\n       Indeed, as it roils developing nations, the spike in \n     commodity prices--the biggest since the Nixon \n     administration--has pitted the globe's poorer south against \n     the relatively wealthy north, adding to demands for reform of \n     rich nations' farm and environmental policies. But experts \n     say there are few quick fixes to a crisis tied to so many \n     factors, from strong demand for food from emerging economies \n     like China's to rising oil prices to the diversion of food \n     resources to make biofuels.\n       There are no scripts on how to handle the crisis, either. \n     In Asia, governments are putting in place measures to limit \n     hoarding of rice after some shoppers panicked at price \n     increases and bought up everything they could.\n       Even in Thailand, which produces 10 million more tons of \n     rice than it consumes and is the world's largest rice \n     exporter, supermarkets have placed signs limiting the amount \n     of rice shoppers are allowed to purchase.\n       But there is also plenty of nervousness and confusion about \n     how best to proceed and just how bad the impact may \n     ultimately be, particularly as already strapped governments \n     struggle to keep up their food subsidies.\n\n\n                            Scandalous Storm\n\n       ``This is a perfect storm,'' President Elias Antonio Saca \n     of El Salvador said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum on \n     Latin America in Cancun, Mexico. ``How long can we withstand \n     the situation? We have to feed our people, and commodities \n     are becoming scarce. This scandalous storm might become a \n     hurricane that could upset not only our economies but also \n     the stability of our countries.''\n       In Asia, if Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi of \n     Malaysia steps down, which is looking increasingly likely \n     amid postelection turmoil within his party, he may be that \n     region's first high-profile political casualty of fuel and \n     food price inflation.\n       In Indonesia, fearing protests, the government recently \n     revised its 2008 budget, increasing the amount it will spend \n     on food subsidies by about $280 million.\n       ``The biggest concern is food riots,'' said H.S. Dillon, a \n     former adviser to Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture. \n     Referring to small but widespread protests touched off by a \n     rise in soybean prices in January, he said, ``It has happened \n     in the past and can happen again.''\n       Last month in Senegal, one of Africa's oldest and most \n     stable democracies, police in riot gear beat and used tear \n     gas against people protesting high food prices and later \n     raided a television station that broadcast images of the \n     event. Many Senegalese have expressed anger at President \n     Abdoulaye\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\n     Wade for spending lavishly on roads and five-star hotels for \n     an Islamic summit meeting last month while many people are \n     unable to afford rice or fish.\n       ``Why are these riots happening?'' asked Arif Husain, \n     senior food security analyst at the World Food Program, which \n     has issued urgent appeals for donations. ``The human instinct \n     is to survive, and people are going to do no matter what to \n     survive. And if you're hungry you get angry quicker.''\n       Leaders who ignore the rage do so at their own risk. \n     President Rene Preval of Haiti appeared to taunt the populace \n     as the chorus of complaints about la vie chere--the expensive \n     life--grew. He said if Haitians could afford cellphones, \n     which many do carry, they should be able to feed their \n     families. ``If there is a protest against the rising \n     prices,'' he said, ``come get me at the palace and I will \n     demonstrate with you.''\n       When they came, filled with rage and by the thousands, he \n     huddled inside and his presidential guards, with United \n     Nations peacekeeping troops, rebuffed them. Within days, \n     opposition lawmakers had voted out Mr. Preval's prime \n     minister, Jacques-Edouard Alexis, forcing him to reconstitute \n     his government. Fragile in even the best of times, Haiti's \n     population and politics are now both simmering.\n       ``Why were we surprised?'' asked Patrick Elie, a Haitian \n     political activist who followed the food riots in Africa \n     earlier in the year and feared they might come to Haiti. \n     ``When something is coming your way all the way from Burkina \n     Faso you should see it coming. What we had was like a can of \n     gasoline that the government left for someone to light a \n     match to it.''\n\n\n                            Dwindling Menus\n\n       The rising prices are altering menus, and not for the \n     better. In India, people are scrimping on milk for their \n     children. Daily bowls of dal are getting thinner, as a bag of \n     lentils is stretched across a few more meals.\n       Maninder Chand, an auto-rickshaw driver in New Delhi, said \n     his family had given up eating meat altogether for the last \n     several weeks.\n       Another rickshaw driver, Ravinder Kumar Gupta, said his \n     wife had stopped seasoning their daily lentils, their chief \n     source of protein, with the usual onion and spices because \n     the price of cooking oil was now out of reach. These days, \n     they eat bowls of watery, tasteless dal, seasoned only with \n     salt.\n       Down Cairo's Hafziyah Street, peddlers selling food from \n     behind wood carts bark out their prices. But few customers \n     can afford their fish or chicken, which bake in the hot sun. \n     Food prices have doubled in two months.\n       Ahmed Abul Gheit, 25, sat on a cheap, stained wooden chair \n     by his own pile of rotting tomatoes. ``We can't even find \n     food,'' he said, looking over at his friend Sobhy Abdullah, \n     50. Then raising his hands toward the sky, as if in prayer, \n     he said, ``May God take the guy I have in mind.''\n       Mr. Abdullah nodded, knowing full well that the ``guy'' was \n     President Hosni Mubarak.\n       The government's ability to address the crisis is limited, \n     however. It already spends more on subsidies, including \n     gasoline and bread, than on education and health combined.\n       ``If all the people rise, then the government will resolve \n     this,'' said Raisa Fikry, 50, whose husband receives a \n     pension equal to about $83 a month, as she shopped for \n     vegetables. ``But everyone has to rise together. People get \n     scared. But we will all have to rise together.''\n       It is the kind of talk that has prompted the government to \n     treat its economic woes as a security threat, dispatching \n     riot forces with a strict warning that anyone who takes to \n     the streets will be dealt with harshly.\n       Niger does not need to be reminded that hungry citizens \n     overthrow governments. The country's first postcolonial \n     president, Hamani Diori, was toppled amid allegations of \n     rampant corruption in 1974 as millions starved during a \n     drought.\n       More recently, in 2005, it was mass protests in Niamey, the \n     Nigerien capital, that made the government sit up and take \n     notice of that year's food crisis, which was caused by a \n     complex mix of poor rains, locust infestation and market \n     manipulation by traders.\n       ``As a result of that experience the government created a \n     cabinet-level ministry to deal with the high cost of \n     living,'' said Moustapha Kadi, an activist who helped \n     organize marches in 2005. ``So when prices went up this year \n     the government acted quickly to remove tariffs on rice, which \n     everyone eats. That quick action has kept people from taking \n     to the streets.''\n\n\n                            The Poor Eat Mud\n\n       In Haiti, where three-quarters of the population earns less \n     than $2 a day and one in five children is chronically \n     malnourished, the one business booming amid all the gloom is \n     the selling of patties made of mud, oil and sugar, typically \n     consumed only by the most destitute.\n       ``It's salty and it has butter and you don't know you're \n     eating dirt,'' said Olwich Louis Jeune, 24, who has taken to \n     eating them more often in recent months. ``It makes your \n     stomach quiet down.''\n       But the grumbling in Haiti these days is no longer confined \n     to the stomach. It is now spray-painted on walls of the \n     capital and shouted by demonstrators.\n       In recent days, Mr. Preval has patched together a response, \n     using international aid money and price reductions by \n     importers to cut the price of a sack of rice by about 15 \n     percent. He has also trimmed the salaries of some top \n     officials. But those are considered temporary measures.\n       Real solutions will take years. Haiti, its agriculture \n     industry in shambles, needs to better feed itself. Outside \n     investment is the key, although that requires stability, not \n     the sort of widespread looting and violence that the Haitian \n     food riots have fostered.\n       Meanwhile, most of the poorest of the poor suffer silently, \n     too weak for activism or too busy raising the next generation \n     of hungry. In the sprawling slum of Haiti's Cite Soleil, \n     Placide Simone, 29, offered one of her five offspring to a \n     stranger. ``Take one,'' she said, cradling a listless baby \n     and motioning toward four rail-thin toddlers, none of whom \n     had eaten that day. ``You pick. Just feed them.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Apr. 22, 2008]\n\n     Climate Change Devastation Gives Food for Thought on Earth Day\n\n                         (By Fr. Sean McDonagh)\n\n       Tuesday, April 22nd, is Earth Day. Unfortunately, there is \n     very little to celebrate this year, as the devastation of the \n     Earth is increasing at an extraordinary rate and, in many \n     countries, the poor are feeling the pain of hunger and \n     starvation.\n       The major culprit this year is climate change. Droughts in \n     various parts of the world, especially Australia, have cut \n     food supplies and the rush to grow biofuels leaves less land \n     on which to grow food. As a result food prices have jumped \n     dramatically during the year. Maize is up 31 per cent, rice \n     has increased by 74 per cent, soya is up 87 per cent, and \n     wheat is now 130 per cent dearer than it was last year.\n       In recent years, concerns about global warming and the end \n     of the oil era convinced many people that growing energy \n     crops might be a good idea. In the U.S. the production of \n     ethanol from plant matter increased by a factor of five in \n     the past decade. Policy decisions taken this year will lead \n     to a further five-fold increase. Europe is also boosting \n     biofuel production and attempting to source it from various \n     parts of the world.\n       The speed at which these changes are taking place can be \n     seen from a glance at investment in biofuels. In 1995 it was \n     a mere $5 billion. A decade later it had jumped to $38 \n     billion, and is expected to top $100 billion (=63 billion) by \n     2010.\n       Sorry to say the biofuel boom is a classic example of the \n     paradox of conscious purpose. This means that we often \n     achieve the very opposite result to the one we intended. In \n     both southeast Asia and South America, growing biofuel crops \n     has led to massive destruction of the rainforest. In Brazil, \n     for example, more than 302,514 hectares were destroyed in the \n     second half of 2007. One of the main reasons for this is the \n     pressure to grow more soya.\n       In Malaysia and Indonesia producing biofuels from palm oil \n     will increase the amount of carbon dioxide released into the \n     atmosphere, because the preferred way of clearing the forest \n     is by burning it. This final destruction of the forest will \n     lead to the extinction of countless species of plant, animal, \n     reptile and bird life.\n       Global food supplies are also at a very low ebb. The last \n     time the U.S.'s grain silos were so empty was in the early \n     1970s when President Richard Nixon sold the wheat surplus to \n     the USSR because crop failures there were leading to \n     starvation. The U.S. recently told the World Food Programme \n     to expect a 40 per cent increase in the price of food in \n     2008.\n       Less food and dearer food has led to riots around the \n     world. In Morocco, 34 people were arrested in January 2008 \n     for taking part in riots over food prices. The situation in \n     Egypt is worse. In a 12-month period up to March 2008, the \n     price of cereals and bread had increased in Egypt by 48.1 per \n     cent, according to Egypt's Central Agency for Public \n     Mobilisation and Statistics. The price of cooking oil rose by \n     45.2 per cent. Because of these increases, the Egyptian \n     government has relaxed the rules on who is eligible for food \n     aid. This has led to tensions and, if the situation \n     continues, could destabilise the government.\n       The same is true in Pakistan. Meanwhile, at least four \n     people were killed and 20 wounded when demonstrations against \n     rising food prices turned into riots in southern Haiti.\n       My colleagues in the Philippines tell me that both the \n     price of rice and insecure supplies of the cereal could do \n     much more to destabilise the government of President Gloria \n     Macapagal Arroyo than coup plotters or even charges of gross \n     corruption. All in all there is little to celebrate on Earth \n     Day, 2008.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today in support of the 20th \nAnnual Global Youth Service Day. This event, the largest service event \nin the world, celebrates the contributions of young people to better \ntheir community, country and world through voluntarism. The day also \ncelebrates contributions by the community, including the\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\npublic, private, and nonprofit sectors, to empower young people.\n  Like the youth who participate in the Global Youth Service Day, I \ngravitated towards public service at a young age. After graduating from \nlaw school, I worked for the Department of Health, Education and \nWelfare on the rights and potential contributions of disabled \nAmericans. We all have a contribution to make, and for me, the greatest \njoy in life has come from public service, which has enabled me to touch \ncountless lives. My mother, Mary Hanford, who passed away just shy of \n103 years old, taught me at a very young age the importance of giving \nback to your community and helping those around you. She taught me that \nthe best thing you can leave behind is not found on a resume or in a \nbank account; it is found in your character, making a difference, a \npositive difference, the lives of others.\n  During Global Youth Service Day, millions of young people across the \nglobe will participate in thousands of community improvement projects. \nAlthough we commemorate this event only once a year, Global Youth \nService Day is a celebration of contributions made every day by \ndedicated young people who desire to change the world one good deed at \na time, and by the communities that empower them to do so. True service \nis not giving 1 day or even 1 week a year; it is truly a way of life.\n  The projects carried out for Global Youth Service Day focus on issues \nranging from increasing literacy to protecting the environment and \nending hunger. One can see the diversity of the projects and the \ndedication of the participants by looking at those carried out in my \nhome state of North Carolina during last year's Global Youth Service \nDay. One such project, the Pfeiffer University Relay for Life, was held \na few miles from my hometown of Salisbury. This 24-hour relay was held \nto support cancer research and to raise awareness. Another project, in \nCharlotte, involved a group doing their own part to protect the \nenvironment by picking up litter and cleaning a creek in their \nneighborhood.\n  Looking back over the years, my belief is it won't be the cars you \ndrove or the titles you held or the awards you were given that will \nmatter. No, it is character, integrity, a caring heart and \ncompassionate concern and love for your fellow man that will count for \nso much more. So let me assure you, that just one individual, one \nperson like those who participate in this important day, can make a \nworld of difference . . . even, I might say, a different world. \nVolunteers are a powerful force, and our future depends on people like \nthese youth, who will motivate and challenge others and make that \npositive difference.\n  No one is ever too young or too old to be involved in shaping our \nworld. I encourage all youth to be inspired on this day to use their \ntalents to find ways to make a positive difference in the lives of \nothers. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation \ndesignating April 25, 2008, as Global Youth Service Day.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3383-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3383-S3387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, this country faces many problems. All \nover this country people are worried about decent-paying jobs, the high \ncost of college education, and a disintegrating health care system. \nThey are worried about the growing gap between the very rich and \neverybody else. But on Saturday, I held three town meetings around the \nState of Vermont: one in Norwich in the morning, one in Radford in the \nafternoon, and one in a small town in northern Vermont in Danville in \nthe evening.\n  To nobody's surprise, the issue that is paramount on people's minds \ntoday is the outrageously high price of gas and home heating oil. \nVermont is a rural State, which means people very often have to travel \nlong distances to work. When they pay $3.50 for a gallon of gas, it \nessentially means in most cases that any wage increase they might have \ngotten over the last year goes right into that gas pump. People are \nhurting. Wages, in fact, are often not going up. So the end result is \nthat people are working longer hours for lower wages.\n  I have talked to many people who say: We used to go places. We used \nto travel. We can't afford to do that anymore. Also, obviously, in a \nState such as Vermont, where the weather gets very cold in the \nwintertime, the cost of home heating oil is a real burden. There are \nmany people in my State and all over the country who are worried about \nhow they are going to be able to heat their homes next winter.\n  We have a national crisis. It is a crisis that is not only impacting \non gas prices at the pump or home heating oil prices. It impacts food \nand every other product we purchase because as oil prices go up, prices \non so many of the products we buy are going to go up as well. This is a \nnational crisis.\n  The time is long overdue for the White House and for Congress to \nbegin to move forward in a comprehensive way. I would be less than \nhonest if I told you I have a lot of confidence that the Bush-Cheney \nadministration is going to do what is right. Just a month ago, \nPresident Bush, when asked about the high price of gas at the pump, was \nvery surprised to learn, in fact, that it was going up.\n  Vice President Cheney, who was the former CEO of Halliburton, deeply \ninvolved in the oil industry when they first came into power, met with \nrepresentatives of the oil industry. They are representing, \nunfortunately, the oil industry. They are not representing the \nconsumers of this country or working families. So it is incumbent on \nthe Congress now in a comprehensive way to start moving forward.\n  This is a complicated issue. I don't think anyone believes there is \none single cause for the rapid increase in oil prices, nor does anybody \nbelieve there is one single solution. But we do know some of the causes \nand what we have to do to lower the price of oil. If we are going to \nprotect middle-class Americans, working Americans, that is exactly what \nwe have to do.\n  While oil prices are soaring, what we should acknowledge is that the \nprofits of huge oil companies are also soaring to recordbreaking \nlevels. We know hedge fund managers make billions speculating on oil \nfutures, and we know OPEC continues to function as a price-fixing \ncartel in violation of the World Trade Organization.\n  The average price for a gallon of gas recently hit a recordbreaking \n$3.53 a gallon, which has more than doubled since George W. Bush has \nbeen President. The price of diesel fuel is now averaging over $4 a \ngallon, and the price of oil is hovering at close to $120 a barrel. \nThese prices say it all. We have a national emergency on our hands. The \ntime is now for this Congress, this Senate, to act boldly to protect \nconsumers.\n  Recordbreaking oil and gas prices at the pump are posing a crisis not \nonly to commuters going to work, especially in rural areas, but family \nfarmers, consumers, small businesses, truckers, airlines, grocery \nstores, restaurants, hotels, tourists, and every sector of our economy.\n  High oil prices are one of the reasons we are moving toward a serious \nrecession which will impact not just this country but the entire world.\n  The national oil emergency we are currently experiencing demands both \na short-term and a long-term solution. Long term, we must reduce our \ndependency on fossil fuel, we must move to energy efficiency, we must \nmove to sustainable energy--and the potential there is enormous. It is \nenormous. We can save huge amounts of energy when we have a \ntransportation system that enables us to drive hybrid cars, to get cars \nthat get 70, 80 miles per gallon, where we have a mass transportation \nsystem. There is enormous potential in terms of solar thermal plants, \nwhich produce huge amounts of electricity. There is enormous potential \nin terms of wind, other forms of solar. We have to focus and invest in \nthose technologies.\n  But over the short term, today, we have to understand that while we \nmove forward in transforming our energy system, we must respond to the \npain\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\nand the distress and the fear Americans are feeling today as gas prices \nsoar.\n  While this is a complicated issue, there are a number of ways I \nbelieve Congress can act to lower the price of oil. Let me mention a \nfew ideas I believe we should be pursuing.\n  First, we need to impose a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas \nindustry. The American people do not understand--I do not understand--\nwhy they are paying recordbreaking prices at the gas pump, while \nExxonMobil has made more profits than any other company in the history \nof the world for the past 2 consecutive years. The price at the pump: \n$3.50 a gallon; ExxonMobil making more profits than any company in the \nhistory of the world.\n  Last year alone, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits, and rewarded \nits CEO, Rex Tillerson, with $21 million in total compensation. Now, \nyou may think that is a lot of money. But a few years ago, they \nrewarded their former CEO, Lee Raymond, with a $400 million \ncompensation package when he retired.\n  Outrageously high prices for oil and gas and CEOs at ExxonMobil with \nhuge compensation packages. But ExxonMobil is clearly not alone. \nChevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and BP have also been making out like \nbandits. In fact, the five largest oil companies in this country have \nmade over $595 billion in profits since George W. Bush has been \nPresident.\n  Let me be very clear. I believe oil companies should be allowed to \nmake a reasonable profit, but they should not be allowed to rip off the \nAmerican people. Enacting a true windfall profits tax would not raise a \ndime in revenue but would lead to significantly lower gas prices at the \npump--something we need to do today. The reason for that is quite \nsimple. There would no longer be an incentive for the big oil companies \nto gouge consumers at the pump because they would not be able to keep \nany of their windfall profits.\n  Imposing a windfall profits tax will not be easy. Since 1998, the oil \nand gas industry has spent--this is quite amazing--over $600 million on \nlobbying. Since 1998, a 10-year period, they have spent over $600 \nmillion on lobbying. They own the law firms. They are former Republican \nleaders, former Democratic leaders, besieging Congress to do everything \nwe can to protect the big oil companies rather than people who are \ngetting ripped off at the gas pump.\n  Since 1990, these very same oil and gas companies have made over $213 \nmillion in campaign contributions. So the folks back home may get an \nunderstanding of why we are not as a body aggressively standing up to \nthese people, that has to do with huge amounts of money in lobbying, \nhuge amounts of money in campaign contributions.\n  But the time is now for the Congress to have the courage and for the \nPresident of the United States to say no to the oil and gas lobbyists \nand their outrageous campaign contributions and yes to consumers who \nsimply cannot afford to pay these outrageously high prices for gas and \noil.\n  While it is true oil companies and their executives are making out \nlike bandits, it is also true that is not the only cause of the \nproblem. What we are seeing today is that wealthy speculators and hedge \nfund managers have also been making obscene profits--billions and \nbillions of dollars, in some cases going to individuals--by driving up \nthe price of oil in unregulated energy markets with no Government \noversight.\n  That is why Congress must act to rein in these greedy speculators who \noften have nothing to do with oil at all. They do not care what they \nare speculating on. They are just making money by driving up profits, \nand we must act by closing what has been referred to as the ``Enron \nloophole,'' the loophole that enabled Enron to do disastrous things in \nCalifornia some years ago and on the West Coast.\n  This loophole was created in 2000 as part of the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act. At the behest of Enron lobbyists, a provision in \nthis bill was inserted in the dark of night and with no congressional \noversight, no congressional hearings. Specifically, the Enron loophole \nexempts electronic energy trading from Federal commodities laws. \nVirtually overnight, the loophole freed over-the-counter energy trading \nfrom Federal oversight requirements, opening the door to excessive \nspeculation and energy price manipulation.\n  Since the Enron loophole has been in effect, crude oil prices have \njumped from $33.39 a barrel, in 2000, after adjusting for inflation, to \nover $117 a barrel today.\n  Last January, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer has estimated \nthere is as much as a $57 a barrel ``speculative premium'' on the price \nof oil. Others have estimated that speculators are driving up the price \nof oil by about 20 to 30 percent.\n  Closing the Enron loophole would subject electronic energy markets to \nproper regulatory oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation.\n  I would like to thank Senators Levin and Feinstein for introducing \nlegislation to close this loophole. It should be passed and signed into \nlaw as soon as possible.\n  In addition, the Bush administration must stop the flow of oil into \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve and immediately release oil from this \nFederal stockpile to reduce gas prices.\n  At a time of record-high prices, it simply makes no sense to continue \nto take oil off the market and put it into the SPR. But do not take my \nword for it. Even the staff at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nrecommended against buying more oil for SPR in the spring of 2002. Let \nme quote from what they had to say about this 6 years ago:\n\n       Commercial inventories are low, retail prices are high and \n     economic growth is slow. The Government should avoid \n     acquiring oil for the Reserve under these circumstances.\n\n  If that advice was relevant in the spring of 2002, it is even more \nrelevant today. Yet that is exactly the policy the administration is \nfollowing. Even though there are over 700 million barrels of oil in the \nReserve, the administration has plans of putting an additional 13 \nmillion barrels of oil into our Nation's stockpile.\n  There is another issue out there that we must address, and that is \nbeginning to understand that OPEC is a cartel whose function in life is \nto control oil production and artificially drive up the price. It is my \nview that OPEC is operating in violation of World Trade Organization \nrules.\n  The President of the United States should begin action to break up \nOPEC. Yesterday, I signed a letter, as I believe the Presiding Officer \ndid, demanding that Saudi Arabia--one of the key OPEC nations; the \nlargest oil-producing country in the world--increase their production.\n  Amazingly, Saudi Arabia is producing less oil today than they were \nseveral years ago. There are experts who believe they can be producing \n1.8 million barrels a day more, which would have a significant impact \non driving oil prices down. We have to remind Saudi Arabia that in \n1991, when Saddam Hussein's army was going to overrun that country and \ntake their oil, soldiers from the United States of America put their \nlives on the line--died--defending Kuwait, defending Saudi Arabia. That \nwas their time of need. Today it is our time of need. It is the world \neconomy's time of need.\n  Saudi Arabia wants to buy sophisticated aircraft from the United \nStates of America. Well, I say to them, as many of my colleagues say: \nFriendship is a two-way street. Increase your production. Drive down \nthe prices of oil.\n  Lastly, we must give the President the power to impose temporary \nprice caps to stabilize oil prices when markets are being manipulated.\n  Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, has the \nauthority to impose temporary price caps on electricity. When it used \nthis authority to deal with the California energy crisis created by \nEnron, electricity prices fell dramatically. The President should have \nsimilar authority over gas prices.\n  These are a few of the ideas that are out there. Other people have \ngood ideas. My view is we should bring these ideas together in a \ncomprehensive way. If we do that, and if we stand together in a \nbipartisan way--if the President of the United States decides to \nrepresent the consumers of this country rather than just the oil \ncompanies--we can keep faith with the American people. We can lower \nprices. We can deal with the very severe national crisis this country \nis now facing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nhis comments about what is a growing national crisis: the price of oil \nand the price of gasoline at the pump. I congratulate him for making \nmany important points relating to this issue and where the Senate needs \nto go in trying to address it. So I look forward to working with him on \nhis ideas and many of the other ideas my colleagues have to try to give \nconsumers some relief at the pump.\n  I think many consumers already have either turned on their \ntelevisions or seen through the impact of going to the gas station \nthemselves that at $118 a barrel for oil, they are paying at least \n$3.56 a gallon for gasoline and more for diesel.\n  But what is important to understand about this is that oil futures--\nwhich is an indication of the price of oil and impacts the physical \nmarket's price of oil--are going to be over $100 for several years, \nincluding probably until 2015. That is, the marketplace has already \ndecided it is buying oil at over $100 until 2015. So that is going to \nkeep the price of oil high at over $100 and it is going to continue to \nhave a significant impact and it is something we need to take into \nconsideration.\n  Now, we have heard a lot of debate on the floor this morning about \nthis issue and what the cause of it was. There have been a lot of \naccusations by a lot of different people saying: Here is what we think \nthe problem is.\n  Well, I wish to go through a couple things I want to make sure our \ncolleagues understand is not the problem or not the solution.\n  First of all, we had people talking about how this was all about more \nsupply, and that if Democrats had not opposed drilling in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge, somehow today we would not have this problem, we would \nbe sitting here without any kind of oil problem.\n  Well, I wish to remind people that the Energy Information \nAdministration--our own Federal Government agency--did an analysis of \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and said that:\n\n       Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would only \n     reduce gasoline prices by a penny per gallon, and only in \n     twenty years when drilling is at or near peak production.\n\n  That would be when it was at peak capacity. So hardly where we are \ntoday--at $118 a barrel--would that have had a significant impact on \nthe prices we have today.\n  We also heard people say this was about environmental regulations, \nthat somehow environmental regulations had caused this problem.\n  Well, let's hear from the oil company executives themselves. This \none, Shell's CEO, said:\n\n       We are not aware of any environmental regulations that have \n     prevented us from expanding refinery capacity or siting a new \n     refinery.\n\n  So here are oil company executives saying they do not know of any \nenvironmental regulations. I think this was testimony before the \nSenate--one of our committees. So, obviously, their oil company \nexecutives are saying that is not what the problem is.\n  They also said environmental regulations are not stopping refinery \nexpansions. So they were clear, testifying, again, before the Senate:\n\n       At this time, we are not aware of any projects that have \n     been directly prevented as a result of any specific Federal \n     or State regulation.\n\n  So you cannot stand on the floor of the Senate and blame regulations \nor environmental issues for not doing something that would impact the \nprice of oil today. It is not true. These are CEOs, these are people in \nthe business, and they are basically saying: No, that is not the \neffect.\n  We have one more from BP who said that it also was not stopping them \nfrom doing anything:\n\n       We do not believe that any Federal or State environmental \n     regulations have prevented us from expanding refinery \n     capacity or siting a new refinery.\n\n  So here is the oil industry itself saying that is not what the issue \nis, that is not what the problem is. They have not been back since this \ntime period to claim any kind of Federal regulation or environmental \nissue.\n  So let's look at the other issue people talk about: inventory. Oh, \nthere must be inventories related to that issue of the fact that you \nwouldn't allow us to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge or that it is \nabout these environmental restrictions and we couldn't build \nrefineries.\n  Here is someone who is an oil analyst who on March 10 had this to say \nabout inventories:\n\n       Gasoline inventories are higher than the historical average \n     at this time of the year, so there is really no need to worry \n     about supply being too tight.\n\n  So this is an oil analyst talking about the marketplace and basically \nsaying: You can't say this is about tight supply as it relates to the \nfundamentals of supply and demand.\n  So is this just about supply and demand? Is it about that? Well, one \nindividual from the Truckers Association basically just said a few \nweeks ago:\n\n       The oil market is no longer functioning on supply-and-\n     demand fundamentals.\n\n  I don't blame the Truckers Association for saying that because they \nare on the front line of out-of-control diesel prices. When they see $4 \na gallon for their diesel, it takes over $1,000 to fill up a typical \ntractor trailer, and they can't make enough money when they are paying \nthat kind of a price. This year, they will pay $22 billion more--$22 \nbillion more--for diesel fuel than last year's high prices. So don't \nthink it is not costing Americans and costing industries that are based \non transportation and profit margins that are very low.\n  We know there is more to this issue than what people have talked \nabout here on the floor this morning. But let's look at what is really \ngoing on and whether this price is justified. Let's look at that.\n  Again, I think a great source to understand whether this price is \njustified--that is, whether there is something else going on in the \nmarketplace--is the oil company executives themselves because if they \nare saying oil shouldn't be at $100 a barrel, then why should it be at \n$100 a barrel? If those in the industry are even claiming it shouldn't \nbe at this price, then something must be wrong and we should act to \ncorrect it.\n  But here is the CEO of Marathon Oil who basically said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  That is an oil company executive owning up to that, just saying right \nupfront that it is not about the fact that oil should be at $100 a \nbarrel.\n  Let's look at what some other CEO said, this one the CEO of Royal \nDutch Shell, who just recently, on the 11th of this month, basically \nsaid that oil fundamentals are no problem, meaning that is not what the \nissue is. It isn't basically supply and demand. They are the same as \nthey were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel. What he is saying is \nthat the fundamentals in the market are the same as when they were $60 \na barrel, so there is no problem with supply and demand.\n  Let's look at another executive from an energy company. I like this \nbecause he actually just recently testified before the House of \nRepresentatives and just spit it right out. He just said it plain and \nsimple. He said that the price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per \nbarrel. That is an oil company executive this month testifying before a \nHouse committee saying that is what the price of oil should be.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, what are we going to do about this \nsituation when even the oil company executives are testifying--in this \ncase, under oath before Congress--and basically saying there is no \njustification for this price? What are we going to do? Are we going to \njust sit by and do nothing? We have people in the marketplace who are \nurging us to do something.\n  This is from an energy analyst who basically was just quoted as \nsaying: Unless the U.S. Government--the U.S. Government--steps in to \nrein in speculators' power in the market, prices will just keep going \nup. That is an oil industry analyst. That is what he is saying.\n  Everybody wants a functioning market. Functioning markets mean there \nis transparency, there is not manipulation, it is working well, people \ncan trust the outcome, and people can make investments knowing that \nsomeone isn't gaming the system. That is what a functioning market is. \nIt is clear that this individual is saying they are not sure there is a \nfunctioning market, and they are basically saying that unless the U.S. \nGovernment steps\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\nin to rein it in, we are going to have a problem.\n\n  We have seen this before. We saw this with the Western energy crisis \nin electricity. We saw the market go crazy and people stand by and say: \nOh, you know what, you didn't build enough capacity; the \nenvironmentalists stopped it; this and this was wrong, and that is what \nthe problem was. Well, during that time period, guess what happened. We \nlost nearly 600,000 jobs, and there was a $35 billion drop in economic \nproduct. For us in the Northwest, it cost our economy billions of \ndollars, and we are still recovering from it. So now is not the time to \nsit and point fingers that this is about some PAC environmental problem \nor regulation or ANWR; this is about taking testimony from individuals \nand standing up and deciding what we are going to do to protect our \nconsumers.\n  My colleague from Vermont mentioned a few things, and I wish to \nmention a few things, also, because I think there are four or five \nthings we should be doing right now to help consumers. This is a \ncrisis. It demands a response by the Federal Government. Some of these \npowers exist within the Federal Government now, some of them we are \nworking on, but we need to be aggressive about protecting our \nconsumers.\n  The first one my colleague from Vermont mentioned was closing the \nEnron loophole. Now, many people may not understand what closing the \nEnron loophole is, but just to give my colleagues a little refresher, \nthis debate has been going on basically since shortly after 2000 when \nCongress gave a loophole to electronic trading of energy. Basically, \nwhat that loophole meant is they didn't have to have the same kind of \ntransparency; that is, we don't have the ability to look at the books \nand see whether somebody manipulated the price or was doing something \nuntoward in the marketplace. We gave them an exemption.\n  Since that time, Senator Feinstein and then more recently Senator \nLevin, myself, and others have been trying to close that Enron \nloophole. We have been trying to close that Enron loophole for over 4 \nyears now. If anybody wants to say there is any responsibility here \nabout what Congress hasn't done and it has impacted the price of \nenergy, then people ought to look at their voting record and see \nwhether they voted to close the Enron loophole because that is part of \nthis problem.\n  In addition, we should require oversight of all oil futures; that is, \nwhy are we saying oil futures somehow are less important than any other \ncommodity we trade on the futures market for NYMEX or for the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange? They have reporting requirements. Federal \ninvestigators can go and look at their books and see whether somebody \ncan manipulate the market. They have that. But, no, we are letting some \nof these oil futures which impact the price of today's oil--as I said, \nfrom now until 2015, people are purchasing oil futures at over $100 a \nbarrel, which means that is going to be a market indicator for what the \nphysical price will be. We need to be having oversight of oil futures.\n  We had a very interesting hearing about a year ago where a professor \nfrom American University, I think, came to testify, and he said: Is \nhamburger any more important than oil in America? Because he said that \nwhen you look at beef and how it is regulated and beef futures, there \nare things they have to report. There are transparencies in the \nmarketplace. We require all of this of them, but oil, which is \nessential to our economy, we basically have given exemptions to. So we \nneed to require oversight of all oil futures.\n  The third thing we need to do is have the Federal Trade Commission \nwrite rules for a law that we passed in 2007. This body did something. \nThat is what people should be holding up today--holding up the fact \nthat we did something to protect consumers. We wrote a new Federal \nstatute basically which said that manipulation of oil markets was a \nFederal crime, that you couldn't have any manipulative devices or \ncontrivances that manipulated the price of oil. Now we are sitting \naround waiting for the FTC to implement that rule.\n  Now, some people think: Well, maybe there is not manipulation in the \nmarketplace. I want to give three examples which have happened \nrecently, all in the last few years. They have been the result of \nhaving new statutes on the books, but we certainly need to have this \nregulation implemented. One of those examples was British Petroleum. \nThe company must now pay approximately $373 million in part for \nconspiring to corner the market and manipulate the price of propane \ncarried through the Texas pipeline. So there is an example of where \nregulators got on the job. Similarly, in 2006, a manipulative scheme to \ngame a natural gas market by a now defunct hedge fund cost consumers \nupwards of $9 billion, and in July of last year, Marathon Oil agreed to \npay a $1 million fine to settle charges that Marathon Petroleum \nCompany, a subsidiary, attempted to manipulate the crude oil prices in \n2003.\n  So these are incidents of manipulation happening. We have an industry \nthat is saying it is not about supply and demand and the price should \nreally be anywhere from $50 to $60 a barrel; it shouldn't be at this \nprice. We need the Federal regulators to do their job.\n\n  The fourth thing we need to do: Having gone through this with the \nincredible crisis of electricity, we learned we have various agencies \nwith various oversight, and the Department of Justice did something \nvery wise during that time period. It created the Enron Task Force. It \ncreated an Enron Task Force to coordinate all the agencies that could \nhelp them in the investigation of the manipulation and corruption and \nfraud that was perpetrated by that company. It worked well. That \nPresident's corporate task force on fraud exists within the Department \nof Justice today.\n  My colleague from Washington, Congressman Inslee, and myself wrote to \nthe Department of Justice and President Bush on Monday calling for a \nDepartment of Justice oil market fraud task force. We believe it is \ntime to bring DOJ into the picture to be aggressive in working with the \nCFTC, the FTC, the SEC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and \nany other Federal agency to be the policeman on this beat and make sure \noil markets are not being further manipulated.\n  The last thing we need to do is to make sure price gouging is also \nnot occurring. Now, we had language in the 2007 Energy bill on this \nissue. I like this language because it is based on language that 28 \nStates have now that in the case of an emergency, when prices have gone \nout of control, it gives the President the ability to declare an \nemergency and to deal with those prices. We may be getting to that \npoint. We may be getting to the point where we listen to these oil \nanalysts who are saying these prices are going to just keep going up \nunless the Federal Government does something, and then I think we are \ngoing to have to do more than this. But at least we need to do these \nfour things--and I say hopefully pass this fifth one as well--to make \nsure we are giving all the tools to the administration to protect \nconsumers.\n  My colleague from Vermont said it well. This is about what are we \ngoing to do to protect consumers. There are a lot of things that have \nbeen happening since our economy took this more significant downturn. I \nwould say it is a significant downturn because no one can sustain these \noil price impacts across our economy. Yes, there are other things such \nas housing, but this is having a significant impact. But if you look at \nsome of the solutions we have done so far, whether we are talking about \nhousing or in the banking industry, we have done a lot for the big \norganizations. This is about doing something to protect consumers on \nprice.\n  I hope my colleagues will take this list seriously as we propose \nlegislation, and I hope all of my colleagues will join in the \nDepartment of Justice starting this investigation. If you look at their \nWeb site, they will tell you when they started the President's \ncorporate task force on fraud, particularly relating to Enron, and they \nstarted making sure traders and others knew they were going to lose \ntheir livelihood and their profession if they manipulated the market, \npeople started getting serious about their actions.\n  At $118 a barrel, we have to send a message by the enforcement \nagencies of the Federal Government that we are going to get serious \nabout challenging manipulative activity as it relates to oil prices and \nthat we are going to do our job and we are going to demand\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nthat the Federal Government have a cop on the beat when it comes to \nhigh oil prices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, whatever one's point of view on the war \nin Iraq, on whether we should be involved or not in the competition for \ninfluence in that region, the incontrovertible fact is, there are men \nand women in the U.S. Armed Forces who are there trying to protect our \ninterests, carry out the orders of their superiors, and safeguard and \ndefend the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And \nthey are in danger of running short of equipment and supplies and the \nother means necessary to succeed in this conflict because requests for \nsupplemental appropriations are languishing in the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees, with no certain schedule for reporting out \nthe bills that must be passed, the bills that must be passed to support \nour troops and replenish the accounts that have been depleted in this \nconflict.\n  Mr. President, I am growing increasingly concerned about the status \nof the President's fiscal year 2008 request to provide supplemental \nfunding to support our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. The \nPresident submitted the bulk of his request in February of 2007 in \nconjunction with his regular fiscal year 2008 budget submission. He did \nso largely because Congress clearly expressed its desire for a full \nyear estimate of war costs. Yet Congress did not appropriate a full \nyear's funding.\n  At the end of last year, Congress approved only a $70 billion \n``bridge fund'' to support our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan until \nthis spring. Enacting even that amount required a protracted struggle \nbetween the House, the Senate, and the President. As a result, the \nDepartment of Defense had to issue furlough notices, make a series of \ninefficient transfers and reprogrammings, and generally function in \nways that could only detract from its primary duties.\n  We find ourselves today facing a very similar situation, more than 14 \nmonths after the submission of the President's request. We have not \nappropriated, approved, or otherwise acted on some $108 billion of the \nPresident's request. The personnel, operations, and maintenance \naccounts that support our activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nrunning low. And by May or June, those accounts will run out of money. \nSoon the Department of Defense will once again have to issue furlough \nnotices, initiate transfers and reprogrammings, and take other \ninefficient and demoralizing actions that simply should not be \nnecessary.\n  I have no doubt that Congress will someday approve a funding bill. \nWhile individual Senators have different views about what our policies \nshould be in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am confident that each of my \ncolleagues wants ultimately to provide our Armed Forces and our \ndiplomatic corps with the resources they need to implement the policies \nof the U.S. Government.\n  My concern is, when will we act? And how will we act? Every day, I \nread stories speculating about action on the supplemental. Last week, \nthe Appropriations Committee held a hearing on the supplemental with \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Nussle as the witness from the \nadministration. It seemed as though we might mark up the bill this \nweek, but that has not occurred. I had hoped that by now a markup would \nbe definitely scheduled for next week. But that hasn't occurred either. \nHopefully, a markup will occur before we lose yet another week.\n  But I grow more concerned with each passing day. In the other body, \nit appears the majority will bypass the committee altogether and take a \nbill straight to the House floor. Why they would choose to forfeit the \ndetailed knowledge and expertise of the relevant committee of \njurisdiction is beyond me, but that is their decision to make. In the \nSenate, I am not entirely comfortable that a similar procedure isn't \nunder consideration. I know very well that it would not be Chairman \nByrd's preference, but I recognize that such decisions are sometimes \nmade by leadership and not by the chairman.\n  I am also concerned that the process by which Congress will consider \nthe supplemental will again be through a series of messages between the \nHouse and the Senate. The House will neither hold a committee markup \nnor generate an original bill for consideration. As such, it appears \nthere will be no conference committee to reconcile differences between \nthe House and Senate. Rather, the committee leadership, as well as the \nmajority leadership in the House and Senate, will retire behind closed \ndoors to produce a final product for our consideration. The minority \nwill be part of the discussion to varying degrees, but there will be no \nconference meeting to attend, there will be no conference votes to \ndecide items of disagreement, and there will be no conference report \nfor Members to sign or not to sign.\n  None of these procedures are without precedent. The Republican \nmajority at times employed similar tactics to move legislation. But I \nfear that in the appropriations realm, we are making a habit of these \nprocedures--a bad habit. Processing bills by exchanging messages with \nthe House is becoming the norm rather than the exception. Formal \nconference committees are becoming rare. It seems that committee \nmarkups may be the next part of the regular order to go by the boards. \nThis trend should be of concern to all Members of the Senate, not just \nthe members of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n  I get the sense that the majority is struggling mightily to develop a \nunified, bicameral course of parliamentary action that is most \nadvantageous for their party and which minimizes the chances of \nunexpected legislative outcomes. I can understand that desire. It is \nextraordinarily difficult to guide a bill as significant as this \nsupplemental through the legislative process, particularly in an \nelection year.\n  But in meeting and striving to engineer all uncertainty out of the \nprocess, the majority is losing valuable time--time that, in my view, \nwould be better spent marking up the bill, moving it to the floor, and \nprocessing amendments in the regular order. Let's not forget those who \nare depending upon the outcome for their livelihood, their ability to \ndefend themselves and protect the security interests of our great \ncountry. They are the ones who are awaiting our action.\n  Let the Congress work its will. Let the President make a decision \nwhether to sign the bill, and let Congress respond, if necessary. Not \nto make light of the Senate schedule over the past 2 weeks, but we \nshould be using this window of time that appears to be available to us. \nIn the increasingly political atmosphere in which Congress operates, \nsometimes we have to remind ourselves of our core responsibilities as \nMembers of this body. In the context of this war supplemental, I think \nour core responsibility is to give the men and women of our Armed \nForces and diplomatic corps the resources they need to succeed in the \nmission they have been assigned by their Government, and to do so \nwithout undue delay\n  We have had the President's request for 14 months--14 months. We have \nheld hearings. Members and staff have had numerous meetings with \nadministration officials and other interested parties to discuss the \ndetails of the need. We have received an updated report from General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker.\n  Mr. President, it is time to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to discuss several areas this \nafternoon. One is the excessive market speculation with respect to the \nprice of oil and gas. My colleagues have done so, and I will weigh in \non that.\n  I think what is happening is not only unfair to the American consumer \nbut damaging to this country's economy. So I will talk about that in a \nbit. I\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nwant to mention that, on Monday of next week, at 2 p.m., I intend to \nchair a hearing of the Democratic Policy Committee, in which we will \nhear from three additional whistleblowers on the issue of waste, fraud, \nand abuse in contracting in Iraq.\n  I have held a lot of hearings over a number of years with respect to \ncontracting in Iraq. It is the most unbelievable waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the history of this country. On Monday, we will hear from \nwhistleblowers who will tell us about the infamous burn pits in Iraq, \nwhere in many cases valuable equipment is taken to be burned. In other \ncases, equipment has been pilfered and taken into the black market. It \nis an unbelievable tale. But it just fits in with the other things we \nhave heard.\n  I will not go through all the examples. I have spoken about them at \ngreat length. Presumably, some are under criminal investigation. One \nwould expect and hope that the Defense Department would begin to debar \nsome contractors that are, in my judgment, cheating the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Let me give a few examples. A contractor is charging for 42,000 meals \na day they are serving to U.S. soldiers. It is discovered they are only \nserving 14,000 meals, overcharging by 28,000 meals a day. I don't know, \nmaybe you can miss a cheeseburger or two on the bill someplace. But how \ndo you overcharge for 28,000 meals a day?\n  An American contractor is paid to rehabilitate 140 Iraqi health \nclinics and gets paid over $100 million, paid for with American \ndollars. The money is gone, but there are no health clinics. I guess \nthere are maybe 20 of them with shoddy construction.\n  An Iraqi doctor who knows that an American contractor was paid to \nrehabilitate health clinics in rural areas goes to the Iraqi Health \nMinister and says: I would like to tour these clinics that the American \ntaxpayers paid to rehabilitate because health is such an important \nneed. The Interior Minister of Iraq said: You don't understand, most of \nthese are imaginary clinics.\n  I had a guy come to a hearing I held, and he saw $85,000 trucks being \nburned on the side of the road, left on the side of the road because \nthey didn't have a wrench to fix a flat tire. The road was safe, the \nonly reason they left the trucks by the side of the road was because \nthey could make a profit by buying another one. Mr. President, $85,000 \ntrucks torched because they had a plugged fuel pump. What is the big \ndeal about that? The contractor will simply reorder new trucks because \nthe American taxpayers are going to be stuck with that bill. It is a \ncost-plus contract.\n  How about $7,600 a month for leasing SUVs? How about $45 for a case \nof Coca-Cola? How long do we have to come to the floor of the Senate \nand talk about this unbelievable, utter waste of the American \ntaxpayers' dollars?\n  We had a man named Judge Radhi come to testify. I asked that he be \nallowed to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee. He came. \nHe was appointed by Paul Bremer to be the head of a Commission on \nPublic Integrity in Iraq. They tried to kill him three times because \nthe folks over there didn't like somebody looking over their shoulders.\n  He said they pursued thousands of cases of corruption; $18 billion \nhad been pilfered and wasted, most of it American money. He talked \nabout $3 billion spent by the former Defense Ministry of Iraq ordering \nairplanes that never arrived in Iraq because it is likely the money \nended up in a Swiss bank account.\n  Judge Radhi said, $18 billion he estimated was wasted, most of it \nAmerican money.\n  Does that surprise anybody? We lifted C-130 cargo loads of one-\nhundred-dollar bills out of this country to fly them to Iraq. In a war \nzone, you are distributing one-hundred-dollar bills out of the back of \npickup trucks. Is it any wonder this is the most waste, fraud, and \nabuse we have ever seen?\n  In 1940, at the start of the Second World War, Harry Truman, then \nserving in this body, helped create a bipartisan committee. It became \nknown as the Truman Committee. It cost $15,000 and saved $15 billion. \nThey did 60 hearings a year for 7 years--60 hearings a year for 7 \nyears. They issued subpoenas. When they saw waste, fraud, and abuse, \nthey stopped it. They were serious. It was a bipartisan investigative \ncommittee right here in this Chamber.\n  This war in Iraq has gone on 5 years. I have held hearing after \nhearing chronicling the waste, fraud, and abuse. And it is \nunbelievable.\n  We read that one of the largest contractors we have engaged in Iraq, \nthe Halliburton Corporation, has been paying 10,000 of their U.S. \nemployees through a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands that has no \nstaffing at all, just an office address. Why would they do that? Why \nwould they hire Americans and run their payroll through the Cayman \nIslands? So they don't have to pay payroll taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  When this supplemental comes to the floor of the Senate in the next \nweek or two, I am going to offer an amendment that says any contractor \ndoing that should not be getting any more contracts.\n  At some point, does anybody have the nerve to stand up and say this \nhas to stop? Is there at least a small group of people, perhaps a \nquorum, who would say this has to stop? What we should do and what I \nhave tried and I say with the support of Senator Reid--and I appreciate \nhis support--we have tried very hard to create a Truman-type committee \non behalf of the American taxpayers to say: Stop this waste, stop this \nfraud, stop this abuse.\n  We have been unable to do that in three votes in the Senate. I regret \nthat because the American taxpayer is being fleeced and American \nsoldiers are being disserved by this waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Let me mention one additional example, which may seem like a small \nmatter, but is symptomatic of a larger problem. Henry Bunting, a \nwonderful man who worked in Kuwait as a buyer for Halliburton \nCorporation, brought a towel to a hearing. He held it up. He said: We \nwere buying towels for American soldiers. Here is a towel I was \nsupposed to buy, a white towel. So I ordered white towels.\n  My supervisor said: You can't buy that white towel. You need to buy a \ntowel that has the logo of our company, embroidered in silk.\n  I said it will triple, quadruple the cost. The supervisor said: It \ndoesn't matter, it is a cost-plus contract. We will earn more money.\n  Unbelievable.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse came to testify. The price of her testimony was \nher job. She was the highest civilian official in the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers. She said this awarding of the LOGCAP Rio contracts was \nthe most blatant abuse of contracting authority she had seen in her \nentire career. For that it cost her job.\n  I have told my colleagues before, I called the general at home at \nnight who has since retired, who hired Bunnatine Greenhouse, who was \njudged to be one of the best contracting officials we ever had. I \ncalled him at home at night.\n  I said: General Ballard, tell me about Bunnatine Greenhouse. He said \nshe was tops and what happened to her was wrong, dreadfully wrong.\n  She blew the whistle on the good old boys network, and now her case \nis behind a shroud in the Defense Department like all the rest of these \nissues--under investigation, they say. When will the investigation be \ndone? When will it end?\n  Halliburton KBR was contracted to provide water to the military bases \nin Iraq. That was their job. A man named Ben who was in Iraq working \nfor Halliburton came and said: We were providing water but were not \nchecking the--were not testing the water.\n  It turns out the nonpotable water was more contaminated than raw \nwater from the Euphrates River. That is what our soldiers were \nshowering in, shaving with, and often brushing their teeth with.\n  Then I got hold of an internal Halliburton document--I believe it was \n21 pages--written by Will Granger, the man in charge of water quality \nin Iraq for Halliburton. He said this was a near miss. It could have \ncaused mass sickness and death. This was an internal document leaked to \nme from inside Halliburton, written by a man in charge of water in \nIraq: A near miss, could have caused sickness and death.\n  We had whistleblowers from inside the company say this is what \nhappened: Water more contaminated than\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\nraw water from the Euphrates River being sent to these camps. \nHalliburton said it didn't happen--despite the fact I had the \nevidence--didn't happen, never happened, not true. The U.S. Army said: \nDidn't happen, never happened. I did not understand that. I would have \nthought the U.S. Army would have been apoplectic on behalf of the \nhealth of its troops.\n  So I asked the inspector general: Do an investigation, will you, and \ntell me what the facts are.\n  The inspector general did the investigation and just finished a month \nand a half ago. Guess what? The whistleblowers were right. So why did \nthe U.S. Army declare to us it didn't? I understand the company \ndeciding it will not admit to anything. What about the U.S. Army? In \nfact, they sent a general to this Congress, to the Armed Services \nCommittee, to say these incidents never happened. Now we have an \ninspector general report that not only demonstrates that the general \ntestified inappropriately, was wrong, deceived the Congress, but that \nthe inspector general had provided that information to the Pentagon \nprior to them sending the general up here to tell us information that \nwas not accurate.\n  It just goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, we need to have a Truman committee. I know my message \nis tiresome to some, but it doesn't matter much to me. This Congress \nowes it to the American people to do what previous Congresses have done \nduring wartime, and that is properly investigate the waste, the fraud, \nand the abuse on the most significant expenditure of taxpayers' money \nthat has ever occurred ever in the history of this country for \ncontractors. We shoveled money out this door. It is unbelievable. And \nalmost no oversight.\n  I brought to the floor of the Senate many times a picture of a man \nwho testified with bricks of one-hundred-dollar bills wrapped in Saran \nWrap. He said it was the Wild West. We told contractors: Come to this \nbuilding and bring a bag because we pay in cash.\n  I described that in the context of a company called Custer Battles. \nTwo guys who had virtually no contracting experience in a very short \ntime got many millions of dollars worth of contracts. And they were \nthen found to have defrauded the Coalition Provisional Authority.\n  I came to the floor a week or two ago and said the New York Times did \nsome enterprising reporting--good for them, and I say to those \nreporters: You did some great work, work that probably could have and \nshould have been done by the Congress in the recent past.\n  I showed a picture of a man named Ephraim, 22 years old, and his 25-\nyear-old vice president who was a massage therapist--a 22-year-old CEO \nof a company and a 25-year-old massage therapist as the vice president. \nThey ran a company that was a shell corporation set up by the 22-year-\nold's dad some years ago out of an unmarked office in Miami Beach. They \ngot $300 million in contracts from the U.S. Department of the Army to \nprovide munitions and weapons to the Afghan army and police.\n  What ended up in Afghanistan was, in many cases, ammunition from the \nmid-1960s, manufactured by the Chinese in boxes that were taped and \ncoming apart. This was a company that got over $300 million.\n  Should somebody ask the U.S. Department of the Army and the \nSustainment Command of the Department of the Army in Illinois how on \nEarth did this happen? How did you think you would get by with this? \nHow are you going to explain this to the American taxpayers?\n  We desperately need to establish a Truman committee to investigate \nthis issue. The American taxpayers deserve no less, in my judgment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3389-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDIA MARKET CONCENTRATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to mention, this morning out of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, thanks to Senator Inouye's and Senator \nStevens' support of my legislation, we passed legislation that will \nveto a rule that was passed by the Federal Communications Commission \nthat allows for more consolidation in America's media.\n  The Federal Communications Commission decided they want more \nconcentration in the media, despite the fact that most of what \nAmericans hear, see, and read every single day is directed by about \nfive or six major corporations in America. They think we need more \nconcentration. So they passed a rule that says it is going to be OK to \nallow newspapers to buy television stations in the same city.\n  We have had a prohibition against that action for a while. It is \ncalled cross-ownership. They did their rule. The Chairman of the \nFederal Communications Commission was very anxious to get this rule \ndone and serve whatever master he was serving. They did their rule, but \ntoday we passed a veto resolution out of the Commerce Committee, a \ndisapproval of the rule by the Federal Communications Commission that \nwould allow greater concentration in the media.\n  The last thing we need is more concentration in the media. We have \nall these supporters that come to the Senate floor who say: What are \nyou talking about? We have all these new outlets. Go to the Internet. \nSee how many sites there are. Go to cable television. See how many \nchannels there are. I say: Yes, a lot of new choices but from the same \nventriloquist, the same source.\n  One guy testified before the Commerce Committee and said, for \nexample, on cable television in my office, 48 channels are on basic \ntier and 42 of those channels belong to the same five or six major \ncompanies. That bill will come to the floor of the Senate because it is \na privileged piece of legislation. My resolution of disapproval, passed \nby the Commerce Committee today, will come to the Senate as a \nprivileged resolution. It will be on the calendar now. I am going to \nconsult with Senator Reid, and I will visit with the minority, and find \na time to bring it up and have a vote to disapprove the rule that was \nenacted by the Federal Communications Commission, which, in my \njudgment, stands logic on its head.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3389-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3389-S3390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OIL MARKET SPECULATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the final matter I want to talk about \ntoday is this issue of the price of oil and the price of gasoline and \nexcessive speculation. There has been some discussion today about this, \nand I want to make this point.\n  We have seen a dramatic runup in the price of oil and, therefore, the \nprice of gasoline. There is no justification with respect to the \nfundamentals of oil and supply and demand for that. There is no \njustification for it at all, but something has changed in this country. \nWhat has changed is the futures market has become an orgy of \nspeculation.\n  Let me quote a man named Mr. Fadel Gheit, a top analyst from \nOppenheimer and Co. He has been in this business for 30 years. He said \nthis a couple of months ago.\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. Oil speculators include the largest financial \n     institutions in the world. I call it the world's largest \n     gambling hall. It's open 24/7. It's totally unregulated. This \n     is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit and \n     everybody's going 120 miles per hour.''\n\n  This is happening in the futures market. You need a futures market to \nhedge. You need it for liquidity. I understand that. What has happened \nto the futures market is pretty bizarre. We now see on the futures \nmarket 20 times the amount of oil bought and sold every day than is \nused every day. Twenty times more is bought and sold than is used. For \nthe first time, we see hedge funds up to their neck in the futures \nmarket. Is it because hedge funds love oil? No, they don't know \nanything about oil. Do they want oil delivered to their offices? Do \nthey want oil delivered to their homes? No. They never want to own any \noil. They want to buy things they will never get from people who never \nhad it. That is the way the futures market works. These people are \nspeculating. Hedge funds are neck deep speculating in oil futures, and \nfor the first time investment banks have joined them. So you now have \nbig investment banks and big hedge funds with a presence in the futures \nmarket like never before. They have all these commodity corners in \ntheir company now, and they are hiring more, and they are speculating \nat an unbelievable rate.\n  I am told, and I have read, that investment banks for the first time \nare\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\neven buying oil storage capability to buy oil and take it off the \nmarket. Why? To wait until it increases. So now we have oil upwards to \n$120 a barrel because we have so much rampant speculation or outright \ngambling in these markets.\n  What does that mean for the folks driving a Chevrolet down the road, \ngetting low on gas and trying to figure out how to get to a gas pump, \nand how to pay the bill when they get there? Well, the folks in the \nhedge funds, these folks in the investment banks on these commodity \nmarkets that are engaged in the 24/7 casinos, are going to the bank. \nMan, they are going to the bank big time. I am talking billions and \nbillions of dollars. It is pretty unbelievable. When you have a person \ndrive up to the gas pump and fill that car with gas, a portion of that \nmoney now goes to this carnival of speculation in the futures market to \nreward the speculators. A portion of it, of course, goes to the OPEC \ncartel too. These are folks who sit around in a closed room with a \nlocked door and make decisions about price and about production.\n  I might add, while I am at it, that Saudi Arabia, by the way, has \n800,000 barrels a day less production on the market than they did 2 \nyears ago--800,000 barrels a day, every day. That means a lot in terms \nof what might happen in that market.\n  So we have a lot of things going on here. What should we do about it? \nWell, in addition to all of that, the Bush administration is deciding \nthey want to stick, and they are sticking, 60,000 to 70,000 barrels of \noil underground every single day in something called the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. We have an SPR to save for a national emergency. \nWell, they are buying oil at $118 a barrel coming off the Gulf of \nMexico as a royalty in kind transfers. They are taking $118-a-barrel \noil and putting it in the ground, 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day.\n  With oil at record highs, it is Byzantine to see this administration \nsaying we have to do more to fill the SPR. This is at a time when the \nStrategic Reserve is 97 percent filled. So they take oil out of the \nsupply, which puts upward pressure on oil and gas.\n  When the supplemental appropriations bill comes to the floor of the \nSenate, I intend to offer that amendment as well, to stop putting oil \nunderground in SPR when oil is above $75 a barrel. I mean, this doesn't \ntake a reservoir of common sense. It just takes a few grains of common \nsense from somebody who might actually help to fix this problem.\n  What I also want to do is to increase the margin requirements on the \nexchange. If you buy stock on margin, you pay a 50-percent margin \nrequirement to buy stock. If you want to control oil by going into the \nfutures market for oil, you pay 5 to 7 percent. You pay a 50-percent \nmargin for stock, but 5 to 7 percent for oil. If you want to control \n$100,000 worth of oil, it will cost you $5,000 to $7,000. That doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  That encourages speculation. That encourages the speculation that \npushes the runup of these prices. I believe the margin requirement \nought to be at least 25 percent at this point, during this period of \naggressive speculation. So I am putting together a piece of legislation \non that as well.\n  You know, I want this country to develop an energy policy that makes \nus much less dependent on foreign sources of oil, engages in much more \nconservation, and much more efficiency. We should produce more. I am \none of the four Senators who helped pass the legislation finally that \nopened up Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006. So I believe in \nadditional production. I believe we ought to conserve more. I believe \nwe need more efficiency, and I believe we need to pay much more \nattention to renewable energy.\n\n  All those things are important. All of them are important. But right \nat the moment we have a circumstance where we have an administration \nsticking oil under the ground at the wrong time, which puts upward \npressure on oil and gas. We also have hedge funds and investment banks \nhip deep in the futures market speculating and making billions of \ndollars on speculating. At the same time, they are driving up the price \nof oil and gas for American families and doing great damage to this \ncountry's economy.\n  It is not just the family, and it is not just the business. It is not \njust the truckers and not just the airlines that are hurt. This country \nis experiencing significant economic damage as a result of the runup in \nthese prices. I think there are reasons for us to come to the floor on \nan urgent basis and take obvious steps to deal with it. I have \nmentioned several, and there are more. But I only want to make the \npoint that this is not some passing fancy that is going to be a magnet \nfor a lot of discussion. This is a very serious, real problem that is \ndoing significant damage to this country's economy.\n  There is a lot to do next week and the week after, and I will be \nintroducing some additional legislation. I will be anxiously awaiting \nthe appropriations supplemental legislation. When the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill comes to this floor, either in the \nAppropriations Committee or on this floor, we must be given the \nopportunity--and will be given the opportunity--to offer the kind of \namendments I have suggested. This will include an amendment that stops \nthe putting of oil underground in the SPR at a time when oil is priced \nat $118 a barrel. This is just one of the obvious things we can do to \nstop penalizing American consumers and damaging this country's economy.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3390-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3390-S3391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FLORIDA PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate on \ntwo subjects. I will be brief.\n  The task has fallen to this Senator from Florida to continue to try \nto press the chairman of my party and its executive committee, in the \nform of the Democratic National Committee, to recognize the votes of \n1.75 million Florida Democrats who went to the polls on January 29, a \nturnout of twice any previous turnout in a Presidential primary, to \nexpress their preference for the nominee of our party. They did so in \nthose huge numbers, they did so in a duly called election by Florida \nlaw, which caused all of the rhubarb in the first place because the \nlegislature of the State of Florida moved ahead of the date set by the \ntwo parties after which they would then be punished by the party rules.\n  Both party rules provided that the two parties would be punished if \nthey moved earlier than the date of February 5 for their primary. The \nparty rules in both parties said that half of the delegates would be \ntaken away. Indeed, that is what the Republican National Committee did. \nBut not so the Democratic National Committee, for they decided to take \na full pound of flesh and take away all the delegates and say the \nelection didn't count.\n  There are some people who are thinking, even though they felt \npassionately about it at the time, the way all this worked out, since \nwe don't have a nominee yet at an early day like the Republican \nnominee, I think some people are thinking maybe this should have been \nworked out a long time ago, such as last summer, before this ever came \nto a head.\n  But it is what it is, and all the attempts at finding a compromise \nthat can seat the Florida delegation at the convention have all come to \nnaught because of the inability of the two candidacies to come to a \nconclusion as to what they would be able to accept.\n  The bottom line is that seating Florida, whether you seat them \naccording to the DNC rules, taking away half the delegates, or seating \nthe whole delegation, advantages one candidacy and it disadvantages the \nother candidacy. As a practical matter, I think it is going to be \ndifficult to get an accommodation and agreement to do it.\n  But I want everybody to understand that the Democratic National \nCommittee can take away delegates--they have that authority. But the \nDemocratic National Committee cannot deny the certification of a legal \nelection by Florida voters. You can't deny that. It is a fact. It is a \ncertified election under Florida law. That was a\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nlegal election under Florida law and it was a clean election under \nFlorida law. The Democratic National Committee cannot deny that \ncertification of that legal election.\n  Sadly, one of the byproducts of all this is that in listening to what \nthe latest Gallup poll says, one-half of all the Democrats in the \nUnited States think all of this fracas is hurting the party--one-half \nof all the Democrats in the country. When you combine that latest \nGallup Poll with the fact that months ago a poll in Florida showed that \n22 percent of Independent Florida voters, 22 percent of Independents in \nFlorida, would be less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee in \nNovember because of the way that Florida is being treated by the \nDemocratic National Committee: Democratic National Committee, you \nbetter wake up. We have a problem on our hands.\n  What we ought to be doing is looking at November. As the old \ncolloquialism says, we better watch out or we are going to be cutting \noff our nose to spite our face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3391-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EQUAL PAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise today, on the 93rd anniversary of the \nonset of the Armenian genocide, to honor the victims of this terrible \ntragedy and to reiterate my unwavering support for the United States \nGovernment to officially recognize as genocide the series of atrocities \ncarried out against the Armenian population by the Ottoman Empire \nbeginning on April 24, 1915.\n  It truly saddens me that after 93 years, the United States has failed \nto acknowledge the Armenian genocide for what it was. Between 1915 and \n1923, the Ottoman Empire forcibly deported around 2 million Armenians, \nof whom 1.5 million men, women, and children were killed. Those \nfortunate enough to survive the massacres, forced marches, and \ndeliberate starvation, were ejected from their homeland.\n  In response to reports of these horrific events, U.S. Ambassador to \nthe Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau, Sr. explicitly condemned the \npolicy of the Government of the Ottoman Empire as ``a campaign of race \nextermination.'' Moreover, Ambassador Morgenthau was praised by U.S. \nSecretary of State Robert Lansing for his efforts ``to stop Armenian \npersecution.''\n  Perhaps more significant to the Chamber in which I stand today was \nthe passage of S. Con. Res. 12 on February 9, 1916. This prescient \npiece of legislation not only acknowledged that a colossal tragedy had \nensued in the midst of the Great War, but also resolved that the \nPresident of the United States ``designate a day on which the citizens \nof this country may give expression to their sympathy by contributing \nfunds now being raised for the relief of the Armenians,'' who, at that \ntime, were enduring ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering'' at \nthe hands of the Ottoman leadership.\n  Less than 4 years later, while the Armenian genocide continued, the \nSenate would also pass S. Res. 359, which stated, in part, that recent \ncongressional testimony ``clearly established the truth of the reported \nmassacres and other atrocities from which the Armenian people have \nsuffered.''\n  I say to my friends in the Senate, given how our esteemed colleagues \nof the past reflected on this terrible tragedy, I cannot help but think \nthat they would have surely labeled these atrocities as genocide if \nonly the word had been coined. The United States has a rich history of \ndefending human rights, standing up for the oppressed, and speaking the \ntruth about genocide. However, in spite of support from Members of \nCongress and leaders in the Armenian community, the official policy of \nthe executive branch of the United States still does not recognize the \nArmenian genocide.\n  I am so proud that my home state of Nevada, with its vibrant \nArmenian-American community, and 40 other U.S. States have, by \nlegislation or proclamation, already recognized the Armenian Genocide. \nIn fact, on April 11, 2000, former Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn \nproclaimed April 24, 2000, as a day of remembrance of ``The First \nGenocide of the 20th Century.''\n  I would also like to congratulate the Armenian-Americans of southern \nNevada for planning yet another successful Armenian Genocide \nCommemoration event on the campus of the University of Nevada-Las \nVegas. It is so wonderful to see this community from my home county \ncome together each year to honor the survivors and their deceased \nbrethren, and I wish my Armenian friends in Nevada the best of luck \nwith this year's commemoration and those for years to come. May God \nbless them and all of those who fight on their behalf.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 93rd \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  On April 24, 1915, an ancient nation faced extermination when \nofficials of the Ottoman Government initiated a series of raids in \nwhich hundreds of Armenians were arrested and subsequently deported or \nkilled. Isolated incidents of brutality had occurred before, but sadly \nthis event marked the beginning of a campaign of murder, deportation, \nand forced starvation. When the violence ultimately ended, as many as \n1.5 million Armenians had died and 500,000 were exiled. Armenians all \nbut disappeared from land their people had occupied for centuries.\n  The American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time was the \ndistinguished Henry Morgenthau who described the horrors perpetrated \nagainst the Armenians as the ``murder of a nation.''\n  Just this week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I have \nthe honor to chair, had a hearing on the systematic murder of innocents \nin Darfur. The incident serves as an important reminder that an open \ndiscussion of the Armenian genocide is critical. Since the 1915 ethnic \ncleansing, the murder by a government of its own citizens has occurred \nagain and again.\n  It is depressing to think that human beings have not learned their \nlesson. The whole world is diminished, wounded, and made poorer by such \ntragedies and we must not forget them if we hope to prevent them. The \ncommemoration of this act of brutality and systematic murder 93 years \nago is important and relevant not only for the survivors and their \ndescendents, but for humanity as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3391-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3391-S3392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAN CHERRY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend, Dan Cherry. A retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general, Dan \nCherry is a respected Kentuckian and a man of character.\n  During his time in the Air Force, General Cherry volunteered for \ncombat duty in 1966 and 1971, flying over 295 missions, most of them \nover North Vietnam. On one of those missions in April 1972, General \nCherry shot down the plane of a Vietnamese soldier, Nguyen Hong My.\n  General Cherry always wondered what happened to the pilot that he \nshot down, and he recently was given the chance to meet him. General \nCherry and Hong My met face to face in Vietnam almost 36 years to the \nday of General Cherry's shooting down Hong My's MiG-21 fighter.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Brigadier \nGeneral Dan Cherry, who through his actions of patronage and \nreconciliation has shown us what it means to be a true American, and \nKentuckian. Recently\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nthe Bowling Green Daily Newspaper published a story about General \nCherry and the remarkable story of his journey to Vietnam. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Bowling Green Daily News, Apr. 13, 2008]\n\n          Vietnam Vet Reunites With Pilot He Shot Down in '72\n\n                            (By Jim Gaines)\n\n       Bowling Green, KY.--On April 6, Dan Cherry and Nguyen Hong \n     My were back in the air near Hanoi, capital of Vietnam.\n       Almost 36 years before--on April 16, 1972--Cherry shot down \n     My's MiG-21 fighter in the same area.\n       My parachuted as his plane crashed, breaking his arms in \n     the process; and now Cherry's plane, an F4D Phantom II, is \n     restored to its wartime colors and parked in the Aviation \n     Heritage Park on Three Springs Road.\n       Last week, the two men flew together past the scene of \n     their earlier encounter, chatting in the comfortable seats of \n     a jetliner on their way to My's home.\n       ``It was, I guess, the most amazing experience I've ever \n     had in my lifetime,'' Cherry said.\n       Cherry volunteered for combat duty in Southeast Asia in \n     1966, then for a second tour in 1971. He flew 295 missions, \n     most of them over North Vietnam. He retired as a brigadier \n     general in the U.S. Air Force and went on to a career in \n     Kentucky state government and managing the Kentucky TriModal \n     Transpark.\n       But, Cherry said, he often wondered what happened to the \n     pilot he shot down. When the Aviation Heritage Park was in \n     its planning stages 2\\1/2\\ years ago, one of its local \n     backers half-jokingly suggested trying to find the MiG pilot.\n       Cherry worked through friends to contact a reunion show on \n     Vietnamese TV, which worked through the Ministry of Defense \n     to identify Nguyen Hung My.\n       In December, a producer of the show--called ``As If We \n     Never Parted''--e-mailed Cherry with the news and asked if \n     he'd appear on the show.\n       After flying to Vietnam for his first visit since the war, \n     he went to the TV studio April 5. According to Cherry, the \n     show's host introduced him and told the audience about his \n     life. After showing pictures of Cherry's family, she \n     introduced My.\n       Cherry said he was nervous, wondering how he'd be received. \n     But My smiled as he came out and shook Cherry's hand. Through \n     an interpreter, My said he was glad to meet Cherry. The \n     anchor told about My's life, his four years of flight \n     training in the Soviet Union and his war service.\n       Thanh Nien News, a major newspaper in Ho Chi Minh City \n     which publishes in Vietnamese and English, reported on the \n     pilots' meeting. According to that story, My said he'd never \n     thought about looking for the pilot who once shot him down. \n     After the war, he studied English and finance, and worked for \n     an insurance company, the paper said.\n       My flew for two more years after recovering from his bail-\n     out injuries, speaks Chinese and Russian, has a great sense \n     of humor, and is obviously highly respected by friends and \n     family, Cherry said.\n       After the show, the two sat down backstage and talked about \n     flying and their respective families.\n       ``We hit it off really well,'' Cherry said.\n       Later, they and the TV staff went to a rooftop restaurant \n     in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. Over dinner, My asked if Cherry \n     would visit his home in Hanoi. Cherry--already planning to go \n     to Hanoi the next day as a tourist--thought My meant some \n     indefinite time in the future; it turned out he meant the \n     next day. When Cherry agreed, My changed his own travel \n     schedule so they could be on the same flight.\n       My's house, it turned out, was within walking distance of \n     Cherry's hotel. That night he and his friends Larry Bailey \n     and John Fleck made their way to My's house along streets \n     teeming with motor scooters, Cherry said.\n       They had dinner with My's family, and Cherry got to hold \n     his former opponent's 1-year-old grandson, he said.\n       ``It was just a tremendous experience to be welcomed so \n     completely,'' Cherry said. ``I've made a good friend in Mr. \n     Hong My.''\n       In return, he gave My a bottle of bourbon and invited him \n     to visit Bowling Green, perhaps later this year, he said.\n       My offered to guide them around the city the next day, \n     showing up at 8 a.m. in a car with his son-in-law and friend. \n     He took them to one site after another, including a number of \n     military museums that ordinary tourists wouldn't get to see, \n     Cherry said. They saw past displays of Soviet-built fighter \n     planes, including MiG-21s like the one My flew in 1972, he \n     said.\n       Cherry also visited the ``Hanoi Hilton''--the building made \n     notorious as a prison for American pilots shot down over \n     North Vietnam. It's now a museum. Most of the exhibits, \n     though, are devoted to the Vietnamese who were held there \n     during the decades of French rule, Cherry said; there's only \n     one small room describing its time as a prison for Americans.\n       The overall impression he had of Vietnam is that what the \n     Vietnamese call the ``American War'' has been put far behind \n     them, he said.\n       ``They're moving on to the future. They don't hold any \n     grudges,'' Cherry said.\n       My also asked for help with one task: He shot down an \n     American plane, too, but believes that pilot was killed, \n     Cherry said. So he asked if Cherry could help him find that \n     pilot's family. He would like to express his respect and \n     condolences, Cherry said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3392-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3392-S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER AND SON TO WORK DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, April 24 is Take Your Daughters and Sons \nto Work Day, which is a great opportunity for people who are in a \nposition to do so to give their kids a better idea of what they do for \na living. In my office, we had a short social time this morning to \nallow the children of staff members to gather and talk about their \nexperience. Participation in Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day \ncan be fun for the parents and the children. But at its heart, this day \nis a part of a broad effort to reach pay equity for women.\n  On Tuesday, we marked Equal Pay Day, the point in 2008 when the \naverage woman's wages finally catch up with what the average man earned \nin 2007. The numbers are sobering.\n  Equal pay has been the law since 1963. But today, 45 years later, \nwomen are still paid less than men--even when women have similar \neducation, skills, and experience. While women's wages have risen in \nall States, in inflation-adjusted dollars, since 1989, the typical \nfull-time woman worker does not make as much as the typical man in any \nState. At the present rate of progress, it will take 50 years to close \nthe wage gap nationwide.\n  In 2007, women were paid 77 cents for every dollar men received. That \nis $23 less for every $100 worth of work women do--$23 less to spend on \ngroceries, housing, child care, and other expenses. Nationwide, working \nfamilies lose $200 billion of income annually to the wage gap.\n  Over a lifetime of work, the 23 cents on the dollar women are losing \nadds up. The average 25-year-old working woman will lose more than \n$523,000 to unequal pay during her working life. These figures are even \nworse for women of color. And because women are paid less now, they \nhave less money to set aside for retirement, and they will earn lower \npensions than men.\n  Part of the motivation behind Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work \nDay is to expose children of both genders to professional fields that \nhistorically have been dominated by men. This day is one of many \ninitiatives developed to encourage girls and young women in their \neducation and professional journeys. Professional and student \norganizations, such as the Society of Women Engineers, offer a support \nnetwork for those young women who are making their mark in professions \nthat historically have not seen many women.\n  Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day can help both girls and boys \nsee the career opportunities that may be open to them if they stay in \nschool, set goals, and study. I commend the employers and employees who \nare able to participate today. I would also like to congratulate and \nencourage the children who are sizing up options for their future \ncareers. Let us keep in mind today that we need to keep working to \nenable every child to achieve his or her full potential, and we need to \nensure that women are fully and fairly compensated for all the work \nthey do.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise in honor of today's Take Our \nDaughters and Sons to Work Day when, over the past 15 years, \nindividuals, families and workplaces have joined in expanding \nopportunities and transforming the lives of millions of girls and boys \nboth nationally and internationally. I want to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss the importance of family in creating an active and resourceful \ncitizenship and workforce for the future. As our Nation continues in \nits historical role as a melting pot, the importance of international \nadoption in the fabric of American families continues to grow. Mr. Paul \nHanly Furfey stated that ``The first, the most fundamental right of \nchildhood is the right to be loved. The child comes into the world \nalone, defenseless, without resource. Only love can stand between his \nhelplessness and the savagery of a harsh world.'' Families created or \nexpanded by international adoption are unique and special, open to \ncultural differences and\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nsharing in the common elements of mankind, compassion and love.\n  The United Nations Population Division gathered data from more than \n100 countries and found that in a world of 2.2 billion children under \nthe age of 18, fewer than 12 per 100,000 are being adopted. In other \nwords, in a total global population of 6.5 billion, there are only \nabout 260,000 adoptions of all kinds annually including those within \ncountries, across borders and of step children. In the United States we \nhave seen an upward trend in international adoptions from 7,083 in 1990 \nto 17,718 in 2000 and over 20,000 international adoptions in 2007.\n  I have received several letters of concern from many Arkansans \ninquiring as to what the U.S. Government is doing to help these \nchildren find their way to loving homes in Arkansas. In fact, the \nUnited States has taken several important steps to protect the rights \nof the child and to assist families in the international adoption \nprocess. From a global level, the Convention on Protection of Children \nand Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption--Hague Adoption \nConvention--a broad multilateral treaty, was signed by the United \nStates in March of 1994. In 2000, the Senate and the House passed the \nIntercountry Adoption Act of 2000 to implement the Convention. In 2006, \nthe Department of State issued the final rule on the Accreditation and \nApproval of Agencies and Persons to implement the Convention and the \nIntercountry Adoption Act.\n  Legislation to help adoptive families pay for expenses associated \nwith adoption procedures was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 \nto make improvements to the Internal Revenue Code to add a two-part \nadoption assistance tax relief program. The tax relief for adoption \nexpenses has helped many families to be able to afford the financial \ncosts of the actual adoption process. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity now issues immigrant visas to children entering the United \nStates with adoptive parents who are U.S. citizens under the I-800 Visa \nProgram, making them U.S. citizens when they reach U.S. soil.\n  On my part, I have signed several letters to international leaders \nconcerning the importance of transparency in the adoption process in \nall countries, particularly in the signatories of the Hague Adoption \nConvention.\n  Our recognition of today's Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day \nprovides us with a great opportunity to recognize the unique role and \ncontributions of adoptive families in our country. Families created \nthrough adoption are special. They go through so much time and energy \nto find each other. We must celebrate these families who through \nperseverance and determination become whole and provide a loving \nenvironment for our next generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3393-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EXPANDED DNA COLLECTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was concerned to learn from the \nnewspapers last week that the Federal Government is getting ready to \npublish a rule sanctioning the collection of DNA samples from all \ncitizens arrested for Federal crimes and from many people detained as \nillegal immigrants. These samples may even be kept permanently as part \nof the Government's DNA database even if a person is ultimately \nexonerated.\n  I have long supported the analysis of DNA evidence to catch the \nguilty and exonerate the innocent. In 2000, I introduced the Innocence \nProtection Act, which included the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA \nTesting Grant Program for defendants. This program, where appropriate, \ngave defendants access to the postconviction DNA testing necessary to \nprove their innocence in those cases where the system got it grievously \nwrong. As a former prosecutor, I was acutely aware that DNA testing \ncould help prevent both the conviction of innocent defendants, and the \ncriminal justice nightmare of the real wrongdoer remaining undiscovered \nand possibly at large.\n  In 2004, Congress passed the Innocence Protection Act as an important \npart of the Justice for All Act. Congress recognized the need for \nimportant changes in criminal justice forensics despite resistance from \nthe current administration. The Justice for All Act authorized several \nother important programs to encourage the use of DNA evidence, which I \nstrongly supported, notably including the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog \nGrant Program to eliminate the nationwide backlog of rape kits and \nother evidence awaiting DNA testing in crime labs around the country. \nThat important program has helped law enforcement to find the \nperpetrators of terrible crimes throughout the country and to ease the \nordeal that crime victims go through.\n  But DNA testing, like any powerful tool--and particularly any \npowerful tool in the hands of the government must be used carefully. If \nabused, it can infringe on the privacy and civil liberties of Americans \nwhile doing little to prevent crime. I am concerned that the policy \njust announced may do exactly that.\n  When Senator Kyl proposed the legislation that formed the basis for \nthis policy, I said that it raised serious privacy concerns. Right now, \na person's DNA can be collected immediately upon arrest, and it can be \nused immediately to search the DNA indexes for a possible ``hit.'' But \nit cannot be added to the Federal index unless and until the person has \nbeen formally charged with a crime. This new policy allows DNA to be \nentered for those who have been arrested but not charged.\n  This change adds little or no value for law enforcement, while \nintruding on the privacy rights of people who are, in our system, \npresumed innocent. It creates an incentive for pretextual arrests and \nwill likely have a disproportionate impact on minorities and the poor. \nThis policy may also make it harder for innocent people to have their \nDNA expunged from government databases.\n  Since I first spoke out against this provision in 2005, we have only \nseen more examples of abuses of power by this administration, including \nthe Justice Department's improper firing of prosecutors for political \nreasons and the FBI's abuse of national security letter power given in \nthe PATRIOT Act. In this light, the added power to collect and keep DNA \ninformation from potentially innocent people gives even more cause for \nconcern.\n  I will study the proposed rules and policy carefully, and the \nJudiciary Committee will perform careful oversight of its \nimplementation. We must ensure that DNA evidence is used aggressively \nand efficiently to make us safer, but also that it is used in a careful \nand appropriate way that secures our rights and increases our \nconfidence in our justice system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3393-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3393-S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL CHILD CARE WORTHY WAGE DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support a resolution by \nSenator Menendez supporting National Child Care Worthy Wage Day. I hope \nthat it will shine a brighter light on the many challenges facing the \nearly childhood education and care community and the importance of \nattracting and retaining excellent childcare workers.\n  Across the country today, nearly two-thirds of children under the age \nof 5 are in some form of nonparental care while their parents are at \nwork and more and more research emphasizes that learning begins at \nbirth. The quality of early care that children receive has a profound \nimpact on the rest of their lives.\n  Children in high-quality early care and education programs are 30 \npercent more likely to graduate from high school and twice as likely to \ngo to college. They are also 40 percent less likely to be held back a \ngrade or need expensive special education programs.\n  Childcare is particularly effective for at-risk students. Important \nstudies, including the research of both Nobel Laureate Economist James \nHeckman and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, show that \nquality early care and education can break the cycle of poverty and \ncrime. Heckman's survey of at-risk boys who receive quality early \neducation found that less than 10 percent of boys who participate will \nbe convicted of a crime and less than 2 percent will end up on \nwelfare--rates significantly lower than for those who do not receive \nsuch support.\n  The key to assuring quality early childhood education and care for \nour youth is access to a highly qualified educator or caregiver. \nDespite the obvious importance of their work, however,\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nchild care providers are underpaid, unsupported and undervalued.\n  These providers are responsible for the social, emotional and mental \ndevelopment of the children in their care. They teach skills that young \nchildren need in order to be ready to read and learn when they go to \nschool. They help young children learn about the world around them and \nhow to interact with others. Yet the average salary of an early care \nand education workers is $18,820, and less than a third of them have \nhealth insurance.\n  In Massachusetts, those numbers are only marginally better--childcare \nworkers are paid a little over $10 an hour and earn $22,760 annually. \nBy comparison, registered nurses make $37,511 a year, police officers \nearn $37,078, and K through 12 teachers earn $32,306.\n  The story of Melvina Vandross is typical. She has spent the last 20 \nyears caring for children in poor families in New York City. Due to the \nlack of sufficient Federal subsidies, she makes less than $19,000 a \nyear in one of the world's most expensive cities. She has no health \ninsurance, and could not afford to get her son the tutor he needed to \nsucceed in school. Her commitment to the futures of some of the \nNation's least fortunate children has made it nearly impossible for her \nto provide for herself and her family.\n  Melvina's story is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that Head Start \nteachers in Montana qualify for Habitat for Humanity homes. The men and \nwomen who shape the lives of our Nation's children deserve fair wages \nand benefits. The sacrifice we are asking of them for their \nindispensible work is too high.\n  Inadequate wages and benefits have made it difficult to recruit and \nretain qualified childcare providers. Turnover rates are going through \nthe roof. Almost 30 percent of child care providers leave the field \nevery year. Neither their wages nor their turnaround rates are \nacceptable. If we want our children to be cared for by qualified \nproviders who have a good education and sound understanding of child \ndevelopment, we must see that they are fairly compensated and \nsupported, commensurate with their contribution to our national, civic \nand economic well-being. They are indeed deserving of a worthy wage for \ntheir worthy work that is so important for the Nation's future. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important resolution. We owe it to the \nNation's childcare providers, and we owe it to our Nation's children \nand their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3394-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD MALARIA DAY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, April 25 is World Malaria Day. That is the \nday that the world pauses to acknowledge that over a million people a \nyear die of a disease borne by mosquitoes, a disease that we know how \nto prevent, a disease that we know how to treat. The most vulnerable \nare children under the age of 5; every 30 seconds a child dies of \nmalaria. Pregnant women are also at high risk; 10,000 expectant mothers \nperish each year from the disease. Malaria exacts an enormous economic \nand social toll as well, costing the poorest countries in the world \nbillions of dollars each year in lost productivity, working days, \nrevenue, and investment. With global weather patterns changing, malaria \nis spreading further, reaching areas that were previously unaffected.\n  Last month, the Foreign Relations Committee approved a bipartisan \nbill that could, over the course of time, help to save millions of \nlives by providing people with the means to prevent and treat malaria. \nI am proud to have sponsored this bill, along with Senator Lugar and \nour other colleagues. This legislation, S. 2731, the Tom Lantos and \nHenry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, authorizes up to \n$5 billion over the next 5 years to combat malaria, a dramatic increase \nin resources. It also formally establishes the position of a global \nmalaria coordinator to oversee U.S. programs and strengthens U.S. \nparticipation in the multilateral global fund to fight AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria. These efforts will build on the dramatic \nearly success of the President's malaria initiative, which was launched \n3 years ago by President Bush. Already, under this initiative, the \nisland of Zanzibar has witnessed a 95 percent reduction in infection \nrates among children. Through bednets, spraying of homes, and providing \ndrugs, we can replicate that success on a much broader scale.\n  Similar legislation has passed the House of Representatives, and our \nbill received a strong vote of support in committee here. It is my hope \nthat the Senate will soon take up S. 2731, that we will debate whatever \ndifferences we may have and vote on it, and that the President will be \nable to sign it into law well in advance of the G-8 meeting in July. If \nso, he will be in an excellent position to help convince other \ncountries to undertake similar commitments. Even more important, we \nwill let the people of Africa and other hard-hit areas of the globe \nknow that the United States is sustaining the commitments that it first \nmade in 2003 when Congress passed the original United States Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3394-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DENIM DAY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize April 28, \n2008, as the first annual ``Denim Day'' in New Jersey.\n  Each year, Denim Day is observed in communities across the country to \nraise awareness and educate the public about rape and sexual assault. \nThe observance was created in response to an appalling 1998 decision of \nthe Italian Supreme Court. In that decision, the court overturned a \nrape conviction because the victim was wearing tight jeans at the time \nof the attack and must have helped her rapist remove them. Women and \nmen around the world were rightly outraged by the verdict, and wearing \njeans on Denim Day has become an international symbol of protest, \ncalling attention to the horrible crime of rape and the destructive \nattitudes that prevent sexual assault victims from receiving justice.\n  Every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is sexually assaulted. \nDespite its prevalence, sexual assault is one of the most underreported \ncrimes in the world, meaning many attackers never spend a day in prison \nfor their offenses. Denim Day in New Jersey will send a strong and \npowerful message that sexual assault is always wrong.\n  I hope this observance will encourage more sexual assault victims to \ncome forward and hold their attacker accountable, as well as provide \nsome comfort to the victims of sexual assault, who will know that they \nare not alone.\n  Once again, I would like to recognize April 28, 2008, as ``Denim \nDay'' in New Jersey and reiterate my strong support for observing this \nimportant day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3394-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3394-S3395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Corporal Kyle Weston Wilks\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, I wish today to strongly support the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which would clarify the laws against pay \ndiscrimination. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy, chairman of the \nHealth, Employment, Labor and Pensions Committee, for his leadership on \nthe bill. He has been a tireless champion for civil rights and I \napplaud his work.\n  Mr. President, we as Americans are bound by a powerful idea--a \nrevolutionary idea--that our nation is a work in progress. It is an \nidea etched in the words of the Constitution: ``to form a more perfect \nunion.'' It is an idea that has inspired some of our Nation's greatest \nachievements--abolishing slavery, banning segregation, and expanding \nvoting rights. It is an idea that brings the best out of our public \nservice.\n  This week in the Senate we have an opportunity to take another \nimportant step along our path of progress--to make our union more \nperfect.\n  It is no secret that pay gaps exist in our country. Gender, race, \nnational origin, age, disability, or religion should not have any \neffect on a worker's pay. But, sadly, they do. Nationally, women earn \n77 cents for every dollar that men earn. In Colorado, women earn 79 \ncents for every dollar that men earn. The inequities are even clearer \nwhen you break the numbers in Colorado down by ethnicity. On average, \nAfrican-American women earn 61.2 percent of what White men earn. Asian-\nAmerican women earn 68.4 percent; Hispanic women earn 52.4 percent; and \nNative American/Alaskan Native women only earn 54.7 percent of what \nWhite men earn.\n  These pay disparities persist partly because women still occupy fewer \nhigh-paying jobs than men. But they also persist because of continued \npay discrimination in the workplace. We have laws on the books to make \npay discrimination illegal, but those laws can be improved.\n  Lilly Ledbetter's case is a classic, and tragic, example. Ms. \nLedbetter worked for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Gadsden, \nAL, for 19 years. She was a manager, a position predominately occupied \nby men at the company. After early retirement, Ms. Ledbetter learned, \nfrom an anonymous note, that male managers at the company were making \n20 to 40 percent more than she was making in the same job.\n  So Ms. Ledbetter took Goodyear to court. The jury found that the \ncompany violated her rights under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. They awarded her back pay and damages.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, however, reversed the \ndistrict court decision. They said that Ms. Ledbetter filed her case \ntoo late. They said she needed to file her complaint within 180 days \nafter the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\n  Rightly, Ms. Ledbetter appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In its 5-\nto-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the 180-day statute of \nlimitations begins when the original discriminatory act occurs. Whether \nthe worker even knew that the discriminatory decision was made is of no \nconsequence. Whether they were discriminated against for 1 or 20 years \nis also insignificant under the Court's majority decision.\n  It is critical to understand the profound impact of the Court's \ndecision. If an employee cannot challenge a discriminatory paycheck \nbeyond the 180 days that the employer made the discriminatory decision, \ncompanies that discriminate cannot be held accountable for their \nactions. Six months after a discriminatory action, the bad actor is in \nthe clear. This was certainly not the intent of Congress when it \nenacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ginsburg raised a good question \nand a matter of common sense. How was Ms. Ledbetter supposed to know, \nand therefore complain, when she was first given a lower raise than her \nmale counterparts? Goodyear, like many employers, kept salaries and \nraises confidential.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would correct this injustice. The \nbill would amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other \ncivil rights laws to make clear that the 180-day statute of limitations \non a pay discrimination claim, based on gender, race, national origin, \nreligion, age or disability, would restart every time an employee \nreceives any wages or benefits affected by the discriminatory act. This \nwas the law of the land for decades, with the exception of three \nStates, until the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Ledbetter v. Goodyear.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act should receive the unanimous support \nof this body. We should all agree on the principle of `equal pay for \nequal work.' We should all agree that pay discrimination has no place \nin a 21st century America. And we should all agree that when there is a \nclear problem with the existing law, we should correct it.\n  We have come a long way over the last 2\\1/2\\ centuries toward opening \nthe doors of opportunity to every American. But ours is a nation still \nin progress, and our Union can still be perfected.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe Fair Pay Restoration Act, S. 1843,--and I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bipartisan measure, introduced by Senator \nKennedy and supported by 40 of my colleagues in the Senate. This bill \nwould rightly provide victims of workplace gender discrimination with \nthe reasonable timeframe they deserve to file discrimination suits \nunder Federal law--while restoring longstanding precedent that was \nregrettably reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court last year.\n  I firmly believe that America should be a global leader on issues \nrelated to gender discrimination and equal pay, but with its decision \nin Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the Supreme Court \ntelegraphed entirely the wrong message to the rest of the world about \nthe value of equal pay for equal work--and ignored the realities of pay \ndiscrimination. Furthermore, with the economy in crisis, gas prices \nsky-high, and housing values falling, it is all the more critical we \nnot lose vital ground on fair pay.\n  It is no secret that women play a substantial leadership role in our \nNation--we are business leaders, entrepreneurs, politicians, mothers, \nand much more. But regrettably, wage discrimination still exists and \nhas remained constant for many years. In 1963, the year of the Equal \nPay Act's passage, full-time working women were paid 59 cents on \naverage to the dollar received by men. In 2004, more than 40 years \nlater, women were only paid 77 cents for every dollar earned by men.\n  What is even more troubling is that, according to a National Academy \nof Sciences report, between one-third and one-half of the wage \ndisparities between men and women cannot adequately be explained by \ndifferences in experience, education, or other legitimate \nqualifications. And notably, this wage discrimination exists despite \nthe passage of the Equal Pay Act that made it illegal to pay women less \nthan men for performing equal work.\n  Wage discrimination also continues to exist despite the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, which outlawed discrimination in employment and wages on \nthe basis of sex, race, color, religion, and national origin. This \npernicious injustice continues despite Congress passing the 1991 Civil \nRights Act, which I strongly supported, along with most of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the political aisle.\n  As a former cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, I \nhave been a longtime advocate in the pay equity debate. As some of my \ncolleagues may remember, in 1984, Representative Claudine Schneider, R-\nRI, Representative Nancy Johnson R-CT, and I wrote to the Reagan \nadministration asking that it prevent the Justice Department from \nweighing in against AFSCME v. Washington, which supported the concept \nof pay equity. And as a Member of the House of Representatives, I \nrepeatedly introduced bipartisan resolutions that would have \nestablished a commission to study compensation practices in Congress \nfrom 1984 to 1993. It is therefore simply unconscionable to imagine \nthat in this day and age, wage-setting practices are still being \naffected by historical gender biases resulting in the undervaluation of \nwork and low pay for women.\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n  Sadly, the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter will make it \nvirtually impossible for women workers to close the wage gap and to \nreceive the remedies they deserve when they are discriminated against. \nThis decision represents an enormous step backward for women and for \nany person alleging pay discrimination.\n  Lilly Ledbetter's story poignantly coupled with this unfortunate \nruling reminds us that wage discrimination persists across our Nation. \nIt is therefore long past time we reversed the Supreme Court's decision \nin Ledbetter and clarified that laws against pay discrimination apply \nto every paycheck or other compensation a worker receives. And Senator \nKennedy's Fair Pay Restoration Act would reestablish a fair rule for \nfiling claims of pay discrimination based on race, national origin, \ngender, religion, age or disability.\n  This bipartisan measure would also impose a reasonable time limit for \nfiling pay discrimination claims and would start the clock for filing \npay discrimination claims when compensation is received, rather than \nwhen the employer decides to discriminate. Each discriminatory paycheck \nwould restart the clock for filing a pay discrimination claim and as \nlong as workers file their claims within 180 days of a discriminatory \npaycheck, their charges will be considered timely. This measure would \nrestore the precedent applied by nine courts of appeals and the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission in pay discrimination cases until the \nSupreme Court's May 29, 2007. It would also maintain the current limits \non the amount employers owe.\n  The bill would also restore congressional intent, by mirroring \nlanguage prohibiting discriminatory seniority systems, which was \nincluded in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1991. The bill was signed \nby President George H. W. Bush in 1991, and I was pleased to support \nthis measure which passed with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.\n  Some contend this bill would ``exacerbate the existing heavy burden \non the courts by encouraging the filing of stale claims'' . . . that it \nwould allow employees to bring a claim of pay or other employment-\nrelated discrimination years or even decades after the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred. That is simply an exaggeration. The fact is--\nemployers would not have to adjust for salary differences that occurred \ndecades ago. Current law limits back pay awards to 2 years before the \nworker filed a job discrimination claim under title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, and this bill would not change this 2-year limit on \nback pay.\n  I cannot overstate my support for the Fair Pay Restoration Act, and I \nencourage my colleagues in the Senate to vote for this legislation \ntomorrow to ensure equal pay for women and minorities in the workforce. \nDiscrimination of any kind in the workplace should not be tolerated. It \nis time the law reflected that.\n  Thank you. Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks be included in the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3396-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HONORING RETIRED MAJOR D.

Brock Foster.\n  A native of Ohio who served his country in World War II, Korea, and \nVietnam, Major Foster demonstrated uncommon courage while flying as an \nA-1 Skyraider during a rescue mission near the Ho Chi Minh Trail on \nJune 28, 1968. At great risk to his personal safety, Major Foster \nremained in the rescue area amid heavy antiaircraft artillery and enemy \nfire to make repeated passes to protect the rescue helicopter. Major \nFoster's selfless heroism enabled the successful rescue of the Navy \npilot who had been encircled by hostile forces for more than 39 hours.\n  Nearly 40 years later, Major Foster is receiving long overdue \nrecognition for his sacrifice and valor and will be awarded the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. Given to those who distinguish themselves \nin aerial flight by taking heroic actions above and beyond the call of \nduty, the Distinguished Flying Cross is a fitting recognition of Major \nFoster's unwavering dedication to the service of the United States.\n  I am proud to honor this great Ohioan. His heroic actions and \ndedication to the U.S. Air Force and his fellow servicemen are an \ninspiration to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3396-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKER EDUCATION\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I highlight the importance of \nacknowledging and celebrating extraordinary efforts by Americans who \nhave led the way in protecting and preserving America's natural \nresources. I am honored to congratulate three educational institutions \nin my State of Oregon, Columbia Gorge Community College, Lane Community \nCollege and the Oregon Institute of Technology.\n  Recently, Columbia Gorge Community College received $1.6 million to \nsupport the college's community-based job training program to develop \nskilled technicians for renewable energy facilities such as wind, \nsolar, hydropower and biofuels production. The funding is part of the \nDepartment of Labor's Community-Based Job Training Grant Initiative to \nhelp community colleges provide area students and workers with the \nskills needed to stay competitive in up-and-coming industries. The \nprogram is the only one of its kind on the west coast. Just in the \nPacific Northwest, developers of wind energy facilities will need 300-\n500 additional workers in the next decade. Since the fall of 2007, \nColumbia Gorge Community College has offered a 1-year Certificate and a \n2-year Associate of Applied Science Degree in Renewable Energy \nTechnology.\n  Lane Community College in Eugene, OR was recently commended for their \ncertificate and 2-year degree programs which train students in energy \nmanagement and renewable energy. Graduates of the program are in high \ndemand by renewable energy companies. Lane Community College is quickly \ngaining recognition as a national leader in sustainability and has won \nfive awards in the past 2 years, including the Campus Sustainability \nLeadership Award from the Association for the Advancement of \nSustainability in Higher Education, and the Outstanding College \nRecycling Program Award from the National Recycling Coalition.\n  The Oregon Institute of Technology, OIT, also has earned distinction \nfor offering the Nation's first 4-year undergraduate degree program in \nrenewable energy. The Institute is on track to graduate the first class \nof students this year. Graduating students can seek employment in \nvariety of fields including design, engineering, installation, auditing \nand programming within the renewable energy sector. Additionally, OIT \nis working to become the only college campus in the world to be \ncompletely powered by geothermal energy.\n  I believe that we have a responsibility to encourage efforts to \nincrease the availability of renewable energy and conserve our natural \nresources. Oregon continues to build on a long history of innovation in \nenvironmental policy and practice. These community colleges are leading \nthe way in educating these workers and providing highly skilled workers \nto the rapidly expanding renewable energy sector in our State and the \nNation. I commend them for their efforts and pledge my full support as \nthey move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3396-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3396-S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDING WAUKESHA HOME DESIGN CENTER\n\n Ms SNOWE. Mr. President, this week is National Small Business \nWeek, a time to celebrate the critical role small businesses play in \npowering our economy. Indeed, as ranking member of the U.S. Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am constantly \nreminded of how crucial small businesses are to maintaining our \neconomic vitality. Nationally, small firms represent 99.7 percent of \nall businesses and have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs over \nthe past decade. On occasion, one of these small businesses goes above \nand beyond the call of social responsibility with an act of true \nthoughtfulness and generosity. Michael Costigan and the employees of \nthe Waukesha Home Design Center in southeastern Wisconsin recently \nanswered this call to action and made a difference in their community.\n  The story begins several weeks ago, when a selfish individual posing \nas a worker stole a television from the Zablocki Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center in Milwaukee, WI. This was a cowardly\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nand despicable act, and I hope that the perpetrator is brought to \njustice. After the theft, elderly and sick veterans at the center were \npreparing to adjust to watching their favorite movies, TV shows, and \nMilwaukee Brewers games on an older and smaller television, until a \nlocal businessman heard what had happened on the radio.\n  Michael Costigan, the general manager of the Waukesha Home Design \nCenter and a veteran himself, was incensed by this incident, and \ndecided to take action. He and the company's 25 employees, many of whom \nare also veterans, immediately made arrangements to donate a 52-inch \nflat-panel high-definition television to the Veterans Center. Just this \nmorning, Mr. Costigan and other employees personally delivered the \ntelevision to a group of ecstatic veterans, who will no longer suffer \nbecause of the inconsideration of another. I am pleased to hear that \nthe residents have already set up their Nintendo Wii to play bowling.\n  I am highlighting this compelling story on the Senate floor today \nbecause of the example it sets for each and every one of us. The \ncompany has only been in business since November of last year, but they \nhave already made a lasting impression on their local area. While we in \nCongress must do all that we can to support our nation's heroic and \npatriotic veterans, it is good to see that there are individuals and \nbusinesses caring for those who have given so much to defend our \ncountry's freedoms. My heartfelt gratitude and appreciation goes out to \nMichael Costigan and the Waukesha Home Design Center's employees for \ntheir work of selflessness and charity, and I wish them a bright future \nin all of their endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3397-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3397-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3397-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2634.

A bill to require a report on invasive agricultural pests \nand diseases and sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to trade before \ninitiating negotiations to enter into a free trade agreement, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Agriculture \nSmart Trade Act along with my colleague Senator Stabenow. The goal of \nthis legislation is to ensure that, as we consider the various free \ntrade agreements that come before the Senate, we are taking a look at \nthe big picture, including the increased risk of accidently importing \ninvasive pests or diseases and the ability for American agricultural \nproducers to access new export markets once trade agreements are in \neffect. Our bill is supported by United Fresh, the national association \nof fruit and vegetable growers and processors, and the U.S. Apple \nAssociation.\n  The bill has two main components. First, it requires the \nAdministration to send a report to Congress prior to the start of \nformal trade negotiations with a foreign nation detailing potential \ninvasive pests and disease that could pose a risk to U.S. agriculture. \nFurthermore, this report must identify what additional agricultural \ninspectors and other personnel are needed to prevent these pests and \ndiseases from being brought into the United States.\n  Second, the bill requires the Administration to disclose in the same \nreport all sanitary and photosanitary, or SPS, trade barriers that \ncould unduly restrict export markets for American commodities. What \nwe've seen in the past is that a trading partner will raise SPS \nbarriers to prevent American products from entering their country. Some \nof these SPS barriers are not grounded in science are simply non-tariff \ntrade barriers. As the Administration begins negotiations for a trade \nagreement, we all need to take a look at what kinds of SPS issues we \nhave with potential trading partners. Are their SPS concerns based in \nscience? We need to be sure that once an agreement is in effect, we \nwill have access to those foreign markets as stipulated in the trade \nagreement.\n  I want to make clear that this bill does not in any way limit the \nPresident's authority to negotiate trade agreements under Fast-Track, \nnor does it prevent trade legislation from being considered by the \nCongress. What this bill does is provide the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives with a more complete picture of what potential trade \nagreements involve beyond the obvious import and export quotas.\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\n  Regardless of how any senator feels about the free trade agreements \nthat we review and debate, I think all of my colleagues will agree with \nme that increased international trade means an increased risk of \nimporting bugs and diseases that have the potential to devastate our \nfood sources, jeopardize the livelihoods of our farmers, and cost our \nstates a fortune. We need to acknowledge the risk and put in place the \nbest safeguards we can to prevent the accidental introduction of these \nharmful pests.\n  I am not merely speculating about the risk of invasive pests and \ndisease. It is a fact that all of our States are battling insects and \ncrop diseases and dreading the next outbreak. Most recently in \nPennsylvania we discovered that the western part of our state is \ninfested with the Emerald Ash Borer, an invasive beetle that was \naccidently imported to the U.S. through Detroit via wooden shipping \npallets from China. This beetle is costing our commercial nursery \ngrowers millions of dollars in lost stock. Senator Stabenow knows \nbetter than anyone how much money, time and other resources the Ash \nBorer has cost the States of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and \nPennsylvania. But that's just one example. Orange growers in Florida \nhave spent the past decade fighting to contain and eradicate citrus \ncanker, an invasive disease that causes citrus trees to produce less \nand less fruit until they prematurely die. And California and Texas \nhave dealt with expensive eradication programs to deal with the \nMediterranean fruit fly or ``Med fly.''\n  The list goes on and on. And there isn't a single State that has not \nbeen impacted by invasive pests or diseases. So I hope that my \ncolleagues will support the Agriculture Smart Trade Act, and help us \nmake smart decisions that will protect our growers and our economy \nwhile opening new export markets.

A bill to require brokers to disclose and pay independent \ntruckers for any fuel surcharges received from shippers that relate to \nfuel costs paid for by the truckers; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that I \nbelieve is vital to the survival and competitiveness of our nation's \ntrucking industry. For too long, our small business motor freight \ncarriers, who struggle every day to make ends meet, have had their \nconcerns ignored and neglected. Today, as the entire trucking industry \nfaces monumental economic challenges spurred by skyrocketing, record-\nbreaking oil prices and exorbitant and volatile fuel costs, not to \nmention a detrimental slow-down in the hiring of new drivers, our \nindependent operators are having to contend with a devastating economic \ndownturn and enduring business failures--the likes of which this \ncountry has not seen since 2000.\n  During the first quarter of 2008, nearly one thousand motor carriers \nfailed, and they were not just trucking companies with two or three \ntrucks, but the average number of vehicles numbered 45 trucks! As you \ncan imagine, the financial impact is enormous, especially given that \nthe Bureau of Transportation Statistics projects freight to grow by \nmore than 70 percent by 2020. Forestalling action is not an option if \nwe are to sustain our trucking industry which is an undeniable, \neconomic lifeline of this nation.\n  That is why I have taken this opportunity to join with Senator Brown \nin introducing the Trust in Reliable Understanding of Consumer Costs \n(TRUCC) Act which would provide our small business operators and \ncarriers with the long-denied fairness that is owed to them. It is time \nthat these hard-working men and women free from stranglehold of \nunscrupulous brokers and middle-men who charge shippers for fuel costs, \nbut refuse to pass on those costs to operators who actually pay for the \nfuel. Our bill would provide not only a clear line-item delineating the \nfuel surcharge in the contracts provided to our small business \ncarriers, but also would guarantee that the entity in the transaction--\nwhether a shipper, broker, or driver--who absorbs the consistently-\nrising cost of fuel will become the recipient of the fuel surcharge.\n  To our measure's detractors who mischaracterize it, calling it among \nother things--outrageous, I want to remind them that our focus is on \nsmall business motor carriers which comprise more than 90 percent of \nthe truck industry, and that these individuals continue to traverse the \ncountry, carrying consumer goods and propelling our economy forward in \nthe process. And they do so, despite the constant challenges that are \npart and parcel of this occupation . . . brokers who obfuscate the \namount or even existence of fuel surcharges to the benefit of their own \ncoffers, the escalation of fuel prices, maintenance costs for their \nvehicles,\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\nthe long days or weeks of travel--sacrificing time away from their \nfamilies in order to make a living, feed their families, and finance \nthe education of their children. And so, Mr. President, I ask, how can \nwe afford to turn a blind eye to the plight of these Americans whose \nlivelihood is so integral to commerce in the great country? Merely \nwishing the problem away or simply keeping it out of sight and out of \nmind is neither tenable nor acceptable.\n  Make no mistake, not all brokers are bad actors, nor are all small \nbusiness operators being exploited. That is precisely why the \nlegislation Senator Brown and I are offering today does not place \nonerous burdens on the logistics industry. We merely seek to ensure \nthat an industry under siege on several fronts receives what its \npurveyors are rightfully entitled to--equitable treatment and a modicum \nof transparency. Is it too much to ask that they may see for themselves \nin a transaction who, if anyone, is receiving a fuel surcharge, and how \nmuch is being paid out for the cost of fuel? Is it too much to ask for \nan assurance that, if the motor carrier is willing to pay the high cost \nof fuel at the pump while transporting goods across this nation, that \ncarrier will be reimbursed? The answer to both questions is a \nresounding, ``No!'' The solution to addressing this regrettable \nsituation is our common-sense legislation the consideration of which is \nlong overdue.\n  I urge all my colleagues who have small business motor carriers in \ntheir state to consider seriously this issue and lend their strong \nsupport to this welcomed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2911. A bill to improve vaccination rates among children; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleague Senator \nMurray in introducing legislation that will help bolster childhood \nimmunization in those parts of our country where immunization rates are \nmuch too low. Since the beginning of the 20th century, vaccines have \ncompletely eradicated the once frequent killer smallpox and almost \neradicated polio. Vaccines save lives, avert communicable diseases and \nreduce health care spending for preventable diseases. We must continue \nin our efforts to achieve childhood immunization rates of 90 percent by \n2010 and with passage of this bill, we can do just that.\n  Vaccines are one of the most effective tools for prevention of \ndisease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nfor every $1 spent on vaccines, America saves $18.60 in both medical \ncosts and societal costs. But more important than the cost saving is \nthe weight and value we must place on ensuring that children are fully \nvaccinated. We must not lose one more child to a vaccine preventable \ndisease. Childhood vaccines prevent over 10 million cases of infectious \nillness and nearly 34,000 childhood deaths in America every year. \nClearly, vaccines are a tried and true way to not only reduce health \ncare costs, but also to keep our children healthy.\n  The legislation Senator Murray and I are introducing today authorizes \nfunding for effective interventions recommended by the Task Force on \nCommunity Preventive Services and helps to achieve childhood \nimmunization rates of 90 percent by 2010. First, the legislation \nauthorizes additional funding for a demonstration program allowing \nWomen, Infant and Children clinics, also known as ``WIC'' to play a \ngreater role in childhood immunizations. This is achieved by \nrecommending vaccines to WIC recipients, coordinating care or \nimmunization services, or employing an immunization coordinator. More \nthan 45 percent of U.S. infants receive benefits through WIC clinics. A \n2002 study by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases \nrecommended coordinating government benefits to keep children up-to-\ndate with their immunizations and noted that WIC programs have \nsuccessfully accomplished this in numerous communities. Our legislation \nwould enhance such efforts and would even go a step further to require \nthat any grantee using these funds have access to the State \nImmunization Information System to better coordinate immunization \nscreenings and services.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes additional funding for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct public, age \nappropriate immunization awareness campaigns and immunization education \nand outreach activities. Research shows that outreach, coupled with the \ncoordination of immunization and WIC clinics, can increase childhood \nimmunization rates by of approximately 12 percent.\n  Lastly, this legislation establishes a sense of the Senate concerning \nthe importance of electronic record coordination by both the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services and the Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, and that these leaders should work \ntogether to improve the integration of immunization information systems \nwith electronic medical records, health information systems, and health \ninformation exchanges.\n  Vaccine preventable diseases will continue to be a threat to our \nNation's most vulnerable population if we do not ensure proper \nvaccination among infants. Through this legislation, we can work to \nachieve the Healthy People 2010 objective of vaccinating 90 percent of \nall children by age two. To take a quote from a former First Lady of \nthe United States and a cofounder of the organization Every Child by \nTwo ``No child in America should have to get sick from a vaccine \npreventable disease. It's time for us to redouble efforts to protect \nthe 20 percent of preschoolers who are routinely not being immunized on \ntime.'' The Infant Immunization Improvement Act will be a vital first \nstep to increasing vaccination rates and will serve as an important \nsafeguard against the spread of communicable diseases. I would like to \nthank the Partnership for Prevention for their input on this \nlegislation and the 156 members of the 317 Coalition for endorsing the \nInfant Immunization Improvement Act. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor \nthis legislation--because leaving a single child unprotected is one too \nmany.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2913. A bill to provide a limitation on judicial remedies in \ncopyright infringement cases involving orphan works; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I join once again with Senator Hatch \nto introduce a bill that will have a significant and positive impact on \nour cultural heritage. Hundreds of thousands of so-called ``orphan \nworks''--works that may be protected by copyright, but whose owners \ncannot be identified or located--are collecting dust. Despite \ntremendous interest in using these orphan works in new collections and \nnew creations, they often languish unseen, because those who would like \nto bring them to light, and to the attention of the world, fear the \nprospect of prohibitively expensive statutory damages. In other \ninstances, the copyright in an orphan work may have expired, but \npotential users lack the information to be certain of the propriety of \ngoing forward with its use.\n  The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 will remedy this \nsituation. It will help potential users of orphan works find the owners \nof those works, and it will help the owners to receive compensation. \nThe works will no longer be orphans; their owners will reap the \nfinancial benefits of their use, while the public reaps the creative \nbenefits. More creative works will be used, contributing to our \ncultural and artistic heritage, and more creators will receive \ncompensation for use of their work.\n  Our legislation permits the use of an orphan work only if the \npotential user performs and documents a good faith search for the \ncopyright owner. If users cannot locate and contact copyright owners, \nthey may use the orphan work. But if copyright owners later make \nthemselves known, and if users have performed a search that qualifies \nunder this legislation, owners are entitled to reasonable compensation. \nThe user will not be liable for full statutory damages in those \ncircumstances, but if a user does not perform that good faith search, \nthe user will face up to $150,000 in statutory damages.\n  In practical terms, then, what does this mean? It means that a woman \nin Vermont can restore a wedding photograph of her grandparents, even \nif she\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\ncannot locate the photographer to get permission to do so. It means \nthat a library can display letters of American soldiers wrote during \nWorld War II, even if the library cannot contact the soldiers or their \ndescendents. It means that museums can exhibit Depression-era \nphotographs, even if they cannot determine the name of the \nphotographer.\n  What this bill does not do is create a ``license to infringe.'' In \nany of the above instances, if the users do not conduct a good faith \nsearch for the copyright owner, those users are in the same boat they \nare in now when it comes to infringement. This bill does not change the \nbasic premise of copyright law: If you use the copyrighted works of \nothers, you must compensate them for it. As an avid photographer, I \nunderstand what it means to devote oneself to creative expression, and \nI applaud anyone with the talent and commitment to make a living doing \nso. Orphan works are too important to our families, our communities, \nand our culture to go left unseen and unused.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his help in developing this legislation, \nand I look forward to working with him to ensure that this bill becomes \nlaw. I am especially pleased to name this bill for Shawn Bentley. \nSeveral years ago, Shawn died, tragically young, but he left behind a \nlegacy of affection and regard for all of us who knew him. He served \nSenator Hatch as a counsel for intellectual property, and it was he who \nfirst inspired this effort on orphan works. Naming this bill for him is \na testament to his dedication to the issue, and his value to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full bill text be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the accurate transmission of network \ntraffic identification information; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, to help end the growing problem of \nphantom traffic, today I introduce the ``Signaling Modernization Act of \n2008.'' Senators Inouye, Smith, Dorgan, Thune, Pryor, and Snowe \ncosponsored this bill. Phantom traffic is a phone call sent over the \ntelephone network without the identifying information carriers use to \nbill each other.\n  When I call home to Alaska, that call is transmitted over several \ndifferent carriers. Phone companies charge each other for the use of \ntheir networks. The funds generated by these charges are particularly \nimportant to carriers in Alaska and throughout rural America. Phantom \ntraffic prevents carriers from collecting the funds they are owed, \nimpacting universal service and raising rates for rural customers.\n  It's time Congress pulled back the mask on phantom traffic to \ndiscover who or what is behind this problem that has plagued carriers \nfor several years. The Federal Communications Commission is actively \nanalyzing the issue, but it is time we find a solution.\n  Yesterday the Commerce Committee heard from a member of the National \nTelecommunications Cooperative Association from rural Missouri. He told \nus that 11 percent of their traffic did not have sufficient information \nfor billing, causing them to lose about $37 per line per year. This \nloss of revenue makes it more difficult for rural carriers to deploy \nbroadband.\n  Our bill will require all calls from voice communications service \nproviders to contain enough information to allow carriers to bill each \nother, including voice over internet protocol providers offering 2-way \nservice and providers transiting the traffic between originating and \nterminating providers. Our bill also directs the FCC to establish rules \nimplementing this requirement within 12 months of enactment, and gives \nit the authority to adopt enforcement provisions. Phantom traffic \nsteals from rural carriers and customers. I hope Congress and the FCC \nwill look at this issue closely and put an end to phantom traffic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3408-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 530--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING OCTOBER 5, 2008, \n          AS ``NATIONAL SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Crapo) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 530\n\n       Whereas sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas sudden cardiac takes the lives of more than 250,000 \n     people in the United States each year, according to the Heart \n     Rhythm Society;\n       Whereas anyone can experience sudden cardiac arrest, \n     including infants, high school athletes, and people in their \n     30s and 40s who have no sign of heart disease;\n       Whereas sudden cardiac arrest is extremely deadly, with the \n     National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute giving it a \n     mortality rate of approximately 95 percent;\n       Whereas, to have a chance of surviving an attack, the \n     American Heart Association states that victims of sudden \n     cardiac arrest must receive a lifesaving defibrillation \n     within the first 4 to 6 minutes of an attack;\n       Whereas, for every minute that passes without a shock from \n     an automated external defibrillator, the chance of survival \n     decreases by approximately 10 percent;\n       Whereas lifesaving treatments for sudden cardiac arrest are \n     effective if they can be administered in time;\n       Whereas, according to joint research by the American \n     College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, \n     implantable cardioverter defibrillators are 98 percent \n     effective at protecting those at risk for sudden cardiac \n     arrest;\n       Whereas, according to the American Heart Association, \n     cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation with \n     an automated external defibrillator more than double a \n     victim's chances of survival;\n       Whereas the Yale-New Haven Hospital and the New England \n     Journal of Medicine state that women and African Americans \n     are at a higher risk than the general population of dying as \n     a result of sudden cardiac arrest, yet this fact is not well \n     known to those at risk;\n       Whereas there is a need for comprehensive educational \n     efforts designed to increase awareness of sudden cardiac \n     arrest and related therapies among medical professionals and \n     the greater public in order to promote early detection and \n     proper treatment of this disease and to improve quality of \n     life; and\n       Whereas early October is an appropriate time to observe \n     National Sudden Cardiac Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 5, 2008, as \n     ``National Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports--\n       (A) the goals and ideals of National Sudden Cardiac Arrest \n     Awareness Week; and\n       (B) efforts to educate people about sudden cardiac arrest \n     and to raise awareness about the risk of sudden cardiac \n     arrest, identifying warning signs, and the need to seek \n     medical attention in a timely manner;\n       (3) acknowledges the critical importance of sudden cardiac \n     arrest awareness to improving national cardiovascular health; \n     and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this week with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3408-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 531--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL \n                       CHILD CARE WORTHY WAGE DAY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Casey, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Johnson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

State sanctioned use of excessive force increased, \n     and security forces tortured members of the opposition, \n     student leaders, and civil society activists''; and\n       Whereas annual inflation in Zimbabwe is reportedly running \n     over 150,000 percent, unemployment stands at over 80 percent, \n     hunger affects over 4,000,000 people, and an estimated 3,500 \n     people die each week from hunger, disease, and other causes \n     related to extremely poor living conditions: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to support the people of Zimbabwe, who have been \n     subjected to incredible hardships, including violence, \n     political repression, and severe economic deprivation, in \n     their aspirations for a free, democratic, and more prosperous \n     future;\n       (2) to call for an immediate cessation of politically \n     motivated violence, detentions, and efforts to intimidate the \n     people of Zimbabwe perpetrated by Zimbabwe's security forces \n     and militias loyal to ZANU-PF;\n       (3) that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission should \n     immediately release the legitimate results of the \n     presidential election and ratify the previously announced \n     results of the parliamentary elections;\n       (4) that President Robert Mugabe should accept the will of \n     the people of Zimbabwe in order to effect a timely and \n     peaceful transition to genuine democratic rule;\n       (5) that regional organizations, including SADC and the AU, \n     should play a sustained and active role in resolving the \n     crisis peacefully and in a manner that respects the will of \n     the people of Zimbabwe;\n       (6) that the United Nations Security Council should be \n     seized of the issue of Zimbabwe, support efforts to bring \n     about a peaceful resolution of the crisis that respects the \n     will of the people of Zimbabwe, and impose an international \n     arms embargo on Zimbabwe until a legitimate democratic \n     government has taken power;\n       (7) that the United States Government and the international \n     community should impose targeted sanctions against additional \n     individuals in the Government of Zimbabwe and state security \n     services and militias in Zimbabwe who are responsible for \n     human rights abuses and interference in the legitimate \n     conduct of the elections in Zimbabwe; and\n       (8) that the United States Government and the international \n     community should work together to prepare a comprehensive \n     economic and political recovery package for Zimbabwe in the \n     event that a genuinely democratic government is formed and \n     commits to implementing key constitutional, economic, and \n     political reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3409-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4576.

I ask unanimous consent that the Banking Committee be \ndischarged from consideration of H.R. 4286.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4286) to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \n     Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in recognition of her courageous and \n     unwavering commitment to peace, nonviolence, human rights and \n     democracy in Burma.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to note Senate passage of \nH.R. 4286, legislation that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to \nthe jailed prodemocracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San \nSuu Kyi. The bill now goes to the President for his signature.\n  I am pleased to report that this legislation has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. Once again I am joined in this effort by my friend, \nthe senior Senator from California. Senator Feinstein and I introduced \nthis legislation and it has 76 cosponsors. In this regard, I would like \nto thank Rich Harper of Senator Feinstein's staff and Lucy Bean of my \nstaff for their work on the bill.\n  When first established in 1776, the Congressional Gold Medal was \ngiven to military leaders for their achievements in battle. Since that \ntime, it has become America's highest civilian honor, having been \nbestowed upon great friends of freedom such as Winston Churchill, \nNelson Mandela and Martin Luther King, Jr. Granting Suu Kyi the Gold \nMedal would continue that same tradition of honoring heroism in the \ndefense of liberty.\n  For more than 20 years, Suu Kyi's support for justice and democracy \nhas placed her at odds with the tyranny and oppression of the Burmese \njunta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC. She and her \nsupporters have combated the brutality of the junta with peaceful \nprotest and resistance. She has chosen dignity as her weapon, and she \nhas found allies around the world to aid her in her struggle.\n  Despite the efforts of Suu Kyi and her allies, the SPDC will soon \nplace a sham constitution before the people of Burma for an up-or-down \nvote. This might sound democratic, but no one is fooled. This proposed \nconstitution includes language that would forbid Suu\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\nKyi from holding public office. Criticism of the document is a criminal \noffense. The true intent behind the proposed constitution is not the \nexpansion of democratic principles. Its true purpose is to legitimize \nand make permanent the military junta and its brutal tyranny.\n  By awarding Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal, we in Congress are \nletting the world know that the American people stand with Suu Kyi and \nthe freedom-loving people of Burma and against the junta and the \nillegitimate charter it is propounding.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, there be no \nintervening action or debate, and that all statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the third reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 4286) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3412-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 510) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preambles, reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis is one of the most common life-\n     threatening genetic diseases in the United States and one for \n     which there is no known cure;\n       Whereas the average life expectancy of an individual with \n     cystic fibrosis is 37 years, an improvement from a life \n     expectancy in the 1960s where children did not live long \n     enough to attend elementary school, but still unacceptably \n     short;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States \n     have cystic fibrosis, more than half of them children;\n       Whereas 1 of every 3,500 babies born in the United States \n     is born with cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas more than 10,000,000 Americans are unknowing, \n     symptom-free carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     recommend that all States consider newborn screening for \n     cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation urges all States to \n     implement newborn screening for cystic fibrosis to facilitate \n     early diagnosis and treatment which improves health and life \n     expectancy;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     cystic fibrosis can extend the lives of people who have the \n     disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in cystic fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in gene, protein, and drug therapies \n     beneficial to people who have the disease;\n       Whereas innovative research is progressing faster and is \n     being conducted more aggressively than ever before, due, in \n     part, to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's establishment of a \n     model clinical trials network;\n       Whereas, although the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation continues \n     to fund a research pipeline for more than 30 potential \n     therapies and funds a nationwide network of care centers that \n     extend the length and quality of life for people with cystic \n     fibrosis, lives continue to be lost to this disease every \n     day;\n       Whereas education of the public about cystic fibrosis, \n     including the symptoms of the disease, increases knowledge \n     and understanding of cystic fibrosis and promotes early \n     diagnosis; and\n       Whereas the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will conduct \n     activities to honor National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month \n     in May 2008: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the goals and ideals of National Cystic Fibrosis \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the promotion of further public awareness and \n     understanding of cystic fibrosis;\n       (3) encourages early diagnosis and access to quality care \n     for people with cystic fibrosis to improve the quality of \n     their lives; and\n       (4) supports research to find a cure for cystic fibrosis by \n     fostering an enhanced research program through a strong \n     Federal commitment and expanded public-private partnerships.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3412-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REGARDING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF \n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity to meet this afternoon \nwith unions representing different airline entities. I also met with \nthe owners and operators of airlines. We have a real problem on our \nhands. Fuel costs are now approaching 50 percent of the costs of our \ncommercial airlines--50 percent. It used to be that the No. 1 cost, of \ncourse, was labor, personnel, but that is not the way it is. It is \napproaching 50 percent.\n  We are spending billions and billions of dollars, and most of that \nmoney is going to places we would rather it not go, to countries that \nhave certainly nondemocratic forms of government, and a number of them \nare doing some very bad things with the money we are sending.\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\n  We are going to approach this FAA reauthorization to try to direct \nattention to some of the issues we read about every day: 3,000 flights \nbeing canceled, airlines flying with improper equipment. We are going \nto do our very best to have a good debate. I hope we can proceed to \nthis legislation. It is something that is so important for us to do as \na country.\n  Mr. President,the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the FAA \nreauthorization bill--I will again remind everyone--will be at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/24/senate-section/article/S3413-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2920\n\n  Mr. REID.
