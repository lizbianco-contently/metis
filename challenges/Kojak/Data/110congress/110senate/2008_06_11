Mr. President, when President Bush took office, one of the \nairplanes flying us to the west coast, or to the Midwest, or to the \nsouthern part of the States from Washington, DC, the cost of a tank of \nfuel for that airplane was 15 percent of the overall cost of the \nairline. Today, after 7 years and 6 months of President Bush, it now \ncosts those airline companies almost 50 percent of the total costs. So \nit has gone from 15 percent to almost 50 percent.\n  All over America, airlines are eliminating flights that are full. \nWhy? Because those airplanes cost too much to run. Every airplane \nflying across America today is losing money--every commercial airline--\nbecause the cost of fuel is so high. Think about that. Eighty-five \npercent of the cost of an airline could be other things when President \nBush took office; now it is 50 percent. Airlines are in deep trouble.\n  I repeat, airplanes taking off from Washington, DC, or other places \nin America, and are full, with every seat taken, those flights are \nbeing eliminated because that type of airplane uses too much fuel. They \nare doing everything they can to eliminate the need for extra fuel. \nThey are hosing down airplanes to save a quart of fuel here and there.\n  Mr. President, it is a desperate situation that the American airline \nindustry has. In addition, our airlines are having difficulty competing \nwith the European airlines. They pay in euros; we pay in dollars. We \npay approximately, let's say, $1.40 per gallon--we know that is wrong, \nbut the mathematical calculation is the same--and Europe pays about 80 \ncents. We cannot compete.\n  Mr. President, when President Bush took office, a gallon of gasoline \nin a motor vehicle was less than $1.50. Now, this morning, it is \nannounced that the average cost in America is over $4.05 a gallon. That \nis what has happened during the Bush administration.\n  The day before yesterday, I met with the National Association of \nManufacturers. The biggest concern they have is the cost of energy. One \nrelatively small American manufacturer who has been quite successful--\ntotally American--said this year, so far he has to\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nborrow or come up with another $6 million--he doesn't know where he is \ngoing to get it--just to take care of the problems attributed to rising \nenergy cost.\n  In spite of all this, in spite of the problems we face in America \ntoday with gasoline, people are trying to take public transportation \nwhen they can, but in rural America there is very little public \ntransportation. Vacations are being stopped. In spite of all this, \nyesterday, the Republicans stopped us from going forward on legislation \nthat would ease some of the problems.\n  For example, in the matter we are talking about when morning business \ncloses, we think it is time to look at the subsidies the oil companies \nget. During the past year, they made about $250 billion in profits--net \nprofits. Yet we subsidize these oil companies. We believe that should \nbe looked at closely.\n  We also believe we should look at a windfall profits tax. We also \nbelieve--and there is bipartisan support for this; Senator Specter \ntalked about this, and Senator Kohl is our major mover on this issue on \nthis side--OPEC scholars believe, and members of our Judiciary \nCommittee believe they are violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. But \nthere is a question as to whether they are subject to that. What these \nSenators and others want to do--and that is part of our legislation--is \nmake them subject to the antitrust laws in this country. They make most \nof their money in America. Why shouldn't our laws apply? We were \nstopped from going forward to debate that issue.\n\n  There is a school of thought today that believes the problems with \nthe cost of oil are based on speculation--pure speculation. If the \nPresiding Officer wanted to leave and buy a share of General Motors or \nFord stock--and Kirk Kerkorian is buying about 1 billion dollars' worth \nof Ford stock today--if you want to buy stock in Ford or General Motors \ntoday, you would have to put up 50 cents, which is your margin, for \nevery dollar you buy. But not with oil. Some margins with oil are 3 to \n5 percent. There is a lot of speculation going on.\n  We wanted to take a look at that but, no, the Republicans said: We \nare not even going to let you legislate on that matter. It seems to me \nthat is what we should do. If they don't like our proposal, let's do \nsomething they think would be appropriate. Let's legislate.\n  Mr. President, I think it is pretty clear we cannot produce our way \nout of the problems we have with energy. Take ANWR and all of the \noffshore, and we in America have about 3 percent of the oil in the \nworld. So it is obvious we cannot do that. Can we do a better job in \nproduction? Of course we can. We do certain things, and we have done \ncertain things, such as allowing more offshore drilling off the coast \nof Louisiana.\n  The answer to all of this is not drill, drill, drill. The answer is \nto do something to help save our world. Global warming is here because \nwe have taken, for well more than a century, carbon out of the Earth \nand put it into the sky. It has caused our Earth to be sick. We have a \nfever. Global warming is here. So we not only have to face this issue \nand recognize we don't need more fossil fuel, we need alternative \nrenewable energy. That is what we tried to move to yesterday. The \nRepublicans would not let us.\n  We have entrepreneurs in America who want to invest money in \nrenewable energy--the Sun, the wind, geothermal. They want to invest, \nand we want to be able to give them tax credits as incentives. But, no, \nnot with this Republican minority, not with this Republican President. \nThe answer is no, no, no to directly affecting energy costs and doing \nsomething to allow us to move to renewable energy.\n  If that weren't enough, yesterday, to show what is going on with the \nRepublicans and to indicate to the American people why they keep losing \nthese special elections--one in Illinois, one in Louisiana, and one in \nMississippi--look what they are doing. Yesterday, the Judiciary \nCommittee had a hearing on torture to find out why America--the United \nStates of America--why we were torturing people who were being picked \nup for being suspected terrorists. All we wanted to do is hold a \nhearing. No. In the Senate, if you don't want a hearing to go forward, \nand we have been in session for more than 2 hours, you can stop it. So \nwe had to recess the Senate to go ahead with the hearing anyway.\n  They do not even want us to do oversight. So we are going to come \ntoday and talk about the calamity facing America with the oil prices. \nThe Presiding Officer and I just left a meeting of people concerned \nabout food--food. Senator Dorgan from North Dakota indicated that the \ncost of fertilizer in the small, sparsely populated State of North \nDakota, in 1 year, has gone from $400 million to $800 million. Those \nfarmers are trying to figure out a way to pay for that. People all \naround that table were people concerned about food. The problem is \nenergy costs.\n  Yet in the Senate, we are not allowed to debate that because \nRepublicans want to maintain the status quo. The status quo will not be \nmaintained much longer. We may have to put up with President Bush and \nhis policies for 7 months, if he is not willing to work with us. We may \nhave to put up with the obstructionism of the Republicans for another 7 \nmonths, but the day is going to change come November when the elections \nare held because we will no longer have the slim majority we have now, \nand we will be able to legislate for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5462-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, we heard, believe it or not, \nthe Democratic nominee for President of the United States suggesting \nthat rising gas prices aren't the problem. I will say that again. \nYesterday, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States \nsaid rising gas prices are not the problem. The problem, he suggested, \nis that they have gone up too fast. He said he would prefer a gradual \nadjustment. The Democratic nominee for President said the problem is \nnot that gas prices are too high, it is that they have gone up too \nfast. He would have preferred a gradual adjustment.\n  Now, the position outlined by the Democratic nominee should not be a \nsurprise to most Americans, given that Washington Democrats have \nrepeatedly refused to allow increased energy production at home even \nthough, as we all know, increased supply leads to lower prices. It is \nas if they are doing everything in their power to keep gas prices from \ngoing down. In fact, the Republicans in the Senate offered a proposal a \nfew weeks ago, which would have dealt with the inadequate amount of \ndomestic supply, and we were blocked by the majority. They simply \nrefused to have a debate on the possibility of opening domestic \nsupplies.\n\n  Whether it is shutting down domestic exploration in large areas, both \nonshore and offshore, or instituting a moratorium on oil shale \ndevelopment, which this new Washington Democratic majority in Congress \ndid, increasing the gas tax or refusing to pursue coal to liquid, \nDemocrats long ago implemented a gradual adjustment, as the Democratic \nnominee for President suggested yesterday, a gradual adjustment on gas \nprices that is reflected today in the $4.05 Americans are paying for a \ngallon of gas. Kentucky families do not need a gradual adjustment to \ntheir pocketbooks. They need a solution for their pain at the pump.\n  We have seen a lot of recent converts over the last few months \nsuddenly advocating for lower gas prices, but their long-time advocacy \nfor limiting domestic supply and increasing the gas tax has brought us \nto where we are today. Recycling the same failed ideas from the 1970s \nand increasing our reliance on Middle Eastern oil only makes the \nproblem worse. I wish to be perfectly clear, at a time of record gas \nprices, we do not need to tax them even higher or make American \nconsumers be even more reliant on Middle Eastern oil.\n  The American people want us to address high gas prices, and we should \ndo so the only way that will have a lasting impact: by increasing \ndomestic supply in an environmentally responsible way and increasing \nAmerican jobs in the process.\n  When our friends on the other side agree to do the same, we will \nbelieve they are serious about lowering gas prices. Until then, we will \nbe left to conclude that all they support is a gradual adjustment \nadvocated yesterday by their nominee.\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n  What we have had is a situation where one side does not want to do \nanything to address the supply problem and suggest things that will \nonly make gas prices higher. The other side has said: We are willing to \ndo a balanced energy approach. Last year, we joined with the majority \nto increase the corporate average fuel economy for automobiles. That is \nan important step in the right direction on the conservation side. We \nare anxious to see us move as rapidly as possible to the kinds of \nautomobiles that are more efficient and less reliant on gasoline.\n  But it is absurd, it is nonsense to suggest that you can rule out of \nbounds, for example, roughly 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf, \neven when we have States that want to go offshore. Take Virginia. Last \nyear, Virginia, represented by one Democratic Senator and one \nRepublican Senator, wanted to open their Outer Continental Shelf. The \nSenate would not give them permission to do it. Why in the world would \nwe want to deny a State which is willing to explore offshore the \nopportunity to do it, particularly in a time when gasoline prices are \nso high?\n  We welcome this debate. It is a most important issue in the country \ntoday. Republicans are comforted by the fact that a growing number of \nopinion polls in the country indicate that a greater percentage of \nAmericans get it. One of the most interesting surveys is the one by the \nrespected independent polling organization Gallup a little over a week \nago that indicated, on the issue of going into wilderness areas in a \nlimited way and the Outer Continental Shelf where States are willing to \ndo it, the American public now favored that 57 to 41. That is a total \nchange from a year ago when the numbers were roughly equal.\n  The American people understand this is a problem we can do something \nabout ourselves. We are the No. 3 oil producer in the world. The Saudis \nare No. 1. The Russians are No. 2. They do not think it makes sense for \nus to continue to beg foreigners, particularly those with unstable \nregimes, to solve this problem for us when we could take it in our own \nhands and, in an environmentally sensitive way, dramatically increase \nour production at home.\n  So this is a great debate about the most important issue in the \ncountry, and Republicans are certainly anxious to engage in this \ndebate. We will be discussing this issue all day today and, in all \nlikelihood, every day for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3098\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter--and I have alerted my friend, the \nmajority leader, because I think he may well wish to object--I wish to \nshortly propound a consent request. Let me say the consent request I \nwill be asking for will basically, if agreed to, allow the callup of \nthe bill S. 3098, which is the McConnell-Kyl-Grassley bill, which \nincludes a 1-year AMT patch which was omitted in the House bill that \nthe Senate did not agree to go forward with yesterday and extends the \nprovisions that expired in 2007 for 2 years. This is a 1-year longer \nextension than was in the House bill we voted on yesterday.\n  S. 3098 does not include any tax hikes, reflecting the position of 41 \nSenators taken in a letter to Senator Baucus on April 23 of this year. \nHowever, the Republican alternative also includes the Ensign-Cantwell \nenergy tax incentives which was approved by the Senate by a vote of 88 \nto 8.\n  In addition, S. 3098 does not contain the New York City earmark which \nwas in the bill yesterday, the tax break for trial lawyers which was in \nthe bill yesterday or the Davis-Bacon expansion which was in the bill \nyesterday. Any or all of those, of course, would draw a veto from the \nPresident and would make it impossible for us to get this extender \npackage into law.\n  On balance, this is a bill that could pass the Senate and be signed \nby the President. I would hope we would pass it as soon as possible.\n  Having explained what is in the measure, I now ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending motion be temporarily set aside and that I be \nrecognized in order to move to proceed to S. 3098, the Alternative \nMinimum Tax and Extenders Tax Relief Act, and to file cloture on that \nmotion. I further ask that if the motion to proceed to S. 3098 is \nadopted, no other pending business be displaced, with the vote \noccurring today after morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, people who are listening to and watching \nthis discussion must go back and understand George Orwell set forth a \nprinciple in his book ``1984'' that has become known as Orwellian. What \nthat means is what the person is saying, they mean the direct opposite.\n\n  This is so hard to respond to in a calm, deliberative manner. We want \nto legislate. The proposal the distinguished Republican leader \nsuggested is an amendment we might find a way to approach, but \nshouldn't we get on the bill? I don't understand this. I don't \nunderstand this. They talk about the way to solve the problems of \nenergy in America is to keep drilling, and now they are talking about \ndrilling in wilderness areas--pristine areas in which they want to \nstart drilling.\n  We have 3 percent of the oil in the world, counting everything--ANWR, \nall those other things. We cannot produce our way out of the problems \nwe have. Sixty-five percent of the oil we use we import. So it seems \nlogical to everyone the thing we should do is stop importing oil. We \ncan produce a little more, and we should do that, but the way to get \nout of this problem is to move to alternative energy.\n  In this debate, with these gas prices as high as they have ever been \nin the history of America, more than $4.05 a gallon, where is George \nBush, the President? Why isn't he talking about this? Why isn't he \ntalking about this? He hasn't talked about it for the last 2 months. \nWhere is John McCain? Does he favor, as obviously he does, the \nobstructionism of the Republicans in the Senate to allow us to go \nforward and debate gas prices? That is what we want to do.\n  I made very clear what is in our bill. There is nothing so difficult \nto understand. We believe the cost of oil is driven up by these margins \nthat are out of whack. We want to legislate and say let's take a look \nat that. We believe the OPEC nations are being unfair to America. \nShouldn't we be able to take a look at that? We believe there are \nwindfall profits that should be directed back to the American people. \nWe believe the subsidies to major oil companies should be taken away, \nand we believe we should be able to do something about alternative \nenergy.\n  Each step of the way, the Republicans have blocked us from doing \nthat. I don't understand why we can't go forward and legislate such as \nthis body has done for more than 230 years. Senator Stabenow was here \nyesterday--now we put Velcro on the numbers because they change. \nEverything we do we have to go around the obstructions put up by the \nRepublicans. Now the chart has 75 filibusters. We have Velcro, and we \ncan add numbers to it. But remember, these acts of obstructionism by \nthe Republicans are significant, and they are stopping us from doing \nthe American people's business.\n  I hope we can move into a time where we can legislate. We are going \nto talk about gas prices today, and the American people, while we are \ntalking about gas prices, are filling their tanks at these outrageous \nprices, with the Republicans not letting us move to this legislation. \nIn the meantime, George Bush, the President, and John McCain, the \nnominee, are being silent as to what should happen.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the problem, I say to my good friend, \nthe majority leader, is he wants to dictate the terms of the debate in \nthe Senate, as if we were in the House. What he has done repeatedly, of \ncourse, is filed needless cloture motions and then filled the tree. All \nthis parliamentary gobbledygook, I guess, is confusing to the American \npublic. But the Senate has historically been a freewheeling place, \nwhere both sides had to cast difficult votes.\n  I remember when my party was in the majority. Senator Lott and \nSenator Frist used to say to all of us: The price of being in the \nmajority is you have to cast a significant number of bad votes in order \nto get a bill through. My good friend, the Democratic leader, has \ndecided he wants to protect his Members from having to cast votes they \ndon't like. So what he does,\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nthrough a parliamentary procedure that is permissible in the Senate, is \nmake it impossible for the minority to offer amendments that they want \nand, of course, the minority's reaction to that is to not let a bill \nwithout any of their imprint succeed.\n  With regard to the substantive issue that is before us, the Los \nAngeles Times, certainly not anywhere near a conservative newspaper, in \ncriticizing both sides on the gas price issue, this morning had this to \nsay about the proposals my good friend and most in his party are \nadvocating--windfall profits tax and the effort to sue OPEC. This is \nwhat the L.A. Times had to say this morning:\n\n       Exhibit A in the case against congressional Democrats as \n     wise stewards of the energy economy is which failed to \n     advance Tuesday after it got too few votes to head off a \n     filibuster. It would have imposed a windfall-profits tax on \n     oil companies and allowed the U.S. attorney general to sue \n     OPEC on antitrust grounds, among other things.\n\n  They are describing the central provisions of the bill we decided not \nto go forward with yesterday. And this is what they had to say about \nthose two proposals:\n\n       Trying to find an economist who thinks a windfall profits \n     tax is a good idea is like searching for a climatologist who \n     thinks global warming is caused by trees.\n\n  This is one of the most liberal editorial pages in America. Let me \nsay it again. This is what they said about the windfall profits tax:\n\n       Trying to find an economist who thinks a windfall profits \n     tax is a good idea is like searching for a climatologist who \n     thinks global warming is caused by trees. Such a tax unfairly \n     targets the oil industry, which is already amply taxed and \n     whose profits aren't far out of line with other U.S. \n     industries when considered as a percentage of sales. It also \n     would discourage oil companies from investing in new supply, \n     which is precisely what happened when Congress imposed a \n     similar tax in 1980. The result might be even higher oil \n     prices.\n\n  We have been there and we have done this. We know what happens.\n\n       That's nothing compared with the lunacy of taking the \n     Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to court, \n     though. That would invite retaliation by OPEC members, which \n     could seize the assets of U.S. companies doing business \n     overseas. More likely, there would be a subtler response, \n     such as production slowdowns that would cause oil prices to \n     skyrocket.\n\n  One of the most liberal editorial pages in America about what my good \nfriend the majority leader is suggesting is somehow, some way, the \nsolution to higher oil prices at the pump.\n  This is a debate we welcome. We intend to participate vigorously \ntoday. There is no way--I repeat, no way--to get a handle on this issue \nwithout taking greater advantage of the oil production we have within \nour shores that we can explore for and develop in environmentally \nsensitive ways. I think it is noteworthy, for example, that there was \nnot a single reported example of spillage in the gulf during the \nKatrina hurricane. I mean, that had to be, quite possibly, the most \ndevastating hurricane to ever hit the United States of America. I am \nunaware of a single reported example of any spillage in the offshore \ndrilling that is going on in the gulf.\n  We know how to do this, Mr. President. We know how to exploit our \nresources in an environmentally sensitive way. So I welcome the debate. \nWe are happy to be on the subject, and many of my Members, of course, \nwill be looking forward to discussing it during the course of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, my friend's statement about \nthe L.A. Times is as Orwellian as his statement about wanting to cast \nvotes. Understand, everybody, that he means just the opposite. They do \nnot want to cast any votes, so that is why they are preventing us from \ndebating this legislation. He said we are making it impossible. That is \nOrwellian. They are the ones stopping us from debating.\n  I would suggest to my friend that the L.A. Times is not some liberal \nnewspaper. It has been purchased by one of the most conservative men in \nAmerica today. He owns a chain of newspapers. He announced yesterday he \nis going to cut the news of the L.A. Times by 50 percent because the \nnewspaper is going broke. So it is not a liberal editorial page.\n  But assuming that we understand the Orwellian-speak from the \nRepublican side, let me read a little more from the same editorial he \ntalked about.\n\n       Republicans are just as short of good ideas. Their big \n     strategy on oil is to open up the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge to drilling. A recent report by the Energy Information \n     Agency showed that there is anywhere between 5.7 billion and \n     16 billion barrels of ``recoverable'' oil in the refuge. \n     Depending on where the actual number falls in that range, it \n     could eventually reduce the price of oil by between 41 cents \n     and $1.44 a barrel. Given that oil is trading at about $135 a \n     barrel, that's not much--and the price reduction wouldn't \n     occur until 2026. In fact, it would take at least a decade to \n     extract a drop from the refuge even if drilling were approved \n     tomorrow. The land is more valuable as a pristine home for \n     threatened species.\n\n  So, Mr. President, again, everything we have heard this morning, as I \nhave indicated, everything we have heard from the minority is just the \nopposite factually.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course the editorial was critical of \nboth sides, which illustrates the point. In order to function in the \nSenate, the majority leader is not going to be allowed to say: Oh, I \nwill allow you amendments, but I get to pick them. Every time we have \nhad a serious issue come before the Senate, the best offer we have had \nin recent months has been: Oh, sure, we will have amendments, but I \nwant to see them first and there are going to be a limited number. I \ncan't think of much major legislation that has been able to go forward \nthat way unless it enjoys overwhelming support on both sides of the \naisle--for example, the supplemental to provide funding for our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, where we have such broad support that there is \nwidespread cooperation going forward. Normally, the way the Senate \nlegislates is to let the Senate legislate.\n  I mean, my goodness, I mentioned this last week, and I will mention \nit again. The last sort of major, huge piece of legislation related to \nthe environment was the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. We had 180 \namendments in the Senate, and it was a 5-week debate. It was a big, \nmajor, significant proposal in which both sides participated. It was a \ntime in which Senator Mitchell was the Democratic leader and there was \na Republican named Bush in the White House. That is the way we used to \ndo business around here on major environmental legislation.\n  And I would say to my good friend that I understand the demands he \nhas within his conference to protect his members from bad votes and the \ngreat desire to try to shut down the minority, but it just doesn't work \nthat way in the Senate. And I think we ought to, on these big issues \nwhere there is a broad difference of opinion, go to these bills in a \nfreewheeling and open way and explain to Members on both sides--I will \nexplain to mine and he can explain to his--that the price for moving \nlegislation in the Senate is that once in a while you have to cast a \nvote on something you wish you didn't. That is the price for doing \nmajor important legislation. I wish we could get back to that. It is \nobviously not going to happen today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, remember the Orwellian-speak from the other \nside. Everything that my friend has said, just the opposite is factual. \nWe would love to take votes. They won't let us take votes. As with \nglobal warming, we offered two amendments, three amendments, six \namendments, germane, relevant. We tried every possible procedure, and \nthey said: No, you can't do that.\n  Mr. President, that is how we feel about this legislation. We believe \nand we have acknowledged that our legislation is not perfect, but it is \ngood legislation. If we could get to it, we believe it would allow for \ndebate on how to lower gas prices in the short term and, with the \nalternative renewable energy, that it would allow us to look down the \nroad and do something that is very significant for the long term. But \nthey won't let us legislate on anything. For them to come and say: We \ndon't want to take tough votes, well, we will take tough votes, easy \nvotes, medium votes, anything. They won't let us. That is why we have \n75 filibusters, and the number keeps going up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5464-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week the Defense Secretary took \nhistoric action by forcing out both the Air Force Secretary, Michael \nWynne, and its Chief of Staff, Michael Moseley. It was the first time \never that a Defense Secretary has simultaneously dismissed a service \nsecretary and a service chief, and he did so after finding systemic \nproblems in the Air Force that led him to have a serious lack of \nconfidence in their leadership and oversight.\n  I have come to the floor today because Secretary Gates's move raises \nred flags about many of the Air Force's recent actions, including the \ndecision to award a $35 billion contract to build the next generation \nof aerial refueling tankers to the European company Airbus instead of \nBoeing. This is one of the largest contracts in history, and it is \ncritically important. Our tankers refuel planes and aircraft from every \nsingle branch of our military. As long as we control the technology to \nbuild them, we control our skies and we control our own security. So I \nwas astounded when the Air Force announced in February that it would \naward this contract to Airbus, and here is why.\n  Airbus and its parent company, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, \nor EADS, have made no secret of their desire to dismantle the U.S. \naerospace industry, and we have seen time and again that Europe is \nwilling to try anything in order to do that. EADS is so flooded with \nsubsidies from the European Union that we, the United States, have \naccused the EU of illegal business practices before the World Trade \nOrganization. EADS has lied repeatedly about its contribution to the \nU.S. economy, and EADS has given us more than one reason to question \nhow hard it will work to protect our security interests.\n  Given this history, I have asked repeatedly over the last 3 months \nthat Air Force leaders explain how they came to their decision. After \nall, the Air Force is well aware of these concerns, and I believe the \nAmerican taxpayers deserve answers. But I have been stonewalled again \nand again. As the Pentagon moves to restore its leadership in the Air \nForce, I hope we will finally get some answers.\n  Let me begin today by talking about the unfair trade practices that \nled the United States to challenge Europe at the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Back in 1970, several European governments created Airbus to \nchallenge our country's aerospace dominance. But unlike Boeing, which \nis a private business operating in a free-market system, Airbus \nfollowed the corporate welfare model. Europe views Airbus as a jobs \nprogram, and it is willing to provide subsidies no matter what, even if \nthey lose money and even if their products fail. That means Airbus can \ngrow without having to assume the same kind of risk American companies \ndo.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative is so concerned that this has created \nan uneven playing field that we have demanded that Europe stop the \nsubsidies and play by the rules. As I said earlier, because of Europe's \nillegal tactics, our Government now has a WTO case pending against the \nEU. So I think it would make absolutely no sense that we would on the \none hand haul Airbus before an international dispute settlement \norganization while on the other hand award it one of the largest \ndefense contracts in history, a contract that will make it a major U.S. \ndefense supplier for decades and further erode the American aerospace \nindustry. It is as if you caught a thief in the act of stealing your \ncar, but instead of turning him in, you hand him the keys and you give \nhim your wallet too.\n  It is not just a matter of one government branch contradicting \nanother. It was that illegal system that allowed Airbus to develop the \nA330. Airbus's tanker received millions of dollars in launch aid, which \nsignificantly reduced its production costs. Europe is now unfairly \nusing that break to get into our defense industry. The result could be \nsignificant permanent harm to our aerospace industry.\n  Boeing spent decades developing the technology and training the \nworkforce to supply our military tankers. Boeing has made American \nrefueling tankers now for more than 50 years. Our workers have made \nthem with pride because they know they help to fortify our military \nstrength. But with this Air Force decision, we are letting all of that \nslip away. Once our workers move on to something else, we just can't \nrecreate this industry overnight. So I think we, as a Congress and as a \nnation, need to think long and hard about whether that is the best \ndecision for our national security.\n  But it isn't just Europe's record of subsidizing EADS that I am \nconcerned about. EADS and Airbus also have a long history of creating \nslick marketing campaigns that distort their contribution to our \neconomy. So I want to turn to that next because I fear EADS is being \nless than honest about its plans to create jobs with this tanker \ncontract.\n  Five years ago, when Airbus was first working to unravel Boeing's \ntanker contract, Airbus and EADS hired a small army of PR specialists \nto assert to us that their business was good for America.\n  As you can imagine, I was skeptical so I asked the Commerce \nDepartment to investigate their claims, and guess what they found. They \nfound that Airbus's numbers were hugely inflated. Airbus claimed it had \ncreated 100,000 American jobs, but after looking into it the Commerce \nDepartment found the real number was 500. Airbus said it contracted \nwith 800 U.S. firms. The Commerce Department found it was 250.\n  Then Airbus did something funny--it decreased the number of contracts \nit said it made from 800 down to 300, and then it increased the alleged \nvalue of those contracts from $5 billion to $6 billion a year.\n  As I said at the time, you cannot trust Airbus's funny numbers. The \nsame is true today. When you scrutinize the facts, Airbus's numbers do \nnot hold up. This time, Airbus says it will finish these tankers here \nin the United States at a factory in Alabama. But there is no plant in \nAlabama. It has not been built and there are no workers yet hired.\n  Economists are now saying we are actually going to lose jobs if \nAirbus supplies our tankers. A study last week by the nonpartisan \nEconomic Policy Institute shows that Boeing would create at least twice \nas many American jobs as Airbus. In other words, we stand to lose as \nmany as 14,000 jobs here in the United States with this Air Force \ncontract to Airbus. I cannot think of a worse time for our Nation to \nhave this decision. Last month our country saw the biggest increase in \nunemployment in more than two decades, and that was on top of the \nmortgage and credit crisis and the skyrocketing gas prices we have been \nhearing about this morning.\n  The Air Force said it did not have to consider jobs when it \nconsidered Airbus's bid, so it has not even tried to justify that \ndecision. But I believe that as Members of Congress who represent the \nAmerican people, we have a responsibility to look long and hard at \nwhether this contract is in the best interests of America, its workers, \nand its economy--especially at a time when our families are struggling \nto get by.\n  Finally, I have some very serious concerns about giving a company \nowned by foreign governments control over our military technology. \nAirbus and EADS have given us plenty of reason to worry about how hard \nthey might work to protect our security interests. Let me give a couple \nof examples. In 2005, EADS was caught trying to sell military \nhelicopters to Iran. Despite our concern about Iran's support of \nterrorists in Iraq and despite their efforts to develop nuclear \nweapons, they were caught trying to sell military helicopters to Iran. \nIn 2006, EADS tried to sell C-295 and CN-235 transport and patrol \nplanes to Venezuela. That is a circumvention of United States law.\n  As with the other questions I have raised today, I have repeatedly \nasked the Air Force whether we, the United States, can trust a foreign \ncompany to\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nkeep our military's best interests in mind, particularly one that has a \nhistory of trying to sell weapons of military technology to unfriendly \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have not received answers to those \nquestions either. This is a critically important matter. What happens \nif France or Russia--which, by the way, is pushing to increase its \nstake in EADS--want to slow down our military capacity because they do \nnot like our policies? Do we want another country to have that kind of \ncontrol for decades to come--especially given the concerns the Defense \nSecretary has now raised about decisionmaking and leadership at the Air \nForce? I think we have to push for an explanation before we move \nforward on this contract.\n  I have detailed this morning three very serious concerns about Airbus \nand EADS. The facts are clear. When it comes to international trade, \nEADS doesn't play fair. It has repeatedly lied about its impact on our \neconomy and it has more than once given us reason to worry about how \nhard it will work to protect our security interests.\n  The bidding process for the tanker contract was so flawed that Boeing \nfiled its first ever protest of a defense contract decision with the \nGAO, and we are waiting for that decision. But we need to remember the \nGAO can only look at whether the Air Force followed the procurement \nlaws and regulations. It cannot answer whether the Air Force should \nhave awarded that contract in the first place. We, Congress, have to \nask those questions.\n  I have raised those questions in hearings, in letters to Pentagon \nofficials, and in face-to-face meetings, yet no one at the Air Force or \nthe Pentagon or the White House has begun to justify why we should \naward a $35 billion contract to supply the linchpin of our military \nstrength to a company that another branch of our Government has accused \nof illegal business practices, one that distorts its records, and does \nnot have our national security interests at heart.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the Defense Secretary has \nraised serious questions about the leadership and oversight at the Air \nForce. Given those concerns, we here in the Senate and the Congress \nmust examine this contract carefully, demand the Air Force explain its \ndecision, and consider whether it is in our Nation's best interests to \nmove forward on this contract. We owe it to our taxpayers. We owe it to \nour servicemembers. I hope with new leadership and oversight at Air \nForce, we will get those answers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5466-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \ngreat Arkansan, a fellow--I am holding his picture up here--whom most \nAmericans do not recognize. Pretty much everybody in Arkansas knows \nhim. He is a household name in our State.\n  It is with great pleasure I rise today to honor the career of a great \nArkansan, a track and field icon, known not just in Arkansas but around \nthe world. Following the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships \nthis week, Coach John McDonnell will retire after 36 years at The \nUniversity of Arkansas.\n  Walking past the trophy cases lining Bud Walton Arena at the \nUniversity of Arkansas, you will note the Razorback track team has been \na winner over and over again under the leadership of Coach John \nMcDonnell. He has accumulated more National Championships than any \nother coach in the history of college athletics. But his commitment to \ntrack and the UofA goes beyond the finish line. His athletes will tell \nyou that Coach McDonnell motivated them and set high standards on and \noff the track. He taught them about integrity, character and teamwork--\ntraits they continue to apply in their career and lives today.\n  Dr. B. Alan Sugg, president of the University of Arkansas system, \nsaid it best when he described Coach McDonnell as ``a world-class coach \nbecause he is a world-class leader.''\n  He started his track career at Southwestern Louisiana, now Louisiana-\nLafayette, where he was a six-time All-American in cross country and \ntrack. He also was the 1966-67 AAU 3,000-meter champion, and he won the \nmile at the 1966 British Selection Games.\n  He began helping other athletes achieve their own success as a coach \nfor 2 years at New Providence, NJ and at Lafayette, LA before embarking \non a dedicated and determined career coaching the Razorbacks. He \naccepted the job at Arkansas over a similar offer from Oklahoma, he \nsays, because the terrain of northwest Arkansas reminded him of his \nhome in Ireland.\n  I am going to hold up a sign here. When you drive into Fayetteville, \nyou see this sign. It says, ``Welcome to Fayetteville, Track Capital of \nthe World; 42 NCAA Track and Field Championships.'' You will notice \nthis ``42'' is like a little flip chart because we won so many times, I \nthink after maybe 25 or so, the highway department said we can't keep \nreplacing this sign every time he wins a title, so now all they do is \nchange that number out. Let me tell you, it changes frequently.\n  His record of wins as a coach is remarkable. He has won 42 NCAA \nNational Championships since 1984: 11 in cross country, 19 indoor track \nchampionships, and 12 outdoor track championships. This includes 12 \nconsecutive NCAA indoor track championships from 1984-1995. During this \nstreak he won the triple crown five times including three in a row from \n1991-1994.\n  He has been relentless in his pursuit of conference championships as \nwell, winning 84 conference championships since 1974 including 38 in \nthe old Southwest Conference and 46 in the Southeastern Conference. Did \nI mention 20 conference triple crowns since 1982, including 8 straight \nbetween 1987-1995?\n  Alberto Salazar, a Nike executive and world-class marathoner said \n``John McDonnell has been the most successful and the best coach in the \nUnited States from the 1980s on.'' He goes on to say, ``his teams have \ncontinued to get better and better . . . he has set the standard for \nall other coaches to follow.''\n  While being a winning coach he also focused on development of his \nstudent-athletes, coaching 185 track All-Americans who combined have \nearned 652 All-America honors. He has coached 23 Olympians, spanning \nthree decades and six different Olympic Games. Mike Conley won a gold \nmedal in Barcelona and a silver medal in Los Angeles, Matt Hemingway \nearned silver in Athens, and Calvin Davis a bronze in Atlanta.\n  Seven-time NCAA champion and Olympian Alistair Cragg said:\n\n       I am his creation . . . I came in here out of shape and had \n     quit running. He's got that hand on your shoulder that you \n     know you can't mess up, but if you do that you're not going \n     to mess up on your own. You can go into any race or \n     competition with a lot of confidence. When he says you're \n     ready, you're ready. It's a reassurance.\n\n  Moreover, Coach McDonnell produced 55 individual national champions. \nHis athletes hold 22 records, including Daniel Lincoln who holds the \nOutdoor American record for the 3,000M Steeplechase and Tyson Gay who \nholds the 200M record at the Outdoor World Championships.\n  Coach McDonnell will continue to inspire student-athletes and coaches \nalike. A physical legacy has been established by the new state of the \nart ``John McDonnell Field''--a new 10,000 seat outdoor venue which \nopened in 2006 at the University of Arkansas. Accompanying that is the \nRandal Tyson\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\nTrack Center, a world-class indoor facility that opened in 2001.\n  ``John built this program,'' says Mike Conley, a five-time NCAA \nchampion at Arkansas and the 1992 gold medal winner in the Olympic \ntriple jump.\n\n       When he recruited me and the others who eventually won the \n     school's first national Triple Crown, there weren't any \n     facilities to speak of. We came because we believed in him \n     and what he thought he could do at Arkansas. The facilities \n     came later because of his success.\n\n  With much humility and a sense of humor, Coach McDonnell has been \nnamed National Coach of the Year 12 times in indoor track, 11 times in \noutdoor track and 7 times in cross country.\n  That is a total of 30 National Coach of the Year honors. I do not \nwant to forget about the 50 times he has been named Conference Coach of \nthe Year, and the 62 times he was awarded Region Coach. The most recent \naward was winning the 2008 SEC Coach of the Year for outdoor track.\n  It goes without saying Coach McDonnell has been inducted into the \nU.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Hall of Fame, the \nUniversity of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor, the Arkansas Sports Hall \nof Fame, the University of Southwestern Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame, \nand the Mayo Hall of Fame.\n  Coaches and teachers live within our hearts and our minds for years. \nWe remember their drills, their training and their sayings and only \nlater realize the full impact they have had on our lives. Coach \nMcDonnell is one of those coaches.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in thanking and recognizing \nCoach John McDonnell on his outstanding career and his positive \ninfluence for so many Razorback athletes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, today I rise to urge passage of S. 3101, \nthe Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act.\n  This is the right bill for America's seniors and the health care \nproviders who treat them. It is a balanced bill, and it enjoys strong \nbipartisan support.\n  It hasn't been easy to get to this point. I have engaged in earnest \nnegotiations with Senator Grassley, Minority Leader McConnell, and the \nadministration to reach a compromise on this bill.\n  After several weeks of talks, it became clear that we would not be \nable to reach agreement on a bill that is fair to both rural and urban \nareas, and that balances the need to help America's seniors with the \nneed to address the pending payment cut for Medicare providers.\n  So I have worked with Democrats and willing Republicans to craft this \nlegislation, the right legislation, and I urge all Senators to \nenthusiastically support it.\n  There is urgency in this call for support. We must act now to block \nthe cuts that Medicare's doctors will face on July 1.\n  This legislation gives doctors a decent, measured increase in \nreimbursement that doesn't explode costs or excessively raise premiums.\n  It includes provisions to improve the quality of care that is \nprovided and, as is so urgently needed, increases access to primary \ncare.\n  It will also save lives and reduce costs by requiring doctors to use \ne-prescribing by 2011 whenever they give Medicare patients \nprescriptions.\n  But the legislation goes further. It also takes care of America's \nseniors.\n  First, it expands access to preventive services. Preventive care can \nidentify health problems before they become health catastrophes.\n  To help beneficiaries identify medical conditions and risk factors \nearly, this bill allows new preventive services to be added to the \nprogram, so long as they are recommended by the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force and are approved through regular regulatory \nchannels.\n  Second, the bill finally gets rid of the discriminatory copayment \nrates for seniors with mental illnesses.\n  Many older Americans experience depression and other mental health \nproblems, but Medicare currently requires a much higher copayment for \nmental health services.\n  That copayment is 50 percent, compared to the 20 percent required for \nphysical health care services.\n  This legislation lowers copayments for seniors' mental health \nservices until they match other copays, making sure that seniors can \nafford the screening and treatment they need.\n  The bill also expands the drug benefit's coverage to include \nbenzodiazepines and barbiturates used for epilepsy and mental health \ntreatment.\n  Third, for low-income seniors this act expands programs that help \nwith their out-of-pocket costs. Medicare pays many health costs for \nseniors, but some low-income beneficiaries need extra help to afford \neven basic care.\n  And although subsidies are available through the Medicare Savings \nPrograms, or MSPs, beneficiaries must prove their assets are low enough \nto qualify.\n  The assets test for these programs has not been raised since 1989--\neven though the cost of living, and certainly the cost of medical care, \nhave increased astronomically since then.\n  The bill takes an important step to improve access for these \nbeneficiaries by increasing the level of savings that MSP applicants \nmay have and still qualify for help.\n  We also discount the value of life insurance policies and financial \nhelp from churches or family members from counting against a senior's \neligibility for assistance.\n  Fourth, this bill protects seniors from unscrupulous marketing \npractices by private health plans.\n  Countless reports have surfaced about aggressive, fraudulent and even \nabusive sales and marketing practices used by Medicare Advantage plans, \nthe private plan option in Medicare.\n  This legislation builds on the CMS-proposed rule to ban abusive \nmarketing of Medicare Advantage and other plans once and for all. \nMarketing abuses are extensive. This legislation stops that.\n  The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act takes \nimportant steps to shore up our health care system in rural areas.\n  It ensures that hospitals in these areas get the resources they need \nto keep their doors open, and expands access to tele-health services.\n  It also includes important relief for ambulance providers and \nphysicians serving rural areas.\n  Pharmacy payments are another area where the legislation makes \nimportant improvements.\n  Pharmacies are an integral part of the health care infrastructure in \nAmerica.\n  Prescription drugs play a huge role in medical treatment, and many \npeople see their pharmacists more regularly than their physicians.\n  Pharmacists are also vital to the ongoing success of the Part D \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Changes in this bill, including fairer and more timely payments to \nthose who dispense drugs to our nation's senior citizens, can make the \nbenefit work better for pharmacists, and thereby for seniors.\n  Furthermore, this act would save valuable Medicare dollars by \nproviding one, fully bundled payment for all end-stage renal disease-\nrelated services.\n  This will improve the quality of care these vulnerable beneficiaries \nreceive by balancing incentives and instituting a rigorous quality \nimprovement program.\n  And, for the first time, dialysis facilities will receive a \npermanent, market-based update to their payments each year, to make \nsure that Medicare payments keep up with their costs.\n  One of the questions I am asked most about is how this bill would \naddress Medicare Advantage payments.\n  Federal spending for private Medicare Advantage, MA, benefit plans, \nincluding health maintenance organizations, preferred provider \norganizations, and private fee-for-service plans, has grown rapidly \nsince Congress increased payments for MA in the Medicare Modernization \nAct of 2003.\n  CBO tells us that the Federal Government will pay these private plans \n$74 billion in 2008, at a rate 13 percent higher than traditional \nMedicare fee-for-service providers receive.\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\n  In sum, every Medicare beneficiary in the country, regardless of \nwhether they are enrolled in an MA plan or remain in traditional fee \nfor service, will pay $2 extra per month to subsidize these extra \npayment rates.\n  Private fee-for-service plans, in particular, get a special deal that \ncosts taxpayers and beneficiaries alike.\n  The law doesn't require these plans to sign contracts with hospitals \nor doctors, rather, providers are ``deemed'' part of the network. And \nplans can pay these providers 100 percent of traditional fee-for-\nservice rates even as they receive 117 percent of that rate in \nreimbursement from Medicare.\n  They are also exempt from reporting quality measures that all other \nplans must report. In other words, they have a good deal. Too good of a \ndeal.\n  Another, and just as obvious, example of how Medicare pays these \nplans too much is the double payment for indirect medical education, \nIME. So-called IME payments are intended to defray the higher patient \ncare costs at facilities with graduate medical education programs.\n  But these payments are made twice: once to the facility itself, and \nagain to Medicare Advantage plans, with no requirement that plans pass \nthe IME funding along to teaching hospitals.\n  This bill will save taxpayers $13 billion over 5 years by requiring \nprivate-fee-for-service plans to form provider networks and eliminating \nthe double payment for IME to MA plans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It will also require private fee-for-service plans to \nreport on quality measures like other plans are required to do.\n  Some in the Senate, and many in the Bush administration, oppose any \nreforms to private fee-for-service plans.\n  They oppose protecting beneficiaries from private plans' unscrupulous \nmarketing practices.\n  Just as regretfully, they oppose expanding access that poor seniors \nhave to assistance with their out-of-pocket costs, and to evidence-\nbased preventive services.\n  So now we in the Congress have a choice. We can protect private \nhealth insurance plans. We can leave low-income beneficiaries behind.\n  We can neglect our obligations to ensure that the Medicare program \nworks for all seniors or we can do the right thing.\n  We can pass meaningful, bipartisan Medicare legislation that, yes, \nblocks the cuts to physician payments, which is absolutely crucial, but \nwhich does so much more, that brings much-needed relief to rural areas, \nimproves quality, and cuts costs in the appropriate places.\n  That is what we ought to do. That is what America's seniors deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this balanced legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMissouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5468-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5468-S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I have said before on this floor, I think \nit is time for us to get real about energy. It is time for us to get \nreal about lowering gas prices.\n  The American people, as we all know if we have listened to our folks \nwhen we go back home, are suffering from record-high prices of \ngasoline.\n  Now, in response to the record pain at the pump, the American people \ndeserve something more than legislative gimmicks that raise taxes, \nincrease litigation or provide political favors. It is a startling \nplace many of our Democratic friends now find themselves in. They seem \nto believe that for every problem there is a tax increase that can \nhelp.\n  If there is someone you do not like or want to take a shot at, raise \ntheir taxes. You have a problem that needs fixing, raise the taxes. We \nsaw that with the climate debate last week. To address the issue of \nclimate change, the bill proposed, and the amendment we did not adopt \nlast week proposed, to raise energy prices $6.7 trillion to lower \nenergy demand and pay for new Government programs and spending.\n  With record-high prices for gasoline, climate sponsors wanted to \nraise gas prices a further 53 cents by 2030 and $1.40 by 2050. This \nweek brought a new attempt to raise taxes. Well, last week some \nquibbled about whether the $6.7 trillion in higher energy prices was a \nhidden tax or a hidden fee. It did not make much difference to the \npeople who would pay it. There was no hiding from the fact that a tax \nincrease is what the Democrats proposed this week.\n  This week they proposed raising taxes on the exploration and \ndevelopment of new oil supplies. You know, folks back home cannot \nbelieve that. Those looking for new sources of oil for the American \npeople would pay higher taxes to find and deliver that oil to us. I \nhave a hard time believing that too.\n  But we folks from Missouri do not take words at their face value. We \ncall ourselves the Show-Me State for a reason. You need to show us how \nraising taxes would help this situation. For me, personally, I have not \never seen a time when raising taxes on something lowered its price or \nproduced more of it.\n  I think our minority leader pointed out the Los Angeles Times said \nraising taxes to deal with the oil supply was similar to a \nclimatologist saying trees caused global warming.\n  Well, it is economics 101, folks. Raise taxes, you get less of it. \nYou increase exploration and development and you get more of it and you \nlower the price. In this case we actually have the experience about \nwhat President Carter did. In the mid-1970s, he pushed through higher \ntaxes on domestic oil production.\n  What a disaster that was. Oil companies reduced their U.S. domestic \noperations and went overseas. The result was a greater U.S. dependance \non oil from the Middle East, which continues today. Why our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle would want to return us to the days of \nJimmy Carter, I do not understand.\n  It may feel good to some people to propose hurting American consumers \nby putting a tax on the oil industry or on the executives, it may sound \ngood, but it winds up hurting the American people. The Democrat bill \nfailed to get support. It contained other provisions that would hurt \nconsumers as well.\n  One section would allow the Department of Justice to sue, to sue \nthose countries for their membership and participation in OPEC. Now, \nthat is a feel-good provision as long as you do not think about what \nwould happen. How can anyone doubt that an OPEC country facing the \nprospects of U.S. lawsuits--if we could have jurisdiction over them, \nand I question that--would stop selling oil to the United States and \ntake their oil someplace else, such as China.\n  Again, the Democrat bill would hurt suffering Americans by driving \noil supplies away from the United States for fear of litigation.\n  Speaking of litigation, we sure didn't hear much from supporters of \nthe bill about the $1.6 billion in tax breaks for trial lawyers hidden \nin the legislation to extend renewable energy tax credits. Section 311 \nwould allow trial lawyers working on contingency $1.6 billion in tax \nbreaks. Apparently, the suffering of trial lawyers is more important to \nsome in the Democratic Party than the suffering of the American people \npaying record prices at the pump. The tax breaks for trial lawyers is \none section before the tax provisions before film and television \nproducers. Section 312 modifies tax deductions for domestic film and \ntelevision production. It gives special tax treatment for U.S. actors, \ndirectors, and producers.\n  Obviously, I support tax breaks for U.S. workers. But why does the \nDemocratic Party think tax breaks for American actors are more \nimportant than price relief for moms and dads suffering record gas \nprices?\n  Why does the party on the other side think tax breaks for Hollywood \nfilm producers are more important than price relief for American \ntruckers suffering record diesel prices?\n  At the same time the Democratic bill is giving tax breaks to trial \nlawyers in Hollywood, they are blocking the American people getting new \noil supplies they need to bring gas prices down. I am a cosponsor of a \nbill entitled ``The American Energy Production Act of 2008.'' If \nenacted, this legislation\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nwould produce up to 24 billion barrels of oil from U.S. domestic \nsources. The bill would allow environmentally friendly access to \nroughly 10 billion barrels of recoverable oil in northern Alaska.\n  I challenge anyone who opposes opening access to Alaskan oil to read \nthe bill and see all of the environmental requirements it contains. I \nchallenge them, if they haven't done so, to go to the North Slope of \nthe Bering Sea and see the drilling going on at Prudhoe Bay 45 miles to \nthe west of ANWR. They have been drilling there. They drill in an \nenvironmentally friendly way. They have to put the roads in in \nmidwinter, when it is 200 degrees below zero. They are rock roads. They \ndon't disturb the environment. As a matter of fact, the caribou love \nthem. The caribou herds are flourishing. The wolves are great. The \nflowers are just as good as they are elsewhere. The mosquitos are just \nas big as they are in the lower part of Alaska. That drilling is being \ndone without environmental damage.\n  About 30 miles to the east Canada is drilling. Several hundred miles \nto the west Russia is drilling. They are producing significant amounts \nof oil. Oil drilling in Alaska or exploration in the deep sea or \nrecovering oil from shale would take advantage of the latest, most \nmodern, environmentally friendly drilling and development technology. \nToday we have modern oil rigs that can drill down and then virtually \nsideways far beneath sensitive surface areas needing protection. Oil \nrigs at sea are now so safe they can withstand hurricanes without \nspilling a drop of oil.\n  There are thousands of oil rigs off the coast of Louisiana. Did \nanyone hear a report about an oil spill after Hurricane Katrina? No. \nBecause it didn't happen.\n  This is the kind of environmentally protective technology we would \nuse to open oil reserves in the seabed off America's coasts. Experts \nknow of at least 14 billion barrels of oil off our Atlantic and Pacific \ncoasts so far out to sea they couldn't be seen from shore. There may be \nmany more. There are much higher estimates. This number is probably an \nunderstatement because they have not even mapped many of these areas \nand explored for oil reserves. We also have a massive supply of oil in \noil shale in the mountains of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. The shale is \nso thick with oil one can smell and feel it in the rocks. With oil at \n$10 a barrel, it was too cheap to make oil shale affordable in the \n1970s and 1980s, but prices at even half of today's level would be \nenough to unlock U.S. oil reserves in shale: roughly 2 trillion, it is \nestimated, barrels of oil, and that is seven times the reserves of \nSaudi Arabia.\n  Why should we be begging OPEC or Saudi Arabia for more oil when we \nhave seven times the oil Saudi Arabia has in that one area alone?\n  Opponents say no. They give us the NIMBY treatment--not in my \nbackyard. Unfortunately, they don't limit themselves to blocking action \nin their backyards. They limit everybody else's backyard as well.\n  We had a classic vote in the Appropriations Committee in May--\nunfortunately, a straight party-line vote--whether to lift the \nmoratorium and allow the preparation for environmentally friendly \nexploration and development of shale oil. Fifteen of my Democratic \ncolleagues voted no; 14 Republican Senators, including me, voted for \nopening it. We failed. In Alaska, the people fully support opening \nnorthern Alaska to further environmentally safe oil extraction. It is \nthe elected representatives of other States far below to the east of \nAlaska who want to thwart the will of the people of Alaska.\n  The people of Virginia fully support opening oil reserves in the deep \nocean off their shores, but elected officials from California and other \nStates from the West want to thwart Virginia's desire. The people of \nUtah support opening the oil reserves under their mountains, but it is \nthe interest groups in Washington, DC, and other States that are \nthwarting the people of Utah.\n  The people of my State don't understand why we are blocking access to \nU.S. oil reserves. They don't understand why we are withholding new \nsupplies needed to get prices down. They don't understand why we are \ndenying ourselves the relief we need and deserve.\n  In my State we mine lead. Lead has environmental problems. We have to \ndeal with the environmental problems, and we do. There is only one \nsimple reason we mine for lead. We have 90 percent of the lead in the \nUnited States, and it is needed for technology. But at the same time on \nenergy, we in Missouri are working hard to develop new, clean sources \nof fuel and ways to reduce energy demand.\n  Kansas City, MO, is a national leader in hybrid cars and the advanced \nvehicle batteries they need. We have a Ford plant where Missouri \nautoworkers assemble the Escape hybrid SUV. We also have a GM plant \nwhere they assemble hybrid SUVs and sedans. In the Kansas City area, we \nhave an advanced battery manufacturer producing the next generation \nlithium-ion batteries. They use a polymer technology to improve \nperformance and safety. Our military is taking advantage of this \ntechnology now, and someday it will go into our automobiles. Trying to \nstay one step ahead, we are also working on the next generation of \nhybrid cars. Right after these remarks, I intend to go outside to the \narea we call the swamp, just northeast of the Capitol, to see a plug-in \nhybrid Ford Escape brought to town for the Department of Energy.\n\n  Plug-in technology would allow us to begin to travel the first 40 \nmiles of every trip on electricity, without burning a drop of gas. Many \nfamilies and commuters in the city could go the entire week back and \nforth to work burning no gasoline. Rural folks and farmers could drive \ntheir trucks with plug-in hybrid technology into town and around the \nfarm. Then, when they need to haul a load great distances, the \ntraditional engine would automatically kick in.\n  I introduced an amendment to the climate bill last week which would \nhave helped workers, the environment, and costs for Americans by \nstarting the U.S. domestic manufacturing supply base for hybrid \nbatteries for automobiles. Hybrid cars are more expensive than \ntraditional cars because their hybrid batteries are made in low \nquantities in Japan, Korea, and China. Not surprisingly, those firms \nfavor their Japanese and Korean auto manufacturers, and whatever is \nleft comes to U.S. carmakers. The answer to this problem is mass U.S. \nproduction that will produce hybrid batteries in high volumes and cause \nprices to fall, putting thousands of U.S. workers in good manufacturing \njobs in Missouri and across the Nation. It would be a win/win \nsituation--good for the environment, reducing oil demand; good for \nconsumers who need cheaper cars that burn less gas; and good for \nworkers needing good-paying jobs at home.\n  I introduced an amendment that would have provided Federal funds. \nUnfortunately, that amendment, like others, was blocked from \nconsideration by climate bill sponsors. I will continue to fight for a \ncommonsense proposal, and that is what we need. We need to get past \ngimmicks, charges, and countercharges, taxes, ranting and railing and \nlawsuits. The American people need fundamental relief for a fundamental \nproblem: prices are high. There is too much demand, not enough supply. \nIt is economics 101, as I said. We need a comprehensive solution that \nprovides the American people with more supply and less demand and also \nwith more environmentally clean solutions.\n  Last year we addressed demand through higher, newer, aggressive but \nachievable CAFE auto efficiency standards. Yet, as we have seen, demand \nstrategies have not stopped the record increase in prices. We need to \naddress supply--billions and billions of barrels of oil on our land, \nunder our land, off our shores, in our mountains. That is what the \nAmerican people need--not gimmicks, not increases in taxes, not more \nlitigation, not tax breaks for trial lawyers or Hollywood.\n  I urge my colleagues, it is time. Let's get real about our energy \nstrategy so we can provide Americans the real relief they deserve and \nwe ought to be providing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nBrownback follow my time with 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the most important \nissue on the minds of my constituents in Georgia and, I know, folks all \nover the country; that is, skyrocketing gas prices. I hear from \nhundreds of Georgians every day who are struggling to fill their gas \ntanks to get to work or to take their kids to school or to run their \nnecessary errands. They want to know what Congress is doing about these \nout-of-control gas prices.\n  Nobody disputes the fact that the United States is dependent on \nforeign sources of oil, and nobody disputes that this problem has been \nin the making for any number of years. We currently import more than 60 \npercent of our oil and, over the past 30 years, we have reduced our \ndomestic exploration options and left our refining capacity stagnant. \nBut we can do something to provide relief to American families who are \nreally feeling the pain at the pump. If we can do something about it, \nthe obvious question is, Why aren't we?\n  Let's look, first, at what the Democratic response has been to high \ngas prices. Yesterday, we voted on a so-called energy bill proposed by \nthe majority. The two highlights of this bill to address skyrocketing \ngas prices are, first, sue OPEC. The Democrats want to sue the \nindividuals we are doing business with as a means of lowering gas \nprices. This is hard to understand. Second, the Democrats propose to \nput a windfall profits tax on big oil companies that are certainly \nachieving big profits in today's market in the petroleum industry.\n  I had a group of businessmen from Georgia in my office yesterday. \nThey were small businesspeople, but they were all from the same \nindustry.\n  I said: OK, let me ask you this. If the Federal Government walked \ninto your office and said, we are going to put a windfall profits tax \non you; we are simply going to raise your taxes by an extraordinary \namount, what would be your reaction?\n  They said: It is pretty simple. We would do two things. First, we \nwould try to reduce our profits below a point where we would not be \nsubject to a windfall profits tax, and that means we would decrease \nproduction. The second thing we would do is, if we had a tax that we \nhad to live with, we would pass it on to our customers.\n  Again, to think that a windfall profits tax on oil companies is going \nto decrease the price of gasoline is somewhat foolish.\n  What has been the Republican response? Where should we go? There are \nvery clearly four separate issues that need to be addressed with \nrespect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices. The first one has just \nbeen alluded to by Senator Bond from Missouri; that is, we simply need \nto take advantage of additional resources we have inside the United \nStates. We, as Republicans, have sought to do that.\n  On May 13, less than a month ago, Senator Domenici and Senator \nMcConnell proposed an amendment to expand exploration in the ANWR \nregion of Alaska and to authorize drilling in offshore coastal waters \ncurrently subject to a Federal moratorium--in other words, deep-sea \nexploration. This amendment was defeated. Mr. President, 43 Republicans \nvoted for the amendment; 48 Democrats voted against the amendment.\n  So once again, as is known throughout the country, Republicans are \nconsistently advocating--and have for all of the 14 years I have been \nprivileged to serve in the Congress--exploration for more domestic oil \nin this country to alleviate our problem, while the Democrats continue \nto oppose measures to explore domestically.\n  Now, of the four things we need to do, certainly exploration for more \noil is one of those. We do have a lot of capacity in this country that \nhas simply gone unexplored over the years. There is deep-sea \nexploration available to us. There is oil in the ANWR region of Alaska, \nwhich we have consistently sought to explore, as well as now we know \nthat in the Rocky Mountains of our great country, we have a greater \nresource of oil than exists in Saudi Arabia. It is simply imperative \nthat we explore more from a domestic standpoint.\n  Secondly, supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our \neconomy. We simply have to implore our oil companies to provide more \ngasoline to Americans. We are seeing today more people driving to the \ngas pump than ever before in the history of our country simply because \nof the increase in the population. Our economy has done pretty well in \nthe last several years. People are traveling more than ever before. We \nmust have the capability to provide the kind of supply that is demanded \nby Americans.\n  Thirdly, we have to continue down the road of researching and \ndeveloping more alternative fuels. Historically in this country, we \nhave shied away from that. We have seen the development of ethanol \nprimarily in one region of our country, the Midwest. But when you get \nto the Northeast or the Southeast or even, for the most part, the far \nWest, you simply do not see a supply of ethanol. It is concentrated in \none part of our country. But that is changing. It is changing now, and \nwe are seeing more production facilities built in all parts of the \ncountry.\n  But there is an unintended consequence that nobody thought about. We \nhave 101 ethanol-producing facilities online in this country today. We \nhave another 100 ethanol manufacturing facilities that are scheduled to \ncome online in this country in the next 14 to 18 months. All but two of \nthose facilities are producing ethanol from corn. The unintended \nconsequence we have seen due to the high demand of corn for energy \nproduction is an increase in food prices. Corn, wheat, soybeans, \npeanuts, or other commodities have simply increased in price because of \nthe demand for corn; therefore, farmers are planting more corn and less \nof the other commodities. That is the unintended consequence.\n  I am very proud of the fact that in the farm bill we just passed we \naddressed the issue, that we ought not to incentivize the production of \nadditional ethanol from corn. But what we have done in that farm bill \nis to provide funding for research--grant money as well as loan money--\nas well as funding for the construction of additional ethanol and \nbiodiesel facilities to be resourced not with corn but with cellulosic-\nbased products.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a part of the country where corn can \nbe grown in great quantities and great quality, I might say. But in the \nsoutheastern part of the United States, because of our hot weather and \nour soil is not as rich and our rainfall is not as consistent as the \nmidwest part of the country, we cannot grow corn the way it can be \ngrown in the Midwest.\n  But there is one thing we can grow like nobody else; that is, a pine \ntree. What we are seeing in Georgia today is the construction of an \nethanol-producing facility that is going to be resourced with pine \ntrees. It is one of two facilities that are under construction in the \ncountry today where cellulosic products are, in fact, going to be used. \nSo I am very proud of the fact that in that farm bill we have sought to \nincentivize additional production of ethanol from cellulosic-based \nproducts.\n  The fourth thing we have to do--Americans have been very spoiled. We \nare used to getting in our car and going where we want to go when we \nwant to go, and when the time comes when we have finished our business \nand want to move on, we are used to getting in our vehicle and moving \non, by ourselves for the most part. That simply has to change. We have \nto implement conservation practices from a personal household \nstandpoint like we never imagined we would have to do in this country.\n  From a political, legislative policymaking standpoint, we have put \nsome measures in place that are going to dictate to the automobile \nmanufacturing industry that they have to develop automobiles that get \nhigher miles per gallon. That is good. But we also have to implement \nsome personal measures to make sure we truly do have conservation \npractices in place.\n  I had a constituent say to me just the other day: Saxby, I don't \nunderstand this issue of why we are not exploring for more oil \ndomestically when everywhere I go, people tell me, why aren't we \nexploring for more oil that we know we have in America? He said: What \nyou ought to do is call for a national referendum on this, and let's \nsee what the American people, by and large, think of this issue.\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\n  It is difficult, frankly, to do that, although I think it is a very \ngood idea. I would like to know what the masses in other parts of the \ncountry think. I certainly know what they think in my part of the \nworld. But there is one thing very similar that I think should be \nconsidered.\n  I note that just yesterday, the American Solutions for Winning the \nFuture announced that over half a million Americans have signed a \npetition online urging Congress to immediately start exploring for oil \ndomestically to lower gasoline prices. Now, here is the way the \npetition reads:\n\n       We, therefore, the undersigned citizens of the United \n     States, petition the U.S. Congress to act immediately to \n     lower gasoline prices (and diesel and other fuel prices) by \n     authorizing the exploration of proven energy reserves to \n     reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources from unstable \n     countries.\n\n  According to American Solutions' resource data, 81 percent of the \nAmerican people support the United States using more of its own \ndomestic energy resources to combat the rising cost of energy. I cannot \nsay that I am surprised by that statistic, but I think it further \nunderscores how Senator Domenici's bill is a commonsense plan for \nlowering gas prices for Americans, and doing it now.\n  Another commonsense solution Republicans have offered, which I have \nsupported, was proposed by Senator McCain. This would provide an \nimmediate Federal gas tax holiday. What does this mean to our American \nconsumers? Well, here we are going into the summer when travel \ncertainly increases. If this bill passed, as soon as tomorrow, if it \ngot to the President's desk and he signed it, each and every American \ncould be paying 18.4 cents per gallon less for gasoline and 24.4 cents \nper gallon less for diesel fuel.\n  The Democrats promised leading up to the November 2006 elections that \nif you send the majority of Democrats to Congress, we are going to \naddress this issue of gasoline prices, we are going to get prices under \ncontrol. Well, at the time Senator Reid became majority leader, at the \ntime Congresswoman Pelosi became the Speaker of the House, the price of \na gallon of gasoline in this country was $2.33. Today, average prices \nhave increased by $1.71 cents per gallon over that last year and a \nhalf.\n  We all know summertime is the time when families take an annual \nvacation. Americans generally drive more during this time of the year. \nGiving a temporary gas tax holiday until Labor Day is a pure short-term \npolicy and will benefit Americans only in the short term, but I think \nit is another way we can provide immediate relief to American families.\n  This is an issue that ought not to be partisan in nature. It is an \nissue all Americans are feeling every single day. It is an issue we as \npolicymakers should address. It is an issue that cries out for strong \nleadership in Washington today. We need to see that leadership come \nforth out of this body. We need to see the American people given some \nrelief and given a long-term solution to this issue of gas prices; \notherwise, the next generation is going to be looking at much higher \nenergy costs than what we are looking at today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nRepublican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' comments, \nfrom both Missouri and Georgia, and I agree on the energy issues. I \nhave been traveling across all of Kansas, going to all 105 counties. I \nhave been in nearly 70 so far, and the dominant issue by far is the \nprice of energy. People want to get these prices down.\n  The key to supply and demand is to get more supply as fast as we can. \nWork on demand as far as being conservation-minded but not to increase \ntaxes. Increasing taxes--things such as a windfall profits tax--does \nnot get you another drop of fuel. It only raises the price. I do not \nknow of anything we have increased taxes on where you end up getting it \nfor less price. It just does not work that way.\n  So I support my colleagues' statements on that, and I hope the \nAmerican people are looking at that issue and seeing that here is a way \nof increasing production but not raising taxes. What the Republicans \nhave put forward is an increase-energy-production bill, and what the \nDemocrats have put forward is an increase-energy-tax bill. I hope \npeople can decide which of these will likely get them lower prices. It \nis production, it is not increasing taxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5471-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5471-S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I also wish to inform and talk briefly \nto my colleagues about a major GAO study that is going to be out next \nweek. It is about the bidding for the tankers for the U.S. Air Force.\n  The GAO will announce the results of its review of the Air Force \ntanker contract next week. The GAO does not have authority to sustain \nor overturn the Air Force contract by itself. The GAO only reviews if \nand when the Air Force followed its own rules. Congress has the final \nsay on this issue because only Congress can consider all of the \nrelevant issues. Still, it is a major report that is going to be coming \nout on this issue.\n  I have been very disappointed in the Air Force granting this tanker \naward to primarily a foreign builder, primarily to Airbus and EADS, \nwhich will build the biggest part of this tanker plane. I am \ndisappointed for three major reasons:\n  One is that I think the merits themselves of the contracting process \nwere not followed by the Air Force.\n  Second is the heavy subsidization by European governments of Airbus's \nplane. The base plane has had heavy subsidies of which the U.S. \nGovernment, by another arm--the U.S. Trade Representative's Office--is \nsuing the European governments and Airbus and EADS, its parent \ncorporation, for this. We are likely to see that case report out soon.\n  Third, I think all the contractors should be subjected to the same \nrules, including things such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, \nwhich U.S. companies are subject to, and I believe all foreign \ncompetitors and bidders should be as well.\n  First, regarding the GAO, we need to look inside the process the Air \nForce used to award the contract. At the base of this, what is very \npuzzling to me is why the Air Force put so much stock in getting a \nbigger Airbus plane in this bidding process when they had been happy \nand desirous of the size of the plane Boeing had put forward. If they \nwanted a bigger plane, they should have put that forward in the bidding \nprocess.\n  Plus, I put this forward: At a time when airlines are looking at the \ncost of running their airplanes and fuel costs, why is it that the Air \nForce would look at a bigger plane instead of a smaller plane that is \nmore fuel efficient? That is what all the airlines are looking at. Why \nwould we not look at the same thing? Plus, in looking at the bigger \nplane, I do not believe a realistic assessment of the military \nconstruction needs at the bases throughout the United States and the \nlanding needs throughout the world has been looked at because you are \ngoing to have to increase landing space, you are going to have to \nincrease hangar space for the larger airplane Airbus is putting \nforward. That is in the GAO report.\n  On the foreign trade subsidies, the Air Force says it cannot consider \nforeign subsidies when it looks at the cost of contract proposals. As a \nresult, the GAO will not review that issue either. But the United \nStates is currently suing the European Union for subsidizing the same \ncompany to which the Air Force has awarded this new tanker contract. We \nexpect that ruling on this WTO case very soon. We anticipate getting \nsomewhere--if we win this case--a $4.5 billion judgment against Airbus \nand EADS for this same frame they are now being rewarded by the Air \nForce for with a $35 billion contract. So they subsidized the civilian \naircraft, militarized it, and put it into the military building field. \nWe sued them on this for an illegal international subsidy. We are \ngiving them a contract here for $35 billion on the same subsidized \nplane. Only Congress can decide this issue, but I submit this is not \nthe way we want to encourage other governments around the world to \noperate.\n\n  Then a final issue is on foreign corrupt practices. The Air Force \nconsiders\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\neach bidder's ability to execute a major contract, but it cannot \nevaluate the business practices used by each company, and neither can \nthe GAO. But all U.S.-based companies are subject to the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. I submit we must require that same sort of \nperformance. If a company is going to bid on a major U.S. military \ncontract, they should be subjected to the same rules. I think this \nwould be something that EADS, the parent corporation of Airbus, would \nbe willing to be subjected to. We should require that they and other \nforeign companies compete for Defense contracts and hold themselves to \nthe same standards we require of U.S. companies under this Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. Again, the Air Force has not considered this \npiece in their overall analysis.\n  The bottom line is I think this is a highly flawed contract on the \nbasis of the military not following its own design requests of its \nsmaller plane; second, the United States awarding a contract on a \nsubsidized plane that was illegally subsidized; and third, that these \ncompanies are operating under different rules. A foreign company \noperated under a more favorable set of rules. I think the Congress \nshould look at all of these issues and say this is not the way we want \nto go on these tankers. We want to build them in the United States. We \nwant these jobs in the United States. We want the workers to be in the \nUnited States. We want the military industrial complex to be U.S. based \nand not foreign based.\n  As a gentleman said to me some time ago: There are two things we \nshouldn't be dependent upon another country's government for, and that \nis for your defense and for your food. Here we are being subject to a \nforeign government's building of a major piece of our military complex. \nThe tankers are something that extend the ability for us to be able to \nfly missions. They are critical to our air campaigns. We are going to \nbe dependent upon primarily a foreign producer to be able to build \nthese planes. I think that has untold problems--potential problems--for \nus down the road and it would be something it seems to me this Congress \nshould take a very aggressive look at and say no, we don't want to go \nthat route. The GAO report will come out next week. It is going to be a \nkey issue in this overall decisionmaking process.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and my colleagues for the time.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3044, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3044, a bill to provide energy \n     price relief and hold oil companies and other entities \n     accountable for their actions with regard to high energy \n     prices, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time on behalf of Marylanders \nwho are worried. They are worried because of the high cost of energy. \nThey are worried about the cost of filling the tanks in their cars with \ngasoline. They want us to do something about it. They are looking to \nus. They recall just 7 years ago, when President Bush took office, and \nthe price of gasoline at the pump was less than $1.50 a gallon. Today, \nit is over $4 a gallon. It is having a direct impact on people in my \nState and around the Nation being able to afford to operate their \nautomobiles.\n  I can tell you businesses in Maryland--and I am sure my colleagues \nhave similar stories around the Nation--particularly small businesses \nthat rely upon their car or truck for transportation, don't have the \nability to afford the increased cost of energy. They are on the brink \nof going out of business because of the rising energy cost. They want \nus to do something about it.\n  I am particularly disappointed and frustrated that the Republicans \ndecided twice this week to deny us an opportunity to do what we should \nbe doing--legislating on this very important issue.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act of 2008 would have made a major \ndifference in the cost of energy in the United States. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of that legislation. Yet the Republicans used a procedural \nroadblock--a filibuster--to prevent us from taking up that legislation, \ndebating it, acting on amendments, and doing what we should be doing. \nThe Republicans said the status quo is acceptable. Well, the status quo \nis not acceptable.\n  What would this legislation do? First, it would say taxpayers don't \nneed to subsidize the oil companies. The oil companies are making \nrecord profits. In 2002, their profits were $29 billion. Last year, \nthat grew to $124 billion. They don't need public subsidies. Taxpayers \nshould not be subsidizing them. By the way, they are not investing \ntheir profits back into this country. They are not looking at ways to \nmake this Nation more energy secure, nor are they investing in \nrenewable energy sources. The President said, on April 14, 2005, that \nif oil reaches $55 a barrel, there is no need for the Government to \nsubsidize further efforts on behalf of the oil industry. The price now \nis $140 a barrel. So the subsidies were provided. That $17 billion \nshould be reinvested in America, rather than subsidizing oil companies \nfor even greater profits. Let's use that for making this Nation energy \nsecure, and let's use it for renewable energy sources.\n  That is exactly what this legislation would do.\n  There has been a lot of talk about a windfall profits tax. I happen \nto believe the oil industry is entitled to a profit--just not an \nobscene profit, taking advantage of the world circumstances in oil. \nWith the windfall profit provision of this legislation, it would tell \nthe oil companies to invest a little bit of that money here in America, \nin renewable energy sources. That is what it does. It is a clear \nmessage about the security of America.\n  This legislation would take on the speculators. A large part of the \ncost is not that we are using more oil because, actually, we are using \nless oil today because of the high cost. We have speculators, who are \npeople buying oil futures and driving up the cost of oil, and we are \npaying more at the pump. This legislation says those types of \nspeculators should be regulated. There should be margin requirements \nthat make sense, and they should not speculate without sound investment \nprinciples. That is what this legislation does.\n  This legislation expresses our concerns that the OPEC countries that \nare sending oil into America and depend upon U.S. consumers should be \nsubject to our antitrust laws. This legislation would help in the short \nterm, help bring down the cost of gasoline in the short term, but it \nwould also provide us some long-term strategies for energy security.\n  What did the Republican leadership do? They said, no, let's not talk \nabout it. The status quo is acceptable.\n  Well, it is not acceptable. Then, on H.R. 6049, the Republican \nleadership again exercised the filibuster procedural roadblock, and we \ncould not take up that legislation, which would provide $18 billion for \ntax incentives for renewable energy sources so we can energize the \nAmerican marketplace to develop our wind, solar and geothermal and we \ncan develop the answers to our energy problems in America by energizing \ninnovative individuals and companies in using our market forces to \nsolve the problems here in America.\n  The legislation also provided for more energy-efficient buildings, \nwhich makes sense, and extended the expiring tax provisions, including \nresearch and development, which would also help us in dealing with the \nproblems of our country, and extending the alternative minimum tax \nrelief, which is so important. The Republicans said, no, with \nprocedural roadblocks.\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n  The American people want us to act. I have heard my Republican \ncolleagues say we can produce enough oil to solve this problem. Let me \ngive you the numbers and facts. I hope the public will make its own \njudgment. America, unfortunately, doesn't have a large reserve of oil. \nWe have 3 percent of the world's reserve, including that in ANWR. If we \nallowed production in that environmentally sensitive area, ANWR, at \nfull production we would produce about six-tenths of 1 percent of the \noil in the world. Does anyone think the OPEC nations would not just \nreduce their supply to us by that amount, meaning there would be no \nimpact whatsoever as a result of the production of that small amount of \noil?\n  As the majority leader pointed out, when I had the opportunity to sit \nin the chair earlier today, we have sources of oil, and we are \nutilizing those sources. We are exploring where we can fulfill the \nenergy needs for our own country. But the truth is, we consume 25 \npercent of the world's oil and only have 3 percent of the reserves. We \ncannot produce enough oil to deal with our needs.\n  We need to develop alterative energy sources. I will give you one \nother statistic. If we would have passed the CAFE standards 10 years \nago, we would be saving more oil than three times the amount that is \ncurrently in reserve in ANWR. So we need to become energy secure, and \nwe need to do it for several reasons. We need to do it because of our \nsecurity, because of our economy, and because of our environment.\n  If we develop alternative fuel, if we do better in conservation, and \nif we invest in more efficient transportation, we cannot only become \nindependent of the OPEC countries and the hold they have on us in \ndetermining how much oil they will make available to us, but we also \ncan be friendlier to our environment. We can deal with the serious \nenvironmental issue we have and America can restore international \nleadership.\n  What do the Republicans say? We cannot even talk about these issues \nwith a bill, with amendments before us, because they use procedural \nroadblocks to prevent us from taking up this issue. Well, we should be \ntaking up these bills.\n  Marylanders want us to act and vote and make the tough decisions. \nThey want us to do that. They want us to develop an energy policy that \nwill wean us off oil, that makes us energy secure, that allows us to \ncontrol the economic cost of energy, that puts America in the forefront \nof the international community on global warming to deal with pollution \nand to deal with the risks that are involved.\n  But what Americans want us to do today is to move forward on the \nlegislation that is before us, the Consumer-First Energy Act that could \nand would have an impact on the price of gasoline in the short term so \nthose Marylanders with whom I have talked, who have told me that they \nliterally cannot afford to operate their cars and are in danger of \nlosing their businesses, that we are taking every reasonable step here \nto deal with their concerns and to help them. That would be the \nresponsible action for us to take.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside this partisan differing and let's \nact in the best interest of the people of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nreserve the remainder of their time and that I be recognized out of \norder for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wanted to come and talk about the \nDemocratic bill called the Consumer-First Energy Act. We go through the \nsame things over and over. We have an energy bill that has no energy in \nit. I said this on the floor last December. We keep talking about \nenergy, and every time we try to expand energy, try to expand the \nsupply, it dies right down party lines.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act does nothing to increase access to \nAmerica's extensive oil and gas reserves. It does nothing to promote \nnuclear energy. It does nothing to increase our refining capacity, \nsomething I have been trying to do for a long period of time. It does \nnothing for electricity generation or transmission and does nothing for \nthe utilization of clean coal technology.\n  Instead this act increases taxes on America's oil and gas producers, \nwhich means we are going to be paying more at the pump--we know that--\nand increases Government bureaucracy.\n  A cornerstone of the bill establishes criminal penalties of up to $5 \nmillion and 5 years in prison if a fuel supplier sells his product at \nan ``unconscionably excessive price.'' But the agency responsible for \nits enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission, says this legislation is \nunnecessary and even counterproductive. FTC Commissioner William \nKovacic told Congress recently:\n\n       My intuition is that it would create hesitation in the \n     response to shortages and that that might tend to exacerbate \n     rather than mitigate shortages.\n\n  In addition to the FTC's opposition, price-gouging investigations are \nnothing new. They have been occurring for decades, with each reaching \nthe same conclusion.\n  The Investors Business Daily last month had an editorial:\n\n       Senators also want to impose steep penalties on ``price \n     gouging''--despite the fact that some 17 separate studies \n     have found it doesn't exist. The plan amounts to little more \n     than an attempt to impose price controls--a socialist tool \n     dressed up in a populist garb. Democrats hailed their new \n     measure as an attack on ``the root causes of high gas \n     prices.'' That's one of the more laughable comments to emerge \n     from the Senate in some time.\n\n  Recently, in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the FTC \nissued another report after an extensive investigation into price \ngouging. Once again, it is the same conclusion. The FTC found:\n\n       No evidence to suggest that refiners manipulated prices \n     through any means . . .\n       No evidence to suggest that oil companies reduced inventory \n     to increase or manipulate prices or exacerbate the effects of \n     a price . . .\n\n  Additionally, Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy for the \nClinton administration, when asked last year in a Democratic \nPresidential debate if oil companies are price gouging the American \nconsumer, bluntly answered:\n\n       No, they're not.\n\n  Price-gouging legislation is a solution in search of a problem. Also, \nit is more of class warfare. If they want to blame somebody, they want \nto blame oil companies, the people who are actually plowing back more \nthan 100 percent of profits into exploration at the present time. \nFederal law already bars companies from colluding to fix prices, and \nthe Federal Government currently has all the legal tools necessary to \naddress price gouging.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, ``at least 30 states \n. . . have laws that prohibit gouging, excessive price increases, or \nunconscionable pricing. Other states may also exercise authority under \ngeneral deceptive trade practice laws depending on the nature of the \nstate law and the specific circumstances in which price increases \noccur.''\n  So knowing what we do about price gouging, this provision is \nrepetitive, unnecessary, and potentially counterproductive. This could \nhave the effect of increasing the price at the pump.\n  The other major component of the Democrats' Energy bill reinstates \nthe windfall profits tax. Democrats want to impose a windfall profits \ntax despite the fact that we had this same tax almost 30 years ago and \nthe results were predictable and harmful. Again, it is more class \nwarfare.\n  In 1980, under President Jimmy Carter, Congress imposed an excise \nlevy on domestic oil production called a crude oil windfall profits \ntax. According to a 1990 report by the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service, the results of the Carter windfall profits tax were \nvery counterproductive. Quoting from that report:\n\n       The windfall profits tax reduced domestic oil production \n     between 3 and 6 percent, and increased oil imports from \n     between 8 and 16 percent . . . This made the United States \n     more dependent upon imported oil.\n\n  This is what happened last time. We are supposed to learn from our \nexperiences.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  Looking back to 1980, we now know what a windfall profits tax will \ndo. It will decrease domestic production and increase America's oil \nimports--the exact opposite of what we need to do.\n\n  Additionally, a 1984 General Accounting Office report called the \nwindfall profits tax ``perhaps the largest and most complex tax ever \nlevied on a U.S. industry.''\n  In May, Investors Business Daily editorialized in response to this \nnew tax proposal:\n\n       As any student who has taken Econ 101 at the local junior \n     college can tell you, higher taxes don't encourage \n     production; they discourage it. But Senate Democrats \n     apparently played hooky the day the taxes were discussed.\n\n  American oil and gas companies reinvest their profits into \nexploration, production, and other energy. This is how we can get on \nthe road to expanding our production in America. America's major oil \ncompanies already pay the second highest corporate tax rate in the \nindustrialized world. An additional $17 billion in tax increases will \nonly further harm the international competitiveness of U.S.-based oil \ncompanies.\n  Using the Energy Information Administration's numbers, oil and gas \nindustry profits can be calculated to roughly account for about 8 \npercent of the price of a gallon of gas. So for a $4 gallon of \ngasoline, oil and gas companies profit approximately 32 cents.\n  It is then arguable that if oil company profits were slashed in half, \nas has been proposed, it would only reduce the cost of a gallon of gas \nby 16 cents. And people are led to believe it will be $2 or $3. It is \nnot true.\n  It is arguable that if oil company profits were slashed in half, that \nwould be approximately 16 cents a gallon.\n  Mr. President, $17 billion in tax hikes will also ship American oil \nand gas jobs overseas. If indirect and other employment resulting from \nthe direct activities and the earnings of these direct oil and gas \nemployees is included, the total U.S. employment resulting from oil and \ngas activity is almost 8 million.\n  For American jobs, for the international competitiveness of American \ncompanies, and for the consumers at the pump, Congress has to reject \nthese Democratic attempts to increase taxes and implement backdoor \nprice controls.\n  What should we be doing? Oil and gas exploration and production is \ncurrently prohibited in 85 percent of America's offshore waters. We \ntalked about the huge reserves, but it is prohibited. We are willing to \ndo it, but it is prohibited in 85 percent of the waters.\n  Other nations don't do this. Canada allows offshore drilling in the \nPacific, the Atlantic, and the Great Lakes. Additionally, Cuba is \nlooking to expand drilling which could occur 45 miles from the shores \nof Florida, and that is with technology that is much less \nenvironmentally sound. So we would have the effect of increasing any \nadverse effect that would come from that type of activity.\n  Exploration and production activities are currently prohibited in the \nPacific and Atlantic regions of the Outer Continental Shelf which hold \nan estimated 14 billion barrels of oil and 55 trillion cubic feet of \ngas. This is equivalent to more than 25 years worth of imports from \nSaudi Arabia. Looking to Alaska, ANWR is estimated to contain 10 \nbillion barrels of oil, about 15 years worth of imports from Saudi \nArabia. If President Clinton had not vetoed the bill back in 1995, we \npassed a bill that was in concert with what they want in Alaska and \nthat is to be able to explore that very small area up there--if that \nhad not happened, we would be in a position today, we would have 1 \nmillion additional barrels a day coming from ANWR. We know what that \nwould do to reduce the price of gas at the pump.\n  The Heritage Foundation describes ANWR's 19 million acres as the same \nsize as South Carolina:\n\n       Of that area, President Bush proposes opening about 1.5 \n     million acres to exploration (roughly 6 percent of ANWR). Of \n     those 1.5 million acres, only 2,000--an area the size of \n     Washington's Dulles International Airport--would be devoted \n     to drilling.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I believe what we need to do is understand that supply \nand demand still works. We have to increase the supply domestically, \nand we can do it by passing the Consumer-First Energy Act that has been \nproposed by Senator Domenici, myself, and others. The price at the pump \nwould directly respond on notice of that type of legislation passing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the blocks \nof time be extended for another hour, with the majority controlling the \nfirst half hour of the extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I just got back from my home State of \nMinnesota. Let me tell you, the price of gas is not just one of the \nissues people are talking about, it is the issue they are talking \nabout.\n  In this last week, as we all know, gas prices have risen above $4 a \ngallon as the national average, and many of the people in the country \ncannot afford it. If you drive past a Costco store--I am a Costco \nmember--you will see in the Twin Cities cars lining the block trying to \nget in to save a few pennies, to save a few nickles, to save some \nmoney. Those gas lines remind me of the OPEC oil embargo we have not \nseen since the 1970s. If you talk to people in the rural parts of our \nState, you will be shocked at their out-of-pocket expenses. They have a \nlonger way to drive to work. With gas at $4 a gallon, some people are \nspending $20 a day to get to work in the morning and to get home at \nnight.\n  Mr. President, as you know from your home State of Colorado, in some \nareas, there is not going to be a lot of mass transit. In some areas, \nthey have to drive longer to get to work. Families cannot afford these \nprices. A few weeks ago, we saw stories in the paper saying that \nconsumers were not changing their driving patterns, that they were \ncomfortable with their commuting habits, and they were willing to pay a \nfew dollars extra each week. Well, $4 gas has changed all that. One in \ntwelve Americans now have found a new way to go to work because they \ncan't afford week after week of these gas prices. And we need more mass \ntransit. I support that. That is a good thing. But we know for many \nAmericans who have less income and are dealing with the problem of \nincreased health care costs and who are dealing with the issue of an \nincrease in the cost of food, and now these gas prices up to 4 bucks a \ngallon, when they have less disposable income, less money in their \npocket, it is hard to afford things.\n\n  We simply cannot continue business as usual. When we have people \ngoing to a gas station and can only afford to fill half their tank with \ngas, we can't afford to keep going. That is why I am so shocked when I \nhave seen what the other side has done. Time and time again, the same \nold argument. Well, I think these same old ideas are running on empty, \njust as the people in this country are running on empty.\n  The other side has blocked consideration of some new ideas and a new \nway to go forward with energy, both for short-term and long-term relief \nfor the people of this country. I say this to my colleagues who voted \nagainst that bill and voted against allowing us to debate and allowing \nus to move forward with a new energy future: They are running on empty, \nand the American people know it.\n  Remember back when President Bush was asked about $4-a-gallon gas on \nFebruary 28? The President said:\n\n       You are predicting $4 a gallon gasoline? That is \n     interesting. I hadn't heard that.\n\n  Well, for the people in my State, $4-a-gallon gasoline isn't \ninteresting, it is a budget buster. The fact is, this administration \nhas failed to provide Americans with a meaningful energy policy that \nwould provide relief from high gas and energy prices. They have been \nrunning on empty. This is why I am so frustrated that our colleagues \nblocked consideration of this important bill.\n  We are not proposing anything radical. We are simply asking that the \nGovernment enforce the laws on the books and make the marketplace work \nlike it is supposed to.\n  As the Presiding Officer does, I come from a prosecutor's background, \nand I know we can have all the laws on the books we want, but if we \ndon't enforce them, we are not going to get the relief we need. We are \nnot going to help victims--or in this case consumers--if there are no \ncops on the beat and no\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\none is enforcing the laws or drawing the line.\n  As part of this important bill, the other side blocked us from even \nconsidering, from even debating having Federal regulators provided the \ntools to do their job, to crack down on speculation in the futures \nmarket and on speculators who trade in offshore exchanges just in order \nto avoid regulation. We want the Attorney General to have the authority \nto prosecute collusion by foreign governments.\n  We heard a witness in recent months come before multiple committees \nin Congress, the CEO of an oil company, and say: You know what. A \nbarrel of oil shouldn't cost over $100. A barrel of oil should cost \nsomewhere between $55 and $60. That is the true cost. We heard a \nwitness in recent months describe our energy markets as a giant \ngambling hall without rules, as a superhighway without a traffic cop.\n  That is what we are dealing with. So we need a cop on the beat. The \nConsumer-First Energy Act gives us that cop on the beat. It addresses \nthe problem of market speculation by stopping traders from routing \ntransactions through offshore markets in order to get around the limits \non speculation put in place by U.S. regulators. Why would they go to \nthese offshore markets? We know why they are going there. They want to \navoid any regulation in this country.\n  In fact, you don't even have to go offshore to find unregulated \nenergy trading. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is allowing \nthe Dubai Mercantile Exchange in New York and the Ice Electronic \nExchange in Atlanta to trade in U.S. oil futures without Federal \noversight. I can't tell my constituents to rest easy because the Dubai \nFinancial Services Authority is looking out for their interest.\n  We need to take action not only by regulating these offshore markets \nbut also by making sure what is going on in this country is right. Now, \nwe closed the Enron loophole, or we tried to do that with the farm \nbill, Mr. President, but there is clearly a lot more that needs to be \ndone. There is a lot of speculation that is offshore and out of reach \nof our negotiations and our regulators. This bill will make those \nforeign trades in American oil and gasoline futures subject to \nreporting requirements so we can have a paper trail and keep track of \nwhat is going on.\n  The bill would also require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto increase the margin requirement for oil trades. The margin \nrequirement is currently set by exchanges themselves, kind of like the \nfox guarding the henhouse, and they have set the requirement so low--5 \nto 7 percent--that speculators can buy enormous amounts of oil with \nonly a small amount of cash, and this has caused a tremendous amount of \nvolatility in the price of oil and gas.\n  Remember what the CEO of the oil company said: Oh, no, no, no, this \nshouldn't be. Oil shouldn't be priced at over $100 a barrel. It should \nbe $55. Well, where is all this money going? It is going to build five-\nstar hotels in the middle of the desert somewhere. We have been \ninvesting in the sultans of Saudi Arabia instead of the farmers and \nworkers in this country where we should be developing a long-term \nenergy policy.\n  A final area where we can take immediate action is in our dealings \nwith the OPEC nations. OPEC is a cartel of oil-producing countries that \nmeet and decide how much oil to produce and thereby control prices. \nThey make no pretense of having a free market system. They do not obey \nthe laws of supply and demand. They gather together and they set \nproduction, which determines prices. As a former prosecutor, I call \nthat kind of behavior collusion, and it is illegal in this country. But \nthe members of OPEC are foreign governments, and so far they have \ngotten away with it.\n\n  As oil exporting nations, the members of OPEC could provide us with \nsome relief. They have the spare capacity to increase their production \nof oil and ease the pain being felt by the people in this country. But \nOPEC recently met and decided not to increase production, at least \nuntil the fall, after the summer driving season when prices always \nrise. Not only that, Saudi Arabia has actually decreased production \nsince 2005.\n  Think about it. Our country spends $600,000 every minute on imported \noil. That is money leaving the pockets of American consumers, American \ndrivers, going into the coffers of foreign countries. By refusing to \nstep up production, OPEC nations are saying: We don't think prices are \nhigh enough yet. Let's let them go higher. Well, I think they are.\n  This bill that was blocked by the other side was going to put a stop \nto some of this OPEC price setting by allowing the Attorney General to \nbring enforcement action against foreign governments that are engaging \nin collusion and hold them to the same standards of fair dealing we \nalready have in place in this country.\n  So those are some short-term ideas, in addition to the ones we were \nable to pass, which was to temporarily halt putting oil into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve when the prices are high. We got that done. \nBut there are other things even more important. To do something about \nwhat is called the gambling hall when it comes to oil speculation, to \ndo something about price gouging, to do something about the OPEC \nnations--these are short-term things that are doable and that the \npeople in my State, who are lining up in those Costco lines, want to \nsee. But, once again, we were blocked by the other side.\n  Our people are running on empty. They are tired of this, and the \nother side is running on empty when it comes to ideas. We need a bold \nnew future, a long-term solution. American consumers also expect that \ntheir corporations should invest sensibly for the long-term interests \nof our country and our economy. That is what works. That is how \nbusiness works.\n  But here is what is going on. This Congress, in the past few years--\nbefore I got here--gave a bunch of giveaways to the oil companies. I \ndon't know, $17 billion, something like that. So we, the people, have a \nsay in what these oil companies do when we are giving them a bunch of \ntax giveaways.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act imposes a windfall profits tax on oil \ncompanies. It doesn't just say, no; every oil company gets a windfall \nprofits tax. We could say that given that the big oil companies raked \nin $36 billion in just the first 3 months of this year. But it says, if \nthey invest in renewables and do what they are supposed to do given \nthey have gotten these subsidies--that they invest in their refining \ncapacity and do things like that--then they would not have this \nwindfall profits tax. But if they don't and they are taking the \ntaxpayers' money and they are raking in the bucks and the prices are \ngetting jacked up, then they are going to get a windfall profits tax.\n  Why should these big companies be getting $36 billion in the first 3 \nmonths, making no progress in terms of a long-term energy policy, and \nthen the consumers are paying over $4 a gallon at the tank? It makes no \nsense. The oil companies' profits since this administration took office \nare over $600 billion and counting.\n  Now, you can make the argument for high profits if this money was \nbeing used to develop alternative resources, but it is not. Time and \ntime again we keep going backwards, not forward.\n  So this provision says if they take their profits they get from \nAmerican families and businesses and reinvest them in the country's \nenergy future, that is fine. If they don't, we are going to take a \nportion of their money and invest it in the farmers and the workers of \nthe Midwest instead of the oil cartels of the Mideast.\n  We know what we need for a long-term energy policy. We need \ninvestment in hybrid electric cars. We are not that far away. In 2 \nyears, the Chevy Volt is going to give us 30 to 40 miles by plugging it \nin and then it converts over to fuels. We have great advancements in \nbiofuels, something the Presiding Officer and I have worked on very \nhard, going to cellulosic ethanol but going beyond even corn-based \nethanol so that we look at getting energy from switchgrass and prairie \ngrass and algae and all kinds of biomass and residue from logging. \nThese are all in our future. But we have to actually put those \nincentives in place so the investment follows.\n  We have tried. We have done some things, but we need a bold energy \ndirection in this country, and that is what this bill was about that \nthe other side blocked. They are running on\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nempty with ideas, and the American consumers are running on empty with \ntheir tanks. When American families are facing the kind of economic \nsqueeze they are facing today, they expect action from their \nGovernment. They expect that their Government will protect their \ninterests to make sure the markets are fair and honest and transparent. \nThey expect their government is going to watch out for them, not for \nthe oil companies.\n  We have proposed legislation that would do these things. It would \ngive the Government the tools to protect consumers in the short term, \nand it would begin to set our country on a smart, sustainable course \nfor the long term toward energy independence. You can put your head in \nthe sand and pretend it is not happening, or you can look for a new \nfuture. Does that involve, as our friends on the other side have been \nsaying, increased production in our country? Of course it does. We live \nin Minnesota, next to North Dakota, where we are seeing the discovery \nof more oil. That is a piece of this; that is a piece of it. But the \nother piece is looking to the future with renewables and biofuels and \nnew kinds of technologies. And if we keep going the old way, giving \nthat $17 billion to the oil companies and not investing in a new \nfuture, we are going to end up even worse than we are now, and that is \nrunning on empty.\n  It shouldn't take $4-a-gallon gasoline to bring us to the brink of \naction on sensible market reforms and a smart long-term energy policy, \nbut that is where we are. That is where we are. It is time to act. I \nimplore my colleagues on the other side not to filibuster this bill. We \nmust move ahead and we must do something for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield back the remainder of \nthe majority's time in this half hour as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I want to speak on this issue, the \nenergy problem we find ourselves in, and I want to begin by a moment of \nreflection upon the problems described by my dear colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  The fact is, the more we can find a way to work together and the less \nwe make clever rhetorical points about whether one party is on full or \nanother is on empty, or anything else, the quicker we will get to a \nsolution. The fact is, we are not going to find solution to the energy \nproblem in America by doing it as Democrats or Republicans. We are \ngoing to find it by working together as Americans.\n  We all know when the minority is not permitted the opportunity to \nimpact a bill by amendments there is not a real debate taking place \nand, therefore, our ideas, the ideas of 49 Members of this Senate, are \nnot worth considering. We all know that is not the way the Senate \nlegislates. That is not the way to do things when you are serious about \nan outcome and not just looking to make political points.\n  We are, for sure, in the midst of an energy crisis like nothing we \nhave seen in recent times. A gallon of gas is more than $4 a gallon, \nwith diesel more than $5, and natural gas prices continue to rise. \nThese high prices are putting an unexpected and heavy burden on \nmillions of American families. As I talk with Floridians, it is clear \nthat people are feeling the pain and families are hurting. The rising \ncosts are digging into the family budget.\n  In addition to high energy costs, we are also in the midst of \nincreasing food costs and putting an even greater strain on families \nwho are growing increasingly anxious. They want and deserve solutions. \nThey don't want and don't deserve partisan bickering.\n\n  There are a number of factors impacting the price of gas--including \nthe influence of speculators and the weak dollar.\n  We are seeing a large and increasing demand for fuel while supplies \nremain stagnant.\n  Since the automobile was invented, it took the United States until \nthe early 1980s to reach 100 million cars. In China, the same thing \nhappened in less than 15 years. According to the International Energy \nAgency, Chinese oil imports are expected to rise 80 percent in the next \n4 years.\n  And by the way, we know the Chinese are looking for ways to increase \ntheir own oil production--but despite what is cited as fact here on the \nSenate floor on frequent occasions, China is not drilling off the coast \nof Cuba. I have taken the time to research this issue because of my own \ninterest in this area of the world.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, China only owns one \nplot where they could explore. It is this little green spot. Whether it \nis under production or not is not clear, but it is not offshore--it is \non the island itself. According to University of Miami Center for \nHemispheric Policy fellow Jorge Pinon, there is no drilling taking \nplace offshore in Cuba by the Chinese or any other country.\n  Reports to the contrary are false; they are rumor; they are akin to \nurban legends. China is not drilling for oil 60 miles from the Florida \nKeys. There is one oil company--Spanish Respol RTF--that has purchased \none lease off of Cuba's shore and there is no current drilling or even \nplans to drill in the forseeable future. There is the possibility that \nthe Canadians may have something happening there, but I am not aware of \nthat either.\n  So any talk of using some fabricated China/Cuba connection as an \nargument to change U.S. policy has no merit.\n  To address the supply side of the equation, one solution I have \nalways favored involves using our existing natural resources to \nincrease domestic production.\n  Congress has made some progress in this area in recent years, but \nmore needs to be done.\n  Offshore drilling is one area where we have made progress. In 2006, I \nhelped to negotiate the opening of more than 8 million acres in the \nGulf of Mexico as a result of negotiations and conversations on a \nbipartisan basis here in the Senate.\n  The area is estimated to contain up to 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas and 1.25 billion barrels of oil. That is a tremendous \namount of resources in areas open to drilling right this minute, all as \na result of an agreement Senator Nelson and I made, protecting \nFlorida's beaches yet understanding the need to open up this area of \nthe Gulf.\n  While 8 million acres have been opened in the Gulf, to date no \nexploration has taken place. I know they are still in the process of \nleasing, but to date we have had no product out of that area. It makes \nsense to me that we would go here first, well away from Florida's \nbeaches, before this area, where we also have a military mission area \nto protect.\n  I hope that before we talk about opening areas closer to our beaches, \nthat we will first attempt to get to the one billion barrels of oil \nalready available in the Gulf.\n  Another promising domestic resource is in ANWR in Alaska.\n  Five different times during my Senate career, I have voted to open \nthis remote area for oil exploration. It is environmentally safe, the \npeople of Alaska favor it, and our country needs it.\n  I will continue to support efforts to obtain resources from the area.\n  The size of the land we are talking about for exploration is merely \n2,000 acres within 19.6 million acres of wilderness--that is the \nvirtual equivalent of a quarter on a football field.\n  Estimates indicate this area in Alaska contains approximately 10.4 \nbillion barrels, meaning we could have another one million barrels of \noil coming into the U.S. supply every day for decades.\n  I will continue to support increasing the U.S. domestic production as \nlong as it is supported by those most directly impacted by it.\n  Along with working to increase the U.S. oil exploration efforts, \nthere is also a tremendous need to build more oil refineries.\n  Part of the reason why our oil supplies are stretched thin is because \ndespite the rise in demand for gasoline, a new fuel refinery has not \nbeen built in three decades.\n  Once crude oil is shipped from overseas, it still has to be refined.\n  With so few oil refineries in this country and the demand so high, \nthis results in a bottleneck and further contributes to the domestic \ndemand that is outstripping supply.\n  We can do a great deal more in the short term to alleviate the burden \nhigh gas prices are having on America's families.\n  An integral part of any energy plan moving forward has to focus a \nheavy emphasis on conservation. We are not going to drill our way to \nenergy independence.\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n  We have to have a comprehensive approach: more exploration, more \nconservation, renewables, biofuels, and new technologies.\n  We are paying high prices at the pump for that demand, and it is also \nsomething we are paying for environmentally. I think there is huge \npromise in answering some of our energy demands and contributing to a \ncleaner environment by investing in alternative fuels.\n  Most people are familiar with ethanol--but I think that is just the \nfirst step. Florida's research universities have been working on \ncellulosic ethanol, which is a second generation biofuel.\n  This process generates fuel from orange peels, grass clippings, corn \nstalks--not the corn but the waste after the corn is gone. Any sort of \norganic material that has carbon in it can be turned into fuel.\n  One thing should be clear--it is that the tension on the world's oil \nmarket is not going to lessen anytime soon and the need to lessen the \nU.S. dependence on foreign oil could not be any greater.\n  Frankly, this Congress has been absent on the matter. The fact is, \nalthough we talk about President Bush and what he has and has not done, \nwe have an obligation to act as well. The fact is, when the Democrats \ntook over the Congress the price of oil was $2 a gallon; today it is \nover $4 and going up. We have to put down the partisan rhetoric. We \nhave to come back to the fact that we must come together, work \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, to do what serious legislating \nusually can accomplish when people of good faith come together to get \nsomething done.\n\n  I invite my dear friend and colleague, the Presiding Officer today, \nto find ways we might work together so we can help American families. I \nknow there are many things on which we can agree. We ought to try to \ndiminish the points of disagreement and find the common ground and move \nforward to a better energy future for our country so we might leave the \nkind of legacy for our children that I know is the reason we came here \nto the Senate in the first place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Florida to \ntalk about an issue that is probably on the minds of nearly every \nAmerican today, especially if they just pulled their big SUV away from \na gas pump and they fed their credit card into that gas pump and it \nregistered $100. That is the reality the American consumer is being \nsubjected to today in an unprecedented way. So my advice to the Senate \ntoday goes back to an old country song that was popular a few years \nago, by a female country artist, called ``A Little Less Talk And A Lot \nMore Action.''\n  That is exactly what ought to be going on in the halls of Congress \ntoday: a heck of a lot less talk and a lot more action. What ought that \naction be for the American consumer who today is paying more money than \never in the history of our country for energy? In the short term, the \n``more action and less talk'' ought to be production, producing oil out \nof our known oil reserves in this country. That is not the answer for \nthe future. That is the answer for tomorrow, next year, and 8 or 10 \nyears into the future. I call it a bridge solution to the reality of a \nnew generation of energy that is the cellulosics, that is electric, \nthat is the hybrid. But we are always going to need oil or hydrocarbons \nin our economy to produce the kind of transportation fuels for the big \ntrucks and many of our rail engines and all of those kinds of heavy \ntransportation needs. That is not in part what the consumer is paying \nfor today. The consumer is paying $4-plus at the pump today, depending \non where you live, because this Congress over the last 20 years has had \nan attitude that is quite simple: Put that in wilderness, protect it, \ndeny it, we can conserve our way out of it. The Clean Air Act says it \nis too expensive to retrofit refineries so we take one, two, three \nrefineries offline. We have taken many of them offline because they \nsimply couldn't comply with the Clean Air Act and they were too \nexpensive to retrofit and our overall capacity to refine, with our \noverall capacity to explore and develop, went hand and hand down while \nthe American consumer was consuming more.\n  What does that ``a little less talk and a lot more action'' mean? It \nought to mean this: It ought to mean going where you know you can get \nit, going where you know you can drill. Where might that be? Here is \nthat reality that American consumers ought to know about, and then I \nhope they will pick up the phone and call their Senator or e-mail their \nSenator and say: Why did you do this? Why over the last 30 years did \nyou deny us access to these areas where we have known oil reserves?\n  In a modern world, for me to quote 20-year-old statistics doesn't \nmake a lot of sense. But for 20 years we have said: No, we are not even \ngoing to use new seismographic measuring efforts to determine where the \nother oil is. We are going to take the old information, 20-year-old \ninformation in the red zone represents this.\n  American consumer, listen, because you ought to be on the phone \ntoday, calling your Senator and saying: A little less talk and here is \nthe action. Start drilling. Open these areas. Get the bid process \ngoing.\n  What can it yield? The U.S. Geological Survey says that in these red \nzones we have a known resource of 29 to 30 billion barrels of oil. In \nthe undiscovered areas where we believe it is, there is 85 billion, or \nabout 115 billion. You do the math.\n  If we could produce a few more million barrels a day, what would the \nmarket do? What would the speculators do? They would run for cover. We \nwould take $30 or $40 a barrel right off the top of the market that is \na speculative price today that is betting that America will not do this \nbecause they are betting Congress is going to be doing a lot more talk \nand no action.\n  If we act, if we do what we ought to do, if we go where we know we \nshould go, where the oil is today, and we find that there are 120, 130, \n150 billion barrels of oil, down comes the market.\n  If the market comes down for America, the market comes down for the \nworld. That is the price in the market, because we are talking about \nmarket trends that are world trends--not only us. If you think we are \nhaving a bad time here and we are paying $4, what is a European paying? \nThey measure by liters, but they are usually, probably at $9 or $10 \nnow. So they are as angry as consumers as we are as consumers about the \nreality of the market in which we all live.\n  I am talking crude oil. I am not talking natural gas. In these areas \nwe believe there could be as much as 633 trillion cubic feet of gas. \nFor the chemical industry of our country, for the world as we know it, \nthat is hugely important. For all of the costs of the goods and \nservices we are buying at the market shelf today that are going up in \nprice, they are reflecting their need to have the ingredients that flow \nfrom oil or that flow from gas. Whether it is the transportation that \ngets them to the shelf or whether it is the ingredients of the product \nthat is on the shelf, this is a world today that is dominated by what \nwe call hydrocarbons--oil and oil derivatives, and gas. We are all \ngoing to be paying a great deal more.\n  The thing that is most visible is the pump, that $4 or $4.20 or \n$4.50. The Senator from Alaska told me this morning that in areas of \nrural Alaska where they barge the gas up and offload it during the \nsummer for the locals to use, it is well over $5 a gallon.\n  And it is going to that consumer at well beyond their inability to \npay. They are growing frightened; they are relating to that Senator \nfear that they can no longer live their lives the way they would like \nto live them because they simply have to deny themselves access to gas, \naccess to oil.\n  Well, that is the reality of where we live and what we have done to \nourselves. It all started in this Congress 20 years ago in the name of \nthe environment. We began to deny, deny, deny, and deny. Consumers are \nsaying something much different today than they did then. Because they \nrecognize that in a state of denial there is a price to be paid. They \nare now paying that price.\n  So what happened and what is happening? Well, on May 19, a Gallup \nPoll came out. They asked Americans: Shouldn't we allow drilling in the \nU.S. coastal waters and up here in the ANWR area, the Alaskan National \nWildlife Refuge?\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\n  A few years ago, a majority of Americans said: Oh, no, no, no. Let us \nprotect those areas. Today, well, this was even before $4 gas, this was \nMay 19, not this week, and 57 percent of Americans said: Drill it.\n  There is a new Rasmussen Poll out today which is even higher than \nthat. Americans are saying: Drill it. Go where the oil is. Explore it. \nDevelop it. Bring it online. Do it in an environmentally sound way.\n  And our technology today can take us there. We do not risk the \nenvironment when we do this. Anybody who stands on the floor of the \nSenate today and says: Oh, save the environment, is in a 20-year-old \nenvironmental time warp. And it is quite obvious why. They haven't seen \nthe technology. They do not know what we now can do; that we have \nlearned from the 1960s spill in Santa Barbara. Have you heard some \nSenators quote the facts about Katrina? Over a thousand wells were \nknocked offline, drilling rigs knocked off point. Not a drop of oil \nspilled. Why? Technology.\n  So America, awaken. Pick up the phone. Call your Senator and say: Get \nwith it. A lot more action and a lot less talk. Because right now we \nare talking. We are jawboning, we are politicking, and the consumer is \nhaving their budgets burnt up by the reality of the marketplace that \nthis Congress helped set decades ago.\n  Hear me. A lot less talk, Senate, and a lot more action. Let's go to \nwork. Let's drill our reserves. Let's produce them in an \nenvironmentally sound way and let's give this consumer and our economy \nand the world a better place to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the pain that \n$4-a-gallon gas is inflicting across the country. For the last 8 years, \nour energy policy has been stuck in the past. Today, we suffer from \nthat neglect. Our national security is compromised by our alarming \noverdependence on foreign oil. Our economy is held hostage to other \ncountries that control the oil reserves.\n  Every day--every day--most Americans, most of the 300 million \nAmericans are feeling the real pain of high gas prices and diesel \nprices resulting from these failed policies.\n  Americans know the past all too well. Since 2001, the price of oil \nhas risen more than 400 percent. The cost of a gallon of gas from \nColorado is up almost 300 percent. Oh, yes, we all remember those dear \nold days in 2001, when in Colorado we were paying $1.08 a gallon in the \nbeginning of the Bush administration. Yet today we are at $4 a gallon \nin Colorado.\n  U.S. expenditures during that same time period on foreign oil that we \nare importing into our country have more than tripled; a family's \ntransportation costs have more than doubled. Projections show gas may \nreach $5 a gallon this summer.\n  But the numbers do not even begin to tell the real story of how our \ndependence on foreign oil is hurting the American people. They do not \ntell the story of the farmer in Kit Carson County, on the Eastern \nPlains of Colorado, who is worried, worried that he will not be able to \nafford the diesel needed to harvest the wheat at the end of the summer.\n  They do not tell the story of the trucker in Elizabeth, CO, whose \nweekly income has fallen $700 in this economy and can barely afford to \nfill his truck because fuel costs are higher than they have ever been.\n  They do not tell the story of how fuel prices have pushed several \nairlines into bankruptcy and led United Airlines to cut over 1,000 jobs \nin recent days.\n  In rural communities, in particular, gas prices are taking a huge \nbite out of the family budget. This map shows the average proportion of \na family's income that is going for filling the tanks in counties \nacross the country.\n  You can see which parts of the country are the hardest hit. Those are \nthe rural counties, where upward of 16 percent of the entire budget is \ngoing for gasoline. So you see in the broad swath of what is rural \nAmerica, this yellow area. Down here is my San Luis Valley, where 16 \npercent of the family budget essentially is going to fill the tanks of \ngasoline for those families.\n  Across the country we are paying almost $5 billion more every day for \noil than we did 5 years ago. These moneys are going to the Middle East, \nto Russia, and to Venezuela. They are not moneys that are staying in \nAmerica to make us strong. Revenues for oil-producing states and oil \ncompanies, primarily oil companies controlled by foreign governments, \nwill reach $2 trillion this year, $2 trillion.\n  So while American farmers and ranchers are facing $10,000-a-month \nfuel bills, Saudi Arabia is using its oil riches to build four new \ncities in the desert; the Sudanese are building new skyscrapers and \nfive-star luxury hotels; and Russia, Russia is using its oil windfall \nto increase its Federal budget tenfold.\n  Over the last 8 years, we have not only become more dependent on \nforeign oil, today we import an increasing amount of oil from those \nforeign countries. Thanks to the failed energy policies of the past, we \nare at the mercy of OPEC and the oil-producing nations of the world.\n  We need to move forward with a new ethic and new imperative of energy \nindependence. We must succeed in a sustained policy that is not a stop-\nand-start policy on energy independence but one that will succeed in \naddressing the cause that I believe most of the Members of this Senate \nbelieve in; that is, to end our addiction on the importation of foreign \noil.\n  How are we going to do this? First, we must continue to develop our \ndomestic oil and gas resources. You heard my friends on the other side \nof the aisle say we are not doing enough, that we have not drilled \nenough in the United States of America. Yet when you look at the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act which I helped craft, along with Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman, that legislation took sensible steps, in my view, to \nstimulate new exploration and energy development and opened the door to \na whole host of items on a portfolio toward energy independence.\n  In 2006, we worked together, again, Democrats and Republicans, to \nopen an additional 8 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for energy \ndevelopment. Those areas contained 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas and 1.26 billion barrels of recoverable oil. We were then asking \nthat we produce more oil from our own resources in America.\n  Colorado is a proud contributor to our Nation's energy supply, and we \nare working to do more. So it is false when people say we are not doing \nthings in America to produce for our energy supply. We have more than \n34,000 active gas wells in my State right now. We have almost 5 million \nacres of land under lease. We are producing 1.2 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas each year, up sixfold from 14 years ago.\n  Over the coming years, we will contribute even more to our Nation's \nenergy supply. The BLM estimates that over the next 20 years we could \nhave 17,000 more gas wells in 3 of our western counties alone.\n  Let me say, are we against energy development in America? You tell me \nthat the construction, the drilling of 17,000 wells in 3 of my counties \nin the State of Colorado is not contributing to the American supply of \noil and natural gas that we need in America? We are doing a lot already \nhere.\n  But for those on the other side who accuse us of doing nothing, they \nare wrong. I have also introduced legislation to open additional areas \nin the State to oil and gas development, including the Roan Plateau in \nwestern Colorado. But we want to do it the right way.\n  Let's not kid ourselves. Expanding domestic oil and gas production \nwill not lower gas prices or kick our addiction to foreign oil. \nAmericans consume 25 percent of the world's produced oil, but we hold \nless than 1.7 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.\n  This chart shows us a little slice of the pie that is 1.7 percent. \nOne of my colleagues earlier said it is 3 percent of the world \nreserves. These are the figures from the Central Intelligence Agency. \nThe CIA tells us we control 1.7 percent of the global proven reserves \nof oil. Yet we are consuming 25 percent of those reserves.\n  So what my colleagues on the other side are saying is that we are \ngoing to take this little slice of the pie and somehow magically \naddress the huge oil security problems we are facing today. That is not \naccurate. We need to be honest with ourselves and the American people \nabout our energy future.\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nWe simply cannot drill our way to energy independence.\n  If we threw open the doors of America's most treasured landscapes to \ndrilling, it would still just be a drop in the bucket. According to the \nEnergy Information Administration, drilling the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nwould, at peak production, which would be somewhere between 2018 and \n2030, reduce the cost of gasoline by less than 4 cents per gallon.\n  We need to be honest with ourselves and the American people about our \nenergy future. We simply cannot drill our way to energy independence.\n  Some dream that oil shale will save the day.\n  Oil shale deposits in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah amount to somewhere \nbetween 500 billion and 1.1 trillion barrels of oil. That is more than \ndouble the proven reserves of oil in Saudi Arabia.\n  The trouble is, the oil is locked up in rock and, even after $10 \nbillion of research and development, nobody has figured out an \neconomical way to get it out.\n  If the technology were ripe, companies like Shell would already be \ndeveloping oil shale today on their own lands. Shell and other \ncompanies already own nearly 200,000 acres of prime oil shale reserves \nin Utah and Colorado. Nobody, not the Federal Government, not the \nCongress, not the State, is stopping them from developing these tracts. \nBut they are not ready, and that's what they have all told us in \ntestimony. They are still struggling to overcome technological and \neconomic barriers.\n  We can help companies such as Shell overcome these barriers through \nresearch and development incentives like the ones I helped put in the \n2005 Energy Policy Act, but even under the most optimistic estimates, \nthe technology won't be ready for commercialization until 2015.\n  So let's be honest about oil shale. Let's not pretend there is a \nmagic wand that we can wave that will unlock the mystery of oil shale. \nLet's be honest about our energy future. Let's be honest with the \nAmerican people.\n  Responsibly expanding our domestic production is only one part of the \nsolution. As I have said repeatedly over the last 4 years, we also need \nto be improving our energy efficiency, investing in technologies, and \ndeveloping our clean energy economy. We have taken several steps in the \nright direction.\n  At the end of 2007, Congress passed legislation to increase fuel \nefficiency standards in cars and light trucks by over 40 percent by \n2020. This will save over 1.1 million barrels of oil a day.\n  The bill we passed, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, \nalso helps spur the rapid development and deployment of advanced \nbiofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol. The bill quintupled the existing \nrenewable fuels standard to 36 billion gallons by 2022, 21 billion of \nwhich must be from advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol. That \nis more than enough to offset our oil imports from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, \nand Libya combined.\n  I was also proud of the work we did in the farm bill to spur \ncellulosic biofuel production, which has the potential to dramatically \nreduce carbon pollution. The farm bill includes a provision I sponsored \nthat provides a $1.01 per gallon tax credit for the production of \ncellulosic biofuels. It is the first incentive for cellulosic biofuels \nof its kind.\n  Why is this so important? Because cellulosic biofuels have the \npotential to displace 3 billion barrels of oil annually, equivalent to \n60 percent of our country's yearly consumption of oil in the \ntransportation sector, without affecting our need for food, feed or \nfiber, 3 billion barrels of oil a year.\n  Dramatically increasing our biofuels production can and will help us \nget control of gas prices and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  In fact, if it weren't for current ethanol production, gas prices \nwould be even higher than they are today.\n  Merrill Lynch estimates that gas prices would be 15 percent higher if \nit weren't for our ethanol production. Do not make biofuels the \nscapegoat.\n  In addition, studies are showing that, as a result of our renewable \nfuels standard enacted in 2005, U.S. oil imports recently declined for \nthe first time in a quarter century.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who just cannot accept the fact that \nbiofuels can and should be a larger part of our energy future. They're \nfinding any excuse to advocate yesterday's energy policies and step \nback into the past.\n  These renewable energy opponents claim, for one, that biofuels \nproduction, in particular corn ethanol production, is to blame for high \nfood prices.\n  This is absurd. There are three factors that are driving food prices \nup, and ethanol production is not one of them.\n  First, food prices are rising because global demand for grains, \nparticularly from China and India, is rising.\n  Second, the global food supply is down because of drought conditions \nin several areas of critical agricultural production. Still, U.S. \nproducers are doing everything they can to boost supplies. Not counting \ncorn used for ethanol production, we produced 17 percent more corn food \nproduct and exported 23 percent more food product overall in 2007 than \nin 2006.\n  Third, rising oil prices are making it more expensive to produce \nfood. Petroleum costs are embedded in every part of the global food \nsupply chain. Recent studies by USDA reveal that for every dollar we \nspend on food, only 20 cents is the cost of the food product itself. \nThe other 80 cents or so are the costs of labor, energy, \ntransportation, and other factors.\n  The best economic minds agree that ethanol production is having \nlittle, if any, effect on food prices. Ed Lazear, chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors, recently reported that \nethanol production accounts for less than 3 percent of the increase in \nglobal food prices.\n  Those who claim that biofuels production is driving up food costs are \nflat-out wrong.\n  Let's not forget where today's high gas prices are hurting most, it \nis in America's rural communities. Farmers, ranchers, small business \nowners, families in small towns, they know the true cost of our \naddiction to foreign oil. They feel it every day.\n  They also know that the solution is not far away. They know that the \nsolution lies in our farms and fields, in the promise of cellulosic \nethanol and in the ingenuity of the American worker.\n  Our rural communities know we can grow our way to energy independence \nif we continue to pass and implement policies that stimulate our clean \nenergy economy.\n  So let's not let them down. Let's not turn the clock back to the \nfailed energy policies of the last 8 years. Let's not pretend that the \n1.7 percent of the world's oil reserves that we possess will meet our \nenergy needs. Let's be honest with the American people. Let's build our \nclean energy economy. Let's pass the tax extenders that Senator Baucus, \nI, and others have developed that will stimulate renewable energy \ndevelopment. Let's give these growing industries the tax certainty that \nthey and their investors need to move forward with projects that are \ncreating good-paying jobs across the country. Let's get after the \nspeculation in the oil market. And let's get to work on breaking our \naddiction to foreign oil.\n  I will conclude by making a few additional comments. We have heard \nfrom the other side of the aisle that oil shale somehow is magically \ngoing to develop as part of the solution for our energy independence \nand deal with gas prices today. The truth of the matter is, we \nsupported the oil shale provisions in 2005 and have been moving forward \nin the development of oil shale in Colorado in a responsible way.\n  Yet we know that even after the investment of billions of dollars, \nthe technology is some 6 to 7, maybe 8 years away before it can be even \ncommercially developed, if it is proven it can be done. Yet there is \nthis accusation that is coming from the other side of the aisle that \nsomehow the development of oil shale is going to deal with the \nimmediate crisis we face today. That is simply a false charge. We need \nto move forward and attempt to look at the development of oil shale in \nan environmentally responsible way.\n  Another point, before I conclude, is we need to continue to grow our \nway to energy independence. I am a proud sponsor, with Senator \nGrassley, of the 25-by-25 resolution. I think America's farmers and \nranchers can help us move forward so we can produce 25 percent of our \nenergy from renewable energy.\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\n  I am hopeful this energy crisis does not create an opportunity for us \nto take a step back on the investments we are making in biofuels. \nBiofuels are a significant way in which we will move forward to energy \nindependence.\n  I believe strongly there are parts of our energy agenda that \nRepublicans and Democrats can come together on, but I am hopeful the \nstalling tactics that keep us from moving forward to crafting an energy \nbill will end so we can deliver on solutions to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nsolid, pertinent remarks about the energy situation we face and \nsolutions for the crisis.\n  The energy crisis we face today is putting a squeeze on our working \nfamilies. This morning, AAA announced another new record high on the \nnational average for the price of a gallon of gas at $4.05 a gallon. \nDiesel hit a new record of $4.79 a gallon. The price of oil is at $134 \na barrel. Yesterday in the Senate, Republicans blocked some solid \nmeasures by which we can lower the cost of energy which would directly \nimpact working families, small businesses, agriculture, and the \ntrucking industry.\n  Today, I rise to urge my Republican colleagues to allow us to pass \nlegislation that will make a difference to free America from this grip \nof foreign oil. Although my Democratic colleagues have produced \ncommonsense legislation to deal with this energy crisis, the folks on \nthe other side of the aisle continue to block any reasonable attempt to \ntake effective action. We have sound policy proposals on the table, and \nit is time for the other side to help lead or follow or get out of the \nway.\n  My Montana neighbors are hurting from the high cost of energy. Our \nmanufacturers are at the risk of shutting down because of high energy \ncosts. Truckers struggle to make ends meet, facing the high prices of \ndiesel fuel. Family farmers are suffering from record-high diesel, high \nfertilizer, and other input costs. This energy crisis is real. We feel \nit every day. We have been feeling this effect for many months. The \nphone in my Senate office is ringing off the hook with folks asking for \nrelief. Unfortunately, Republicans yesterday voted to deny any of that \nrelief. They continue to block action even on the commonsense plan of \nmy colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, to extend tax incentives for \npromising alternative energy.\n  The facts are clear. We cannot drill our way out of this energy \ncrisis. Drilling is a part of the mix of solutions we need, but we must \nfind innovative and creative solutions to the challenges of this 21st \ncentury. Investing in renewable energy at home is the only way we can \nget on a path toward energy independence.\n  In short, we must pass the tax bill by Senators Baucus and Grassley \nto support energy innovations such as wind, solar, and biofuels. The \nbill extends the production tax credit for wind, geothermal, landfill \ngas, solar, and biomass.\n  The United States has led the world for 3 years in wind power \ncapacity. Last month, the Department of Energy said the United States \ncan get fully 20 percent of its power from wind. But all of this grinds \nto a halt if we don't extend the production tax credit that expires at \nthe end of this year.\n  This bill also includes incentives for homeowners to take the \ninitiative to put renewable energy systems in their homes. It advances \ncarbon capture technology so that we can expand coal power into the \nfuture while fighting climate change, and it extends credits for \ncellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. We have heard a lot of talk about \nethanol influencing food prices. If we want to develop biofuels that \ndon't compete with food, we need to extend the tax credits that help \nget these fuels into the marketplace.\n  Perhaps most importantly, it continues our focus on conservation in \nhomes and businesses. This is the low-hanging fruit of good energy \npolicy.\n  If this package has any shortfalls at all, it is that the extensions \nare not long enough. I know a lot of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle also like the tax provisions. The difference is, they don't \nwant to pay for it. It is not free. We can't just get out the credit \ncard and forget about it. If we don't pay for it, our kids do.\n  This package by Senator Baucus takes a fiscally responsible approach \nto the tax incentives. That means closing the loophole in the Tax Code \nthat allows wealthy hedge fund managers, many of whom engage in the \nvery speculation that drives up the cost of oil, to defer paying taxes \non the money they make outside the United States.\n  Why anyone would hold up $55 billion in tax cuts for small \nbusinesses, working families, and our Nation's renewable energy \nindustry is beyond me. More importantly, families in Montana and rural \nAmerica wouldn't tolerate it, and they should not.\n  Unfortunately, the other side of the aisle continues to block this \nbill. We need to pass this important Federal support and expand it so \nenergy diversification efforts can count on a more steady and reliable \nbackstop.\n  Montana is already leading the way toward a more sustainable energy \nfuture. We need to use the power of the Federal Government to reach the \nfull potential of these homegrown renewable energy projects. Let me \ngive a couple examples.\n  Across the Great Plains, wind is one of our most reliable and most \nplentiful natural resources. We are harnessing the power of wind to \ngenerate electricity and to power homes and businesses across my State. \nWe need the support of the U.S. Tax Code to build on this progress. On \nthe agricultural front, camelina is a crop that can be used in biofuels \nwithout competing with food crops. In fact, the byproduct of camelina \nfuel production can be fed to cattle as a nutritional feed. This is an \nexample of the innovative approach this Nation needs to free ourselves \nfrom the grip of OPEC and corrupt oil regimes of the world.\n  There is no reason the Senators cannot work together to support \ninnovative solutions to this challenging problem. Unfortunately, the \nRepublicans seem only interested in covering for the President, who has \nbeen asleep at the switch. Their own solution is to drill for oil in \nour most environmentally fragile areas.\n  We need commonsense solutions to address the cost of energy. The \nenergy provisions in the Baucus bill will take a giant step forward in \ndeveloping the 21st-century solutions our people deserve. We must start \ntoday to put America back on a path toward energy independence.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about high gas prices and \nthe fact that so many of my colleagues from across the aisle have no \ninterest or seem to have no interest in addressing the problem. \nRepublicans seem not to care about the pain at the pump, but they may \nwell care about the pain at the polls that could come from ignoring \nthis crisis and their constituents.\n  The bottom line is, we are asking to have a debate on the issue of \nhow to reduce gas prices, and the other side just says no. They may \nhave a different solution than we do. They think ANWR is the answer, \nthe Alaska oilfields. We all know that would take 7 years before a drop \nof oil would come, and most estimates say it would not reduce the price \nby very much at all. But let's debate it. We are willing to debate \nANWR, an issue they care about. Why are they not willing to debate the \nwindfall profits tax or dealing with speculation or dealing with the \ncartel of OPEC? We are happy to debate it all.\n  Make no mistake, we are facing an energy crisis that has led to a \npainful and unprecedented spike in the price of oil--$140 a barrel, $4 \na gallon--and the minority, the Republicans say this is a problem that \nis not worthy of our attention or action. It is hard to believe. When \nyou go home, whether it is at a parade or a veterans hall, even at \nweddings and christenings, people are coming over to you and asking: \nWhat are you doing about gas prices? The other side says: Let's not \ndebate it.\n  It is incredible.\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\n  Eighty-six percent of Americans are unhappy with the state of our \neconomy. The most tangible symbol of this is $4 a gallon gasoline. I \ncan't understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nrefuse to address this issue and block us from helping American \nconsumers as our economy continues to falter.\n  They can filibuster all they want. We are up to 75 filibusters. \nSeventy-five times, they said: We don't want to move forward. We don't \nwant to debate. But they cannot play the American people for fools. \nCome November, they will reap what they sow. My colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will filibuster themselves right out of their Senate \nseats. The American public will not take lightly the fact that Senate \nRepublicans have prevented anyone from helping. They will see through \nthe shams and the false ideas. The strategy of playing to a base that \nis becoming more and more narrow is going to cost them dearly because \nthe American people know which party is blocking action on energy \nprices and on tax extenders.\n  For all the talk about how American families have benefited from the \nBush tax cuts, for all the emphasis Senator McCain is placing on making \nthem permanent, the simple, undeniable, you-can-look-it-up, no-spin \ntruth is that the average American family is paying far more in higher \ngas prices this year than they received from the Bush tax cuts. So set \naside for a moment higher health care costs, higher tuition costs, \nhigher food prices, and all the other ways American families are \nfeeling the pinch. They are paying more this year in gas prices alone \nthan they received in the Bush tax cuts. Let me repeat that. They are \npaying more this year in gas prices alone than they received in the \nBush tax cuts. Our friends across the aisle have turned the economic \nstimulus plan into the big-oil stimulus plan. It is unconscionable that \nthe American public is being forced to use their stimulus checks just \nto pay for gas.\n  I have asked myself, Why don't they even want to debate the issue? We \nare willing to debate ANWR. We are willing to debate some of their \nsolutions. Why aren't they willing to debate ours? I will tell you why. \nThere are too many people who don't want to vote yes or no. They are \ntorn between their base, their oil company constituency, and the rest \nof America. So they want to duck. But that policy is not going to \nwork--not this time, not this place, not this year.\n  So we are here today to ask that we be allowed to debate the two \nissues they blocked us on yesterday. This week in the Senate \nRepublicans are blocking lower energy costs. Let me repeat that because \nclear as a bell, that is what is happening. This week in the Senate \nRepublicans are blocking lower energy costs. We cannot even debate \nthem. Yesterday, they blocked us twice from debating legislation to \naddress rising gas prices.\n  The Senate majority leader put together a comprehensive energy \npackage, the Consumer-First Energy Act. Senator Baucus put together the \nRenewable Energy and Job Creation Act that extended tax credits to \npromote renewable energy and break our dependence on foreign oil. What \ndid they say to either of these in terms of not just a lack of support \nbut debate? No, no, no.\n  So we are stuck with high oil prices, and instead of letting us \ndebate these pieces of legislation, my colleagues on the other side and \nthe Bush administration keep going back to the same old tired idea: \nDrilling in Alaska. And do not be fooled because presenting this idea \nis like a poorly performed magic trick. It does not work, and if you \nlook closely enough, you can see through the smoke and mirrors.\n  Let me ask my colleagues, when would ANWR drilling have an impact on \nprices? When are we going to get the first bit of oil? In 2018. Do the \nAmerican people want to wait until 2018, 10 years from now? We \nDemocrats--I was one of the leaders here--agreed last year to drill in \nthe east gulf. That would have increased domestic production over the \nnext few years. So when the other side says: We don't want to drill--we \nbelieve we cannot drill our way out of the problem. We need a profound \nchange in energy policy. But to alleviate the short-term pain--not 10 \nyears from now but more immediately--we have said drill in the east \ngulf. I helped round up Democratic votes to pass that bill.\n  So we are not saying do not drill, but we are saying we need a \nprofound change in energy policy. ANWR is too far away. We should be \nchanging the policy long before 2018 when the first drop of ANWR oil \nwould come.\n  Perhaps the only thing we have done that will help reduce the price \nof oil and gas in the last while is something that had to wait for a \nDemocratic Congress and Senate: Higher mileage standards in the cars. \nThat will be something. But we need to do a lot more. We need to go \nafter the oil companies. We need to go after OPEC. We need to stop \nrampant speculation.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act does those things. We need to change \nour tax policy so instead of giving breaks and subsidies to the oil \ncompanies, we start encouraging alternative energy: Solar, wind, \nbiomass--you name it.\n  In conclusion, yesterday we heard simply: No, we will not debate oil \nprices. They are blocking lower energy costs. We hope over the next day \nor two our Republican colleagues will rethink that position and join us \nin a fulsome debate because otherwise we will not get gas prices to go \ndown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, could you let me know when 5 minutes \nhave expired, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will give the Senator from New York \nan A+ for creative imagination. Here we are wanting to debate the \nclimate change bill--which is a 53-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase \nproposed primarily by Members of the other side, and which includes a \n$6.7 trillion slush fund that Members of Congress could spend as they \nsee fit--and members of the majority party were so embarrassed by it \nthey tried to bring it down and pull it from the floor. This is a bill \nwe should be spending all month talking about. If it is really \nimportant to deal with gas prices and electricity prices and climate \nchange and clean air and our overdependence on foreign oil, where are \nthe debaters on climate change? That is the bill we are on today. We--\nthe Republicans--said let's continue to discuss this important issue. \nThey said: No, let's bring it down. And for what purpose? To bring up \ntheir no-energy bill. Their solution to gas prices--very cleverly \ndisguised by the Senator from New York--is more lawsuits, more taxes, \nand no exploration. Our solution is more American energy now.\n  The Senator from New York said: Well, why should we drill in the 2000 \nacres of Alaska that would produce a million barrels of oil a day? It \nwould be 10 years before we would see that oil. The answer is that it \nwould be 1 million barrels of oil a day, which would add 1 million to \nthe 6 million we produce. Ten years ago, President Clinton vetoed \nlegislation passed by a Republican Congress to permit more oil \nexploration in Alaska. If he had not, we would have 1 million more \nbarrels of oil a day of American energy.\n  So that is the reason we should go ahead. We need more American \nenergy now. We are for it; they are not. We are for it; they are not. \nMore American energy now.\n  We know the future is a different kind of future for energy. I have \nsuggested--with support from many of my colleagues--that we have a new \nManhattan Project, in effect, to focus on things we do not know how to \ndo. How do we get solar power down to the cost of fossil fuel? How do \nwe make plug-in electric cars commonplace? How do we safely dispose of \nnuclear waste by reprocessing it? How do we have more research for \nadvanced biofuels, made from crops we do not eat? We want that kind of \nfuture, where America has achieved clean energy independence. We want \nto start today to move toward it with the same intellectual horsepower \nand speed and dollars that we moved toward splitting the atom and \nbuilding a bomb in World War II.\n  But that is the future. The bridge to the future is to use more \nAmerican energy now. Gasoline is made from oil. We use 25 percent of \nthe world's oil. Until we get to this future, we are going to need more \nof it. We can either buy it from the Middle East and from Venezuela, or \nwe can make more of it here. It is that simple.\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\n  Today, and in days to follow, I will be reading letters from \nTennesseans who have written to me about the effect of gas prices on \ntheir families. I received 400 such e-mails in the last few days. Let \nme read one from Lounita Howard from Lascassas, TN, which is in \nRutherford County:\n\n       The high gas prices have hit my husband and myself \n     especially hard. We are both self-employed. Bobby is a full-\n     time farmer (one of few remaining in Wilson County, \n     Tennessee), and I own a small community newspaper, The \n     Watertown Gazette.\n       I live nearly 20 miles from my office, but working from \n     home is not an option. I'm spending close to $70 a week on \n     gas just commuting to Watertown from our farm in Lascassas. \n     (We live just in Wilson County.) Two years ago, it cost me \n     $30 to $35 a week.\n       Diesel fuel is another story. Road fuel is running around \n     $4.70 a gallon. Off-road fuel for tractors is around $4.30 or \n     $4.40.\n\n  She goes on to tell about her husband Bobby, who is a seventh \ngeneration farmer.\n  I have a letter, also, from Jonathan Henry, a marine for 18 years, \nwho is a Tennessee native who returned from 12 months in Iraq. His \nfamily was given a flat rate for moving costs. Gas is so high, they \nhave had to make cuts in about everything else, he says. He had to \nforego his family vacation. It is too expensive to go on now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will continue for about \nanother 60 seconds, and then I will conclude my remarks.\n  I have letters from Kathy Crowe from Hendersonville, TN; Joseph Rizzo \nfrom Townsend, TN, where I live; and Marti Lewis from Pleasantville, \nTN.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: 1st Sgt Jonathan Henry.\n     To: Senator Alexander.\n     Subject: A Marine's opinion.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: I am writing as a Marine who \n     returned from Iraq in February from a twelve month tour, my \n     second in three years. I appreciate your concern to hear from \n     Tennesseans including active duty service members from \n     Tennessee like myself who represent our great state. Shortly \n     after I returned to my home base in North Carolina and \n     executed orders to Camp Pendleton, CA where gas is now in \n     excess of four dollars and thirty-one cents as of 1 June \n     2008. My family felt the expense of gas prices as we are paid \n     a flat rate for moving that includes fuel cost. The high \n     prices for gas reduced the flexibility we had for use on \n     other moving expenses.\n       The high prices of gas are having a serious affect on \n     Tennesseans like myself who are assigned outside Tennessee \n     and pay the highest prices in the nation. I have proudly \n     served in the Marine Corps for over eighteen years and will \n     gladly go anywhere assigned but it strains my family during \n     times like this when we travel. This summer we had planned \n     vacation time together we missed during my deployment in \n     2007. We have had to change our plans considerably because \n     there is no way an enlisted member like myself can afford to \n     travel distances outside the immediate area and have \n     expenditures beyond what we would pay for fuel. My wife is \n     thrifty and she made our home run smoothly while I served in \n     Iraq and assures me that we can still make the most of what \n     we have here at our new duty station.\n       I appreciate your concern and hope that Congress will see \n     how Americans are sacrificing because of soaring gas prices.\n           Thank You Sir,\n                                                Jonathan S. Henry,\n     1st Sgt USMC.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Lounita Howard.\n     To: Senator Alexander.\n     Subject: High Gas Price Stories.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: The high gas prices have hit my \n     husband and myself especially hard. We are both self \n     employed. Bobby is a full-time farmer (one of few renaming in \n     Wilson County, Tennessee), and I own a small community \n     newspaper, The Watertown Gazette.\n       I live nearly 20 miles from my office, but working from \n     home is not an option. I'm spending close to $70 a week on \n     gas just commuting to Watertown from our farm in Lascassas \n     (We live just in Wilson County). Two years ago, it cost me \n     $30 to $35 a week.\n       Diesel fuel is another story. Road fuel is running around \n     $4.70 a gallon. Off-road fuel for tractors is around $4.30 or \n     $4.40. It just keeps going up--almost daily. There's no way \n     to budget for this. We row-crop, growing corn and large \n     amounts of hay, and raise cattle. Obviously, Bobby uses \n     thousands of gallons of diesel in his business just to keep \n     the tractors going. He uses a substantial amount of road-fuel \n     as well, as he must have heavy-duty dually diesel trucks to \n     pull trailers loaded with equipment or hay. Diesel fuel used \n     to cost less than gasoline. Now it costs far more. It costs \n     hundreds of dollars just to fill the tanks on one truck.\n       We're really wondering how we can survive. Bobby is a \n     seventh generation farmer on the same land in Wilson County \n     settled by his ancestors when they came to Tennessee in the \n     early 1800s. My dream was to own my own business--I saw that \n     dream come true five years ago, but with the cost of fuel \n     coupled with the high cost of health insurance as a self-\n     employed couple, I beginning to question the wisdom of \n     continuing to pursue that dream.\n       Before the gas prices started skyrocketing, we were holding \n     our own--not getting rich, mind you, but we were ok. Now, \n     it's hand-to-mouth. Gas prices are impacting the cost of \n     everything else--groceries, household supplies, you name it I \n     heard today that sales at Goodwill Stores in Tennessee have \n     gone up 12 percent--not surprising. Who can afford to buy \n     ``new'' when they've got to fill up their fuel tanks to do \n     their job, or get to the office?\n       Thank you for your time and efforts to address the problem \n     of high fuel prices.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lounita Howard,\n     Lascassas, TN\n                                  ____\n\n     From: essencelighting@netscape.net.\n     To: Senator Alexander.\n     Subject: Impact on Small Business.\n       We supply lighting to the residential building community in \n     Sumner and Wilson county. Many of these builders have gone \n     from building 30 homes a year in 2007 to this year just one. \n     Some have even gone out of business completely.\n       I took a second mortgage out on our home and used \n     retirement funds to purchase this business several years ago. \n     We built a thriving business with a bright future until this \n     year. Today, I can barely make payroll. Our key was always \n     customer service. Part of that service included going to a \n     client or builder's home and personally consulting on the \n     project site. This consultation is at no charge. We have free \n     delivery. We can no longer afford to drive to Wilson County \n     or the far roaches of Davidson County without charging a fee \n     just to pay for Gas! It pains me to charge for what my heart \n     says should be at not charge. It cost $110 to fill my tank 2x \n     per week.\n       Our sales to the building community are down 47% over \n     previous year(s).\n       My supplies are charging 25% of the cost of goods as fuel \n     charges.\n       UPS is charging 25%--55% cost of goods as delivery charges.\n       Product made in China (90% of inventory) is rising monthly,\n       Two of my employees are considering leaving us due entirely \n     to fuel costs from Gallatin to Hendersonville everyday.\n       If this continues, we will close. Several new people will \n     be on the state's unemployment, the $50,000+ local sales tax \n     we contribute to will be eliminated and we will foreclose on \n     our personal home and property.\n       Please help.\n                                                      Kathy Crowe,\n     Hendersonville, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Joseph Rizzo.\n     To: Senator Alexander.\n     Subject: Gas Prices.\n       I am a student at UT and live in Townsend. It cost me $100 \n     per week just to travel back and forth to school. I was faced \n     with dropping out of school, because I could not afford the \n     fuel, or dip into my savings and purchase a scooter that will \n     give me the economy of $20 per week in fuel cost. If the cost \n     of the scooter offsets the cost of the fuel, then I made the \n     right choice in the long run. My biggest concern now is the \n     safety of traveling back and forth on a scooter. Had no \n     choice. Education or no education.\n                                                     Joseph Rizzo,\n     Townsend, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: breethnheethn@aol.com.\n     To: Senator Alexander.\n     Subject: Gas Prices.\n       I am a disabled veteran who requires a lot of medical \n     treatment and doctor visits. And because I live in a small \n     town I have to drive up to 100 miles for treatment. I have \n     been forced to try and schedule appointments to coincide with \n     my family's appointments so we can share the ride. As a \n     result, I am not getting the treatment I require as often as \n     is needed and am left suffering with symptoms that have \n     caused me to be disabled. I should go to the doctor for \n     treatment every two weeks but have to now wait up to a month \n     because the gas prices are so high. In the meantime I suffer \n     with terrible pain. But, I have little choice since I can't \n     afford the gas it would take to drive such distances. I pray \n     that the prices will go down so that I can seek the treatment \n     I need for a condition that arose while serving my country. I \n     appreciate all that you do to ensure we can have reasonable \n     and affordable gas.\n                                                      Marti Lewis,\n                                                Pleasantville, TN.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As we debate high gas prices, and as we hear these \nstories from Tennesseans and other Americans, let's be clear what we \nneed to do. We all want an energy future where America has achieved \nclean energy independence, but that is very different than what we have \ntoday. But the bridge to that future in a country that uses 25 percent \nof all the energy in the world is more American energy now.\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nWe Republicans support that, and most of the Democrats do not--which is \nwhy they propose more lawsuits and taxes, but no exploration.\n  Just as one example, to conclude: Why not let Virginia do what four \nother States do and put oil and natural gas rigs 50 miles out where you \ncannot see them, and take 37.5 percent of the revenues and put it in a \ntrust fund for schools or beach nourishment, give 12.5 percent of the \nrevenues to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and put some more \nAmerican oil now into the world marketplace so prices would stabilize \nand begin to go down? I offered that amendment to the Budget Resolution \nearlier this year. It was defeated 52 to 47. Most Republicans voted for \nit. Most Democrats voted no.\n  We are for more American energy now, and they say no.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes and the remaining block of our time be \nreserved for the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to also read a letter from one of \nmy constituents, Jerry from Denton, TX. That is just around Dallas. He \nwrote to me:\n\n       I work full time, have two part time jobs, and go to school \n     full time and with living expenses I am having trouble \n     keeping my head above water. My parents are both retired and \n     drawing social security, my dad is also working as much as he \n     can, but still they are just barely able to get by. My health \n     insurance expires next month and I cannot afford it because \n     of what I'm spending on gas right now.\n\n  Jerry adds:\n\n       We need a long term plan that allows for new sources of \n     energy, but that does not involve the complete doing away \n     with gas or making gas prices go so high. Something needed to \n     be done months ago.\n\n  Well, I think Jerry is being overly generous. Something needed to be \ndone far earlier than just a few months ago. We needed to do something \nabout this 10 years ago. But, unfortunately, the birds have come home \nto roost, and now the American people are suffering high gas prices \nwhich affect every aspect of their lives.\n  Two days ago, I was in Houston, TX, at the Houston Food Bank. I heard \nfrom a senior citizen--a woman--who is disabled and whose food costs \nhave gone up by 50 percent. Now, you may wonder, what is the connection \nbetween food costs and gasoline? Well, the fact is, the diesel or the \ngasoline the farmers need in order to produce the crop--to bring it in \nso it can be made available for us to buy and prepare for our tables--\nhas driven food prices even higher.\n  As to some of the choices we have made in Congress--for example, to \nuse food for fuel, things such as corn for ethanol--about 25 percent of \nour domestic corn crop now is used for biofuels, and we need to revisit \nthat. But in the short term what we need to do is to bring down the \nprice of gasoline at the pump. There are basically three ways we can do \nthat: One is we can increase supply which, to me, is the most obvious \nanswer.\n  I heard one of my colleagues this morning cite a new Gallup survey \nwhich points to the fact that American attitudes have changed \ndramatically with the facts; that is, as gas prices have gone higher--\nfrom January 4, 2007, when they were $2.33 a gallon to today where they \nare $4.05 a gallon--attitudes have changed about producing oil from \ndomestic sources. We are talking about in Alaska. We are talking about \nthe Outer Continental Shelf where now China, off of our southern \ncoastline is producing oil in basically an area where we could be \nproducing it, but China is producing it for themselves while we have \nput a moratorium on producing that for ourselves.\n\n  Then there is a vast oil shale out in the Western States. It is \nestimated that in the Green River formation in Colorado, Utah, and \nWyoming, there are as many as 2 trillion barrels of oil potentially \navailable from that one location but approximately 6 trillion barrels \nof oil from producing oil shale using new technology that has not \nalways been available. So we could bring down the price of gasoline, 70 \npercent of which is composed of the price of oil, by increasing \nAmerican supply which will, in turn, reduce our dependency on imported \noil from the Middle East.\n  Our colleague and friend, Senator Schumer of New York, acknowledged \nthis recently--that supply can affect price--but he was talking about \nSaudi Arabia increasing their supply. I am not for increasing our \ndependence on Saudi Arabia or any other country; I am for greater \nindependence by depending on our own domestic resources. But he said on \nthis argument--on the supply-and-demand issue--on April 30: If they \nproduced a half a million more barrels a day, the price would come down \na very significant amount. At the same time, it would stop the \nspeculation that keeps driving the price of oil up.\n  Well, I say he is half right. More supply--more American supply--\nwould help dampen the speculation and help bring down the price which \nwould help make more oil available to make into gasoline which would \nhelp all of our consumers and constituents at the pump. It would help \npeople such as Jerry, who is trying to get by while going to school and \ntrying to hold down two jobs in Denton, TX.\n  Fifty-seven percent, at last count, of the American people in a \nGallup survey said they believe we ought to take advantage of the \nnatural resources that God has given this country. I remember when I \nwas in school; we would look at different countries and try to figure \nout why one was more successful, more prosperous, than another. \nInvariably, the teacher would say because the natural resources this \ncountry has are so vast, that is one of the reasons for the tremendous \nprosperity. America is the only country I know of that has this \nbounteous natural resource known as oil and gas and we have consciously \ndecided--Congress has consciously decided--to put it out of bounds \nthrough various appropriations acts dating back to about 1982.\n  We need to reconsider this. I believe we need to change our ways and \nhelp relieve some of this pressure consumers are feeling at the pump, \nand the woman I was referring to at the Houston Food Bank who sees her \nfood prices driven up, requiring her to be more in need of the good \nworks and the charity of others, to help her with her food costs. This \nis something that I, frankly, do not understand--why Congress continues \nto be the impediment and not part of the solution.\n  Our friend from New York and others say: Well, we have a solution. \nThere was a bill that was introduced and voted on yesterday, and \nfrankly I agree with the Senator from Tennessee that it was not an \nenergy bill because it didn't contain one additional drop of new \nenergy. What it said was: Well, we are going to sue OPEC--the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--including Venezuela and \nIran, Saudi Arabia, and others, presumably to get them to open the \nspigot even wider so we can be more dependent on imported oil while \ncontinuing to put America's natural resources out of bounds. That is \nnot a solution. Then they said: OK, we have an even better idea. People \nare mad at oil companies, so let's raise taxes on oil companies. That \nwould be great, wouldn't it? It would make everybody feel good.\n  Well, the problem is that happened back in the 1980s, the so-called \nwindfall profits tax, and do you know what happened? The Congressional \nResearch Service has documented the fact that domestic oil production \nwent down by 6 percent. In other words, it made us even more dependent \non imported oil from the Middle East and elsewhere, not less dependent. \nSo we want to repeat our mistakes. It is true that those who forget \nhistory are condemned to relive it, and I guess our friends on the \nother side of the aisle want us to relive that bad part of our history \nas far as our energy independence is concerned.\n  So as good as it may feel to some people to raise taxes to stick it \nto the oil companies, it is sticking it to yourself. In the end, \neverybody understands that when you raise taxes, eventually those \ntaxes--those costs--are going to be passed down to--guess who. You got \nit: to the consumer. Rather than bringing down the price of gasoline, \nit is going to continue to drive up the price.\n  Last week we saw what I think is fair to say a very poorly timed \npresentation of the Boxer climate tax bill which, rather than bringing \ndown the price of oil and gasoline, would have driven the price up. The \nNational Association of Manufacturers estimated if\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nwe had passed that bill, it would have driven up electricity costs and \ngasoline costs by more than 145 percent.\n  So there is a better way for us to do this, but it is not by trying \nto force bad solutions, big Government solutions with $6.7 trillion in \ncosts associated with it--ones which will backfire on us and increase \nthe costs of gasoline and electricity. That is not a good solution. I \nthink most people of good will and common sense would agree. We need to \nfind a solution that will bring down those costs as we work toward that \nclean energy future that Senator Alexander and others have talked \nabout; as we use more of our own natural resources, as we develop \nnuclear power to make electricity in a larger percentage as countries \nsuch as France do where 80 percent of their electricity is made from \nnuclear power; so we have electricity to recharge the battery on that \nhybrid plug-in vehicle that is going to be produced by General Motors \nand others in 2010 and beyond.\n  We are going to have to change some of the way we operate such as by \nconservation, by paying more attention to the environment, but also \nfrom a national security and economic perspective by trying to make \nsure we develop clean sources of energy. But as we are on that bridge \nto the future to clean energy independence, we are going to have to \ncontinue to depend on oil and gas. Doesn't it make sense that we would \nrely more on ourselves and less on others to help us with this \nimportant element of a prosperous economy, not to mention the thousands \nof additional jobs that would be created right here in the United \nStates, if we would develop more of our own resources rather than \ndepend on our adversaries to sell it to us so they can use the money to \nbuy weapons to perhaps use those weapons against us?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss further this issue of \nenergy which is, of course, a massive and important priority for us as \na nation and for people simply trying to get through the day--driving \nto work or whatever they have to do that uses energy--with the price of \ngasoline at over $4 a gallon and, at least in my part of the country, \nthe fear of oil prices next winter--which is the primary source of \nheating fuel for us in New England--being well into the middle $4 price \nrange and potentially higher. That is something most people find almost \ninconceivable but, more importantly, it is extremely hard to afford and \nit puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the family budget.\n  The question becomes: How do we address this as a culture and how do \nwe address it as a Congress? We have had a proposal brought forward by \nthe other side of the aisle which seems to ignore the concept of supply \nand demand and turns basically to trial lawyers and to taxes to try to \naddress how you produce more energy. That is unlikely to encourage or \nto address this issue in a positive way. The simple fact is to set up \nan American procedure where you are now allowed to sue Saudi Arabia or \nthe Gulf Emirates or Iran over their production of oil is cutting off \nyour nose to spite your face. These are independent nations. The idea \nthat you are going to resolve the issue of production and availability \nand price by suing these nations, some of which--for example, \nVenezuela--have great antipathy for us to begin with; at least their \nleadership does--is absurd on its face. It is plain absurd. It may make \na good press release, it might make a good hyperbolic statement, but it \ncertainly does not do anything to produce more energy for us as a \nnation at a more affordable price. It may make a few trial lawyers \nhappy, but that is about all it is going to do.\n  In fact, it will have the opposite reaction. If I led a country and \nthe U.S. Congress passed a law that said they could sue my country, I \nwould simply say to the United States: You can go pound sand. We don't \nhave to ship you any oil at all. We certainly don't have to take the \nrevenues that we generate from those oil shipments and reinvest them in \nthe United States, which is critical to us as a society for our own \ncapital formation. So this policy is counterproductive and, as I say, \nis cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n  It is followed closely by an equally incoherent policy from a \nstandpoint of substance--maybe not from a standpoint of politics--which \nis the idea that you are going to tax American corporations at \nexcessive rates over which you tax other corporations because they make \nprofits that are deemed by Members of the other side of the aisle to be \nexcessive. Basically the philosophy of this position is: Well, we in \nCongress know how to spend your profits better than you, the company \nthat produces those profits knows how to spend them, and that somehow \nwe in Congress are going to produce more oil and, as a result, reduce \nthe price of oil if we simply take control over your profits so you can \nno longer invest those profits in the exploration for new oil or for \nnew energy sources or for alternative energy sources. The idea that \nCongress could in any way efficiently handle these dollars has been \nproven to be a fallacy, of course. Congress would simply take those \ndollars and spend them on whatever political issue we happen to feel \nthe most appropriate and whatever constituency we want to benefit the \nmost--dollars which could be much more efficiently used. Remember, most \nof these dollars, these profits, don't end up going to some pie-in-the-\nsky exercise; they either go back to the exploration to produce more \nenergy or they go to stockholders through dividends. Most Americans are \nstockholders. Working Americans are invested in pension funds through \ntheir place of employment and they are stockholders. In fact, well over \n65 percent of senior citizens receive dividend income. Of course, those \ndividends are a function of profit for the companies that pay the \ndividends. The money flows back to the employees of those companies and \nto the people who own pension funds which have invested in those \ncompanies, whether it is an auto worker or somebody working in a \nfactory in New Hampshire or a high-tech individual who has a 401(k). So \nthose profits usually get reenergized into the economy to produce more \neconomic activity. They certainly are more efficiently used in that \nmanner and through exploration than they would be for us to basically \nconfiscate those profits through an excessive tax because some Members \nof the other side think it is good politics and as a result wish to \ntarget these companies which they see as good political fodder.\n  A much more logical approach to production and reducing the cost of \nenergy in this country would be to actually do something about \nproducing more available energy for the American people. Unfortunately, \non every attempt to do that, we have been stonewalled by the majority \nparty--stonewalled on the issue, for example, of producing more nuclear \npower. We have a unique experience of this in New Hampshire. New \nHampshire was the last State to bring online a nuclear powerplant. It \ncame online years after it should have come online at a cost which was \ndramatically more than it should have cost because of the opposition of \nthe left--aggressive and very effective opposition in stalling--in \nbringing that nuclear powerplant online, Seabrook.\n  What has happened since it has been brought online? It has produced a \nlot of good, clean energy, not only for the people of New Hampshire but \nfor the people of New England who have benefited from that nuclear \npowerplant. Unfortunately, the people of New Hampshire have been stuck \nwith a bill of almost $100 million which is the result of cost overruns \ndriven almost entirely by the left by delaying tactics which were put \nupon the plant and the production of this energy. That attitude hasn't \nchanged much on the other side of the aisle. There is still genuine \nopposition to nuclear power. Nuclear power is a clean form of energy \nand it is something we should be turning to.\n  France--a country which is not often held up as an example around \nhere for policy, but it should be on this issue--has 80 percent of its \nenergy coming from nuclear power. We as a country should be equally \naggressive in that area.\n  Another area we need to be aggressive in, for those States that feel \nit is appropriate, they should be allowed to do over-the-horizon \nexploration for oil and for gas off their shores. It works in \nLouisiana. Ironically, one of the few things that results from Katrina \nthat you could look at as positive--and Katrina was a horrific \ndisaster--was\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nthe fact that there wasn't one barrel of oil spilled as a result of \nthat hurricane--a level 5 hurricane--coming up the gulf and going \nthrough New Orleans. It wiped out the city of New Orleans, but all the \noil rigs that were functioning--and there were a lot of them in the \nGulf of Mexico--survived without a leak, without a spillage of any \nkind. That shows that drilling in deep water can be done in an \nenvironmentally safe way.\n  Yet the other side of the aisle resists and stops any attempts to \nallow other States that might wish to pursue this course of over-the-\nhorizon exploration for oil and gas from pursuing that course. Virginia \nhas expressed interest in doing it, and Virginia may have a very large \npotential energy source right off its coast. It may be fairly far out, \nand it will be deep water, but it may well be there. There is no reason \nwe should not look at that type of approach and produce energy there.\n  We need to produce more American energy because we cannot rely--and \nthis is fairly obvious--on energy from nations in the Middle East \nespecially.\n  Another example is oil shale. The technology for the recovery of oil \nshale has gotten to the point where it is extremely sophisticated and, \nagain, environmentally safe. All the activity occurs below ground. \nThere is virtually nothing occurring above the ground, other than the \nactual pumping out of the final product, which is a kerosene-type \nproduct that can be used for jet fuel. We have a reserve of oil from \noil shale that exceeds the reserve of Saudi Arabia. Think about that. \nWe have, in our Western States, enough oil from shale, which can be \nrecovered by underground methods and have no insignificant \nenvironmental impact, to actually produce more oil than Saudi Arabia. \nAre we able to pursue that? No. Why? Because the other side refuses to \nallow exploration for participation in oil shale in the West.\n  Those are a few examples of the type of expansion and approach we \nshould take toward producing more American energy, which is totally \nresisted, regrettably, by Members of the other side of the aisle who \nare speaking for aggressive groups on the left.\n  We are not going to produce more energy or reduce energy costs by \nsetting up a regime to sue Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. We will probably \nhave the exact opposite effect. Certainly, it will affect the \nwillingness of those countries to invest in the United States. We are \nnot going to produce more energy or reduce energy costs by putting a \nconfiscatory tax on companies that produce energy and taking money that \ncan go to individuals through dividends, working Americans, or can go \nto greater exploration out of the pipeline and giving it to people in \nCongress to spend on special interest groups.\n  The only way we are going to get more energy and reduce our reliance \non foreign energy is if we produce more in the United States, which we \ncan do; we have the reserves. We are not allowed to use them. We can \npursue nuclear, for example, and we can pursue renewables. They can \nhave a positive effect, but they cannot obviously overwhelm the entire \nneed, or carry the entire need. We also, of course, should look at \nother areas, such as conservation and using a different type of vehicle \nor engine--something that is either a hybrid or an all-electric engine. \nBut to drive an all-electric car, you have to have electricity \nproduced, which means you have to have more electrical plants, and you \nhave to make sure they are clean and not putting carbon, nitrogen, and \nsulfates into the air.\n  We should be using nuclear power and promoting clean coal technology. \nSo you need specific initiatives that will actually produce something \nin the way of energy, not political statements that produce something \nin the way of hyperbole. Senator Domenici has proposed a bill that \nwould carry a number of those issues--expansion in the effort of \nnuclear, the opportunity to pursue over-the-horizon exploration, and \nusing shale oil through underground recovery. Yet that bill has been \nheld up and stopped by the other side of the aisle. So the question \ntoday becomes, how do we better improve our position and make sure we \nhave less dependence upon foreign oil and begin to bring down these \nprices of gasoline and home heating oil? The answer is simple: Beyond \nconservation and the renewable issue, which there is agreement on, the \nanswer is to produce more American energy and make it clean energy, \nsuch as nuclear.\n  I believe if we want to progress in this area, we need to take a hard \nlook at over-the-horizon drilling for offshore oil and gas off the \nStates that are willing to pursue that. Maine, which has the Gulf of \nMaine, is not going to be willing to do it because of the fisheries and \nneither will New Hampshire. If Virginia wants to do it, they ought to \nbe able to do it. It can be done safely.\n  Second, oil shale is a reserve that can be produced, again, \nunderground and without environmental harm. These are substantive, \nspecific approaches, which we need at this time.\n  I yield the floor, reserve the remainder of our time, and I suggest \nthe absence much a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, our people are hurting. There \nis something wrong with the price of oil and gas. It is not a normal \nfunction of the marketplace of supply and demand that the price of oil \nhit, last Friday, $139 a barrel.\n  A few months ago, we had an ExxonMobil executive testify before \nCongress that the normal supply and demand of the marketplace for oil, \neven in a tight world market, the normal price would be about $55 a \nbarrel. Yet, last Friday, oil sold for $139 a barrel. So what is the \nproblem? Well, it is obviously not a supply-and-demand issue. A normal \nmarketplace sets its price according to the supply, and when the supply \nis higher, the price is less; if the demand is higher than the supply, \nthen the price is more. As you would expect, in a world where there is \nan increasing consumption of oil, you would think, even with the \nemergence of new countries that are demanding oil, the supply would \nkeep going up and up and, in fact, it has. But if the ExxonMobil \nexecutive is accurate, and the price ought to be around $55 a barrel, \nwhat is the difference that has run the price all the way up to $139? \nWe have to look closer to see. I think the American people are now at \nthe point of hurting so badly we better shake ourselves out of our \nlethargy and do the congressional investigations that are necessary to \npry open this secret box to determine what is causing oil to keep going \nup and up, so we can give our people some relief.\n  Now, it is true it is a multifaceted problem, and it is true that in \na world in which any kind of news would suggest that there is going to \nbe a part of the world that is disturbed, that it sends jitters \nthroughout the marketplace, particularly on oil--since oil is so much \nvalued as a commodity. That would certainly be one reason that would \nincrease the price. So bad news having to do with this or that--bad \nnews with regard to the war, or Iran suddenly having small boats that \nwould swarm the U.S. Navy fleet in the Persian Gulf at the Strait of \nHormuz, that would certainly send jitters. Whatever the world event is, \nit is going to send jitters, and that will cause people to worry \nwhether they are going to have the oil contracts and supply for the \nfuture.\n  But that still doesn't explain the gap between $55 a barrel and $139 \na barrel. So what we have discovered is, lo and behold, back in \nDecember of 2000, on an unrelated bill, there was an insertion made in \nthat bill, without any fanfare, that took away energy and metals from \nbeing a regulated commodities on the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. Whereas, in the past, that Commission would have had a \nregulation that says, if you are going to buy futures contracts of oil, \nyou have to be a buyer who is planning to use that oil. You take away \nthat regulatory effort that, if you want to buy it, you have to buy it \nfor the purpose of using it, you take away that regulatory requirement, \nand then what happens? In an unregulated market, these contracts for \nfuture oil start to get bid up and speculators want to speculate and \nmore and more they think it is a valuable commodity and the price keeps \ngoing up and up in pure speculation.\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\n  It is similar to a potential owner of a house who wants to buy a \nhouse because they want to live there, but another potential buyer of a \nhouse who doesn't want to live there but merely wants to speculate on \nthe house puts in a contract on the house, knowing the value is going \nto go up and would not even wait to close to own the house but will \ntake the contract for this price and flip it to a new buyer who will \nbuy it for a higher price. Thus, the speculative fever drives up the \nprice. That is what has happened, in part, with regard to these oil \ncontracts.\n\n  There is another reason the price is going up too; that is, so much \nof the available money in the world to be invested--we call that \ncapital--used to go into real estate, but we know what has happened to \nthe housing market. We know what has happened to the value of real \nestate. Instead of, as it has over the past decade or so, continuing to \ngo up, it is going down. So a lot of that money that was available for \nreal estate investments is out there to be used and invested someplace \nelse.\n  Naturally, what looks like a good market is the one that keeps \nbidding up the price of oil. Now we have more money flowing into the \nbidding up of the oil contracts, which causes them to be bid up to a \nhigher and higher price. And guess who pays at the end of the day. It \nis all of us. It is our people who are now paying in excess of $4 per \ngallon with the enormous consequences they are suffering, in many \ncases--I have just come back from almost two dozen townhall meetings in \nwhich I can tell you that our people are hurting. They are crying. \nLiterally, people are standing up in townhall meetings weeping. \nFamilies cannot make financial ends meet; families cannot, with the \ncost of everything else going up, afford to drive their car; families \nwho happen not to live close to their place of work, who have to depend \non their own car for transportation, are getting into a terrible fix.\n  So what are we going to do about it? Last week, our Commerce \nCommittee heard testimony from a professor, Michael Greenberger. He \nsuggested we close off the loophole by taking energy commodities, such \nas oil and natural gas, off the list of exempt commodities, making it \nclear that energy commodities must be traded on regulated markets. We \nthought we did this on the farm bill which we passed a couple of weeks \nago by closing that loophole that was allowed in the law in December of \n2000. That loophole, by the way, is called the Enron loophole. It was \ndone at the behest of the Enron company. And then the Enron company, \nonce their commodity--energy--was not regulated, they utilized that--\nremember, in the early part of this decade?--they utilized that to run \nup the price of electricity contracts in the State of California. It \nwas this same phenomenon: speculators speculating, bidding higher and \nhigher on contracts for future electricity.\n  Mr. President, am I under a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 10-minute time limit.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is there another Senator \nwaiting? There is. I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am just getting cranked up, \nbut I will see if I can crank it up and conclude within 4 minutes.\n  We saw the devastation of the electricity contracts being bid up by \nspeculators as a result of the Enron loophole in the law. We thought we \nclosed that Enron loophole a few weeks ago on the farm bill so that \nthere will be new regulation, but there is disagreement on this floor \namong Senators as to whether we have closed it. This Professor \nGreenberger has opined to us in the Commerce Committee that we did not \nsufficiently close it off. I think we ought to examine how ironclad our \nclosing of that loophole is and ask ourselves some important questions.\n  Question No. 1: Should we consider the outright barring of trading \nenergy except for a legitimate business purpose? In other words, if you \nwant to buy a future oil contract, you have to plan to be able to use \nit.\n  No. 2: Should we stop large investors and hedge funds from gambling \nin energy contracts? If it is for the purpose of just running up the \ninvestment cost, I think we should.\n  No. 3: Should we regulate or shut down international exchanges that \ndo business in the United States and whose trades and actions impact \nthe lives of our people in this country? In other words, if they are \nnot trading just on that commodities futures trading exchange but are \ntrading on another exchange that they say is overseas, such as London \nor Dubai, but, in fact, are trading on electronic machines in this \ncountry, should we regulate that or shut it down?\n  No. 4: Should we close the over-the-counter markets until the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission can get its act together with this \nnew law that says they should regulate these energy contracts?\n  Energy is too precious and it impacts the economy too greatly. This \nendless game of speculation must stop. While the traders are making \nbillions of dollars, our people are having difficulty in being able to \nafford to drive to work.\n  There are a bunch of Senators who have been involved in this issue--\nSenator Levin, Senator Feinstein, Senator Cantwell, Senator Dorgan, and \na host of others I am joining. I support these efforts to find some \nanswers quickly to help our people. At an appropriate time, it is this \nSenator's intention, if we have not gotten our act together and offered \namendments, to do exactly what I have been talking about. This Senator \nintends to do it. I look forward to the debate on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I spent close to half an hour around \nlunchtime today with a number of governors. There were some 30, 40 \ngovernors gathered in one of the Senate office buildings not far from \nwhere we are standing today. They were not governors in their thirties, \nforties, fifties, or sixties; they were, for the most part, teenagers, \nand these governors are about to become seniors in high school. They \nare part of the YMCA Youth in Government. They are here from all over \nthe country. It was great to be with them and see young leaders coming \nup through the ranks and hoping to push old guys like us out of the way \nand take our places, whether it is New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, or \nDelaware.\n  One of the issues we talked about was how difficult it is to get \nthings done around here anymore. If you read the Constitution and you \nread the rules of the Senate, there is the opportunity for one person \nin the Senate to slow things down quite a bit, for a handful of people \nto really bollix things up and bring business to a halt.\n  I have never seen a time when we have had so many filibusters in the \nSenate. This is my eighth year, about as long as the Presiding Officer. \nSo far in this Congress, we are up to 75 filibusters.\n  The issue we were dealing with yesterday was whether we were going to \nbring up a bill to fund the development of renewable fuels, such as \nsolar, wind, and geothermal, and pay for that by rescinding some of the \ntax cuts oil and gas companies enjoy. The legislation would also \ncrackdown on speculators and price gouging. Unfortunately, we were \nnot able to get the votes we needed--60 votes, if you will, not 51 but \n60 votes--to be able to move to debate the bill.\n\n  For everybody keeping score, this chart is not showing anybody's age, \nbut that is how many filibusters we have had to go through during the \ncourse of the year.\n  I believe sometimes a picture can be worth a thousand words. Let's \nlook at a couple pictures on these charts and see what we have.\n  This is a picture of what has gone on with oil prices over the last \n7\\1/2\\ years, starting in 2001 when the price of oil was little more \nthan $20 a barrel, and by 2004, it was up to close to $40 a barrel. In \n2007, we were up to close to $70 a barrel. Today, gosh, it is \napproaching $140 per barrel.\n  How does that translate, given that kind of history, into prices at \nthe pump? I just filled up my old Town and Country Chrysler minivan the \nother day, which I am proud to say has 175,000 miles on it. It is a \n2001 model. Delaware is not a big State, but we have gone up and down \nthat State many times in that vehicle, and it is still running. We \nchanged the oil a couple times, but other than that it is doing just \nfine.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  It is getting expensive to fill up the tank. It is a 20-gallon tank. \nWhen I filled up my first tank in my Town and Country minivan, it cost \nme about a buck 30, a buck 40 to fill up. I filled it up this last \nweekend, and it was $75--a lot of money. It is the most we have ever \npaid. It was painful.\n  This is what the runup in prices looks like. There is not too much \ndifference from 2001 to 2003, and then they steadily climb. Recently, \nwe have seen it take off.\n  That chart was looking at 8 years. Let's look at 1 year. This is \nanother way of--I don't think we will look at this chart. We just \nlooked at something similar to this.\n  This is 2008. This is just 1 year of gas prices. We saw at the start \nof the year about $3.11 per gallon; by May 26, $3.93; and in most \ncases, around the country it is up over $4 a gallon.\n  To follow up on what Senator Nelson was talking about, why the runup? \nWe had some really smart people come by and testify before the Commerce \nCommittee last week. One was a guy named George Soros, a gentleman, a \nvery wealthy man. The Presiding Officer probably knows him or certainly \nknows of him, as do many of us. One of the issues he talked about that \nwas very insightful was the value of the asset that the oil-producing \nnations have, the oil under the ground, how that is an appreciating \nvalue, a rising value over time. We just saw the increase from 20 bucks \na barrel up to 140 bucks a barrel, an appreciating asset underground. \nOur asset is a currency, a depreciating asset over the last number of \nyears. We have seen the value of the dollar against most other \ncurrencies go down.\n  If you are an oil-producing nation, why would you surrender an asset \nappreciating in value to take on an asset--our currency--which is \ndepreciating in value? Why would you be anxious to pump more oil, which \nis appreciating in value, to take on the dollar, which is depreciating \nin value? I think it is one of the reasons the oil-producing nations \nare reluctant to produce more oil. It is a problem we face and other \noil-consuming nations around the world face.\n  It is not just supply and demand causing the runup in prices. That is \npart of it. It is not just the drop in the value of the dollar causing \nthe runup in prices. As Senator Nelson and others suggest, there is \nsomething going on with speculation.\n  Not everybody who buys a contract on oil to deliver to this country \nhas the intention of taking possession of that oil; rather, they are \nspeculating that the price is going to go up, not unlike the way people \nwould buy houses or condos--as in recent years we appreciated the \nhousing bubble--expecting housing prices would continue to rise, and \nthey did up until now. Speculators are trading on the idea that the \nvalue of oil is going to continue to go up. Maybe it will, but my guess \nis it will not be forever. Part of our challenge in this country is \nfigure how it won't go up forever and provide some relief at the pump.\n  This chart shows the percentage of oil owned by speculators from \nJanuary 1996 to April of this year. In 1996 or so, less than 15 percent \nof the oil was actually owned by speculators. If you look at today, at \n2007-2008, we are up to almost 35, 40 percent not owned by those who \nare anxious to take oil and refine it but those who are speculating the \nvalue will continue to go up.\n\n  What can we do about it? One of the things we can do about it in this \ncountry is to go after the speculators, and we certainly attempted to \ndo that as recently as yesterday with the legislation we could not get \n60 votes to move to. But there are some other things we can do, and \nthere are some actions we have already taken as a Congress, working \nwith the administration, to encourage people to be helpful in bringing \ndown the demand for the limited amount of oil that is out in the \nmarketplace. Let me mention a few of them.\n  I wish to mention the hybrid Dodge Durango and the hybrid Chrysler \nAspen. A few years ago, a partnership was formed between our friends at \nGeneral Motors, DaimlerChrysler, and BMW to develop the next generation \nof hybrid, and the first fruits of that have gone into the hybrid Dodge \nDurango and the hybrid Chrysler Aspen. Today, the Durango and the \nAspen, in the city, get about 14 miles per gallon and, on the highway, \nabout 18. Starting in August, when they will begin selling the hybrid, \nin the cities I think they will get close to 22 miles per gallon, and \non the highway about 25 miles per gallon. That is not such terrific \nmileage, but compared to what it was, it is almost a 50-percent \nimprovement over what was the case. For people looking for a larger \nvehicle and SUV, there is something to look for right here. People \ndon't have to buy a big vehicle to be able to enjoy better gas mileage \nin our vehicles. I wish to mention, if I can, the Chevrolet Malibu \nhybrid. The Chevrolet Malibu was selected as the car of the year. Last \nyear, the Saturn Aura was selected as the car of the year. We haven't \ncompeted too well for a while in this country for our vehicles, in the \nmidsize sedan segment, but the Malibu is not only the car of the year \nbut also J.D. Power announced last week that, in terms of midsize \nsedans, the Malibu is selected as a top-quality vehicle. That is \nagainst some tough competition in the Toyota Camrys and the Honda \nAccords and the Nissan Altimas of the world. For a top-quality car, the \nChevrolet Malibu looks great and gets good gas mileage but also has a \nhybrid people might be interested in, for people looking to buy a new \nvehicle or maybe downsize or resize their vehicle. This is not a bad \none to look at. There is the Saturn Aura up there.\n  Here in the middle is a concept car I saw at the North American Auto \nShow about a year and a half ago. At the time, it was an idea, and they \nactually had a full-size mockup of what they called the Chevrolet Volt. \nI called it eye candy at the time--very good-looking vehicle, very \nattractive, very easy on the eye, but it turns out it is a plug-in \nhybrid vehicle. The idea is you plug it in and charge the battery. You \nplug it into your garage or wherever you have an outlet in your home, \nand the next day you can drive it for 40 miles without a charge. It has \nan auxiliary power unit onboard. It could be a low-emission diesel, \ncould be an internal combustion engine, could be a fuel cell. It could \nbe any one of those three alternative power systems that would recharge \nthe battery. They don't run the vehicle, they recharge the battery.\n  The idea for gas mileage in this vehicle, which is to be on the road \nin 2010, is about 80 miles per gallon. Now we are talking. One of the \nthings we are doing in the Congress is providing investment monies, \nabout $100 million for investing in lithium ion battery technology. So \nwhen 2010 actually rolls around, we will have a battery to do the job.\n  The other thing we are doing is we are providing tax credits for \nfolks who buy highly energy-efficient hybrids, credits anywhere from \nabout $500 per vehicle up to about $3,500 per vehicle. When plug-in \nhybrids come along in 2010, I expect to see a credit there of up to \nabout $5,000 per vehicle to incentivize people to buy those vehicles.\n  We also have a requirement that for the Federal Government in the \nPostal Service, both on the civilian side of the Government and the \nmilitary side of the Government, about 75 percent of our vehicles that \nwe purchase have to be advance technology vehicles starting this year, \nand the same requirement for the Postal Service.\n  Another thing we can do as Americans, as consumers, to bring down the \ndemand side and try to put some downward pressure on prices, is simply \nto encourage folks to take transit more. They don't need a whole lot of \nencouragement because they are taking it. They are certainly taking it \nin Maryland, where our Presiding Officer is from, and they are taking \nit in Delaware a whole lot more.\n  Transit saves nearly 4 million gallons of gasoline per day. At $4 per \ngallon, that is almost $16 million saved from transit every day. Not \nevery year, not every month, but every day we are going to save $16 \nmillion from transit. The typical public transit user consumes about \none-half the oil an automobile rider consumes.\n  What else can we do as consumers? Take the train. Not just MARC \ntrains in Maryland between DC and the Delaware line, but they can take \nAmtrak. These are the ups and downs of Amtrak ridership since 1991. \nRidership on trains peaks usually between Thanksgiving and New Year's \nDay. Ridership peaks during the summer months as well.\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nRidership at other times drops off. Right about here, Amtrak's on-time \nperformance was not very good. I was on the Amtrak board at the time as \nGovernor of Delaware. There was very good on-time performance and not \nvery good ridership.\n  Look at this. Ridership continues to climb. Ridership on Amtrak last \nyear was up about 10 percent. Ridership is up this year, this fiscal \nyear to date, up about 15 percent. I would tell the Presiding Officer \nthat I rode the train on Monday. I went to Philadelphia, to New York, \nand came back to Delaware. Every train I took, and not peak-time \ntrains, basically SRO--standing room only. A lot of people are taking \nthe train. It is a great way not just to save money but to reduce \ncongestion at the airports and on the roads too.\n  Here is what is going on in commuter rail ridership from Seattle, WA, \nto Philadelphia, PA. We have worked with SEPTA, in a partnership there. \nSeattle, WA, ridership up there the first 3 months of this year is \nabout 28 percent; Harrisburg, PA, of all places, up 17 percent; \nOakland, CA, 16 percent; Stockton, CA, 14 percent; and Pompano Beach, \nnot exactly a place you think of for transit, up 13 percent; and \nGreater Philadelphia, up about 10.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is to say we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to do a number of things: tax policy that encourages \npeople to buy more efficient vehicles--hybrid and so forth--and we are \ndoing that; investing our dollars to help develop lithium ion batteries \nand technologies for the Chevrolet Volt and other vehicles, and we are \ndoing that; we are trying to provide support for transit. The Presiding \nOfficer and I have been very much in favor of doing that and working \nhard toward that end and providing reasonable support for Amtrak to \nhelp expand their capacity.\n  But you know the old story ``You can lead a horse to water but you \ncan't make him drink''? We as consumers have to take advantage. When \nAmtrak is offered, when transit is offered and it is available and it \nmakes sense for us, and when it is time to trade in for a newer \nvehicle, keep in mind the kind of vehicles that are out there and \nproduced in this country and from around the world and take advantage \nof those and buy one.\n  That can be what we can do as individuals to make a difference on \nthis issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the price of gasoline is the biggest issue \nin this country, and I appreciate the comments the Senator from \nDelaware made. However, the one-size-fits-all law is a little tough for \nthis country. He probably doesn't realize we don't have any passenger \ntrains or commuter trains anywhere in Wyoming. We used to, but they \nshowed there wasn't enough use by changing the schedules so it always \nshowed up 12 hours late, and most people weren't willing to wait 12 \nhours for a train. Then when you don't have the use, you can take the \ntrain out.\n  A lot of people in our State don't just drive their car to be able to \nget to work. Driving their truck or their car is their work. And we \nhave these huge miles between places. One of my experiences recently is \nthat I was driving between some towns and I, unfortunately, didn't have \nenough gas to make it to the next town. So I started to fill my tank \nand the pump stopped at exactly $75. Now, I can't tell you the last \ntime I got a pump to stop right on the numbers. It used to be pretty \neasy because you could squeeze the handle and get it to an even number. \nBut now you squeeze the handle a little bit and it goes zap and up \nquite a few cents. But it cut off right at $75. I thought, I don't \nthink that is enough to fill this tank. When I checked, it wasn't. So \nthere are some limits the credit card companies or the pumps are not \nused to, where they cut off, and that is making it a very important \nissue in Wyoming and the rest of the Nation. Because it is making it \nmore expensive to take a vacation, it is making it more expensive to \ncool our houses, and it is making it more expensive to go to the \ngrocery store.\n  Unfortunately, at a time when the American people are begging us to \ntake constructive action, the Senate refuses to have a serious debate \non this important topic. Instead of working together to find sensible \nsolutions we can agree on, the Democratic majority insists on playing \n``gotcha'' politics and bringing up policies that have not been through \nany committee. So they know they will not pass. They do it to score \ncheap political points. That is not how we are supposed to operate. \nThat is how we have been operating now for several months. I think the \nfarm bill is the last one that seriously went through a committee and \nfollowed the whole process.\n  Earlier, there was a chart up that showed 75 filibusters. Well, the \nblame for 75 filibusters shouldn't all be placed on the ``other'' side \nof the aisle. That count of filibusters is anytime that a cloture \nmotion is filed. I have noticed it has been very convenient for the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to put in a bill on a Friday and file a \ncloture motion that we would vote on Monday or Tuesday morning. So far \nas I can tell, the purpose of that, with the 51-to-49 split and 2 \nPresidential candidates gone on one side and one Presidential candidate \ngone on the other side, is they couldn't assure they would win a vote.\n  So if you file cloture and you happen to win, it is going to be 30 \nhours before there can be another single vote, which takes us to at \nleast Wednesday night, and that means you don't have to get your \ncandidates to come in until Wednesday night. So it has been very \nconvenient to have this kind of process on the Senate side. That \nprocess was designed so the majority would have a say in what was \nhappening and so the minority could put amendments on.\n  Now, we have this little thing over here, it is a little \nparliamentary procedure, where you can file a couple amendments at the \nsame time you file the cloture motion, and that prohibits any \namendments, so you don't have to worry about the other side having \nanything difficult to vote on. The minority almost always, I think \nthrough the history of the Senate, has stopped debate on that kind of a \nprocess. The 40 in the minority stop the debate. That is what we have \nbeen going through.\n  We had a perfect example of that yesterday. The Senate voted on a tax \npackage that included an extension of wind and solar production tax \ncredits. Democrats and Republicans both agree we need to extend those \nimportant tax credits. We came together to support the provisions to \nextend those credits by a vote of 88 to 8 in April. But instead of \nworking together, working with our colleagues in the House to move the \nprovision that had the support of the 88 Senators forward, the majority \nforced us to vote yesterday on an extension we all knew wouldn't pass.\n  Now, I am mad about the price of energy, just like everybody else. I \ndon't like going to the gas station and paying $4 for a gallon of gas. \nI look at the profits the oil industry is making, and I do find them \nshocking. They are big numbers, until--until--you compare them with the \ndollars we are shipping to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and other \ncountries every day. We are shipping money out of this country to get \nenergy in much bigger numbers than we are paying to any American \ncompanies.\n  But I also look at the situation we face, and I wish to do something \nthat will improve it and not harm it. My colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle obviously don't have the same desire. How can you tell, \nyou might ask? Because their proposal we voted on yesterday imposed a \nwindfall profit tax on energy companies and increased the level of \nregulation on the energy industry, making it easier to sue them. As \nusual, their answer to a problem is, let's increase the taxes and let's \nhand the situation over to the trial lawyers.\n  Now, we have tried the windfall profit tax before, when Jimmy Carter \nwas the President. While it may have made people feel good for a few \ndays, because they could say they were punishing those big oil \ncompanies for making profits, it didn't improve the situation. It made \nit worse.\n  Businesses, to stay in business, reinvest profits. Most reinvest in \nwhat they know best. I wish to see a monthly report of the oil company \ninvestments. We do keep making it harder and harder for them to invest \nin America.\n  In Wyoming, I know there was a powerplant that decided to do a little \nbit of\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nwind energy. We had the proposal out there that all of them would have \nto get a certain amount of their power from alternative energies, so \nthey planned and started building a wind power field. They were a \nlittle surprised at some of the environmental groups saying: You can't \ndo that; you can't own that. You have to buy it from other people.\n  We have to make up our mind if we want it and how badly we want it \nand who we will let have it. I don't know why anybody with the dollars \nto invest in wind power should not be able to invest in wind power. It \nis an alternative source of energy. It is something we can use, \nsomething we need. Hopefully we can get some better battery storage so \nwhen they are operating, and when people don't need it, we store it for \nwhen people do need it.\n  There are a lot of inventions we need. I have a lot of faith in \nAmerican ingenuity to know, whatever problems are out there, we can \nsolve them. We have people with minds who can come up with creative \nideas that can solve them. That is happening with energy.\n  I was talking about the windfall profits tax. I can't sum it up any \nbetter than former Democratic Senator John Breaux from Louisiana did. \nHe said: A windfall profits tax is not going to produce a single barrel \nof oil. A windfall profits tax will produce less energy and not more.\n  The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan researcher for \nCongress, agrees. A windfall profits tax doesn't improve our energy \nsituation but it does score a cheap political point, and that is why we \nvoted on it once again yesterday instead of having a serious energy \ndebate. The problem we face is the problem of supply and demand: less \nAmerican-made energy and more demand for that energy--prices go up. \nThat is the problem Congress should be addressing. That is what those \nin control of both Houses of Congress do not seem to understand at this \nstage.\n  The continued rise of gas prices is going to put an end to this dog-\nand-pony show eventually. Then maybe the majority will be more open to \nresponsible, limited oil production off our shores in States that want \nto have the production off their shores, such as the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, or we could open less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area smaller than Dulles Airport, \nto energy production with the most stringent environmental controls \never imposed. Maybe we could have a serious debate about using our \nNation's most abundant energy source, which is coal, to produce diesel \nfuel or jet fuel that can be moved in our existing transportation \ninfrastructure and can be made here in America.\n  Wyoming passed some new laws that deal with carbon sequestration, so \nthere would be a goal for people to shoot at. It is the first State to \never do that. The companies are responding. Of course, part of the use \nof that carbon is to inject into oil fields because the average oil \nfield is able to recover about 20 percent of its product. With it they \ncan get 30 percent of the product.\n  It appears as though my time has expired. I still have quite a bit \nmore I will say at a later time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator from Wyoming would answer a \nquestion on my time, before he sits down.\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I listened to the Senator's speech and I was very \nimpressed. I think it would be helpful to those who are listening if \nyou could define one word, because you use it and I use it and \neverybody uses it around here. What does ``cloture'' mean?\n  Mr. ENZI. Cloture means the desire to cut off debate. It can be used, \nbut it is a very lengthy process, very time consuming, and usually \nresults in about 3 weeks of debate even if everybody wants the debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So cloture is an instrument whereby you stop debate, if \nyou impose cloture?\n  Mr. ENZI. If you impose cloture, you cut off a lot of amendments and \na lot of debate and limit the amount of time that anything can be \ntalked about. It is a parliamentary procedure. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If anybody was listening, the Senator talked about \nthat. At the time the cloture motion is filed, there are certain \nrequirements, a certain number of Senators have to sign it. It is a \nrequest to the Senate that you vote on whether you are going to \ncontinue debate. When that vote occurs, you are voting on cloture, on a \ncloture motion regarding the pending motion or pending legislation.\n  Last night I spoke to a group of energy experts and gave them the \nsame warning I have been giving since the start of this year in a \nseries of speeches on the Senate floor. That is that the United States \nfaces a grave and growing threat to its well-being. Our economic \nstrength and our energy security is being threatened by our vast \ndependence on foreign oil. I have said it before and I will say it \nagain: If we do not address this problem in a serious way, America will \nbecome poor.\n  I could have added a whole lot to that, but let me repeat: If we \ndon't do something about this vast dependence upon foreign oil, America \nwill become poor, p-o-o-r. Mr. President, $600 billion a year--it looks \nlike is where we are headed--will be sent from this country to other \ncountries to buy crude oil that we are going to turn into gasoline or \ndiesel fuel to use here in America in our transportation system, \nessentially.\n  We have seen the warnings for years now. I remember when President \nNixon launched the Project Independence more than three decades ago. \nThe goal of that project was to eliminate our dependence upon foreign \noil within a decade. Since then, our dependence on foreign oil has more \nthan doubled and we have literally put trillions of American dollars \ninto the hands of others who often do not share our interests. The \nproblem has gotten worse under both parties for decade upon decade.\n  Yesterday, another warning was brought up to us in the form of trade \nnumbers, international trade numbers for April. Our deficit in the \ninternational trade of goods and services rose by 7.8 percent to nearly \n$61 billion in the month of April. We were also told that this $4.4 \nbillion increase in trade deficit in April was nearly entirely \nattributable to imports of crude oil and petroleum products. The \naverage price of imported petroleum and the total amount of fuel bought \nwere both the highest ever. It is obvious it is because the price of \ncrude oil was the highest ever for that particular month versus any \nother month.\n\n  It is time we begin to do something about this. Family budgets are \nbeing strained by the price of gasoline. America's small businesses are \nbeing hurt by the cost of energy. America's trade deficit is swelling \nout of control by the importation of foreign crude oil and the money we \npay to buy it. It is the time to act, to do something. Over the past 2 \nmonths, Republicans have offered a new direction on energy policy. We \nhave recognized we must open additional areas to American exploration \nand that we must put the decision of locking up our own areas to a test \nof whether closing the land to development meets a greater national \ninterest than opening the land for exploration and production of oil \nand gas. In making such an assessment, we must listen carefully to the \nAmerican people, who are hurting and who are asking us for some relief \nat the pump. A clear majority of Americans wants us to open more lands \nfor oil and gas production. They want to understand what lands are open \nfrom which we could develop our own energy.\n  We have sought to open ANWR. That would not work. We didn't have \nenough votes. We have sought new deep sea exploration. We have sought \nto develop oil shale, or at least to take off the moratorium which was \nimposed last year that will make it more difficult to develop oil \nshale, which we own in large quantities and in great abundance.\n  We also have sought to turn coal into a liquid fuel. We could do that \nin any number of ways. The technique is available; it just costs a lot \nof money. But it is costing us a lot of money to pay for this \ndependence. So we could initiate a major program for coal to liquid and \nsay we are going to contract to sell that to the military. Their needs \nare enormous. They buy a lot of it from overseas because we do not \nproduce enough of our own. So why not take that huge resource called \ncoal, use one of the existing ways of converting it, and arrive at an \nagreement\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nwhere we could use the diesel fuel so produced to fuel our military and \nwe would be using our coal, we would buy less overseas, our military \nwould get the diesel produced here in America, and at the same time the \nother one we could do is commit ourselves to develop oil shale into \noil.\n  If those who have us by the throat can strangle us with the price of \noil only believed we were going to develop ANWR in Alaska, that we were \ntruly going to develop liquid from coal and use it for whatever \nspecialized purpose we wished, know we could do it in large quantities, \nand then if we would commit to oil shale conversion and get started, \neven if it were only to produce a small quantity, the world would \nrespond. They would say America is serious about minimizing rather than \nmaximizing her dependence upon foreign oil. No doubt about it. Any of \nthose three--and the offshore I talked about, the exploration of our \noffshore which is subject to moratoria that have been imposed by \nCongress. There are a number of States that would do it, that could do \nit, and we would share the royalties as we are with Louisiana and \nTexas, that many of us voted for when we produced an energy bill, the \nsecond Energy bill the year before last. We did it, we knew how to do \nit, and we could do it elsewhere.\n  It appears to me now is the time to move on. Each and every one of \nthese American energy policies has been turned back by our Democratic \nfriends on the other side of the aisle and they have sought to raise \ntaxes, increase regulation, and ask Saudi Arabia for more oil.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be given an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's look at what we voted on yesterday. The Democrats \nsought to increase taxes on American business competing with foreign \nnations for a global commodity. They tell us this tax is the solution \nbecause the oil companies are making too much money. These new taxes \nwill not lower prices, and they know it. What raising taxes on American \ncompanies would do is to ship the competitive business advantage to \nforeign oil companies. Raising taxes on American companies and not on \ntheir competitors costs American jobs. Raising taxes on American \ncompanies increases imports and lowers American energy production. This \nis not only my analysis, it is the analysis of the independent \nCongressional Research Service. It is the analysis of the Wall Street \nJournal and the analysis of officials from the Carter and Clinton \nadministrations, who had experience with the windfall profits tax, \nwhich had a pretty-sounding name and a terrible-sounding effect, for it \nrumbled through the country causing oil companies to pay higher taxes, \nthus raising costs of oil and lowering the amount that was produced. So \nwe are told by a consensus of our greatest experts that such a time is \ndecades off.\n\n  I have spoken with those who know about our needs. They say we need a \nbridge to secure our energy future--a bridge. On the far side of the \nbridge is America, where we are no longer dependent on these vast \namounts of crude oil. On the far side of the bridge is cellulosic \nethanol used widely around the Nation and in our plug-in hybrid cars \nthat will influence the use of oil.\n  However, we are told by a consensus of our greatest experts that \nbridge and that such a time when we will not be using oil could be as \nmany as four decades from now. In the meantime, if we do not move to \nsolve it, that bridge will be built of crude oil, if it is imported, \nand we will just pay more for longer periods of time to countries \naround the world that may not agree with our idea or our philosophy of \nlife.\n  We are also told from the IEA that our world oil production estimates \nfor the year 2030 are well below what we previously thought. The \nquestion then becomes will this Nation get about the business today of \nproducing our own American energy for tomorrow or will we continue to \nrely to a greater degree on foreign oil. The question is that simple. I \nask my colleagues to seriously reconsider the Domenici American Energy \nProduction Act.\n  I ask them to reconsider the views that they held when oil was at $19 \nin an era of $135 oil. I ask them to reconsider their views as many \nhave done on nuclear power since I begin advocating for it more than a \ndecade ago. Since then, we have seen a nuclear renaissance in America \nand we are seeing a growing number of people come over to our side on \nthat issue. I ask my colleagues to listen to the 57 percent of \nAmericans who are telling us to produce more here at home. And I ask my \ncolleagues to consider whether the foundation of the bridge to our \nenergy future should be built with American energy or foreign energy. I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in light of the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, I ask unanimous consent to use \nthe remaining Republican time plus an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What remaining time exists?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not object if an additional 3 \nminutes is added to the time on this side following the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Vitter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 33 minutes on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to use 23 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of helium in this \nChamber in recent hours. I have been watching and listening and heard a \nlot of discussion about why we cannot produce more energy.\n  Well, in fact, we are producing more energy. I announced about two \nmonths ago, with the U.S. Geological Survey, their assessment of the \nlargest assessment of recoverable oil they have ever announced in the \nlower 48. That is called the Bakken shale, which underlies eastern \nMontana and western North Dakota.\n  They say it has up to 3.65 billion barrels of technically recoverable \noil in it. The fact is, we are producing more oil and gas. My \ncolleagues who talk about the need to produce more should understand \nthat I and three others, two Democrats and two Republicans, from the \nSenate who lead the effort to open what is called lease 181 in the Gulf \nof Mexico in the 109th Congress. Substantial oil and gas reserves exist \nthere, and we have opened a portion of that--not nearly enough by the \nway.\n  I notice that, in the Republican offshore proposal offered by my \ncolleagues on the other side, they carve out opening the area in \neastern Gulf of Mexico where there is substantial opportunity to \nachieve new oil and gas reserves.\n  In fact, companies from India and companies from China are now \nexploring for oil in Cuban waters. Our companies want to go there, but \nAmerican companies are not allowed access in that area. They are not \nallowed to drill in waters off of Cuba because of the embargo against \nCuba.\n  So this administration has decided, well, we do not want to produce \noil off of Cuba despite the fact those waters are open. My \nunderstanding is some wells drilled by India have now struck oil. The \nChinese are there too, but we cannot drill just miles away from Florida \nin Cuban waters. So next time I hear about people saying, well, people \non this side of the aisle do not want to support additional production, \nwe have supported additional production. That is a fact.\n  The hood ornament on that argument from them is always about ANWR, a \npristine area set aside in legislation signed by President Dwight \nEisenhower. Well, the fact is, ANWR should never be a first resort; \nperhaps a last resort in a critical time. But there is much we can and \nshould do. I am going to talk about some of it this afternoon to \naddress these issues. Yes, produce more, and I have described how I and \nothers have supported more production.\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\n  We need conservation and greater efficiency. We waste a prodigious \namount of oil and energy in this country. We can conserve much more. \nWith everything we do, every switch we touch from the morning until the \nevening, all of the appliances that we use, dramatic new efficiency is \nimportant.\n  We also need more focus on renewable energy from wind, solar, and \ngeothermal. There are so many different forms of energy that need to be \na part of the solution, including the biofuels which are a part of our \nfuture.\n  Having said all of that, I want to go though a couple of charts \nbecause what is happening today is almost unbelievable. We have people \ndriving to the gas pumps this afternoon, and we have people who have \nordered a load of gas delivered to their farm this afternoon. We have \nairlines that pull the airline up to the gate and then have to load up \nwith fuel. We have truckers at the truckstop trying to figure out at \nthe next truckstop how they stop and get a load of fuel and afford it.\n  Look at what has happened. Oil prices have doubled in a year. There \nis not one justification in the fundamentals of oil supply and demand \nfor a doubling in price in a year. There is no justification for it. In \nfact, this country has had an economic slowdown, and we are using \nslightly less energy than we did before. So demand is slightly down in \nthis country. Since January, the oil and gas inventories in this \ncountry have been up slightly. Demand is down slightly down, and \nproduction is up slightly. Yet, the price of oil doubles.\n\n  There is nothing in the fundamentals to justify what has happened to \nthis oil market. Now, I think I understand what has happened to this \nmarket, and here is the line that describes it. It is called \nspeculation. We all know what speculators are. We have lived among \nspeculators. Perhaps our neighbors speculate. We all know speculators.\n  Will Rogers described them about 80 years ago. He said that these are \npeople who buy what they will never get from people who never had it \nand expect to make money on both sides of the trade.\n  That is speculation. Speculators in the oil market are not people who \nwant oil. These are not people who ever want to take delivery of oil. \nThey are not people who would know about the viscosity of oil or \nperhaps how to drill for oil, nor would they care. They are interested \nin trading in a commodities market for the purpose of making big \nprofits.\n  They are not ever wanting to take delivery of anything. They are \nsimply speculators for the purpose of making a profit. Now, that is not \nwhy the commodities markets were established. They were established for \nhedging purposes, legitimate reasons to have a market. You should have, \nand must have, a market for commodities. For hedging purposes you need \nsome liquidity in the market.\n  But what has happened in this market is a perversion. We have \nspeculators in this market who have driven the price way up. In fact, I \nhave just spent an hour today with the head of an organization called \nNew York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX, in New York. He came down and we \ntalked for about an hour. We agree on some things and do not agree on \nothers.\n  This is a pit in which they trade commodities in NYMEX. Well, they \ntrade the crude oil on the NYMEX. One of them is West Texas \nintermediate crude, for example.\n  You have people who wear these jackets, they bid. As you see, they \nthrow paper on the floor. At the end of the day, people who have never \ntouched a quart of oil, let alone a barrel of oil, have decided what \nthe price is going to be for the coming days and months.\n  It is not the only commodities exchange. This is also occurring on \nthe Intercontinental Exchange in London and Dubai. It is a large, \nglobal market, but only part of it is regulated. Only part of it is \navailable for us to inspect and see. Much of it is out of our view. \nMuch of it I call dark money. It exists out there, but you cannot see \nit. It is not transparent or regulated. It has a profound impact on the \nprice of oil, and therefore, it has a tremendous impact on what it is \ngoing to cost consumers to fill a car with gas, a farmer to order a \nload of fuel, airlines to buy jet fuel. We have airlines and trucking \ncompanies going bankrupt and many more struggling to make it through \nthis.\n  Now, I understand we have had 12 airlines in recent months declare \nbankruptcy. We have a lot of trucking companies, mom-and-pop trucking \ncompanies, who are going belly up because they cannot afford to buy \nfuel for their trucks.\n  The airlines are barely able to afford to buy the jet fuel for their \nairplanes. Drivers pulling up to the gas pump are having a difficult \ntime trying to figure out how to pay $60 or $70 for a tank of gas.\n  I pulled up behind an old car about 30 miles north of Minot, ND, one \nday some while ago. It was pretty much a wreck. The back bumper was \nhanging down about halfway. It had a lot of dents and rust. And it had \nan old, faded sticker on the bumper which said: We fought the gas war \nand gas won.\n  Probably not surprising. Gas won. Well, gas is sure winning these \ndays, $4-plus a gallon, diesel well above $4 a gallon, and oil flirting \nwith $140 a barrel. Now, some say, well, that is just the market at \nwork. There is no market at work here. This is a perversion.\n  Let me talk about the oil market. You have ministers representing \nnationalized companies under the banner of OPEC. Now, this is a cartel. \nCartels are illegal in this country. It is a crime. It is criminal. So \nyou have a cartel of countries that go behind closed doors and have \ntheir oil ministers make judgments about how much they are going to \nproduce and what price they want to get for it in the international \nmarketplace. That is No. 1. There is no free market aspect to a cartel. \nI expect most people would agree.\n  Second, the major integrated companies are all much bigger and much \nstronger with much more muscle in the marketplace.\n  Why? Because they have all merged. They all got romantically \nentangled, decided they want to pair up. Pretty soon, Exxon is not just \nExxon; it is ExxonMobil. Phillips Oil is now ConocoPhillips. They all \nhave two names and a lot more muscle. They are bigger, stronger, and \nmore powerful forces in the marketplace.\n  Third, you have a futures market that has become an unbelievable \namount of speculation, driving up prices. So you have a cartel with \nOPEC; bigger, stronger oil companies; and a futures market that is rife \nspeculation.\n  Fadel Gheit, senior energy analyst, who worked 35 years with the \nOppenheimer & Co., said:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I am convinced that \n     oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. I call it \n     the world's largest gambling hall. It's open 24/7. \n     Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. This is like a \n     highway with no cops, no speed limit, and everybody is going \n     120 miles an hour.\n\n  I have talked to Mr. Gheit by telephone. He was a witness at a \nhearing in December 2007. I have a sense of what he is about and what \nhe thinks. He believes this market is a complete perversion. It is rife \nspeculation, with people driving up the price of oil, having nothing to \ndo with the fundamentals of supply and demand.\n  It is not just Mr. Gheit from the Oppenheimer and Co. We see this in \nthe New Jersey Star Ledger:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent or \n     more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  If the former head of ExxonMobil is saying there is so much \nspeculation that it has added 20 to 30 percent to the price of a barrel \nof oil, the question is whether that is credible?\n  From the senior Vice President of ExxonMobil:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 or $55 a barrel.\n\n  The president of Marathon Oil, Clarence Cazalot, Jr.:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  During a question-and-answer period with reporters, he suggested a \nmore reasonable range for crude oil prices would be between $55 and $60 \na barrel.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is supposed to be the \nregulating body. I know regulation is a four-letter word in this \nChamber for some. It is not for me. A free market works only when it is \nopen and free. When the arteries get clogged, bad things happen. We \nhave seen a lot of clogging of the arteries in this so-called free \nmarket system. But we have a referee for the free market system. It\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nis called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC. The CFTC \nis supposed to be a regulator, but like a lot of regulators, it seems \nto be pretty much asleep at the switch. I will describe why and how in \na minute.\n  I have some experience with this because I chaired the hearings in \nthe Senate over in the Commerce Committee on the Enron scandal. I had \nKen Lay, now deceased, come to our hearings. He was the CEO of Enron. \nHe raised his hand, took an oath, sat down, and took the fifth \namendment. He was subsequently sentenced to prison but died before he \nwent there. Once exposed, several in the Enron Corporation went to \nprison because we discovered it was a criminal enterprise. Among other \nthings, it soaked billions of dollars of ill-gotten gains, particularly \nout of consumers on the west coast through wholesale electricity \nprices. That happened under the nose of what was supposed to have been \na Federal regulator, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  During that time, I raised the question about the speculation and the \nmanipulation of the marketplace by Enron and others. Vice President \nCheney scoffed and said: There is nothing going on here. Shame on all \nof you for suggesting there is something nefarious happening. It turns \nout Dick Cheney was dead wrong, supporting the energy interests ahead \nof the public interest. We found out later it was a criminal \nenterprise. We found out later that the regulator did nothing other \nthan sat by and watched what was happening.\n  Now we have a regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nwhich is supposed to be wearing the referee's shirt with stripes that \ncalls the fouls with respect to energy trading. The Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission has actually allowed a lot of this to occur, this \nspeculation, by issuing what are called no-action letters so that a \nnumber of commodity trades can move to the dark side so they can't be \nseen and regulated by the regulator. In fact, the regulator is saying \nthat it is OK for us not to see you or understand what you are doing \nwhich is kind of unbelievable. It defies credibility to hear a \nregulatory body say: We don't want the information with which to \nregulate you.\n  Let me describe what Mr. Lukken, the head of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, the regulatory body, has been saying. I am using \nthe description that he is ``parroting'' the assertion by those \ninvolved in the market. These are the very speculators who make a lot \nof money in these markets and want us to believe that nothing is really \nhappening. There is not substantial speculation. This is just a lot of \ngood people selling and buying back and forth.\n  Here is what Mr. Lukken says:\n\n       Based on our surveillance efforts to date, we believe that \n     energy futures markets have been reflecting the underlying \n     fundamentals of those markets.\n\n  That was last July. Mr. Lukken says: Gosh, things are fine. Don't \nworry. Be happy. Everything is OK. The fundamentals justify whatever is \ngoing on. That was last July.\n\n  The acting Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Lukken, again said in \nJanuary of this year:\n\n       Based on our surveillance efforts to date, we believe that \n     energy futures markets have been largely reflecting the \n     underlying fundamentals of these markets.\n\n  You will note he said in January exactly what he said in July, but he \nchanged one word. It must have been a mistake. He changed one word. He \nessentially says: Hey, don't worry about the price of oil and gas. This \nis all about fundamentals. So the Chairman of the regulatory body says \nthings are OK once again.\n  In February, acting Chairman Lukken says:\n\n       The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is confident that \n     U.S. futures exchanges and clearinghouses are functioning \n     well, especially during these turbulent economic times.\n\n  Don't worry. We regulators have our hands on it. We have it all \nfigured out.\n  On May 7, the acting Chairman of the regulatory body says:\n\n       We can say with a high degree of confidence that people are \n     not manipulating the energy markets.\n\n  That is really interesting because just two weeks ago this same \nperson, Mr. Lukken, who has told us now for a year, while the price of \noil has doubled, there is really no speculation, this is just supply \nand demand at work. The fundamentals of the marketplace are working. \nDon't worry, be happy. Nothing nefarious is going on. There is no \nmanipulation, then all of a sudden, two weeks ago, this man must have \nhad some sort of epiphany. I don't know what he ate for dinner, but \nsuddenly he woke up and made an announcement that the CFTC wants to \nfind out what is going on in this marketplace and for the last 7 months \nthey have been investigating it. Really? That is interesting. What \nabout his statements during the last year they had already concluded \nnothing was wrong?\n  I wonder at what point Americans should be relying on the word of Mr. \nLukken when he was telling us in January there is nothing going on. It \nis just the fundamentals at work. Yet, he was reassuring us in early \nMay there was nothing happening. Perhaps a couple weeks ago, he \napparently, in some startling 180-degree turn decided to figure out \nwhat is happening.\n  Mr. Lukken, the acting Chairman, and his nomination is before this \nbody, said we are now going to something called the Intercontinental \nExchange and others. Incidentally, it is a foreign exchange but an \nexchange in London, largely founded by American companies, trading on \ncomputer terminals in Atlanta, GA, and other places in the U.S. but \nallowed to do it without oversight or regulation by the CFTC because \nthey exempted them with a letter of no action. It basically is saying \nwe are not going to find out what is going on. Really? I thought you \nknew what was going on. You have been assuring us all along that you \nknew what was happening. Turns out now he admits they don't have nearly \nthe information with which to judge whether there was excessive \nspeculation.\n  By the way, the Administration, to the extent it was doing anything, \ncalled for the creation of a task force of several agencies, including \nthe CFTC. They act as if the barn is on fire at the moment. They go \nfrom no motion to slow motion to some sort of hyperspeed, I guess. But \nI have almost no confidence in statements for 6 or 8 months saying that \nthe doubling of the price of oil is just fine, and it is unrelated to \neither manipulation or speculation.\n  I had one of the presidents of one of the largest investment banking \nfirms come to my office. I think we spent an hour speaking. At the end \nof the hour, he answered every question except the one he couldn't \nanswer, the one I kept asking: If you say fundamentals are at the root \nof why the price of oil has doubled, then tell me what those \nfundamentals are that justify the doubling of the price of oil. Is it \nthat supply is down and demand is up? If that is not the case, what are \nthe fundamentals? Those who argue that this speculative binge cannot \nanswer the question, what fundamentals justify doubling the price of \noil?\n  The importance of that is this: I used to teach a little economics--\nnot very much--in college. I taught economics briefly. I tell people I \nwas able to overcome that experience and go on to lead, nonetheless, \nsomewhat of a productive life. Economics is psychology pumped up with \nhelium. That is all it is. Everybody says they know this, that, or the \nother thing. Economics is about human behavior. But I understand enough \nabout the economics of this issue to understand you have binges of \nexcess and speculation, and we have seen them in history. You can find \nbooks about them. They will take you back to the days when tulip bulbs \nwere sold for $25,000 for one bulb in a binge of speculation that is \nstill written about today, 400 or 500 years ago. We have bubbles of \nspeculation that occur. In most cases, it is not terribly damaging to a \ncountry or an economy. Who cares if you can buy a tulip bulb? Who cares \nif you can afford it?\n  Consider this. The price of oil jumps to $135 a barrel. The price of \ngas goes to $4 a gallon. You have OPEC countries going to the bank \ndepositing our money in their accounts. The major oil companies going \nto the bank depositing our money in their accounts. Airlines are going \nbroke, and trucking companies not able to afford to run their trucks. \nThe average American family is trying to figure out how they can afford \nto put gas in the car and get to work. When all of that occurs, it is \nlong past time for this country to say:\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\nWhat on Earth is happening and how do we fix it? When you have a market \nthat doesn't work, there is a responsibility for the regulator and the \nGovernment to take a step and fix that market.\n  This futures market is not the market that was established many \ndecades ago. That market was established for a specific purpose, a \nlaudable purpose. It was to allow orderly trading for delivery of \npetroleum commodities. It has now become an unbelievable cesspool of \nspeculation that has driven up the price of oil in ways that deeply \ndamage this country. This Congress has a responsibility to deal with \nit.\n  I am working on legislation that would mandate the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission to take the steps that are necessary to shut that \nspeculation down, to stop the dark money and markets, to put it all on \nthe regulated side and then to increase margin requirements in order to \nwring the speculators out of this market. I believe that could decrease \nthe price of oil and gas by 20, 30, 40 percent. It is not just me. I \nhave quoted those who run some of America's major oil companies and \nexperts involved in some of the trading at some of the largest \ninstitutions who believe speculation now has driven up the price of oil \nand gas by 20, 30, 40 percent.\n  There is a lot to say about what is happening in our country and a \nlot to say about the need for regulators to begin doing what we pay \nthem to do. I will describe the legislation I am working on at greater \nlength. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. I believe I have been put in order for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9\\1/2\\ minutes at this point.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, we have heard a number of interesting opinions on \nthe reasons and potential solutions to the energy crisis in which we \ncurrently find ourselves. Unfortunately, yesterday many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked our ability to have a \nmeaningful debate about the proactive steps we should be taking to \naddress the issues that are contributing to skyrocketing prices \nAmericans are paying at the pump.\n  All around the country, high gas prices are contributing to already \nshaky economic times for the American people. In my home State of Rhode \nIsland, gas prices have increased by over 140 percent since 2001. \nCurrently, Rhode Islanders are paying $4.09 a gallon for regular \nunleaded gasoline and $4.93 a gallon for diesel. Households in Rhode \nIsland are paying $2,000 more per year for gasoline than they paid in \n2001. That is $2,000 more than they were paying in 2001.\n  For the State economy, this means that families, businesses, and \nfarmers in Rhode Island will spend $835 million more on gasoline this \nyear than was spent in 2001 if prices remain at current levels. But \nthese prices seem to be constantly accelerating. Rhode Island \nresidents, farmers, and businesses are on track to pay over $1.44 \nbillion for gasoline this year. That is an extraordinary drain on the \neconomy of my State and on States throughout the Nation.\n  It is well known that our current energy crisis is due in part to the \nmarriage of two uncontrollable circumstances: a fast-growing worldwide \ndemand for oil and increasingly limited oil supplies. The Renewable \nFuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act, which was signed \ninto law in December of last year, made important improvements to our \nnational energy policy, and I am confident the provisions in that law \nwill help to decrease our long-term dependence on oil and thus lessen \nour future vulnerability to its availability. However, there is also a \nnumber of controllable variables that are contributing to the \nvolatility of energy markets that we must address immediately to ensure \nthe high prices Americans are paying at the pump are not going into the \nwallets of speculators and oil companies looking to exploit these \ndifficult times.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act would take action by incorporating \nproactive measures to protect against excessive speculation, keep the \nhedge funds and oil companies honest, and require investments by oil \ncompanies toward the development of our Nation's renewable energy \ninfrastructure or face a windfall profits tax.\n  Experts now estimate that well over 25 percent of the cost of a \nbarrel of oil can be attributed to excessive speculation by the \nfinancial traders of energy commodities. Yet yesterday we failed to \nmove forward on a bill that would clamp down on excessive speculation \nby preventing traders from routing their transactions through offshore \nmarkets in order to evade speculation limits and subject energy traders \nto stronger reporting requirements.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we must open \nup more land to drilling to solve the current crisis, increase the \nsupply, and lower the demand. The fact of the matter is over recent \nyears we have already opened up significant areas of the land and the \nContinental Shelf to oil companies and given them tax incentives to \nsubsidize and encourage their exploration and drilling activities.\n  Over that same span of time, oil companies have reported bigger \nprofits--almost $600 billion. Yet we still find ourselves in a \nprecarious energy situation today. Moreover, the Minerals Management \nService has reported that of all the oil and gas reserves believed to \nexist on the Outer Continental Shelf, 82 percent of the natural gas and \n79 percent of the oil are located in areas that are already open to \nleasing. Onshore, 72 percent of oil and 84 percent of natural gas \nresources are either accessible already or are pending review.\n  We also hear very little about the nearly 91 million acres of land \ncurrently open to leasing in the Alaskan arctic area outside of ANWR, \nof which only 11.8 million acres have actually been leased.\n  The idea that we need to make more areas available to drilling to \nincrease domestic production is not substantiated by the facts. We have \nbroad swaths of land and Continental Shelf that are available for \nexploration and drilling. They are not being used. Until we have \nthoroughly reviewed and sited projects there, the idea that we have to \nopen up ANWR is only a subterfuge, an excuse for inaction.\n  Indeed, in the last 4 years, the Bureau of Land Management has issued \n28,776 permits to drill on public land. However, during that time, only \n18,954 wells were actually drilled. Thus, oil companies are currently \nholding onto 10,000 unused permits which could just as easily help to \nincrease domestic production as the lands that are currently protected \nunder law. Clearly, the problem is not that there is a lack of places \nto drill.\n  Thus, drilling our way to energy independence is not the answer. \nNeither is increasing the importation of foreign oil and natural gas. \nThe answer is investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy \nprograms that currently save us more energy each year than the amount \nwe consume from any single energy source, including oil, natural gas, \ncoal, and nuclear power. These investments offer short-term and long-\nterm solutions to strengthen our national security by reducing our \nenergy consumption and making us less reliant on oil from unstable \nregions of the world. Moreover, they enhance our economic \ncompetitiveness by creating American jobs in this new green economy, \nand they protect our environment by reducing our carbon footprint.\n  There are actions the Congress can and should be taking, which were \nlaid out in the Consumer-First Energy Act, that could ease the pinch \npeople are feeling at the pump. My colleagues on the other side of the \naisle also refused yesterday to debate a package of energy and tax \nextenders that would also go a long way to help investing in new \nrenewable energy sources and the jobs these new sources would create.\n  Other economic indicators are equally discouraging, in addition to \nthose concerning the energy sector. There are particular concerns in \nour economy today about inflation, slow growth in gross domestic \nproduct, significantly higher consumer borrowing, a rising Consumer \nPrice Index for food, and other indications of difficult economic \ntimes.\n\n  But perhaps the most growing statistic and worrisome statistic across \nthe country is unemployment. New monthly job numbers were released last \nFriday, and they were far worse than economists had predicted. The \nunemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent from 5 percent in only 1 month.\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\n  In Rhode Island, 6.1 percent are jobless right now--unchanged over \nthe past 2 months. This is the fourth highest unemployment in the \nUnited States, behind only the States of Michigan, Alaska, and \nCalifornia. It marks the highest unemployment rate in Rhode Island \nsince August 1995--more than 12 years ago. The number of unemployed \nRhode Islanders has risen to approximately 35,000, and it has been \ntrending upward.\n  The Providence Journal reported today that about 41 percent of Rhode \nIsland's unemployed in January, February, and March have exhausted \ntheir benefits. This is the highest of any New England State.\n  As we all know, the Senate and the House are currently reconciling an \nemergency appropriations bill. I was especially pleased the Senate \nversion provided domestic spending for LIHEAP and unemployment \ninsurance--two critical issues we are facing today: accelerating energy \nprices and exploding unemployment numbers. This domestic funding is \ncritical to boosting our economy and helping those who are most in \nneed.\n  Indeed, many economists have pointed to an extension of unemployment \nbenefits as a quicker way to stimulate the economy than the rebate \nchecks that were being passed out and are being passed out today. An \nextension of UI benefits provides a very high return on the investment, \ngenerating approximately $1.64 in gross domestic product per dollar \nspent. This is especially helpful at a time when people are saving \nless, making them ill-prepared to cope with a long-term economic slump.\n  In Rhode Island, it is estimated that the number of jobless who could \nimmediately benefit from an extension of unemployment benefits ranges \nfrom 6,500 to 8,000 or more. Under the Senate-passed provisions, Rhode \nIsland would not only qualify for an additional 13-week extension, but \ngiven our consistent 6.1 percent unemployment rate, we would trigger \nextended benefits of another 13 weeks. This means Rhode Island could \nreceive up to 26 additional weeks of assistance to help amid these \ndifficult times. That is why I will continue to press also for an \nextension of unemployment benefits.\n  We had the opportunity yesterday to move forward on progressive, \nproactive energy legislation, and it was stymied by my colleagues on \nthe other side. We cannot let that happen. And we cannot also let the \nunemployed go without extended benefits.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I have listened intently for the last 2 \nweeks to the climate change debate and the energy debate, to Republican \nideas and Democratic ideas, to Republican speeches and Democratic \nspeeches--all about what is wrong. While we have talked, the crisis has \ngrown astronomically.\n  In Georgia today, school systems looking to transport students this \nfall are wondering how they are going to be able to afford to run their \nschoolbus fleet because of the cost of diesel.\n  Back in Georgia, today in Marietta, our sheriff and our police chief \nare wondering how they are going to be able to patrol the streets with \nthe budget they have for gas with that tremendous cost. They are \ndoubling up officers. They are leaving cars idle in the motor pool.\n  Today workers are going to the pump, and they are filling up at $4 a \ngallon--a price that is unsustainable for them based on their wages and \nbased on the cost of energy.\n  While we may make a lot of speeches, it is time for Republicans and \nDemocrats alike in the Congress of the United States to put aside their \npartisan bias when it comes to energy.\n  I was a young man in the 1960s. A great U.S. President, John Kennedy, \nstood before the American people and the Congress, when America was \nconfronting a great difficulty. We were falling behind in math, \nscience, and technology. The Russians had already launched a satellite. \nThey were on the way to developing a space program, and America was \nbeing left in the dust. President Kennedy stood before the Congress, \nand he declared the United States would launch a man to the Moon, land \nhim, and bring him home safely before the end of the decade.\n  We did not know how to do that. But the President was bold in \ndeclaring it. The Congress put its partisan differences aside and \nfunded NASA, funded reach; and 7\\1/2\\ years later, on July 31, 1969, \nthe United States of America landed two men on the Moon and brought \nthem back safely to Earth.\n  We are a great country, and we are at our best in a crisis. We have \none today. Answers and solutions lie on both sides of the political \nspectrum. Enough, quite frankly, is enough. Republicans have to begin \nto embrace those things we said are not enough of a solution, such as \nrenewables and conservation. They can help. They do not solve the \nproblem, but they contribute to solving it. Democrats have to recognize \nwe are sitting on a ham sandwich, starving to death, when we continue \nto keep our nuclear energy locked up and we do not expand and develop \nour nuclear program to generate safe, reliable, nonpolluting, carbon-\nfree nuclear energy.\n  On the issue of exploration, it is possible to explore responsibly, \ndevelop the resources of our country, and contribute to our supply \nlocally ourselves. It is important we have tax incentives for all forms \nof alternative energy--renewable energy such as wind and solar, future \nenergy such as cellulosic-based ethanol, equalizing our incentives, \nmaking sure every megawatt hour is incentivized equally so we are \nputting all our solutions on the table.\n  This is not just a political problem; this is not just a pocketbook \nproblem; this is an American problem. Have you ever thought about it \nfor a second? Regardless of your opinion on global warming and climate \nchange, it is in our best interest as a country to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil and reduce the production of carbon in the \natmosphere. It is in our interest environmentally. It is in our \ninterest geopolitically.\n  Right now, the United States of America is buying oil from three of \nour biggest competitors/sometimes adversaries--Hugo Chavez in \nVenezuela, Ahmadinejad in Iran, and Vladimir Putin in Russia--paying \nprices of up to $139.26 a barrel for oil, the profit from which they \nturn around and buy our Treasury notes. They are buying equity in the \nUnited States of America with the very funds we are paying for their \noil.\n  Yet we sit here and do not develop the resources we should be \ndeveloping that we know of and we have here today: the shale oil in \nColorado and Montana and North Dakota, a reserve that is estimated to \nbe equal to the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. There are issues in \nAlaska with ANWR, but we can work them out. We can environmentally and \nsafely explore. We did it 30 years ago with the pipeline in Alaska. We \ncan do it again now. Off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and my State \nand States on the Atlantic coast, we can drill safely and securely. We \ncan drill aesthetically pleasing, because if you drill outside of 50 \nmiles, and in most cases 12, you are over the horizon so there is no \ndamage to tourism. Yet you are extracting your own rich natural \nresource and supplanting those imports you would otherwise have to take \nfrom parts of the world you might not want to take from.\n\n  It is critical that we develop our resources. We all know that oil \nwill run out one day and we all know we have to develop the \ntechnologies to replace it. We all know we need a bridge over the next \n40 years as we develop those technologies to keep America running \nstrong and vibrant and have our economy and our people prosperous. We \nare not going to do it with ever-spiraling prices of gasoline, heating, \nfuel oil, and petroleum. We can't do it. It is time we put our biases \naside. It is time we stood and spoke as Americans. It is time we look \ntoward every possible resource that is available to us and make a \ndeclaration just as John Kennedy did. If this President of the United \nStates and this Congress join united to say we Americans are going to \nreduce our dependence on foreign and imported oil by 33 percent over \nthe next decade and we are going to do it by unlocking those things \nthat we refuse to explore--by developing our renewables, by \nincentivizing equitably all sources of energy that reduce our \ndependence on petroleum such as nuclear, wind, solar, synthetic fuels, \nand biodiesel--the world will immediately take notice and the \nspeculators who were discussed so much two speakers ago will speculate \nin a hurry that America finally\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nwoke up, the Congress finally decided to do something. They will know \nour insatiable desire for foreign oil is at an end, that we are looking \ntoward an end game where we are energy independent. You know what \nhappens when that happens: The price of oil begins to come down \nimmediately.\n  The way you have an immediate impact on a spiraling and rapid \nincrease in price is to have an immediate declaratory decision that you \nare going to do something about it and delineate those solutions you \nhave and you know are doable. Surely a country that faced in the 1960s \na challenge without the technology at the time to even know how to do \nwhat it said it was going to do can now today in 2008 make a \ndeclaration we are going to take our resources we are going to invest \nin them, we are going to incentivize them, and we are going to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. If we do that, we will have the \nbeginning of the end of the rapid spiral up in prices as well as a \nbeginning of a new solution in the Senate of the United States. That is \nboth sides of the issue coming together, finding the common ground that \nin the end benefits whom we serve: the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  When I left Atlanta, GA, on the 4:20 flight to come to Washington on \nMonday, I came here recognizing that every day it is my responsibility \nto speak not for myself but for the people I represent. The people I \nrepresent are hurting. It is hurting our business. It is hurting \neducation. It is hurting public safety. It is hurting the economy. We \nhave to put aside our partisan differences, make a declaration of war \non the spiraling cost of gas, develop the resources that we as America \nknow we have, and say to the American people: This is the most \ndeliberative body in the world, but it also has the potential to be the \nmost decisive body in the world if we will only make up our mind to do \nit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate today, certainly, about the price \nof oil and the impacts the high energy costs are having on our States \nacross the Nation. I rise today to talk a little bit about one \nsolution, one aspect of the solution for our energy woes in this \ncountry, and that is increased domestic production. Before I begin my \ncomments, I acknowledge it is only one piece of the puzzle as we deal \nwith the high price of energy in this country. Increased domestic \nproduction is one aspect of it, but we also have the other components. \nCertainly we must do more to focus our technologies to advance the \nrenewables and the alternative energy sources in this country. Then the \nthird leg of my three-legged energy stool is the focus on conservation \nand efficiency. I think it is fair to say that we in this country \nsimply do not do enough yet, and that is something we must move toward \nand move toward in a dramatic manner.\n  We had a situation in the capital of Alaska about 6 weeks or so ago. \nThe community of Juneau was left without their source of hydroelectric \npower when a series of avalanches took out the transmission lines that \nconnected the source of hydro to the State's capital. Literally \novernight, that community was plunged into a situation where they were \ngoing to be powering that community off of diesel. They were looking at \na fivefold increase in their energy prices. The communities said: What \ndo we do? We can't do this. All of a sudden we had a community--a \npopulation--that said: I can't afford to pay utility bills that are \nfive times what I am already paying in terms of energy usage. So that \ncommunity came together in a time of crisis and in 1 week's time \nreduced their energy consumption by 30 percent, and moved on then \nfurther in the next couple of months to reduce their energy consumption \nin Juneau, AK, by about 40 percent.\n  They did it through everything. Juneau, as my colleagues may know, is \nin a rain forest. It is pretty damp. There is usually not much need for \nclothespins, but every clothespin in Juneau was snapped up literally as \npeople said: Well, I can't afford to run the dryer. We are going to \nfigure out ways in our households where we learn to conserve. That \nfocus--that very specific focus on conservation now because we are in a \ntime of crisis--produced some pretty dramatic results. I think that \ncommunity can stand as an example of how we in this country can work \ntogether to make a difference to reduce our energy consumption.\n  I wish to talk a little bit this afternoon about the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge in the State of Alaska and how opening ANWR to oil \nexploration and development could help lower the price of petroleum for \ndecades into the future. Over the past couple of days, we have heard \nseveral colleagues--well, not several; we have all been talking about \nthe high prices of fuel that people are facing. I have heard a lot from \nsome about encouraging foreign nations, whether it is Saudi Arabia or \nothers, to produce more oil so that we can drive down the price of fuel \nfor our benefit. We have heard that imposing perhaps a windfall profits \ntax on the oil companies would somehow or other lower prices, but the \nexplanation for exactly why that would occur has been a bit sketchy to \nme. But I have heard almost nothing--almost nothing--from some of the \nMembers of this body on why America should not produce more oil \nitself, keeping the jobs in America, keeping the wealth in America for \nour benefit, America's benefit, not the benefit of Saudi Arabia, \nVenezuela, or Nigeria.\n\n  We can pass many laws in Congress, and we can repeal many laws, but \nwe cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. I am not the first \nperson to stand on the Senate floor and say that. If we want to lower \nour prices, we have to figure out how we can increase our Nation's fuel \nsupplies.\n  On June 5, in the Washington Post, there was an opinion piece by \nGeorge Will. He talked about the fact that America does have a national \nenergy policy. According to Will:\n\n       America says to the foreign producers: We prefer not to \n     pump our oil, so please pump more of yours, thereby lowering \n     its value, for our benefit.\n\n  That was his statement about our national policy. That is a crazy \nnational energy policy. No wonder it hasn't worked.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this full column by Mr. Will be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Gas Prices We Deserve\n\n       Rising in the Senate on May 13, Chuck Schumer, the New York \n     Democrat, explained: ``I rise to discuss rising energy \n     prices.'' The president was heading to Saudi Arabia to seek \n     an increase in its oil production, and Schumer's gorge was \n     rising.\n       Saudi Arabia, he said, ``holds the key to reducing gasoline \n     prices at home in the short term.'' Therefore arms sales to \n     that kingdom should be blocked unless it ``increases its oil \n     production by one million barrels per day,'' which would \n     cause the price of gasoline to fall ``50 cents a gallon \n     almost immediately.''\n       Can a senator, with so many things on his mind, know so \n     precisely how the price of gasoline would respond to that \n     increase in the oil supply? Schumer does know that if you \n     increase the supply of something, the price of it probably \n     will fall. That is why he and 96 other senators recently \n     voted to increase the supply of oil on the market by stopping \n     the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which \n     protects against major physical interruptions. Seventy-one of \n     the 97 senators who voted to stop filling the reserve also \n     oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       One million barrels is what might today be flowing from \n     ANWR if in 1995 President Bill Clinton had not vetoed \n     legislation to permit drilling there. One million barrels \n     produce 27 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. \n     Seventy-two of today's senators--including Schumer, of \n     course, and 38 other Democrats, including Barack Obama, and \n     33 Republicans, including John McCain--have voted to keep \n     ANWR's estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil off the market.\n       So Schumer, according to Schumer, is complicit in taking \n     $10 away from every American who buys 20 gallons of gasoline. \n     ``Democracy,'' said H.L. Mencken, ``is the theory that the \n     common people know what they want and deserve to get it good \n     and hard.'' The common people of New York want Schumer to be \n     their senator, so they should pipe down about gasoline \n     prices, which are a predictable consequence of their \n     political choice.\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n       Also disqualified from complaining are all voters who sent \n     to Washington senators and representatives who have voted to \n     keep ANWR's oil in the ground and who voted to put 85 percent \n     of America's offshore territory off-limits to drilling. The \n     U.S. Minerals Management Service says that restricted area \n     contains perhaps 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion \n     cubic feet of natural gas--10 times as much oil and 20 times \n     as much natural gas as Americans use in a year.\n       Drilling is underway 60 miles off Florida. The drilling is \n     being done by China, in cooperation with Cuba, which is \n     drilling closer to South Florida than U.S. companies are.\n       ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five states \n     (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, \n     Delaware), and drilling along its coastal plain would be \n     confined to a space one-sixth the size of Washington's Dulles \n     airport. Offshore? Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or \n     damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a large \n     spill. There has not been a significant spill from an \n     offshore U.S. well since 1969. Of the more than 7 billion \n     barrels of oil pumped offshore in the past 25 years, 0.001 \n     percent--that is one-thousandth of 1 percent--has been \n     spilled. Louisiana has more than 3,200 rigs offshore--and a \n     thriving commercial fishing industry.\n       In his book ``Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of \n     `Energy Independence,' '' Robert Bryce says Brazil's energy \n     success has little to do with its much-discussed ethanol \n     production and much to do with its increased oil production, \n     the vast majority of which comes from off Brazil's shore. \n     Investor's Business Daily reports that Brazil, ``which \n     recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of Rio's \n     beaches,'' has leased most of the world's deep-sea drilling \n     rigs.\n       In September 2006, two U.S. companies announced that their \n     Jack No. 2 well, in the Gulf 270 miles southwest of New \n     Orleans, had tapped a field with perhaps 15 billion barrels \n     of oil, which would increase America's proven reserves by 50 \n     percent. Just probing four miles below the Gulf's floor costs \n     $100 million. Congress's response to such expenditures is to \n     propose increasing the oil companies' tax burdens.\n       America says to foreign producers: We prefer not to pump \n     our oil, so please pump more of yours, thereby lowering its \n     value, for our benefit. Let it not be said that America has \n     no energy policy.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. On the floor this week, some Senators have argued that \nby opening ANWR and causing physical disturbance to just 2000 acres, \nwhich is what we are talking about, of the Arctic coastal plain--and \nthis area is about one-sixth the size of Washington Dulles Airport that \nwould likely result in the production of about 1 million barrels of new \noil a day--isn't going to have much of an impact on prices.\n  I want to quote the senior Senator from New York, who said on May 13:\n\n       If Saudi Arabia were to increase its production by 1 \n     million barrels per day, that translates to a reduction of 20 \n     percent to 25 percent in the world price of crude oil, and \n     crude oil prices could fall by more than $25 a barrel. . . . \n     In turn, that would lower the price of gasoline between 13 \n     and 17 percent, or by more than 62 cents off the expected \n     summer regular-grade price, offering much-needed relief to \n     struggling families.\n\n  Now, earlier this afternoon, the same Senator said opening ANWR would \n``have little impact'' on lowering prices. I am not going to suggest \nthat I know what he was thinking there, but I believe what he intended \nto say was that opening ANWR would have little impact on lowering \nprices immediately. In fact, if we were to vote in Congress today, this \nvery moment, to open ANWR, we would not actually see the oil down the \nline into the lower 48 States for between 5 to 7 or 8 years. But I do \nbelieve the Senator who made those comments is wrong about both the \nshort-term and the long-term effects of opening ANWR to oil \ndevelopment. He was right when he said last month that adding more oil \nto the world supply chain would increase supply and help drive down the \nprices. I think that is just as true in the years ahead as it is today.\n  We recognize that our actions in this Nation, in terms of the \nstatements that we send and what we are willing to do and what we are \nwilling to commit to--if America were to finally tell the world that we \nare willing to produce more fuel ourselves, that we are serious about \nproducing more of the energy we consume, I believe it would result in \nlower prices immediately--not in the 5 years it is going to take to get \nANWR oil flowing, but it would bring down prices because it would have \na psychological impact.\n  In 1995, President Clinton vetoed the legislation that would have \nopened ANWR. If he had not at that point done that, and we had moved \nahead, more than likely we would be seeing an additional 1 million \nbarrels of oil flowing to the market right now. I believe and contend \nthat oil would have prevented the prices from reaching today's \nexorbitant levels.\n  To go back to George Will's column, he says everyone who has worked \nto block U.S. oil development over the past several decades is \n``complicit in taking $10 away from every American who buys 20 gallons \nof gasoline.''\n  We talk a lot about ANWR and the potential out there and the \ncontroversy that, well, you can't open something if it doesn't have the \nsupport of the American people. I think we are being deceptive if we \nare saying the American people do not support the exploration in the \n1002 area. According to a May 29 Gallup Poll, 57 percent of Americans \nsupport ``allowing drilling in U.S. coastal and wilderness areas now \noff limits'' to development.\n  In Alaska alone, the Alaskans who had expressed their support over \nthe years--it has historically been 75 percent-plus of Alaskans who do \nsupport opening ANWR. We are seeing that support grow not only in the \nState, but we are looking at truly exorbitant prices, and we are seeing \nit across the country as well.\n  Just yesterday, there was a nice fellow from Indiana who called my \noffice to say he started a petition campaign on his own--just acting on \nhis own volition--to help win support for opening ANWR. He said in just \na few weeks he gathered thousands of signatures from citizens, not just \nin Indiana but in a number of States, in support of opening ANWR. Just \nlast night, I heard a radio commercial from a group, and I didn't even \nknow they existed. They were gathering signatures in support of opening \nANWR to exploration and development.\n  I think the American people know what some Members in Congress \nseemingly don't; that is, the need for America to expand its domestic \nproduction, expand that in a manner that we can move as quickly as \npossible and affect the high prices that we are seeing in this country. \nAgain, it is not just increased domestic production. That is one aspect \nof it.\n  I spoke a little bit about the Juneau example and how we in this \nNation need to be doing more to conserve and achieve greater \nefficiency. I was home in the State this weekend and folks in Alaska \nare driving through some pretty rough roads and are driving through \ntough conditions. People there like SUVs and trucks, but it is not just \nbecause they are big and powerful; they are necessary. So driving by \nsome of the lots this weekend, I can tell you just about everything for \nsale in the lots was the big trucks. People are looking at them and \nsaying: I can't afford to fill up my vehicle anymore.\n  I was in the fishing community of Dillingham on Saturday. They are \npreparing to go out for their first fish opener on Monday. Some of \nthose boats are not going out because they cannot afford to fuel up. In \nDillingham, the spring barge just came in a couple weeks ago. The price \nof gas at the pump there jumped up over a dollar in 1 day. They are \npaying $5.50 for unleaded. Diesel is $6.50-plus. It affects everything \nin the community, not just what is happening when you fill up your car. \nThey are paying $8 for a gallon of milk. They are paying $10 for a \ncarton of orange juice.\n  When I went in to get a cup of coffee, a young woman said: I don't \nknow how long we can stay in business. People from the small villages \nsurrounding Dillingham are coming in because they cannot afford to fill \nup. The communities are suffering terribly. It is not just anger that \nwe are seeing from the people in Alaska over the high prices that \nhappened this winter. People were angry about what they are paying.\n  Now what is happening is they are scared. They have nowhere to go. \nWhen your village cannot keep the lights on and you have to move to the \nregional hub and you realize there is no place for you to live, it is \njust as expensive, and there is no way to go, you say: I will go to \ntown, to Anchorage or Fairbanks. But do you know what. The people don't \nhave the money to get the airplane ticket out of town to get to a \ncommunity where, again, the energy prices are through the roof.\n  We have challenges in this Nation the likes of which I don't know \nthat we have seen before because it is our energy and our ability to \nutilize our energy sources that keep this country as great as it is. We \ncannot have rural\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nAlaska and rural America imploding because we haven't helped address \nthe high cost of energy. The answers are there. It is increased \ndomestic production. It is renewables and alternatives and the \ntechnologies we can advance. And it is conservation and efficiency.\n  We will keep working on it. I think the people are going to be \nhearing a lot more about what many of us think is the shorter term \nsolution, and that is increased production.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Illegal Detentions\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, our deepest obligation as Senators and \nRepresentatives of the American people is to make sure our Nation's \nfounding promises are being kept.\n  With a few strokes of Thomas Jefferson's pen, we were told that life \nand liberty would be unalienable rights, that a chance to seek \nhappiness would be something to which we were all entitled.\n  Our rights grew over time, and over time we grew out of restrictions \nof who was entitled to those rights. African Americans threw down the \nchains of slavery. Women marched to the polls. People came from all \nover the world to become full members of our society because of the \npromise that our country held and the guarantees that our Government \nmade.\n  But when agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement--also known \nas ICE--conducted raids in Texas not long ago, one 19-year-old U.S. \ncitizen, who was dragged from her home while she was still in her \npajamas, wasn't thinking about that history.\n  An 18-year-old U.S. citizen, who was shackled at his ankles, \nhandcuffed at his wrists, and tied at his waste, wasn't thinking about \nthat history.\n  They were thinking to themselves: My God, what is happening to me? \nWhat is going to happen to my family? What is happening in my country?\n  When ICE agents banged on the door of a U.S. citizen named Arturo \nFlores and pushed their way into his house in Clifton, NJ, without \nshowing a warrant, and when agents in North Bergen, NJ, stormed into \nthe house of a legal immigrant, named Maria Argueta, in the middle of \nthe night and held her without cause, taking her away from her family \nfor 36 hours, those loud knocks on the door quickly woke these law-\nabiding individuals up from their American dreams.\n  Now, hearing these examples, some people might not hear well. They \nmay say this is what happens when people enter this country without \ngoing through the proper channels. I hear that a lot of the time \nbecause it is the mantra of people who defend ICE raids.\n  But these are not undocumented immigrants getting pulled from their \nhomes in the dead of night. They are U.S. citizens who are targeted \nbecause of their race, because of their color, and denied every \nfundamental right guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\n  Our fellow citizens may not have been surprised that they were yanked \nfrom their homes. They might have even known that their immigration \nstatus wasn't even necessarily relevant.\n  They might have heard stories about friends who were U.S. citizens or \nlegal permanent residents but who were seized in immigration raids, \ndetained, and in some cases even deported. I am talking about U.S. \ncitizens and legal permanent residents.\n  They may have known that their accent, their name, the color of their \nskin, the place where they lived would have put them at risk. They may \nhave known that regardless of what our politicians and historians say, \nfundamental constitutional rights still might not apply to them in \ntoday's America.\n  We have been hearing these stories for too long, and it is time they \nwere told on the floor of the Senate because together we need to face a \nblunt reality: Our legitimate desire to control our borders has too \noften turned into a witch hunt against Hispanic Americans and other \npeople of color.\n  Common sense repeatedly loses out to hysteria, and agents of \nintolerance repeatedly jump over the legal protections to which every \nsingle American is entitled.\n  I am going to tell just a few stories today, but there are plenty of \nothers similar to them.\n  Last year, a 30-year-old mentally impaired man named Pedro Guzman, \nwho was born and raised in southern California, was detained on \nmisdemeanor charges and scheduled to be released.\n  He is a U.S. citizen, but somehow his accent, his name, the color of \nhis skin must have convinced immigration authorities otherwise. So \ninstead of returning him to his home, they decided to deport him to \nMexico.\n  Even after immigration authorities realized their horrible mistake, \nthey made no significant effort to correct it. Pedro attempted several \ntimes to cross the border home to the United States, of which he is a \ncitizen, and was repeatedly turned away. He was forced to wander the \nstreets of Tijuana, eating out of trash cans to survive--a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  His mother Maria was worried beyond belief and took off time from her \njob to search for Pedro. Finally, 3 months after he had been illegally \ndeported, Pedro found his way home. When he came back, his mother said \nafter so much trauma, only half her son had returned.\n  Each of us in this country has to think: What if that happened to me? \nWhy couldn't that happen to me next? What would happen to my children \nif I was taken away under those circumstances?\n  Authorities harass U.S. citizens of Hispanic descent in other ways.\n  Last fall, under the cover of darkness, a dozen immigration agents \nstormed into the Long Island home of Peggy Delrosa-Delgado, a U.S. \ncitizen and mother of three. They pushed through her 17-year-old son, \nherded her children into the living room, and one of them drew a gun on \na family friend staying in the house. This was the second time they had \ndone this, supposedly looking for someone named Miguel, who had never \nlived there.\n  Another U.S. citizen named Gladis was at her home one day when 18 \nvehicles drove into her front yard and 20 agents jumped out. Agents \nbanged on the door and threatened to throw gas inside the house if they \ndid not let them in. While the children in the house ran and hid in the \nbedroom, the agents broke down the door.\n  One of the agents grabbed Gladis and attempted to handcuff her. She \nsaid she could prove her citizenship and gave them her Social Security \ncard. After interrogating Gladis and her family for 20 more minutes, \nthe agents left as fast as they came. They had no warrant, no probable \ncause, no reason for their actions besides suspicion about someone's \nname, their accent, and the color of their skin. There is one more \ndetail I should mention. Gladis was 6 months pregnant at the time.\n  Each of us in this country has to think: What if that happened to me? \nWhy couldn't that happen to me? What would happen to my children under \nthose circumstances?\n  Very shortly, I will be introducing legislation to prevent the \nunlawful--unlawful--detention of U.S. citizens and legal permanent \nresidents.\n  The problem with our detention system is even larger. Beyond the U.S. \ncitizens and permanent residents who are unlawfully detained, there are \npeople who have come to the United States fleeing persecution, people \nwho have committed no crime, who find themselves trapped and squeezed \nbetween the gears of the U.S. immigration system.\n  The Washington Post has recently run a disturbing series on the \ncatastrophic state of our detention system. I encourage all my \ncolleagues to read it. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the first of the Washington Post articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 11, 2008]\n\n   System of Neglect: As Tighter Immigration Policies Strain Federal \n      Agencies, the Detainees in Their Care Often Pay a Heavy Cost\n\n                   (By Dana Priest and Amy Goldstein)\n\n       Near midnight on a California spring night, armed guards \n     escorted Yusif Osman into an immigration prison ringed by \n     concertina wire at the end of a winding, isolated\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\n     road. During the intake screening, a part-time nurse began a \n     computerized medical file on Osman, a routine procedure for \n     any person entering the vast prison network the government \n     has built for foreign detainees across the country. But the \n     nurse pushed a button and mistakenly closed file #077-987-986 \n     and marked it ``completed''--even though it had no medical \n     information in it. Three months later, at 2 in the morning on \n     June 27, 2006, the native of Ghana collapsed in Cell 206 at \n     the Otay Mesa immigrant detention center outside San Diego. \n     His cellmate hit the intercom button, yelling to guards that \n     Osman was on the floor suffering from chest pains. A guard \n     peered through the window into the dim cell and saw the \n     detainee on the ground, but did not go in. Instead, he called \n     a clinic nurse to find out whether Osman had any medical \n     problems. When the nurse opened the file and found it blank, \n     she decided there was no emergency and said Osman needed to \n     fill out a sick call request. The guard went on a lunch \n     break.\n       The cellmate yelled again. Another guard came by, looked in \n     and called the nurse. This time she wanted Osman brought to \n     the clinic. Forty minutes passed before guards brought a \n     wheelchair to his cell. By then it was too late: Osman was \n     barely alive when paramedics reached him. He soon died.\n       His body, clothed only in dark pants and socks, was left on \n     a breezeway for two hours, an airway tube sticking out of his \n     mouth. Osman was 34.\n       The next day, an autopsy determined that he had died \n     because his heart had suddenly stopped, confidential medical \n     records show. Two physicians who reviewed his case for the \n     Washington Post said he might have lived had he received \n     timely treatment, perhaps as basic as an aspirin. Privately, \n     Otay Mesa's medical staff also knew his care was deficient. \n     On Page 3 of an internal review of his death is this \n     question:\n       Did patient receive appropriate and adequate health care \n     consistent with community standards during his/her detention \n     . . .?\n       Otay Mesa's medical director, Esther Hui, checked ``No.''\n       Osman's death is a single tragedy in a larger story of \n     life, death and often shabby medical care within an unseen \n     network of special prisons for foreign detainees across the \n     country. Some 33,000 people are crammed into these \n     overcrowded compounds on a given day, waiting to be deported \n     or for a judge to let them stay here.\n       The medical neglect they endure is part of the hidden human \n     cost of increasingly strict policies in the post-Sept. 11 \n     United States and a lack of preparation for the impact of \n     those policies. The detainees have less access to lawyers \n     than convicted murderers in maximum-security prisons and some \n     have fewer comforts than al-Qaeda terrorism suspects held at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But they are not terrorists. Most are \n     working-class men and women or indigent laborers who made \n     mistakes that seem to pose no threat to national security: a \n     Salvadoran who bought drugs in his 20th year of poverty in \n     Los Angeles; a U.S. legal U.S. resident from Mexico who took \n     $50 for driving two undocumented day laborers into a border \n     city. Or they are waiting for political asylum from danger in \n     their own countries: a Somali without a valid visa trying \n     to prove she would be killed had she remained in her \n     village; a journalist who fled Congo out of fear for his \n     life, worked as a limousine driver and fathered six \n     American children, but never was able to get the asylum he \n     sought.\n       The most vulnerable detainees, the physically sick and the \n     mentally ill, are sometimes denied the proper treatment to \n     which they are entitled by law and regulation. They are \n     locked in a world of slow care, poor care and no care, with \n     panic and coverups among employees watching it happen, \n     according to a Post investigation.\n       The investigation found a hidden world of flawed medical \n     judgments, faulty administrative practices, neglectful \n     guards, ill-trained technicians, sloppy record-keeping, lost \n     medical files and dangerous staff shortages. It is also a \n     world increasingly run by high-priced private contractors. \n     There is evidence that infectious diseases, including \n     tuberculosis and chicken pox, are spreading inside the \n     centers.\n       Federal officials who oversee immigration detention said \n     last week that they are ``committed to ensuring the safety \n     and well-being'' of everyone in their custody.\n       Some 83 detainees have died in, or soon after, custody \n     during the past five years. The deaths are the loudest alarms \n     about a system teetering on collapse. Actions taken--or not \n     taken--by medical staff members may have contributed to 30 of \n     those deaths, according to confidential internal reviews and \n     the opinions of medical experts who reviewed some death files \n     for the Post. According to an analysis by the Post, most of \n     the people who died were young. Thirty-two of the detainees \n     were younger than 40, and only six were 70 or older. The \n     deaths took place at dozens of sites across the country. The \n     most at one location was six at the San Pedro compound near \n     Los Angeles.\n       Immigration officials told congressional staffers in \n     October that the facility at San Pedro was closed to renovate \n     the fire-suppression system and replace the hot-water boiler. \n     But internal documents and interviews reveal unsafe \n     conditions that forced the agency to relocate all 404 \n     detainees that month. An audit found 53 incidents of \n     medication errors. A riot in August pushed federal officials \n     to decrease the dangerously high number of detainees, many of \n     them difficult mental health cases, and caused many health \n     workers to quit. Finally, the facility lost its \n     accreditation.\n       The full dimensions of the massive crisis in detainee \n     medical care are revealed in thousands of pages of government \n     documents obtained by the Post. They include autopsy and \n     medical records, investigative reports, notes, internal e-\n     mails, and memorandums. These documents, along with \n     interviews with current and former immigration medical \n     officials and staff members, illuminate the underside of the \n     hasty governmental reorganization that took place in response \n     to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n       The terrorist strikes catapulted immigration to a national \n     security concern for the first time since World War II, when \n     120,000 Japanese residents and their American relatives were \n     locked away in desolate internment camps.\n       After Sept. 11, the Bush Administration transferred \n     responsibility for border security and deportation to the new \n     Department of Homeland Security, which gave it to Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement (ICE)--a reconfiguration of the \n     decades-old Immigration and Naturalization Service--in 2003, \n     the year the Post used as the starting point for counting \n     detainee deaths. Each year since, the number of detainees \n     picked up for deportation or waiting behind bars for \n     political asylum has skyrocketed, increasing by 65 percent \n     since July 2005.\n       Government professionals provide health care at 23 \n     facilities, which house roughly half of the 33,000 detainees. \n     Seven of those sites are owned by private prison companies. \n     Last year, the government also housed detainees in 279 local \n     and county jails. To handle the influx of detainees, ICE \n     added 6,300 beds in 2006 and an additional 4,200 since then. \n     They too are nearly full.\n       These way stations between life in and outside the United \n     States are mostly out of sight: in deserts and industrial \n     warehouse districts, in sequestered valleys next to other \n     prisons, or near noisy airports. Some compounds never allow \n     detainees outdoor recreation; others let them out onto tiny \n     dirt patches once or twice a week.\n       Detainees are not guaranteed free legal representation, and \n     only about one in 10 has an attorney. When lawyers get \n     involved, they often have difficulty prying medical \n     information out of the bureaucracy--or even finding clients, \n     who are routinely moved without notice.\n       The burden of health care for this crush of human lives \n     falls on an obscure federal agency that lacks the political \n     clout and bureaucratic rigor to do its job well. The Division \n     of Immigration Health Services (DIHS), housed in a private \n     office building at 13th and L Streets, NW., several blocks \n     from ICE headquarters, had a budget last year of $61 million. \n     ICE spent an additional $28 million last year on outside \n     medical care for detainees.\n       Medical spending has not kept pace with the growth in \n     population. Since 2001, the number of detainees over the \n     course of each year has more than tripled to 311,000, \n     according to ICE and the Government Accountability Office. \n     Meanwhile, spending for the DIHS and outside care has not \n     quite doubled, ICE figures show. ICE's conflicting population \n     and budget numbers make the trends difficult to determine.\n       The agency is responsible for managing and monitoring \n     detainee medical care, about half of which is provided by \n     U.S. Public Health Service professionals and the rest by \n     contracted medical staff. When doctors and nurses at the \n     immigration compounds believe that detainees need more than \n     the most basic treatment, they have to fax a request to the \n     Washington office, where four nurses, working 9 to 4, East \n     Coast time, five days a week, make the decisions.\n       A proud Statue of Liberty replica stands just beyond the \n     glass doors of DIHS headquarters to remind visitors of the \n     Public Health Service's historical role in screening and \n     treating European immigrants arriving at Ellis Island at the \n     turn of the last century. Its new role is to keep detained \n     immigrants healthy enough to be deported.\n       The mission is accompanied at times by a sense of panic and \n     complicity. Many documents obtained by the Post make clear \n     that the people in charge know that the system is in trouble \n     and that piecemeal fixes are not enough.\n       ``The onus is on us if it hits the fan,'' one official \n     complained during a high-level headquarters meeting about \n     staff shortages late last summer, according to records of the \n     conversation. ``We're going to be responsible if something \n     happens, because it's well documented that we know there's a \n     problem, that the problem is severe.''\n       ``We are putting ourselves and our patients at risk,'' \n     another official said.\n       Doctors express concerns about violating medical ethics and \n     fear lawsuits. In July, Esther Hui at Otay Mesa sent a memo \n     to DIHS medical director Timothy T. Shack, saying her \n     colleagues were worried that they might be sued because of \n     the substandard care they were giving detainees. The agency's \n     mission of ``keeping the detainee medically ready for \n     deportation'' often conflicts with the standards of care in \n     the wider medical community, Hui wrote. ``I know in my gut \n     that I am exposing myself to the U.S. legal standard of care \n     argument. . . . Do we need to get personal liability \n     insurance?''\n       Nurses who work on the front lines see the problems up \n     close. ``Dogs get better care in the dog pound,'' said \n     Catherine Rouse, a contract nurse at an Arizona detention \n     center who quit after two months last year because\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\n     she saw what she regarded as ``scary medicine'' in the \n     prison: Patients taken off medications they needed and nurses \n     doing tasks they were not qualified to do. ``You don't treat \n     people like that. There has to be some kind of moral fiber,'' \n     Rouse said.\n       In a statement responding to questions raised by The Post, \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials pointed out \n     that the federal government spent nearly $100 million in \n     fiscal 2007 on medical care for immigration detainees. About \n     one in four immigrants in the detainee population has a \n     chronic health condition, the statement said.\n       ``Among ICE's highest priorities is to ensure safe, humane \n     conditions of confinement for those in our custody,'' the \n     statement said. ``We make every effort to enforce all \n     existing standards and, whenever possible, to improve upon \n     them. When we find standards that are not being met, we take \n     immediate action to correct deficiencies and when we believe \n     that the deficiencies cannot be corrected, we relocate our \n     detainees to other facilities.''\n       By their calculations, officials said, the mortality rate \n     among detainees has declined since 2004 to a level that is \n     lower than that in U.S. jails and prisons. The deaths, the \n     statement said, ``highlight the tremendous responsibility and \n     potential liability the government faces in providing medical \n     care to a population that often did not have access to \n     adequate health care before coming into our custody.''\n       To this end, the agency recently increased its inspections \n     of facilities and is creating an inspection group at \n     headquarters to review serious incidents, including deaths or \n     allegations that standards are not being met.\n       ICE declined to comment on specific cases, citing internal \n     policies on patient privacy or pending litigation.\n       Neil Sampson, who ran the DIHS as interim director most of \n     last year, left that job with serious questions about the \n     government's commitment. Sampson said in an interview that \n     ICE treated detainee health care ``as an afterthought,'' \n     reflecting what he called a failure of leadership and \n     management at the Homeland Security Department. ``They do not \n     have a clear idea or philosophy of their approach to health \n     care [for detainees],'' he said. ``It's a system failure, not \n     a failure of individuals.''\n       A new director for health services arrived six months ago, \n     following a stretch when the agency was run first by Sampson \n     and then by a second interim director. The new boss is LaMont \n     W. Flanagan, who brought with him the credential of having \n     been fired in 2003 by the state of Maryland for bad \n     management and spending practices supervising detention and \n     pretrial services. An audit found that Flanagan had signed \n     off on payments of $145,000 for employee entertainment and \n     other ill-advised expenditures. His reputation was such that \n     the District of Columbia would not hire him for a juvenile-\n     justice position.\n       ``Another death that needs to be added to the roster,'' \n     Diane Aker, the DIHS chief health administrator, tapped out \n     in an e-mail to a records clerk at headquarters on Aug. 14, \n     2007. Juan Guevara-Lorano, 21, was dead.\n       Guevara, an unemployed legal U.S. resident with a young \n     son, was arrested in El Paso for driving illegal border-\n     crossers farther into the city. He was paid $50.\n       An entry-level emergency medical technician, with barely \n     any training, had done Guevara's intake screening and \n     physical assessment at the Otero County immigration compound \n     in New Mexico. Under DIHS rules, those tasks are supposed to \n     be done by a nurse.\n       After two difficult months in detention, Guevara had \n     decided not to appeal his case. He would go back to Mexico \n     with his family. But on Aug. 4, he came down with a splitting \n     headache, what he called a nine on a pain scale of 10, his \n     medical records show. The rookie medical technician \n     prescribed Tylenol and referred Guevara to the compound's \n     physician ``due to severity of headache . . . and \n     dizziness,'' according to medical records.\n       But Guevara never saw a doctor. Eight days after the first \n     incident, he vomited in his cell. The same junior technician \n     came to help but was unable to insert a nasal airway tube. \n     Guevara was taken to a hospital, where doctors determined an \n     aneurism in his brain had burst.\n       His wife, pregnant at the time with their second child, \n     recalled that she rushed to the hospital but ICE guards would \n     not let her inside, until the Mexican Consulate interceded. \n     Guevara's mother waited five hours before they let her in. By \n     then he was brain-dead.\n       ``My son is not coming back,'' sobbed Ana Celia Lozano \n     months later, sitting in Guevara's small mobile home as her \n     grandson played on the floor. ``I want to know how he lived \n     and died, nothing more.''\n       What appears to be the most incriminating document in \n     Guevara's case has been partially blacked out. Still, what is \n     left shows that he did not receive adequate care. ``The \n     detainee was not seen or evaluated by an RN, midlevel or \n     physician. . . . At the time of the incident on 8/12/2007, \n     the detainee was seen and examined by EMTs.''\n       Each immigration facility is allotted a different number of \n     positions, and a shortage of doctors and nurses is not \n     unusual at centers across the country. Records from February \n     show that about 30 percent of all DIHS positions in the field \n     were unfilled. ICE officials said last week that the current \n     vacancy rate is 21 percent. Concern about the vacancies is \n     voiced repeatedly at clinical directors' meetings. ``How do \n     we state our concerns so that we can be heard? . . . this is \n     a CRITICAL condition. . . . We have bitten off more than we \n     can chew,'' a physician wrote in the minutes of one meeting \n     last summer.\n       In some prisons, the staffing shortages are acute. The \n     Willacy County detention center in South Texas--the largest \n     compound, with 2,018 detainees--has no clinical director, no \n     pharmacist and only a part-time psychiatrist. Nearly 50 \n     percent of the nursing positions were unfilled at the 1,500-\n     detainee Eloy, AZ, prison in February. At the newly opened \n     744-bed Jena, LA, compound, nurses run the place. It has no \n     clinical director, no staff physician, no psychiatrist and no \n     professional dental staff.\n       Last August, Sampson, who was then DIHS interim director, \n     warned his superiors at ICE that critical personnel shortages \n     were making it impossible to staff the Jena facility \n     adequately. In a vociferous e-mail to Gary Mead, the ICE \n     deputy director in charge of detention centers, he wrote:\n       ``With the Jena request we have been re-examining our \n     capabilities to meet health care needs at a new site when we \n     are facing critical staffing shortages at most every other \n     DIHS site. While we developed, executed and achieved major \n     successes in our recruitment efforts we have been unable to \n     meet the demand.''\n       The slow ICE security-clearance process forced many job \n     applicants to go elsewhere, Sampson wrote. Of the 312 people \n     who applied for new positions over the past year, 200 \n     withdrew, he wrote, because they found other jobs during the \n     250 days it took ICE, on average, to conduct the required \n     background investigations. Last week, ICE officials said the \n     average wait had decreased recently to 37 days.\n       These shortages have burdened the remaining staff. In July \n     2007, a year after Osman's death in Otay Mesa, medical \n     director Hui strongly complained to headquarters about \n     workload stress. ``The level of burnout . . . is high and \n     rising,'' she wrote in an e-mail. ``I know that I have \n     been averaging approximately 2-6 hrs of overtime daily for \n     the past 2 months. I will no longer be able to sustain \n     this pace and will be decreasing the number of hours that \n     I work overtime. This being said, more will be left undone \n     because we simply do NOT have the staff.''\n       The overcrowding has created a petri dish for the spread of \n     diseases. One mission of the Public Health Service is to \n     detect infectious diseases and contain them before they \n     spread, but last summer, the gigantic Willacy center was hit \n     by a chicken pox outbreak.\n       The illness spread because the facility did not have enough \n     available isolation rooms and its large pods share recycled \n     air, but also because security officers ``lack education \n     about the disease and keep moving around detainees from \n     different units without taking into consideration if the unit \n     has been isolated due to heavy exposure,'' noted the DIHS's \n     top specialist on infectious diseases, Carlos Duchesne. The \n     staff was forced to vaccinate the entire population in mid-\n     July. In one 2007 death, memos and confidential notes show \n     how medical staff missed an infectious disease, meningitis, \n     in their midst. Victor Alfonso Arellano, 23, a transgender \n     Mexican detainee with AIDS, died in custody at the San Pedro \n     center. The first three pages of Duchesne's internal review \n     of the death leave the impression that Arellano's care was \n     proper. But the last page, under the heading ``Off the record \n     observations and recommendations,'' takes a decidedly \n     critical tone: ``The clinical staff at all levels fails to \n     recognize early signs and symptoms of meningitis. . . . Pt \n     was evaluated multiple times and an effort to rule out those \n     infections was not even mentioned.'' Arellano was given a \n     ``completely useless'' antibiotic, Duchesne wrote. Lab work \n     that should have been performed immediately took 22 days \n     because San Pedro's clinical director had ordered staff \n     members to withhold lab work for new detainees until they had \n     been in detention there ``for more than 30 days,'' a \n     violation of agency rules.\n       ``I am sure that there must be a reason why this was \n     mandated but that practice is particularly dangerous with \n     chronic care cases and specially is particularly dangerous \n     with . . . HIV/AIDS patients,'' Duchesne wrote. ``Labs for \n     AIDS patients . . . must be performed ASAP to know their \n     immune status and where you are standing in reference to \n     disease control and meds.''\n       Given the frequency with which ICE moves people within the \n     detention network, keeping track of detainees is critical to \n     stopping the spread of infectious illnesses. The purchase of \n     an electronic records system named CaseTrakker in 2004 was \n     supposed to help. But according to internal documents and \n     interviews, CaseTrakker is so riddled with problems that \n     facilities often revert to handwritten records.\n       A study at one site found that it took one-third more time \n     to use CaseTrakker than to use paper. Thousands of patient \n     files are missing. Recorded data often cannot be retrieved. \n     Day-long outages are common.\n       When detainees are transferred from one facility to \n     another, their records, if they follow them, are often \n     misleading. Some show medications with no medical diagnoses, \n     or ``lots of diagnoses but no meds,'' according to Elizabeth \n     Fleming, a former clinical director at one compound in \n     Arizona.\n       After Yusif Osman's death and the discovery of the problem \n     with his computerized records, the DIHS ordered a review of \n     all charts at the Otay Mesa center. During the review, \n     auditors also found that 260 physical\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\n     exams were never completed as required. The nurse responsible \n     for the error in Osman's case was reprimanded, but the \n     computer problem was not fixed. The CaseTrakker system ``has \n     failed and must be replaced,'' Sampson, the DIHS interim \n     director, wrote to his ICE supervisors in August.\n       In January 2008, medical director Shack told colleagues \n     that CaseTrakker ``is more of a liability than the use of \n     paper medical record system,'' according to the minutes of a \n     meeting. It ``puts patients at risk.''\n       ICE officials said last week that they are not satisfied \n     with CaseTrakker and are working to replace it.\n       Along with being at the mercy of computer glitches, \n     detainees suffer from human errors that deny or delay their \n     care. And with few advocates on the outside, they are left \n     alone to plead their cases in the most desperate ways, in \n     hand-scribbled notes to doctors they rarely see.\n       ``I need medicine for pain. All my bones hurt. Thank you,'' \n     wrote Mexico native Roberto Ledesma Guerrero, 72, three weeks \n     before he died inside the Otay Mesa compound. Delays persist \n     throughout the system. In January, the detention center in \n     Pearsall, Tex., an hour from San Antonio, had a backlog of \n     2,097 appointments.\n       Luis Dubegel-Paez, a 60-year-old Cuban, had filled out many \n     sick call requests before he died on March 14. Detained at \n     the Rolling Plains Detention Facility in the West Texas town \n     of Haskell, he wrote on New Year's Day: ``need to see doctor \n     for Heart medication; and having chest pains for the past \n     three days. Can't stand pain.''\n       Ten days later he went to the clinic and became upset when \n     he wasn't seen. He slugged the window, yelled, pointed at his \n     wristwatch. He was escorted back to his cell.\n       Another of his sick call requests said: ``Need to see a \n     doctor. I have a lot of symptoms of sickness . . . as soon as \n     possible!'' The next was more urgent: ``I have a emergency to \n     see the doctor about my heart problems . . . or the last \n     couple days and I been getting dizzy a lot.''\n       The next day, Dubegel-Paez collapsed and died. His medical \n     records do not show that he ever saw a doctor for his chest \n     pains.\n       Hanna Boutros, 52, who came to the United States 30 years \n     ago, waited seven months for surgery after receiving a \n     diagnosis of ``high-grade'' prostate cancer, which his \n     urologist urged be treated immediately. ICE officials sent \n     him to Krome Service Processing Center in Miami because, they \n     said, it could best deal with his condition.\n       But he was seen by nurses, not a doctor, until he found an \n     outside lawyer to threaten a suit. Boutros finally got \n     surgery just before Christmas, before he was deported to \n     Lebanon, leaving two children and a wife in the United \n     States. ``I was miserable. I was very, very scared. It was \n     always burning,'' he said.\n       Juan Guillermo Guerrero, 37, was denied his seizure \n     medication and given an ineffective substitute. Suffering \n     from one or two painful seizures a week, he told his lawyer \n     to drop his case, saying he preferred to be deported than to \n     die inside an immigration prison. A few days after he \n     returned to Mexico, Guerrero died of asphyxiation during a \n     seizure, according to his lawyers. Sometimes, to save money, \n     the government releases detainees instead of treating them. \n     Martin Hernandez Banderas, a 40-year-old Mexican, was \n     released from custody last year while he was in the hospital \n     following surgery to amputate his leg. An internal review \n     found that the system failed him before the surgery: Nurses \n     and doctors at Otay Mesa did not appreciate the severity of \n     his diabetic foot wounds, did not properly treat them or \n     prescribe the correct course of antibiotics, and did not \n     bring in a qualified surgeon to evaluate the problem.\n       Simon Reyes-Altimirano, 25, a Honduran, was diagnosed with \n     chicken pox and sent back to his cell with Benadryl, only to \n     be hospitalized a day later and diagnosed with an inoperable \n     brain tumor. He died two weeks later.\n       Shack, the medical director, found that Reyes-Altimirano's \n     care at the El Paso detention center had been ``appropriate \n     and timely.'' But a nurse at the center poured out her \n     remorse in a typed note placed in Reyes-Altimirano's medical \n     file. ``We always have to listen to the patient and the \n     reason I say this is because'' when he first reported his \n     problems, ``one of the nurses said, ``I think he is faking \n     his illness'' . . . this is not just a medical learning \n     experience but also an emotional one.''\n       Three weeks after Reyes-Altimirano died, a nurse at the \n     Krome Service Processing Center accused the Rev. Joseph \n     Dantica of faking an illness, too. The 81-year-old Baptist \n     minister had fled Haiti in the fall of 2004, fearing for his \n     life after gangs set fire to the church overlooking Port-au-\n     Prince where he ran a school, let people use computers for \n     free and quietly handed out money to needy families.\n       As a younger man, Dantica listened to tapes to practice \n     English every day, but he never wanted to live in the United \n     States, said a niece, writer Edwidge Danticat, who was raised \n     by him. He visited once a year, to see his brother in \n     Brooklyn and raise money for his church.\n       But after U.N. peacekeepers and Haitian riot police seized \n     the church to use as a base against gangs, and after the \n     gangs retaliated by burning the altar, Dantica slipped on a \n     woman's muumuu and wig and headed to the airport. He arrived \n     in Miami with a valid visa but decided to seek asylum because \n     he thought he might have to stay longer than his visa \n     allowed. In an earlier time, Dantica would have been \n     permitted to go on to New York while the government \n     considered his claim. This time, he was detained.\n       Dantica and an immigration lawyer were sitting before an \n     asylum officer when the minister began to vomit violently. \n     The lawyer, John Pratt, said agents at the detention center \n     had taken away his client's blood-pressure medicine.\n       Dantica ``turned very cold. His eyes wandered around, and \n     he appeared not to be conscious of his surroundings,'' the \n     asylum officer, Miriam Castro, later told investigators, \n     according to confidential documents. ``Applicant assumed a \n     rigid position with his legs stretched out and remained in \n     this position.''\n       Castro called for medical help. No one came for 15 minutes. \n     When the public health nurse and a physician assistant \n     arrived, the nurse said he believed that Dantica ``was faking \n     because Applicant kept looking at him randomly,'' Castro \n     said. The nurse, Tony Palladino, ``then went on to \n     demonstrate that when he moved Applicant's head up and down, \n     Applicant maintained his head rigid as opposed to limp, thus \n     not allowing his head to fall back. [The nurse] stated that \n     was another way he determined Applicant was faking \n     symptoms.''\n       Dantica died a day later in Miami's Jackson Memorial \n     Hospital, shackled to a bed. Pratt had called the hospital \n     repeatedly, trying to get information about the minister's \n     condition and permission for his family to see him. ``They \n     never said anything but they were doing tests,'' Pratt said. \n     Security reasons, hospital officials told him, prevented \n     visitors.\n       The government's internal medical records say Dantica died \n     of pancreatitis. A one-page death certificate in his file has \n     ``VOID'' stamped across it. Two outside doctors who reviewed \n     his medical records for The Post said he probably died of \n     heart problems.\n       Yusif Osman had been living in Los Angeles as a legal \n     resident for five years when he was detained crossing back \n     from Tijuana in 2006 with a passenger, also from Ghana, who \n     had a false ID. Osman was arrested on a smuggling charge, \n     which he denied and was fighting while locked up at Otay \n     Mesa. He seemed healthy to his friends and family who visited \n     him or spoke to him by phone.\n       His girlfriend, Dorothy Weens, was stunned when she picked \n     up the phone in late June and a stranger broke the news. \n     ``Yusif Osman passed away,'' the man said.\n       When Osman's lawyer called the compound to verify what had \n     happened, he was told only that his client was no longer \n     there. Weens and a cousin of Osman's called immigration \n     officials several times for answers. They were told that the \n     matter was under investigation. Eventually they stopped \n     calling.\n       Osman's belongings from the prison arrived at his cousin's \n     house one day by mail. Pants. Socks.\n       Scraps of paper with prayer verses written in Arabic. His \n     birth certificate. A letter from Dorothy: ``Hey Babe! Hang in \n     there. I'm trying everything I can do, to get you out of \n     there. I love you and God love you. And that all you needs. \n     I'm sending you $100.00. Love, Dot.''\n       There was also an inventory of the rest of his personal \n     property on the day he died: ``4 yellow envelopes. 1 writing \n     pad. I religious beads. I Chap Stick. 14 Ramen soups. 1 grape \n     jelly. 1 jar peanut butter. 1 hot cocoa mix. 1 box Q tips.''\n       The mortuary received a preliminary death certificate from \n     the coroner's office. It noted Osman's cause of death as \n     ``pending,'' enough to release the body. His mosque collected \n     money for a burial in a Muslim cemetery in the Mojave Desert. \n     Male friends dug the grave. They laid his corpse, wrapped in \n     white cloth, into the open earth and covered it with rocky \n     dirt.\n       The final death certificate arrived in the mail sometime \n     later. Under cause of death, it still read ``pending.'' \n     Osman's passing remains a mystery to his grieving relatives \n     in Ghana and his adopted African community in Los Angeles.\n       An uneven, blank concrete headstone marks Grave 26. The \n     truth of Osman's death is also buried, thousands of miles \n     away, past the Statue of Liberty replica near the front door, \n     inside a cabinet at the Division of Immigration Health \n     Services, in file #077-987-986.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, the series is staggering, revealing \ndeficiencies in our detention system that most of us could not dream up \nin our worst nightmare. The Washington Post has forced us as a nation \nto look in the mirror, and I, for one, am appalled at what I see.\n  We, the United States of America, the greatest democracy in the \nentire world, have been injecting people with heavy dosages of drugs in \norder to deport them or to move them around the system with more ease.\n  Immigration officials drug people going through U.S. facilities, and \nthey drug people who are to be deported. They drug some people so \nheavily that when they get off the plane, they collapse on the tarmac \nor have to be rolled off the plane in a wheelchair.\n  They do not only drug people to make it easier to kick them out. One \nstory that stood out in both the Washington Post article and a segment \non\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\n``60 Minutes'' was that of a woman named Amina Mudey.\n  Last year, Amina fled from Somalia to the United States to seek \nasylum after she was tortured and her family was killed before her \neyes. When she arrived at JFK airport, she was shackled, thrown in a \nvan and driven to a windowless, converted warehouse in New Jersey. \nImmigration authorities didn't so much as find an interpreter. Instead, \nthey decided to lock her up and decided she was insane, without even \ntalking to her, and decided to inject her full of a drug to treat a \ndisease she didn't even have. The side effects were awful. Her tongue \nswelled so much she couldn't close her mouth. She drooled and vomited \nuncontrollably and began to lactate. When she complained, they upped \nthe dose. She thought to herself: Maybe I am going to die here.\n  Finally, 5 months after she was detained, she won her asylum case in \ncourt and was released from the detention center. Without the \nperseverance of her lawyer, Amina would never have emerged from her \ndrug-induced state. She never would have found the asylum she so \ndesperately needed.\n  This case sheds light on another grim reality. Medical treatment at \nour detention facilities is atrocious. Overmedication is far from the \nonly problem. Life-threatening lack of care is also a serious problem. \nTake the heartbreaking story of Francisco Castaneda. Francisco entered \none of our detention facilities battling cancer, although he didn't \nknow it at the time. All he knew is he had significant lesions on his \nreproductive organs.\n  Offsite officials who never examined Francisco repeatedly denied him \nthe biopsy he so desperately needed. After 11 long months in custody, \nFrancisco argued for and eventually obtained a temporary release so he \ncould pay for his own biopsy. Life-threatening cancer tumors were \nfound. Despite amputation of the affected area and several rounds of \nchemotherapy, Francisco died of cancer at the age of 36.\n  A Federal judge recently noted that this case appears to present \n``one of the most, if not the most, egregious Eighth Amendment \nviolations [involving cruel and unusual punishment] the Court has ever \nencountered.''\n  The United States of America essentially killed Francisco Castaneda \nby denying him the medical care he so desperately needed. Why? Because \nhe had entered this country without the proper documentation at the age \nof 10, when his mother, fleeing civil war in El Salvador--a war the \nUnited States helped to fund, a war that sent thousands of refugees \nsuch as him to our country--chose to seek freedom.\n  He was denied care because he tried to make a better life for himself \nand his family. These are hardly offenses that warrant death. We cannot \nin good conscience allow these conditions to continue. That is why I \nhave joined together with Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Akaka, Lieberman, \nKerry, and Bingaman to introduce the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act.\n  First, the bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to \nestablish procedures for delivering basic health care to all immigrant \ndetainees in custody. It requires the Department to give people in \ncustody access to any medications they urgently need, both during \ndetention and transfers.\n  Currently, a bureaucrat in an office can overrule a medical \nprofessional who is actually on-site and seeing a detainee. This bill \nensures that treatment decisions are made by the professionals who \nactually see the patient.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Department to report all detainee \ndeaths to the Office of Inspector General and Congress.\n  We can never lose sight of the fact that everyone who immigrates to \nthis country, whether they are documented or not, is a human being. A \ndetention should never amount to a death sentence. This kind of action \nto ensure humane treatment and prevent unnecessary deaths at these \nfacilities is long overdue.\n  Let us not forget that many in immigration detention are there for \nminor violations, many because of administrative errors or pending \nlegitimate asylum cases.\n  At this point, this becomes more than a legal issue; it becomes a \nhuman rights issue. It is our job to do all we can to secure our \ncountry while also protecting the dignity of all human beings. If we \nfail to do so, not only do we blemish ourselves, but we lose the moral \nhigh ground to be a beacon of democracy and a leader of human rights \naround the world.\n  It is astounding to me that human beings could be treated as badly as \nsome are being treated on our soil. When innocent people are drugged, \ntranquilized, and treated similar to animals, when agents attempt to \nhandcuff a pregnant U.S. citizen, break down the door to her home, \nterrify her children and her family, when an agency of the \nFederal Government deports its own citizen, when all this is going on, \neach of us in America has to think: What is happening in our country? \nDoesn't my U.S. citizenship, whether by birth or naturalization, \nprotect me from this kind of abuse?\n\n  Some officials have claimed these incidents are rare, and some have \nsuggested this is acceptable collateral damage in pursuit of \nundocumented aliens. Tell that to our fellow citizens who found \nthemselves either detained illegally or deported. Tell that to Pedro, \nGladis and Amina and everyone else and all the families who have had to \nwatch this happen. No matter how widespread this pattern of abuse turns \nout to be, one thing is clear: It isn't rare enough.\n  There is only one way to prevent that kind of abuse, and it should be \na universal policy that before we accuse someone of being undocumented, \nthere is one other document we should inspect first. It is called the \nConstitution of the United States. It is time for immigration and law \nenforcement at all levels to rededicate themselves to respecting the \nrights the Constitution guarantees. That means respecting the need for \nprobable cause and the right to be free from unreasonable search and \nseizure guaranteed by the fourth amendment, the right to due process \nguaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments, and the full \nbenefits of citizenship and equal protection for anyone born or \nnaturalized in this country, guaranteed by the 14th amendment, and the \nentire range of rights and protections under our Constitution.\n  It is going to take real leadership at every level of our justice \nsystem, from the Attorney General to the Secretary of Homeland Security \non down. That is the only way that those who by birth or naturalization \nhave a legitimate right to pursue the American dream and to make sure \ntheir lives do not turn into an un-American nightmare.\n  This issue might not be the legislative business of the Chamber at \nthis moment, but it is always our moral business. It is always our \nmoral business to defend the most fundamental principle on which our \nNation was founded: that all of us are created equal. Stopping illegal \ndetentions of Americans based on their race is about more than properly \nenforcing the law. Above all, it is about respecting people who may be \ndifferent from us but who share the same birthright.\n  Martin Luther King said:\n\n       We may have come on different ships, but we're all in the \n     same boat now.\n\n  If we are worried about what to throw off the boat, it should be our \noldest enemy, which is fear. Once that is gone, we can resume our \ncourse on the currents of freedom and let our sails be filled with \nliberty and justice for all.\n  We can preserve the Constitution, defend our borders, and, at the \nsame time, make sure no American citizen, whether naturalized or born \nhere, ever faces the discrimination that is taking place widespread \nacross the country in ways in which they are illegally detained, \nillegally put in detention facilities, their houses are broken into, \nand where even a U.S. citizen could be deported. That is a shameful \ntime in our history, and I hope the Senate will work to stop it.\n  To the extent I have any time remaining, I yield it to Senator Durbin \nfor his presentation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before speaking on the issue of energy, I wish to commend \nmy colleague from New Jersey. I hope those who were following the \ndebate of the Senate were listening closely to what he had to say. I \nwish I could remember the exact quote--perhaps he can--but someone once \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\n\n       You can really measure the morality of a people by watching \n     how they treat their prisoners and those under detention.\n\n  I think what he has brought to our attention today is nothing short \nof a critically important issue about the conduct of our Government in \nthe treatment of people in detention, many of whom are not guilty of \ncrimes, many of whom may be suspected and are being treated as if they \nhave already been convicted, and treated extremely poorly.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing up this issue. It is one I hope the \nentire Senate will reflect on, and again I thank him for bringing it to \nour attention.\n  Madam President, if you go back to your home State of Missouri or my \nhome State of Illinois--or you pick a State, pick a town, pick a \nstreet--and grab the first person who walks by and say: Is there \nanything on your mind that Washington is dealing with, do you know what \nthe answer is going to be? Gasoline prices, Senator. Where have you \nbeen? Have you noticed what is going on here? Go to fill up the gas \ntank and pull out the credit card or the cash and you are paying twice \nas much as you did not that long ago. What are you going to do about \nit, Senator? A lot of talk about all the issues you are concerned \nabout, but what is happening in Washington? Well, if you follow what \nhappened this week on the floor of the Senate, you will understand that \nprecious little--in fact, nothing--has happened this week in Washington \nwhen it comes to the issue of gasoline prices, diesel prices, and home \nheating oil. And it isn't for lack of effort.\n  The Democratic majority brought a bill to the floor asking the Senate \nif we could move forward and start to debate this bill. The bill had \nspecific elements in it to try to address the increased cost of \ngasoline, to stop what we considered to be an abuse to the American \neconomy. And how bad is it? Well, take a look at this chart, which \nshows in graphic terms what has happened since President Bush was sworn \ninto office in January 2001 until just a few days ago here in 2008. The \naverage price of gasoline, when the President was sworn in, was $1.47 a \ngallon. It is now $4.04 a gallon. This dramatic increase has caused \nhardship to families, to businesses, to farmers, to airlines, and to \ntruckers. You name it, the American economy is suffering because of it.\n  It isn't just something that happened over a long period of time. We \ncan see just this year what has happened with gas prices. Just since \nJanuary of 2008, gasoline prices have gone up 93 cents, almost $1 a \ngallon. People are feeling that. I find it when I get back to Illinois, \nparticularly in my part of the State, in downstate Illinois, where they \nlive in smaller towns, in affordable housing, and commute to their \njobs. They now find the price of gasoline to be beyond their budgets \nweek after week and month after month.\n  So we said: Let's bring a bill to the floor, and let's have a bill \nthat deals with the reality. And here are the harsh realities. Not only \nhas the price of gasoline gone up, but the profit-taking by the \nAmerican oil companies has gone up dramatically. Since President Bush \nhas taken office, the profit-taking by these companies has increased by \nover 400 percent, in the same period of time the cost of gasoline has \ngone up over 250 percent. It is no coincidence. These companies aren't \nmaking the biggest profits in the history of the oil industry, they are \nmaking the biggest profits in the history of American business. No \nother company has ever done this.\n  We also understand what it means to businesses, passing along the \nexpenses of energy costs on products. Whether they are food products or \nwhatever it might be, it raises the cost of living for everybody.\n  We know what is happening with airlines. Just this last week, the \nairlines--those that are still in business, because so many have gone \nbankrupt--those that are still in business announced dramatic cutbacks \nin their scheduling. Most of the major airlines took out of their \nfleets the less fuel-efficient planes and cut back on their scheduled \naircraft by 20 percent. Well, welcome to our summer vacations as we try \nto move back and forth across America with fewer airplanes, stuffed to \nthe gills with passengers. That is the reality of this energy crisis.\n  We know what it means to truckers. They are facing diesel costs near \n$5 a gallon, and they are trying to fill up those big rigs and keep \nthem on the highway, and it is hard to do. It is difficult to even \nconsider that they can do this without passing along the cost of that \nadded energy cost to those who are buying the products in the back of \nthe truck.\n  So what we have already done so far in the Senate is to pass fuel \neconomy standards for cars and light trucks that will reach 35 miles a \ngallon by 2020. That is a good thing. American consumers will have a \nchoice to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. We have committed to the \nproduction of 36 million gallons of renewable transportation fuels, \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel, by the year 2022. We have expanded \nresearch for plug-in hybrids. What is needed now, though, is not the \nlong-term fix but something that can bring some relief. So we brought \nthis bill to the floor, and here is what it did:\n  First, we rolled back the $17 billion Federal subsidy we are \ncurrently giving oil companies. How can you justify a subsidy to a \ncompany making recordbreaking profits? Why would you take taxes away \nfrom families, who are hard pressed with their own budget needs, and \ngive them to the wealthiest, most profitable companies in America? That \nwas No. 1 in our bill.\n  No. 2 was a 25-percent windfall profits tax. We say to these oil \ncompanies: Enough is enough. You are entitled to a profit--you are in \nbusiness for your shareholders--but when you have gone beyond a \nreasonable profit and it has gone into the area of greed, the \nGovernment is going to take it. And maybe the notion of a windfall \nprofits tax would discourage the oil companies from continuing to raise \nthose gasoline prices at the pump.\n  We also protected consumers from price gouging. The bill gave the \nPresident the authority to declare an energy emergency and set a limit \non unconscionably excessive prices, if necessary. Are we in an energy \nemergency at this point? I argue that we are, and I think the President \nshould have this authority.\n  Next, we would go after speculation in oil--the trading that goes on \nat the highest levels by some of the biggest investors--to make sure \nthere is transparency and accountability, and that is something which \nis long overdue.\n  We would send a clear message to OPEC--that cartel of nations in the \nMiddle East that supplies us with oil--that we will allow enforcement \nactions against any company or country that is colluding to set the \nprice of oil, natural gas, and other petroleum products.\n  What was the Republican response to this bill? We needed 60 votes. We \ncalled for a vote yesterday. I took a look at it and I see that we \nhad--it looks like 6, maybe 7 Republicans who joined us, 7 out of 49, \none of whom was the Senator from Iowa, here on the floor now, who voted \nwith us yesterday on moving forward on this bill. And I salute him. I \nwish some of his colleagues on the other side would have joined him. We \nneeded 60 votes, and it failed. So the filibuster on the Republican \nside worked. They stopped the bill. They stopped the debate. We can't \nmove forward on the bill because we couldn't bring over 60 Members. \nUnlike the Senator from Iowa, the vast majority of Republican Senators \nvoted against even debating this bill, voted against amending it.\n  That is not the first time that has happened in this Congress. The \nfilibuster, which many people are familiar with, allows any Senator to \nstand up and object to any amendment, any bill, any nomination, and if \nanyone wants to say to that Senator that he or she doesn't have the \nright to do that anymore, we need 60 Senators who will stand up and say \nit is time to move on, it is time to debate the amendment, it is time \nto bring it before us. In the history of the Senate, the total number \nof filibusters in any 2-year period of time, the max, has been 57. So \nfar in this Congress, which still has about 6 or 8 months to go, there \nhave been 75 Republican filibusters.\n\n  This most recent filibuster, on the Energy bill, stopped us from \ndebating ways to bring down the price of gasoline in America, to send a \nmessage to oil companies that they have gone too far. We couldn't bring \nover, on a bipartisan basis, enough Republican Senators to reach the 60 \nvotes. So the 74th\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nand the 75th Republican filibusters prevailed. They stopped us from \nmoving forward. That is a sad reality and one that is hard to explain \nback home.\n  This week in the Senate--with the exception of the Senator from Iowa, \nwho is on the floor and whom I have saluted twice but I will salute a \nthird time for joining us on this vote--the overwhelming majority of \nRepublicans are blocking a bill to debate lowering energy costs across \nAmerica. How can that be in the best interest of the American economy? \nHow can it be in the best interest of the Senate? Aren't we elected to \ncome here and address the issues that really count, the ones that \nfamilies and businesses feel every single day? Well, because of the \nstrategy on the Republican side, we were unable to do it.\n  Now, I will tell you that the answer by most Republicans to the \ndebate I have just talked about is that we should drill for oil in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. I am opposed to that. And \nfor years, whenever I would get up and say I am opposed to it, one of \nthe Senators from Alaska would say: You have no business opposing it, \nyou don't know what it looks like, you don't know what you are talking \nabout. So I took it upon myself several years ago to go to the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge and to camp out two straight evenings there, \nwith my son, two overnights, but I use that term loosely because the \nsun was up 24 hours a day by the time we went there to see what it was \nlike. You understand, once you have flown over, landed, and walked \nthrough it, a large part of it, why President Eisenhower set this piece \nof real estate aside and said: Protect it. There is something special \nabout this. Don't develop it unless it is an absolute emergency in \nAmerica and there is no place to turn.\n  From the Republican side, they believe that is the answer: Let's go \ndrill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But the \nDepartment of Energy's own Energy Information Agency has made clear \nthat it wouldn't make any difference if we drilled for oil in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge because by the time the oil would be in \npeak production--which wouldn't be until the year 2030--Refuge oil \nwould make up only .6 percent of the world's oil. It would literally be \na drop in the oil bucket. That drop in the bucket is hardly a solution \nto today's high gasoline prices. In fact, the effect at the gas pump \nwouldn't be felt for two decades.\n  This Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of America's last \npristine, untouched wilderness areas. It is home to over 200 wildlife \nspecies, including polar bears, musk ox, which I spotted while I was \nthere, and caribou. Can we trust that a rush of oil development will \nprotect this wilderness that we hold stewardship over? Is this really \nthe last answer America can come up with? I think not. I think we are \nsmart enough, we are determined enough, and with the right leadership \nwe can reduce energy costs in America, give consumers an option to buy \nmore fuel-efficient cars and trucks, find more fuel efficiency, more \nhomegrown fuels, such as ethanol and the biofuels and biodiesel, and \nmake certain we hold true to the values that we are not going to \ncompromise the water we drink, the air we breathe, or wildernesses and \nrefuges that have been set aside for decades. That is what is \ncritically important in this national debate.\n  We know that despite even their best efforts, some of the major oil \ncompanies have pipeline problems. Just a couple of years ago, one of \nthe major oil companies was responsible for the largest oil spill in \nNorth Slope history. That, unfortunately, is an indication that you can \nnever be too careful.\n  History is clear: We need to do the right things to meet this energy \ncrisis, and the first thing we need to do is to act as a Senate and \ndebate an issue that really counts in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to speak on taxes, but I would \nlike to comment a little on what I just heard from the Senator from \nIllinois. And he is absolutely right that I did vote to debate because \nI think a great deal can be accomplished through debate on this \nlegislation. In regard to the overall bill and the motive behind it, it \nis good in the areas of antitrust and things of that nature, but taxing \noil? The rule of economics 101 is that when you tax something, you get \nless of it. And the American people understand by now, with $4 gas, \nanother rule of economics 101: If you are going to get prices down, you \nhave to increase supply.\n  I would not be flippant about 13 billion barrels of oil in Alaska \nthat we have not tapped. Yes, by the year 2030 it might be .6 percent \nof the world's supply, but when you are using 85 million barrels a day \nworldwide and when there are only about 86 or 87 million barrels of oil \nbeing pumped out of the ground worldwide, then you have to understand \nthat a six-tenths of 1 percent increase in a world supply that is not \nvery flexible is going to make a big difference because it is the \nnervousness that is in the supply of oil, and when it might be cut back \nbecause of natural disaster or terrorism activity or some German worker \nbeing kidnapped in Nigeria, which sometimes is an excuse for oil going \nup, more flexibility in the supply of oil is what is going to help us \nwith steady prices and lower prices as we increase supply.\n  So even though I voted to bring the bill to debate yesterday, I want \nit fully understood that I am not a guy who believes taxing is going to \nincrease supply. In fact, I believe more taxes is going to decrease \nsupply.\n  I wish to have a debate with the Senator from Illinois and other \npeople from the other side that what we need is supply. I could easily \nagree with the Senator from Illinois--maybe not about drilling in \nAlaska, but if he were willing to drill on the Outer Continental Shelf, \nwilling to drill more in the Gulf of Mexico, and willing to drill more \non public land. These are places we know there is an ample supply of \noil we ought to make use of to keep the money in the United States \ninstead of buying from the Arabs to give them American dollars to shoot \nback at us.\n  I think there are a lot of national security implications here that \nare as important as the price of gasoline for our suppliers. I said I \nwould be willing to vote that way if we could get some understanding of \ndrilling other places.\n  What I hear from the other side is: No, to Alaska; no, to the Outer \nContinental Shelf; no, to public lands; no, to the Gulf of Mexico. But \nI don't hear anybody crying--you often hear from people about the Outer \nContinental Shelf that you are going to ruin tourism if we do it. You \nare going to ruin the view of the ocean. But I don't hear anybody \ncomplaining that 50 miles off of Key West, it is OK for China to drill. \nBut if you want to drill 50 miles off of Florida for the benefit of \nAmericans, you would have an outcry. I don't understand it.\n  When I had my town meetings in Iowa during the Memorial Day recess, \nat every one of those meetings was brought up why don't we drill more \nwhere there is oil that is needed in the United States? Why don't we \nexplore and make use of what we have? We can't fool the American \npublic.\n  To some extent the debate we had yesterday was on a bill because if \nwe didn't get to these issues of more exploring and more use of these \nresources, it would be a figleaf to cover the opinion or position of \nthe other party that, no, we can't drill anymore.\n  Conserve? Yes, we ought to conserve. There is nothing the Senator \nfrom Illinois said about conserving that is not legitimate. But \nconserving is not the only answer to our problem. You have to have a \nthree-legged stool of answers to our energy problems.\n  One of them is to drill where we know there are resources. Now, since \nGod only made so much fossil fuel, that is short term. Then renewables \nis second, and conservation, the third. We need a public policy in all \nthose areas. We have public policies for conservation--tax credit for \nfuel-cell cars, for refurbished homes to be more energy efficient, for \nenergy-efficient appliances. We have tax incentives for renewable \nfuels. Of course we have had tax incentives for petroleum for a long \nperiod of time. We need those incentives. But to think renewables or \nconservation is a solution to this problem is very misleading.\n  Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about energy but also to \ntalk more about taxes. That was an issue we debated yesterday. As I \nfinished up last night, I spoke about the spike in gas prices. These \nincreases in costs are hammering most Americans, including\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\ntoo many Iowans. Iowans have seen it firsthand in the gas stations in \nNew Hartford. I say that because sometimes I get the impression from my \nown constituents that everybody thinks all 100 Senators have chauffeur-\ndriven limousines to drive around in so we don't know what the cost is \nto put gas in a gas tank. It is not true here in Washington, DC, except \nfor a few of the elected leaders, and it is not true in Iowa, where I \ndrive a 2003 Taurus. We do take care of ourselves and we do know the \nprice of gas. In fact, I can tell you if I had been smart enough to buy \ngas when I left the Des Moines airport Friday night, I could have \ngotten it for $3.69, and I waited to buy it Sunday night and it was \n$3.89, and I know it is $4 out here. The point is, we feel it.\n  By the way, I have some advice for some of the leaders who drive SUVs \naround here and have chauffeur-driven limousines while we are paying $4 \nin taxpayers' money for gasoline. It aggravates me to high heaven when \nI see the SUVs idling out here, maybe to keep the car warm in the \nwintertime or cool in the summertime, and I saw it when the temperature \naround here was 60 degrees. Shut these cars off and save. There is no \nreason for the Senate of the United States to set an example that we do \nnot conserve or care about the taxpayers' money by having these SUVs \nidle when nobody is in them, when they are not going anyplace.\n  I read reports about the gas issue. I read reports about the stimulus \nrebate checks being eaten up at the pump with this high gasoline price. \nIn addition to this hit from gas hikes, American families are facing a \nbig hit from planned tax hikes. I wish to take a few minutes then to \ntalk about the additional hit taxes make on the family budget.\n  You would think no one would increase taxes in times of economic \ndistress. Record tax hikes in an era of higher gas prices would seem to \nbe a recipe for economic disaster. So people who think taxes are not \nhigh enough, complaining about the upcoming recession--hopefully \navoided but probably not--why would you want to make it worse by \nincreasing taxes?\n  Some people do not seem to care. People on the other side, including \nPresidential candidates, proudly and passionately want to raise taxes. \nYou see it in the debate. I am not telling you something you can't see \non television. Candidates of the other political party are waiting to \nraise taxes. How do they want to increase taxes, you might ask? By \nincreasing tax rates and taxing investment income.\n  If the other side prevails in the November elections, we will be on a \npath to a tax hike; taxes that will go up, as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product, higher than they have been at any time since World \nWar II. If they stay on that path, yet higher. Taxes should rise by \nalmost 10 percent with virtually every American paying more. If you \nwant to create jobs, you don't tax labor. The rules of economics 101--\nif you tax something, you get less of it. If you want labor, then don't \nincrease taxes on labor.\n  I wish to ask folks, particularly in the media, to take a serious \nlook. It is in the Congressional Budget Office reports. It is the \neffect of letting the bipartisan Tax Relief Act of 2001 expire, and \nmaybe a more partisan tax bill of 2003 expire.\n  How much more taxes would we have to pay? A lot more, say people on \nthe other side, especially those Americans who are defined by the other \nside as making a lot of money.\n  What is a lot of money? The Democrats say if you are a family making \nat least $250,000 a year, you make a lot of money and don't pay enough \ntaxes. That puts you in the current 33-percent tax bracket.\n  Can Americans making less than $250,000 a year be sure they will not \npay more taxes? What is to say that the other side will not tax \nAmericans making $100,000 a year? Or even $50,000 a year? The \nbipartisan Tax Relief Act made sure that all Americans are paying less \nin taxes. In 2001 and 2003, Congress did the right thing and reduced \nthe tax liability for all hard-working Americans.\n  This tax relief should not be labeled the Bush tax cuts. Yes, \nPresident Bush had a great deal of involvement and deserves some \ncredit. But I want to remind people that Congress passed the 2001 and \n2003 tax relief. In fact, that year the Finance Committee was divided \n50 percent Republican, 50 percent Democrat, because the whole Senate \nwas equal, the number of Republicans and Democrats. We completely, as a \nbody, rewrote the suggestions that President Bush put before the \nCongress.\n  Max Baucus, the current chairman, was my partner in the 2001 bill. We \novercame the White House's desire to write a ``Republican only'' bill \nand skip the committee process. So stop calling this tax relief the \nBush tax cuts. This label is politically motivated to confuse the \nAmerican taxpayers about what was truly a bipartisan tax relief \nmeasure.\n  This label is repeated over and over. The head of the Senate \nDemocratic Campaign Committee beats his partisan drum with this phrase. \nHe relies on polls to drive a partisan message. The label is likewise \nparroted over and over in the press reports. The Sunday political talk \nshow hosts are even getting into the act. If I had a nickel for every \ntime I heard the words ``Bush tax cuts,'' especially from the political \npundits, I would singlehandedly be able to pay off the national debt.\n  Colleagues and friends in the media, I beg you--I have asked you to \nconsider what I am saying--lay off the false label of Bush tax cuts. \nInstead, look at the substance. The substance of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief put more money into the pockets of hard-working Americans. This \nis how it came about, by lowering the tax rates, providing marriage \npenalty relief and by providing the child tax credit. I do not hear \nmuch press discussion about how much money hard-working Americans are \ngoing to have to pay if the 2001 and 2003 tax relief expires. I ask the \nmedia people: Take a look at the data. It is real. It means dollars and \ncents to virtually every American taxpayer. That cushion in the family \nbudget will be critical to deal with the burden from the higher gas \nprices that have been involved in the debate today and yesterday.\n  Other data: If the 2001 and 2003 tax relief expires, a family of four \nwith household income of $50,000 will pay $2,300 more in taxes. That is \na lot of money for a family earning $50,000. Here is a chart that will \nshow you exactly the impact when 2010 comes and these expire, as the \ncandidates on the other side want to do. In 2011 that family of four is \nhitting a tax wall, the tax wall, or $2,300 a year. These families have \nhit the wall. If the other side prevails, they are going to have their \nnoses bloodied by the tax brick wall that the middle-income family \nhits.\n  Here is more data. A single mother with two children earning $30,000 \nwill pay $1,100 more in taxes, if the tax relief bill is passed. This \nsingle mom with two kids will actually be crushed financially by a \nbrick wall of higher taxes.\n  There is a lot of talk about need for change in economic policy. It \nseems as if change, no matter what it means, is good on its face. Many \nin the media and the beltway punditry fawn over the soaring rhetoric of \nthe eloquent Democratic candidate. Indeed, there is almost a cult of \npersonality surrounding the charismatic junior Senator from Illinois. \nThese folks in the media and beltway punditry need to cut through the \nfog and look at what the Democratic notion of changed economic policy \nwill mean to folks beyond the beltway. Look at this change not from the \nperspective of high-paid, latte-liberal crowds in the bluest areas of \nthe bluest States. Look at what this means in the offices, factories, \nand farms of the heartland. That is what I ask many in the media and \nthe punditry to take a good look at.\n  Gas prices are also squeezing the country's main job creators and \nthat hits small business and farms. Small business has a tax hike to \nworry about as well. This tax hike piles on top of higher energy costs \nthat are slamming small business.\n  According to the Treasury Department, about 70 percent of taxpayers \nwho are flowthrough business owners are in the top 5 percent of the \ntaxpayers. So my friends on the other side of the aisle, along with \ntheir Presidential candidate, are effectively saying they want small \nbusiness owners to pay at least 13 percent more in taxes.\n  Small business owners are not Bill Gates or Warren Buffet. Small \nbusiness owners are hard-working Americans\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nwho live on Main Street. They are vital to our economic well-being. \nSmall business employs a vast majority of America's workers. Yet small \nbusiness owners have to pay more money to their Government. That is \nless money they can use to hire somebody.\n  The old law of economics 101: If you increase taxes, you get less of \nit; you tax labor more, you get less labor, you get less jobs. If that \nperson is not hired, what happens? The individual is unemployed, has no \nincome, has no health care. Instead, that worker stands in the \nunemployment line and collects unemployment.\n  Economics, like I said. All these tax hikes on small business would \npile on top of the gas price hikes already crippling small business. \nWhy should they pay more taxes? Is this change good because they can \nafford it? That is what the other side is saying. But it makes no \nsense.\n  What they are saying is, because these taxpayers can ``afford it,'' \nthese taxpayers should be paying even a greater percentage of Federal \nGovernment taxes. But what does ``afford it'' mean? Do we not want all \ntaxpayers, not just those make $250,000 or more, to pump their \ndisposable incomes back into our economy?\n  Do we wish to steer taxpayers, including upper income taxpayers, \ntoward lower return, tax-favored investments? Do we wish to steer their \nmoney away from reinvesting in small businesses or start-ups?\n  By the way, I wish to compliment one of Senator Obama's surrogates. I \nam referring to Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia. On FOX News Sunday, \nGovernor Kaine indicated Senator Obama would propose a zero-percent \ncapital gains rate for small start-up companies. Under current law, \nthat is a 7.5 percent rate.\n  Now, we Republicans could look at this proposal. But unfortunately \nfor the American people, Governor Kaine said Senator Obama would \nsubstitute this rate with a 33-percent increase in capital gains on \nother investments.\n  So the substitution would be bad for other investors. So let's focus \non the progrowth side of the proposal and consider dropping the rate of \nstart-ups from 7.5 percent to zero.\n  The political talking point that we hear again and again, raise taxes \non the country's top taxpayers to generate ``needed'' revenue, is \ncommunicated to the American public.\n  It is said enough times and repeated by the press so many times that \nmany Americans believe it.\n  It is not the fault of that portion of the American public that \nbelieves it.\n  It is refreshing that a vast majority of Americans think the general \nidea of a tax increase is a bad idea, especially in these economic \ntimes.\n  But the notion that there are no downsides for taxpayers or for \neconomic growth if income taxes go up by 10 percent is a notion that \nthe other side believes. Many in the media seem to accept this notion \nwithout further examination.\n  If middle- and upper-income taxpayers see a bigger tax bill, do they \nbelieve that our economy will be better off?\n  It is clear lower tax rates have generated record tax revenues. I \nchallenge some of the media who are skeptical about tax relief to take \na look.\n  Here is a chart that illustrates that lower taxes have generated \nrecord tax revenues.\n  This chart illustrates that Federal tax revenues have been, and \ngenerally continue to be, coming into the Federal Treasury at or above \nthe historical average of 18.2 percent of GDP.\n  Now what the heck does that mean?\n  It means that lowering the tax rates has not gutted Federal tax \nrevenues.\n  So don't believe the Chicken Littles who say the sky will fall if we \nkeep taxes low.\n  It means that keeping taxes low, even for Americans earning $250,000 \na year has brought in record-breaking revenue.\n  It also means that the Government doesn't need to raise taxes in \norder to generate revenue.\n  Now I can't let my colleagues on the other side, and some of the \nskeptics in the press for that matter, say to the American public that \nif you earn less than $250,000 a year, you won't see higher taxes.\n  Why? There are millions of investors earning less than $250,000. They \nearn dividends and capital gains.\n  Let's take a closer look.\n  In 2003, Congress reduced the top tax rate on capital gains from 20 \npercent to 15 percent.\n  Congress also tied dividend income to the capital gains tax rate, \nthat is, 15 percent.\n  For low-income taxpayers, the tax rate on capital gains and dividends \nis currently zero.\n  That's zero, with a capital Z.\n  Millions of low-income taxpayers receive dividends and capital gains.\n  All of these taxpayers were not making over $250,000.\n  I will shed light on this fact with a chart. Nationally, over 24 \nmillion tax returns reported dividend income.\n  In Iowa, for instance, over 299,000 families and individuals claimed \ndividend income on their returns.\n  Here is another chart dealing with capital gains.\n  Nationally, 9 million families and individuals claimed capital gains. \nOver 127,000 of them were folks from Iowa.\n  I have fought both Democrats and Republicans to ensure that our \ncountry is set on the right course.\n  That course is economic prosperity.\n  I would like to see a real discussion of the negative implications of \nchanging current economic policy. With high gas prices squeezing \ntaxpayers, it is more compelling than ever.\n  Let's clear away the fog about the expiring bipartisan tax relief. \nBroad-based tax increases aren't gauzy ``feel good'' economic policy \nchanges. Let's examine the benefits of keeping taxes low.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank the \nSenator from Iowa for his graciousness in allowing me to speak. He is a \ntremendous leader for us on issues of tax policy and health care, and I \nappreciate my relationship with him a lot. He is a wonderful American. \nHe is a wonderful Iowan. He does a great job for the people of Iowa in \nthe Senate.\n  We all know we are experiencing a time of dramatically increased \nenergy costs. The price of gas sets new highs almost every day, and the \nprice of oil continues to climb. In the face of this, the Democrats in \nthis body think the proper response is to increase taxes and \nregulations on the energy industry.\n  It reminds me of a saying from the Reagan era: If it moves, tax it; \nif it keeps moving, regulate it; and if it stops moving, subsidize it.\n  Well, the bill the Democrats are trying to force on the American \npeople would do at least two of those things. Increasing taxes and \nregulations do nothing to bring down the increase in fixed costs that \nresult from high energy prices. It is not the right solution. \nConventional wisdom dictates that in times when fixed costs are high, \ndiscretionary spending must decrease.\n  As the last budget showed, we certainly do not follow conventional \nwisdom in DC. But families all over America have to. In plain and \nsimple language: Spending more on what we need generally means we have \nless to spend on what we want.\n  Now, make no mistake, we are spending more on what we need. Americans \nare feeling the pain at the pump due to high gas prices, but \nincreasingly they are feeling pain at the kitchen table too. As gas \nprices go up, so do food prices. America's farmers and ranchers produce \nthe safest and most affordable food in the world. But rising energy \nprices have affected almost every level of agriculture. It has caused \nthe cost of everything from fertilizer to processing to increase.\n  The high price of diesel and other types of energy are forcing up \nproduction costs, which also forces up food prices. My home State of \nColorado produces some of the best-tasting produce in the world, \nincluding potatoes. It is not putting fuel in the tractor that is \nhurting our farmers. Last year, in Colorado's San Luis Valley, it cost \na farmer about $90 an acre for starter fertilizer for a potato crop. \nThis year, the cost is up almost $300, from $90. You heard that right, \nin 1 year, starter fertilizer costs have more than tripled.\n  Weld County, CO, is one of the Nation's top-producing agricultural \ncounties. But even in an area that produces as much food as Weld \nCounty, people there are fighting high food costs. Higher food costs \nhurt all Americans, but they are especially damaging to people dealing \nwith food insecurity.\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\n  Food banks are struggling to stretch dollars so they can keep food on \ntheir shelves. That is food that goes to our most vulnerable \npopulations, impoverished individuals and their families. In Weld \nCounty, 32 percent of the individuals served by the local food bank are \nchildren.\n  The price of food, and indeed all goods that need to be moved any \ndistance, is also increased by the transportation costs. Listen to \nthis. The trucking industry has been especially hard hit by the \nincreases in diesel prices. In January of 2007, when the Democrats took \ncontrol of Congress, diesel was $2.53 a gallon. Today the national \naverage for diesel is $4.69 a gallon. That is an increase of $2.16 in \nthe 18 months of Democratic control of Congress. In the 6 years \npreceding Democratic control of the Congress, the price of diesel rose \nabout $1. That is right, $1 dollar for over 6 years, and $2.16 in 18 \nmonths.\n  I think the evidence is clear that the antiproduction Democrats in \nCongress are ignoring the needs of rural Americans in favor of liberal \nenvironmental elitists.\n  Gasoline prices are also changing families' plans for their leisure \ntime. In times such as these, we see an industry such as tourism both \nhelped and hurt by families having more limited funds. Local tourism in \nplaces such as Colorado is helped because people stay closer to home. \nFor example, a family from southeast Colorado might choose to forgo \ntheir planned week-long trip to Yellowstone Park and instead spend 3 or \n4 days at Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  This is good for Rocky Mountain National Park because that family \nmight not have visited if they could afford the gas necessary to go to \nYellowstone. But it is bad for Yellowstone because they lost visitors. \nBusinesses in the surrounding communities around Yellowstone also lost \nthe opportunity to feed and house that family and to sell them their \nsouvenir T-shirts.\n  Unfortunately, though, tourism in a State such as Colorado is likely \nto be hurt by families' needs to visit locally, because although Rocky \nMountain National Park will play host to a southeastern Colorado \nfamily, they are likely to lose visitation from families who have to \ntravel farther to get there. Now, the Rocky Mountain National Park is a \ndestination tourist area. So that people from all over the country, \nwhen they plan their weeks for a week vacation, they plan on making \nRocky Mountain National Park their main focal point of that vacation. \nSo families have to travel farther, and when they travel farther, they \ndo not often want to spend more, and so it hurts destination tourist \nspots such as Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  But it is not just families who plan to drive who are affected. \nAccording to the Air Transportation Association only 8 years ago, 15 \npercent of the price of an airline ticket went to pay for fuel. Now \nthat number has risen to 40 percent. Fuel prices for airlines are up 84 \npercent over last year, forcing them to raise fares and add surcharges \nand fees to recoup costs. Airlines will continue serving their best \nmarkets but may be forced to reduce flight frequencies and the number \nof cities they can serve altogether.\n  Small cities may keep service with a flight or two a day but only at \nmuch higher prices aimed at business travelers, while leisure travelers \nwill have to drive to bigger cities to get more reasonable fears.\n  U.S. airlines are projected to spend $61 billion on fuel this year; \nthat is $20 billion more than in 2007, an increase equivalent to the \ncompensation and benefits of 267,000 airline workers or the acquisition \nof 286 new jets.\n  The rapid increase in jet fuel will add substantially to airline \ncosts at a time when a weakening U.S. economy will make it more \ndifficult to offset those costs with higher fares.\n  While oil prices are soaring, the airline industry and Denver-based \nFrontier Airlines has been forced to analyze every facet of their \nbusiness in an effort to combat the enormous financial strain fuel \ncosts are having on them. Airlines have been resorting to carrying less \nwater per flight, removing bulky, unneeded carts and equipment, while \neven eliminating hot meal options so they could eliminate ovens and \nmicrowaves in the galleys.\n  While I commend our airline industry for their innovative solutions \nand creativity during these constrained times, these changes combined \nwith fare increases are having a dreadful impact on our domestic \nairline industry, which has been vital to national and international \ncommerce and tourism. Denver, CO, is the center of much of that \nactivity.\n  United Airlines recently announced plans to take 70 more jets out of \nservice and cut domestic capacity by 17 to 18 percent for the remainder \nof 2008 and 2009. Although Frontier Airlines prides itself on the \nability to provide passenger service at relatively low cost, once again \nthe high price of fuel has necessitated an increase to their fuel \nsurcharge which is passed on to the customer.\n  In addition to raising prices, they have reduced aircraft fuel burns \nand began using new flight-planning computer software to track fuel and \nflights to save fuel. Frontier has also had to reduce the number and \nfrequency of its flights into Denver, which will have an adverse impact \non the Colorado economy and Colorado tourism, which usually flourishes \nin the warm summer months.\n  In closing, I would like to address the claim that Republicans in \nthis body are the problem. Republicans in this body actually have \nlegislation that will increase domestic production of energy, instead \nof cut it off. We are ready to talk about energy prices. We are ready \nto talk about gas prices. That is why we are here today doing that. We \nwish to help Americas alleviate the pain they are feeling at the pump \nby increasing production. That is the real solution to our problem.\n  The laws of supply and demand dictate that increasing supply will \nwork to drive down prices. Increased taxation simply suppresses supply, \nwhich, in turn, leads to even higher prices. What we should not do is \nact on a bill that will decrease domestic production by imposing \nincreased taxes.\n  What we should not do is act on a bill that will decrease domestic \nproduction by increasing the regulatory burden. That is what we have on \nthe floor right now. That is what the ``no energy bill'' before us will \ndo. I simply cannot support that. I am supporting the majority leader's \neffort to allow Republicans to be able to be a part of this process, to \nsubmit their amendments on the floor so we can actually move toward \nmore production, instead of less production.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor this \nafternoon to speak about the Medicare package we will be voting on \ncloture on, the legislation that Senator Reid filed for cloture \nyesterday. We will be doing that vote sometime tomorrow. Before I make \nmy comments about that particular piece of legislation, I want to make \na few comments in general about the importance of the health care \nagenda and the health care challenge that faces America.\n  For all of us who are in elected office in all of our States, we hear \nabout the pain the people of America are feeling from a number of \ndifferent perspectives. We hear loudly and clearly that people in our \nStates are very concerned about what is happening with the runaway \nprices of oil and the high cost of gas and diesel and the farmers and \nranchers and the businesspeople and consumers in general, just concern \nabout that cornerstone of our economy which is causing so much pain to \nthe people of America today.\n  We also hear about another cornerstone of concern, and that is what \nis happening with the housing crisis, the housing crisis which, in many \nways, has ignited the economic instability we face in America today, \nwhere people are losing their homes, record foreclosures are occurring, \nand people want to know what it is we are doing in Washington to \naddress the dream of home ownership for America.\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n  In my State, it is projected that in the year ahead and in 2009 there \nwill be about 50,000 homes that will go into foreclosure. There will be \nabout a third of the housing stock that will have a decline of anywhere \nfrom 12 to 15 percent in value over the next several years. Those two \ncornerstones of our economy--energy and housing--are trembling a little \nbit today. It is important for all of us in the Congress to do what we \ncan to try to stabilize our energy policy and energy prices and also to \ndeal with the challenges we face in the housing crisis.\n  There is another cornerstone in our economy which is something we \nneed to address. We will do small pieces of it here, but it has to do \nwith health care. Health care today is a huge challenge and problem for \nAmerica.\n  In the Presidential debates, one of the hot topics will be how will \nthe next leader of the greatest democracy in the world help us address \nthe huge challenges we face in health care. One thinks about the fact \nthat there are 47 million Americans who do not have health insurance \ntoday. One thinks about my State of Colorado with a population of under \n5 million people. Today there are 850,000 Coloradans who don't have \nhealth insurance, and of those 850,000, 180,000 are children, children \nwithout health insurance in our State.\n  As I look at the issue of health care in general, one of the \ncornerstones that face our country in terms of the economic and real \nhuman pain we are facing, I am proud of the fact that there are people \nin the Senate who are trying to figure out a way forward already.\n  First, Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, has decided \nthis is an issue we need to learn a lot more about. So we have a series \nof hearings on what is happening with health care, what is happening \nwith health care in other places around the world. Next Monday we will \nbe having a health care summit to try to further our understanding on \nhow we can deal with this incredibly difficult issue. Then in the mix \nof all that dialog, my good friend from Oregon, Senator Wyden, who just \nhappens to be on the floor--totally by coincidence--has offered for all \nof us to take a look at the Healthy Americans Act.\n  The Healthy Americans Act is important because it is the only piece \nof legislation that has come to the Senate in a manner that is a \ncomprehensive health care reform package, but also, importantly, it has \nthe kind of bipartisan support which, at the end of the day, will be \nrequired in order for us to fix the very complex health care problems \nand challenges we face today.\n  I applaud him and both my Democratic and Republican colleagues who \nhave joined him in that effort. It is the only significant bipartisan \npiece of legislation that has been considered in Washington for a long \ntime. But the issue of health care and health care reform is not going \nto go away this year. It is an issue I expect will loom large on our \nplates right after the January 2009 inauguration. Many of us will be \nworking to try to find the right solution that fits the American \npopulation. I very much look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthat on a bipartisan basis and to working with my good friend, Senator \nWyden, on that agenda as well.\n  I wanted to speak about a ticking health care emergency that, if \nunaddressed, will affect millions of doctors and patients across the \ncountry before the end of the month. In 19 days from today, Medicare \nreimbursement rates are scheduled to drop 10 percent, based on an \noutdated formula that we desperately need to fix. A 10-percent cut to \nMedicare reimbursement rates will force tens of thousands of doctors \ninto the red, tens of thousands of doctors across America in every one \nof our States. Millions and millions of Medicare patients will find \nthat their doctor simply cannot afford to treat them. Every single \nMember of this body has heard loudly and clearly about the devastating \neffects these cuts will have on patients and on doctors. Here are just \na few things I have heard over the last several days.\n  This is from Dr. Mike Wasserman, a Colorado physician who is in a \ngroup practice that focuses solely on Medicare patients. He said:\n\n       A 10 percent cut is untenable. I would have to seriously \n     consider immediately closing our practice if this were to \n     actually stick.\n\n  Other comments that I have received in my office from others:\n\n       Many primary care physicians will not only stop taking new \n     Medicare patients but will consider reducing their current \n     Medicare load. That means more patients being cared for by \n     higher cost specialists. Conceivably, this could actually \n     lead to greater Medicare expenditures.\n\n  Finally:\n\n       This cut will have a devastating impact on health care \n     across the board as most commercial insurers and TRICARE tie \n     their rates to Medicare.\n\n  Let's keep these realities in mind as we try to forge ahead in the \nnext 19 days, and hopefully sooner, to try to fix the Medicare issue \nwhich faces us today.\n  The June 30 Medicare cuts will affect military health care plans \nthrough TRICARE. We will have the rug pulled out from under the feet of \nTRICARE if we don't fix this problem. For me and for the soldiers in \nColorado at Fort Carson, for the airmen at Schriever, Peterson, and \nBuckley Air Force Bases, and for our Guard and Reserves, I know they \nwill find that fewer doctors will see them, their spouses, and \nchildren. It will be more difficult for returning servicemembers from \nIraq and Afghanistan to get treatment for PTSD and for wounds they have \nincurred on the battlefield on our behalf.\n\n  As the largest purchaser of health services, Medicare rates also \nserve as a starting point for private insurers. This means the impact \nof a cut will eventually be felt by middle-class families as well.\n  We cannot let this happen. We cannot let Medicare reimbursement rates \nfall on June 30. That is why I am pleased that Senator Baucus and a \nbipartisan group of Senators on the Finance Committee have introduced a \nbill that would correct this problem. I strongly support this bill, the \nMedicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. I thank the \nleadership of Majority Leader Reid for giving us the time to bring this \nmatter to full debate and conclusion, hopefully, on the Senate floor. \nWe have to get this bill done. We have no choice.\n  In addition to saving doctors and patients from the June 30 Medicare \ncuts, the bill makes several fiscally responsible improvements to \nMedicare and Medicaid, including, first, the bill improves critical \nprograms to ensure seniors and individuals with disabilities on a \nrestricted income can afford the health care prescriptions they need to \nstay healthy. Second, the bill extends and expands rural health \nprograms. Third, the bill expands coverage of preventive services which \nare so needed in health care. Fourth, the bill reduces coinsurance for \nmental health services. Fifth, the bill addresses overpayments and \nunscrupulous marketing tactics in the Medicare Advantage Program. \nFinally, the bill will protect the long-term solvency of the Medicare \nProgram.\n  Curiously, the Medicare bill introduced today by Senator Grassley, my \ngood friend and the ranking member on the Finance Committee, mirrors \nmany of these provisions. While the differences may not be in number, \nthe differences, nonetheless, in my view, require us to move forward \nwith the version of the bill Senator Baucus has introduced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The one thing we have always agreed on is that the goal \nof the Medicare Program is to provide affordable, high quality health \ncare to our Nation's seniors. The Baucus bill is the only option that \ndoes that, with nearly $4 billion in beneficiary improvements. The \nBaucus bill also addresses one of the biggest concerns of Medicare \nAdvantage, the lack of reliable networks for private fee-for-service \nplans. By requiring private fee-for-service plans to have a written \ncontract with providers, this bill makes sure patients have access to \nthe providers they are promised, and doctors will get paid for the \nservices they provide.\n  For nearly 40 years, patients have relied on Medicare, knowing that \nthey would not fall through the cracks. We must continue to protect the \nintegrity of Medicare's good name by swiftly addressing inadequacies. \nThe Baucus bill will do just that.\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\n  Too much is at stake to let this bill get stuck in the politics of \nobstructionism. For Medicare patients, for their doctors, for parents, \nkids, soldiers, and servicemembers' families, we need to get this done \nbefore the June 30 deadline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank my \ngood friend from Colorado, Senator Salazar, for his kind and gracious \ncomments about the Healthy Americans Act. He has been a wonderful \naddition to the Senate Finance Committee. I know we are going to be \nspending a lot of time trying to deal with these important challenges \nin the days ahead. I thank him for all his thoughtfulness, both today \nand on a regular basis.\n  Every day from coast to coast, millions of our seniors look at \nMedicare as a lifeline. These are the seniors who walk on an economic \ntightrope, balancing their fuel bills against their food costs and \ntheir food costs against their prescription costs. They are just trying \nnot to fall off the economic tightrope. As the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri has pointed out, when you look at these skyrocketing gas \nand fuel prices over the last few months, that is enough to send \nseniors trembling about the prospect of being able to pay for \nnecessities every month.\n  This legislation is a substantial step in the right direction of \nmajor health reform. It is not everything that needs to be done. As \nSenator Salazar has noted, I and others are working with seven \nDemocrats and seven Republicans on what we think is a comprehensive \noverhaul of American health care system. But, clearly, this legislation \nmoves in the right direction. I want to touch on three areas--the \nquestion of physician reimbursement; protections for low-income people; \nand then, finally, marketing practices--to highlight the fact that this \nlegislation, which I hope the Senate is going to vote to move along \ntomorrow, clearly makes changes that will be helpful for older people \ntoday, but also will pay dividends for the broader course of health \nreform in the future.\n\n  First, with respect to this question of trying to ensure a step \nforward with respect to physician reimbursement--all over this country, \nwe have physicians in small practices who are literally having trouble \nkeeping the doors open. They can have a couple of people in their \noffice and spend virtually the whole day trying to pry out of insurance \ncompanies information from their insurance matrix about what they are \ngoing to pay for various services. Literally, these physicians are not \ngoing to be able to keep their doors open if Medicare physician \npayments are cut by more than 10 percent.\n  So this is not an issue of somehow protecting fat-cat doctors or \nthose who are affluent in our society. This is a question of protecting \nprimary care and primary care for the most vulnerable people in our \nsociety. I am of the view that if this cut were allowed to go forward \non July 1, it would be a body blow to the older people of this country, \nthose millions who are walking on an economic tightrope.\n  I commend Chairman Baucus and Senator Snowe and the whole group on \nthe Finance Committee who are trying to move this forward. I hope we \nwill do that tomorrow.\n  Second, I believe the protections for the low-income older people are \nanother step in the right direction. This legislation increases the \namount of resources that Medicare beneficiaries can have and still \nqualify for the Medicare Savings Program. So what that does is it helps \nolder people fill in the gaps in their coverage. The provision, also \nwith respect to low-income people, adds money to boost the State Health \nInsurance Assistance Programs and the Area Agencies on Aging that are \nenrolling low-income older people in assistance programs.\n  So those are the first two provisions that I think make a real \ndifference for older people: the expansion with respect to services \nthey would get from doctors if the reimbursement goes up, particularly \nin terms of primary care services for older people; and, second, the \nadditional protections for the low-income Medicare beneficiaries.\n  But what I wish to highlight this afternoon is the additional \nprotection in the Baucus-Snowe legislation against abusive marketing \npractices.\n  I will tell the Presiding Officer and colleagues, when I came to the \nCongress many years ago, in the days when I had a full head of hair and \nrugged good looks, it was pretty common for an older person to have a \nshoe box full of health insurance policies, and a lot of them were not \nworth the paper they were written on. They would be wasting money on \nthese health insurance policies that they ought to be using on food and \nfuel and essentials.\n  So in the early 1990s, we got a law passed; and we changed that. It \nwas a law to reform what was known as the Medigap market--the market \nfor policies sold to supplement Medicare. It has worked. It has \nstandardized the market. It has been good for old people. It has been \ngood for responsible insurance companies. It worked.\n  But what happened? After the Medicare prescription drug program went \nin, we saw once again some people in the private insurance sector--\ncertainly not a majority, but some--say: Boy, here is another wonderful \nopportunity to make some fast money. We have seen some horrendously \nabusive practices in this area, particularly through a product that is \nknown as Medicare private fee-for-service. That has been the area \nwhere, in effect, you do not even have the protections you would have \nin Arkansas, say, if an older person had an HMO, a health maintenance \norganization, plan or another.\n  These programs exist outside the oversight and the scrutiny we ought \nto have for the protection of older people. And sitting next to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas on the Finance Committee, Mrs. \nLincoln, we have heard in our committee about these abuses on a regular \nbasis.\n  I also point out that Chairman Kohl, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Aging Committee, had some superb hearings which pointed out exactly \nthe same practices: how you saw older people being victimized by cold \ncalling arrangements and door-to-door sales activities. These agents \nwould be swooping in to apartment buildings and senior living \nfacilities, basically trying to get people into events where there \nwould be a free meal, or calling it an educational program, and all of \na sudden they would be selling these products that were not worth a \nwhole lot more than the paper they were written on.\n  So, in effect, what we saw in the last few years--it is a different \nproduct--but Medicare Advantage was going the same way we saw some of \nthose Medigap programs going in the 1980s, which we eventually fixed.\n  It is important for Senators to note when they vote tomorrow on \nmoving this Medicare legislation ahead that Chairman Baucus and Senator \nSnowe, with the excellent work done by Chairman Kohl in the Aging \nCommittee, are taking a real step in the right direction to protecting \nseniors from these marketing abuses.\n  This bill would require the agents and brokers to set the scope of \nany sales appointment when they are setting it up. It would require \ninclusion of the plan type in the particular program. What happens now \nis it is hard for people to even figure out what type of plan is being \ndiscussed because there has not been the kind of openness and \ndisclosure of those particular provisions.\n  There also would have to be training for those agents and brokers who \nare selling Medicare Advantage in what has come to be known as Part D \nso they would be out in the marketplace in a position to answer the \nquestions of older people.\n\n  Also--and I thought this was a particularly important benefit in the \nBaucus-Snowe legislation--agents and brokers would have to be licensed \nand appointed as required by State law. We saw this in both the Baucus \nhearings and the Kohl hearings, that the lack of that requirement was a \nserious deficiency in terms of consumer protection.\n  I hope tomorrow the Senate will move forward on this Medicare \nlegislation. I think without the additional assistance, particularly \nfor doctors in the primary care field, it will reduce access to older \npeople. We need the protections, the low-income protections I\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nhave outlined. And, finally, we need the protections for older people \nin terms of ensuring we do not have these flagrant, outrageous cases of \nmarketing abuses that take us back to the 1980s, when a lot of us \nthought we had gotten rid of that kind of fly-by-night flimflam rip-off \nof older people.\n  The last point I want to mention--I know the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer has been kind to talk to me about this in the past--is I think \nwe need to pass this legislation as a foundation for the broader health \nreform effort that is going to take place next year. In other words, it \nis going to be pretty hard to go on to broader health care reform if we \nsee physicians clobbered this year and that cutback in reimbursement \ngoes into effect.\n  If you have physicians cut 10 percent, and we lose a lot of \nphysicians in primary care, it is going to be pretty hard next year \nwhen we have a new President and bipartisan interest in the Senate to \ngo on to broader health reform.\n  I think we have an opportunity with respect to comprehensive health \nreform that we have never had here in the Senate. For the first time in \nthe history of the Senate, we have 14 Senators--7 Democrats and 7 \nRepublicans--willing to work in a bipartisan way. For the first time, \nthe people who keep the budget numbers, the Congressional Budget Office \nand the Joint Committee on Taxation, say that the numbers add up for \ncomprehensive reform, that we can do it in a budget-neutral fashion. In \nfact, they say in the third year of an effort it would actually start \ngenerating some surpluses for the Federal Government.\n  So there is a lot to work with, particularly when we get Senator \nKennedy back here, and he is going to be the champion of our effort. I \nthink we can move forward with comprehensive reform, and do it in a \nbipartisan way. But to move forward next year with comprehensive health \nreform, we cannot make mistakes in this session of the Senate.\n  It would be a huge mistake, for example, to let this physician \ncutback go through that is going to harm primary care. It would be a \nhuge mistake not to have the protections for marketing abuses, not to \nprotect the low-income older people.\n  We can pass this legislation. I hope we will do it in a resounding \nfashion in the Senate, starting tomorrow with the important procedural \nvote.\n  I close by saying, we ought to do it now. We ought to do it at this \ntime because it will help seniors for the future but also because I \nthink it will lay an important foundation for bipartisan health reform \nin the next year of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the squeeze on the \nfamily budget that is being imposed by a combination of circumstances \nthat, frankly, cry out for some relief.\n  As shown on this chart, this is how long it takes the average \nAmerican family to work each year to pay their taxes: 74 days each year \nto pay their Federal taxes. Then you add State and local taxes on top \nof that. As you can see, that is a good part of the year, about a third \nof the year, people have to work to pay their taxes, before they can \nbegin to pay any of the rest of their bills.\n  Then it takes 60 days out of the year to pay for their housing; 50 \ndays out of the year to pay for their health insurance; 35 days out of \nthe year to pay for their food; and 29 days out of the year to pay for \ntransportation.\n  Now, this chart was prepared from a special report by the Tax \nFoundation, dated April 2008, having to do with Tax Freedom Day. That \nwas the date they designated when you do not have to pay Uncle Sam or \nState and local taxes anymore, you are actually working for yourself. \nThat is what we call Tax Freedom Day. But I daresay that this chart \nwould have to be updated when it comes to the cost of food and the cost \nof transportation. That is what I wish to concentrate on with my \nremaining few minutes here.\n  Those related to the rising costs of energy--I have mentioned on the \nfloor before being at the Houston Food Bank 2 days ago, where I learned \nthat the cost of food is being dramatically increased as a result of \nthe cost of energy that it takes to produce it by our farmers. Of \ncourse, that is being passed along to consumers, making it harder and \nharder on the most vulnerable among us, particularly seniors, people on \nfixed incomes, to pay for their food costs. Then, of course, you add on \ntop of that the rising costs of gasoline and fuel, and it presents a \nreal human crisis in many instances.\n  Many folks have said: Well, there is not much we can do about it--the \ncost of gasoline. They had said that when gasoline was at $2.33 a \ngallon. Actually, Speaker Pelosi, back before she became Speaker of the \nHouse, said if elected Speaker, the Democrats would present a \ncommonsense plan to bring down the price of gasoline at the pump. That \nwas the good old days. That was back when gasoline was only $2.33 a \ngallon. Now it is $4.05 a gallon, and we are still waiting--I would say \nwith bated breath--for that commonsense solution which has yet to come.\n  But in the absence of a commonsense solution being offered by Speaker \nPelosi, we have offered a solution that deals with the simple fact that \nwhen you have increasing worldwide demand for the same commodity, that \none of the ways you can bring down the price is to increase supply. \nWhen you talk about the ways we can increase the supply of gasoline, \nwell, you necessarily have to talk about increasing the supply of \noil. Then you get into the issue of how much of the oil we depend on to \nmake into gasoline in our refineries is imported. Well, that figure now \nis about 60 percent of all of the oil we consume and the various \npetroleum-related products are produced abroad and shipped into the \nUnited States.\n\n  But we are in an ironic situation of where our dependency on imported \noil is a consequence of our own failed policies here in the Congress \nbecause since 1982 Congress has imposed a moratorium on the development \nof America's natural resources right here at home, whether they be on \nthe western lands, the oil shale, the Outer Continental Shelf \nsurrounding our country, or places such as the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. Congress has placed those out of bounds. We are the only \ncountry in the world that has placed our own natural resources out of \nbounds and refused to develop those while we have increased our \ndependence on imported energy from dangerous enemies of the United \nStates--countries such as Iran and Venezuela, which professes to be our \nenemy in South America.\n  What is ironic is the fact that years ago, the United States and Cuba \nagreed to draw an imaginary line between our two countries and said \nCuba had control of the submerged lands on the other side of that line \nleading up to Cuba and the United States had control of the 45 miles or \nso that represented American territory. But do you know who is \ndeveloping the oil and gas that is 50 miles off our southern shore of \nFlorida? Well, Cuba has production agreements with Brazil, Venezuela, \nSpain, China, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, Canada, and Norway. That is \nright. While we refuse, as a result of a Federal moratorium on \ndevelopment on the Outer Continental Shelf, to allow Americans to \nproduce American energy, the Chinese and others are drilling and \nproducing oil 50 miles off our shore in the area owned by Cuba. It is \nironic indeed that we would prohibit Americans from producing American \nenergy on American land so that we could remain increasingly dependent \non foreign oil. I think it is a terrible mistake.\n  Congress, looking around for a scapegoat as to who has caused these \nhigh prices, I would suggest needs to look in the mirror. We need to \nreassess and correct that mistake by making this natural resource \navailable for production.\n  Some have come up with what I consider to be misguided solutions that \ndo nothing to produce additional supply of oil and gas. As a matter of \nfact, they try something we tried back in the 1980s, for example; that \nis, raise taxes on oil producers here in America. We found out in the \n1980s, according to the Congressional Research Service, that it \nactually reduced domestic oil production by 6 percent.\n  Some may ask: Well, how is that possible? The fact is that 80 percent \nof the world's oil reserves are owned by national oil companies of \nforeign governments. Let me say that again. Eighty percent of the oil \nreserves in the world are owned by oil companies that are\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\nowned by foreign governments, and only 6 percent, 6 percent of the \nworld's oil reserves are owned by stockholder-owned companies; in other \nwords, the private sector--the ExxonMobils, the Chevrons, the Conoco-\nPhillips, and the like. Six percent owned by those privately owned or \nstockholder-owned companies, 80 percent owned by nations such as Saudi \nArabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and others, just to name a few.\n  So the irony of ironies again would be not only to not allow us to \ndevelop our own natural resources but actually to tax the privately \nowned or shareholder-owned oil companies that control 6 percent of the \nworld's resources while not touching the 80 percent owned by foreign \ncountries because, of course, we can't impose a tax on their production \nhere in America. We can only impose a tax on our own companies here in \nthe United States. When we did that before, we decreased domestic \nproduction. We should have learned from that mistake, but sadly, as a \nphilosopher once said, ``Those who refuse to learn from history are \ncondemned to repeat it.''\n  This is almost like Groundhog Day here in the Senate where we \ncontinue to encounter the same failed solutions--or I should say \n``nonsolutions''--to the same problems and refuse to look at the most \nobvious solution staring us in the face; that is, to open more of \nAmerica's natural resources.\n  Now, earlier on the floor, the distinguished Democratic whip, Senator \nDurbin, talked about emergency situations and talked about price caps \nin an emergency and said we are in an emergency, implying that we \nshould somehow--Congress should dictate price controls on gas. But I \nwould suggest to the distinguished Senator that if we have an emergency \nsituation--and I agree, we have something that profoundly affects our \nnational security and our economic security and has a dramatic impact \non food prices and on the average American family. We do have an \nemergency, and we ought to reassess our decision to block exploration \nand production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in the Outer \nContinental Shelf, in the shale oil in the western Federal lands and \nelsewhere which, by some estimates, could produce as many as 3 million \nadditional barrels of oil each day. Now, that is not a panacea, but it \nis a lot of help in the near term.\n  As we develop those natural resources, of course, that means we \ndepend that much less on imported oil. It creates jobs here in America \nat a time when our economy is softening and unemployment rates are \ngoing up, and it would help us be less dependent on some of the folks \nwho wish us harm in this world. To me, it constitutes the kind of \nemergency Senator Durbin was talking about earlier, that we ought to--\nif you won't do it when gasoline is $2.33 a gallon, will you do it when \ngasoline is $4.05 as it is today? If you won't do it when gasoline is \n$4.05 a gallon, will you do it when it is $5 a gallon or $8 or how \nabout $10 a gallon? At some point, there has to be a tipping point at \nwhich the Congress--and especially the Senate--will wake up and look in \nthe mirror and say: You know what, we need to reassess this. We need to \ntake action on behalf of the hard-working American family to make sure \nthey don't continue to find themselves pinched not only by a rising tax \nburden, the cost of housing, the cost of health care, but rising food \ncosts and rising transportation costs.\n  I have to say I was shocked when I saw an interview recently of \nSenator Obama, our colleague from Illinois. He was interviewed by \nCNBC's John Harwood, who asked him the question: Could these high \nprices help us? Senator Obama said: I think I would have preferred a \ngradual adjustment.\n  Well, I am not sure exactly what he means by that. Certainly, we \nhaven't had a gradual adjustment; we have had a radical adjustment \nupward.\n  All we have had, frankly, from our friends on the other side of the \naisle is a refusal to act in a responsible way to open America's energy \nresources while they offer what I have to say are misguided \nnonsolutions which produce no additional energy, things such as raising \ntaxes on oil companies, which we know will only be put on America's \nprivately owned companies and can't be placed on nationally owned oil \ncompanies in places such as Venezuela and Iran but also have had the \ndemonstrated experience of actually reducing domestic production rather \nthan increasing it. Hasn't our experience always been that when you \nincrease the cost--especially increase taxes--on the producer, \neventually that is going to be passed down to the ultimate consumer? So \nwhat it would do is have the effect of decreasing production, \nincreasing dependence on imported oil, and raising the price of \ngasoline ultimately for the consumer at a time when we ought to be \ngiving the consumer relief from these high prices if we can, and I \nbelieve we can by increasing supply.\n  So I hope our colleagues will reconsider their position because, \nfrankly, I think the only thing standing between lower gasoline prices \nand the American people is the Congress.\n  On our side of the aisle, we have offered what we believe to be a \ncommonsense solution that would increase supply, so we can hopefully \nadd to the supply, with rising demand by countries around the world, in \na way that will allow us to at least provide some relief to the \nAmerican consumer as we transition ourselves to new alternative sources \nof energy that are not going to be immediately able to fill that role \ncurrently played by oil.\n  We know we are going to have to continue to depend on oil and gas for \nthe near term, but as we transition ourselves into a clean energy \nfuture by increasing the use of nuclear power to generate electricity; \nas good, old-fashioned American ingenuity creates things such as plug-\nin hybrid cars that operate on batteries we can charge overnight and \ndrive in many parts of the country in a way that will provide an \nalternative to internal combustion engines but which will also help us \ndeal with environmental concerns as well; as we are on this bridge to a \nclean energy independence, we need to take advantage of the natural \nresources God has given us.\n\n  This is one of the things that has made our country so prosperous--\nthe vast natural resources we have. But only the Congress is so \nmistaken as to impose a moratorium on the development and production of \nthose natural resources, and it is hurting hard-working American \nfamilies and the American consumer. We need to do something about it. I \nhope we do on a bipartisan basis soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks regarding the \nrecent actions by the Democratic leadership in Congress with regard to \noil prices.\n  I have no problem with Democrats calling in the oil company \nexecutives to make sure they aren't violating antitrust laws. I am \nconvinced oil speculation contributes too much to the price of oil and \nwe need to take a serious look at that, but focusing on those concerns \nalone is no substitute for a realistic energy policy.\n  There are a number of environmental groups who just plain oppose oil \nproduction. What is worrisome is that it seems Democrats controlling \nCongress have adopted the anti-oil agenda of the environmental movement \nas an outlet of their own energy policy.\n  So far, I have heard proposals to tax successful energy production, \nto investigate the oil futures markets, to ban Canadian oil imports in \nfavor of oil from Venezuela, Russia, and the Middle East, and to call \nfor delay after delay in the commercial production of oil shale. At \ntimes, it almost appears that the anti-oil agenda is the only element \nof the Democratic energy policy. Their policies would not produce one \ndrop of oil. This so-called Energy bill they have will not produce one \ndrop of oil. In fact, they would definitely have the opposite effect--\ntheir bills.\n  Is it so hard to see that less oil means higher prices and economic \nharm and more oil means lower prices and economic benefits? I am not \nsure the Democratic leadership in Congress really understands this. \nThey seem to be completely immune to the facts when it comes to energy \npolicy.\n  They especially don't seem to understand that the price of oil is set \nby a global market. Unlike electricity, which is handled regionally in \nthe United States, oil prices are set globally. About 75 percent of the \nprice of gasoline is set by the global price for crude oil before it is \neven refined. U.S. taxes make up another 13 percent of\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nthe cost of a gallon of gas. So that explains 88 percent of the cost of \nthe gasoline. All the refining, distribution, and marketing of the oil \nhas to be made up in the remaining 12 percent of the cost of gasoline.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be \nsurprised to learn that the Federal Government already makes more on \ngasoline taxes than the oil companies do in profits. That is fine with \nme, except I think people would be astounded to find that actually \nhappened. That is right. I hope our taxpayers remember that when we \npoint to oil company profits. The Government is already raking in more \nmoney from oil than the oil companies are getting.\n  Yet our Government does not explore for oil. It does not produce one \ndrop of oil. It does not refine one drop of oil. It does not build 1 \nfoot of oil pipeline. Yet some of my colleagues want even more money \nfrom the oil company portfolio and profits.\n  This is where the taxpayers should be paying very close attention. If \nour taxpayers are smart--and I believe they are, although they are not \ngetting the facts--their hands will be reaching to protect their \nwallets because guess who is paying all this money to the Government in \nthe form of taxes on oil companies. That is right; it is our taxpayers. \nIt is our consumers. It is Joe Smith going to the gas station. It is a \npretty nasty game to tell our citizens we are taking profits from big, \nbad rich oil companies and then forget to tell the taxpayers they will \nbe the ones who ultimately will bear just about every cent of any new \ntaxes.\n  Let's talk about these big, bad American oil companies for a minute. \nI wonder if the Democratic leadership in Congress is aware that 80 \npercent of the world's oil reserves are owned and controlled by foreign \ngovernment-run corporations. If you put all the big, bad American oil \ncompanies together, they only control about 6 percent of the world's \noil. That is a fact. They cannot rebut that fact.\n  We send more than $600 billion--now approaching $700 billion--each \nyear to countries that are a lot smarter about energy than we are \nbecause they are willing to explore and develop their own resources, \nand we are not.\n  We have the Chinese coming within a few miles of our shore and taking \nour oil because they are willing to explore for it and reap the \nbenefits of it--and right off our shores. We are not permitted to do \nthat. What kind of energy policy is that? Think about it. That is $600 \nbillion to $700 billion each year that we will never get back. But my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle don't seem to have a problem \nwith that.\n  Here we are, one of the biggest energy consumers on Earth, and we \nsend out our small-fry oil companies--with only 6 percent of the \nworld's oil--into the world to compete with these giant national \ncorporations and conglomerates in other countries in a global market \ncontrolled by nations that aren't necessarily our friends.\n  Then we want to stop U.S. companies from developing all the good oil \nresources available in this country. We try to take away their profits, \ndrag them in front of congressional hearings, and blame them whenever \nthe global price goes up.\n  I hate to tell you, but Government is one of the biggest reasons why \nthe price of oil is so high right now--our Government.\n  So far, we don't have actual oil shortages in the world, but we have \na very low level of spare capacity. That has done a lot to raise \nspeculation on the futures market. A lack of spare capacity means any \nserious disruption in the world can lead to real shortages, and the \nfutures markets reflect that fear. Holding hearings on the futures \nmarket isn't going to make those fears go away, and it is not going to \nproduce one drop of oil to help us or bring down the price for our \nconsumers or help Joe Smith or Joe Jones to be able to afford gas for \ntheir cars.\n  Investors need to know we are finding a new barrel of oil for every \nbarrel we sell. But that is not what they are seeing. At the same time, \nthey are seeing that ethanol has major limits as a replacement fuel. \nNinety-seven percent of transportation fuel is oil. Ethanol is the only \nreal alternative, and it makes up less than 3 percent, as far as liquid \nfuel goes. I am opposed to mandates for ethanol, but I have been one of \nthe Senate's leading supporters of incentives for ethanol and other \nalternative transportation fuels. I am the author of the CLEAR Act, \nwhich provides economic stimulation to develop hybrid cars, and the \nauthor of the Freedom Act, which also leads to economic incentives for \nplug-in hybrids and other forms of high-mileage vehicles.\n  I am one of the Senate's leading supporters for ethanol and other \ntransportation fuels. While other folks are just blowing off about it, \nwe have actually put language in law that increased the ability to do \nthese fuels. But even at that, it is only 3 percent of what we need in \nthis country.\n  I am also a realist about the fact that there is no way ethanol can \nput a major dent in our need for fossil fuels. So far, it is the only \nmajor alternative fuel on which we can currently count.\n  That may be a fact that liberals and environmentalists wish to \nignore, but it is a fact. They can talk all they want about wind, \nsolar, and geothermal, but last time I checked, planes, trucks, and \nships don't run on electricity; they run on fossil fuels and so do our \ncars.\n  We should be grateful that Canada has now become our largest supplier \nof energy. They are a friendly, stable partner on whom we can rely. \nThey are our friends, and they are producing more and more oil from oil \nsands every day. Canada now holds more oil reserves than every country \nin the world, except Saudi Arabia. They are pumping 1.3 million barrels \na day down to us, and what do the liberals in Congress want to do? They \npass a law barring the Federal Government from purchasing from the oil \nsands in Canada. They say it is because oil sands have a big greenhouse \ngas footprint, but what they forget to say is, shipping fuel all the \nway from the Middle East also has a big greenhouse gas footprint--and \nprobably more. But liberals would rather be dependent on the Saudis and \nthe Russians and Venezuela than offend environmental groups.\n\n  Here in the States, we have as much oil in oil shale in Utah, \nColorado, and Wyoming than the rest of the world combined. We have a \nFederal law that layers on every available environmental protection but \nalso would allow companies to develop this resource that is 10 times \nricher in oil than a normal oil well.\n  So what do the liberals do? They put a 1-year moratorium on the \nrelease of commercial leasing regulations. Some on the other side say \nthey don't want it to happen too fast. I do. I sure would like to be \nable to bring these prices down. This would bring them down.\n  I congratulate the liberals because the existing law, which I \nsponsored, makes it abundantly clear that each Governor gets to decide \nhow quickly development should move forward in their respective States, \nand they know that. The Democrats know that. If a Governor doesn't want \nto move forward on oil shale, that Governor can say no.\n  What they are doing is making sure the Governor of Utah or Wyoming \nnever gets a chance to make that decision. So now we have companies \nthat have spent tens of millions of dollars in good faith, and they are \njust plain getting shut down by what I consider a neanderthal approach \nto energy in the Senate--and in the House of Representatives; let's not \nleave them out. They are even worse than we are, in some ways. I am \ntalking about the liberals.\n  How are they supposed to go out--these companies--and attract \ninvestors, when Congress is acting to stop regulations for commercial \nleases so they can do some of these things?\n  Environmental elitists tend to point to concerns about water usage, \nland usage, wildlife habitat, and air quality--all very valid concerns. \nSo let's have a look at them.\n  Corn needs about 780 barrels of water for a barrel of ethanol, and \nmore than 1,000 barrels for the equivalent of a barrel of oil. Then it \nneeds another three barrels to turn the corn into liquid fuel. That is \na crazy amount of water, but it works out all right so far because it \nis grown in rainy areas. But if we want to increase the amount of \nethanol available, we are going to have to move toward irrigation, and \nthen there will be major limits to how much we can afford to grow.\n  On the other hand, to mine, process, upgrade, and do land \nrestoration, DOE estimates that oil shale will require a total of three \nbarrels of water for every\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nbarrel of oil. In terms of water, oil shale is hundreds of times better \nfor the environment.\n  Let's talk about land use and wildlife habitat.\n  One acre of corn produces 7 to 10 barrels of ethanol, or the \nequivalent of 5 to 7 barrels of oil.\n  One acre of oil shale produces 100,000 barrels to 1 million barrels \nof oil. Nobody disputes that, that I know. I will repeat that. I hope \nthose concerned about land use and wildlife habitat are listening \ncarefully. One acre of corn produces 7 to 10 barrels of ethanol, or the \nequivalent of 5 to 7 barrels of oil. One acre of oil shale produces \n100,000 barrels to 1 million barrels of oil. In terms of land use, oil \nshale is at least 20,000 times better for the environment than ethanol. \nI am for ethanol, don't get me wrong, but think of those facts.\n  A couple months ago, an article came out how the city of Aspen in \nColorado has been besieged with building applications, equating to \nabout $2 million worth of development a day. If we could stem the \ngrowth a little in Aspen and save, let's say, a hundred acres of those \nbeautiful forests from all that development, and instead allow \ndevelopment of 100 acres of much less desirable land where the oil \nshale in Colorado is, we could produce up to 100 million barrels of oil \nwith no net loss of habitat. Ironically, the local governments in \nColorado's oil shale areas support oil shale development, but the \nliberals in the State are stopping the regulations that would allow it.\n  Some critics of oil shale and tar sands production have raised air \nquality concerns. Let's be clear; there is no aspect of oil shale \ndevelopment that would exempt industry from any Federal or State air \nquality laws or regulations. In fact, these industry members plan to \ncomply and even exceed air quality requirements. These companies also \nexpress a readiness to address climate change questions on the same \nschedule that other industries may be required to control carbon \nemissions.\n  One Utah company is now building a pilot plant to demonstrate their \nability to produce upgraded syncrude from oil shale with little or no \ncarbon emissions.\n  The poorest Americans spend about 50 percent of their income on \nenergy, and not enough is being said about that. The sad thing is that \nthe poor look to the liberals to make national policies for them, but \nin this case, they are being sold out.\n  It is clear the environmentalists have an anti-oil agenda. The \nquestion for this Congress is whether we can afford to adopt that \nagenda as part of a national energy policy. We should be promoting all \nforms of alternative fuels, and I am for that. But the fact is that \nwhen it comes to transportation fuel, which is where our crisis is, we \nare dependent on oil, and there is no combination of alternatives that \ncan change that right now. It would be nice to pretend we are not \ndependent on oil, that we can skip immediately to some yet-to-be \nidentified alternative, 30 years down the line. But we can't. Truckers \nand farmers need diesel today. Moms need to get to soccer and ballet \npractice tonight. Americans want to visit national parks this summer. \nThe sooner we understand this, the sooner we can address the energy \ncrisis we are facing today.\n  This is pathetic. We have it within our means to develop our own oil \nto solve our own problems, to bring these prices down, to be \nindependent, to do the things that keep America strong, to keep our \nenvironment and economy strong, and to do it in an environmentally \nfriendly way that is already on the books. Yet when you look at the \nenergy program the Democrats brought up on the floor, it doesn't \nproduce one drop of this oil that is so critical to all these needs. \nYet we have it within our power to solve these problems. I hope we wake \nup around here and get rid of the doggone partisanship and do what we \nhave to do to provide for the energy needs of this country. We can no \nlonger afford to let the whacko, extreme environmentalists--who are in \nthe game for politics, rather than to help the American people--control \nthis country the way they do. I think it is time for our friends on \nboth sides of the aisle to stand and say enough is enough. Let's become \nenergy independent and energy secure.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for allowing me this extra \ntime. I did not have anything to do with what happened this morning, \nnor did I know it was going to happen. Let me say that my colleague has \nalways been gracious and kind to me. I have a great admiration for him. \nI am sorry I took the extra 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have no objection whatsoever to \nstanding on the Senate floor listening to the Senator from Utah speak. \nHe is an enormously distinguished attorney and has been a great leader \nof his State and the Senate for a long time.\n  I understand very well the unfortunate circumstance this morning was \nnot expected by him, was not participated in by him. I think it has put \nhim in an embarrassing position. I regret that, but I know he had \nnothing to do with it. I have highest regard for him.\n  I think it also put the very distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, in an even more \ndifficult and embarrassing situation because the individual witnesses \nwho were before us when our hearing was interrupted and cut off were \nPennsylvanians, people from the ranking member's home State. I am sure \nif Ranking Member Specter had any idea this was going to happen, he \nwould have taken energetic measures to make sure individual witnesses \nwho suffered grievous injury and had come a long way to Washington to \ntestify would not have had their hearing cut off by parliamentary \nmaneuvers by his leadership.\n  I have the highest regard for both those Senators.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator for his \nremarks. I felt particularly bad because I went 4 or 5 minutes over on \nmy questioning, with his agreement, and then he got cut off on his \nquestions. I wanted the Senator to know that. I appreciate his remarks.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the goodwill of the Senator from Utah \nis appreciated.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Medicare \nbill before us. One of the strongest obligations we have in this body \nis to uphold America's promise to care for those who have worked hard \nthroughout their lives, who have raised their families, and who have \nhelped make this Nation great: our seniors.\n  President Johnson created Medicare as part of that promise to give \nseniors all across this country the peace of mind they would have the \nhealth care they need as they grow older. Today, we take up legislation \nthat would make this critically important program stronger by ensuring \ndoctors in Rhode Island and across this country are compensated, as \nthey should be, for the care they provide.\n  The approaching June 30 deadline for resolving this issue certainly \nmakes this legislation particularly urgent. But we all know that there \nis a far more ominous deadline looming over us in health care, and that \nis when the Medicare trust fund will become insolvent in 2019. As \nChairman Conrad of the Budget Committee so often says, there is a \ntsunami of costs bearing down on us. We are now facing a 75-year \nshortfall in Medicare of $33.9 trillion. It is my belief that we as \nSenators have a fundamental obligation to begin to take steps now that \nwill lower these looming overwhelming costs. If we fail to act now, we \nwill be left with only the cold, harmful, and, frankly, cruel fiscal \noptions of raising taxes, reducing benefits and eligibility, or cutting \nfurther provider payments. What a sad day that would be, especially \nsince it is completely avoidable.\n  This afternoon, I commend Senators Baucus, Rockefeller, Snowe, and \nSmith for offering a bill that not only addresses the looming cut in \nMedicare reimbursements to physicians, but takes a broader look at the \nproblems in our Medicare system and in the health care system \ngenerally.\n  This bill includes a number of reforms that begin to address the \nflaws in our broken health care system and lead us down a path of more \nefficient, effective care for seniors today and into the future.\n  As my colleagues know, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the \nlimitless\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\npotential of health information technology to support a transformation \nof our health care system. For many providers, e-prescribing, \nelectronic prescribing of pharmaceuticals, is the gateway technology to \nlarger health information technology adoption because the startup \ninvestment is relatively low and the benefits are quite high. E-\nprescribing is expected to eliminate over 2 million adverse drug events \non Americans per year, to avoid 190,000 hospital admissions, and 1.3 \nmillion outpatient visits annually, and to produce an estimated yearly \nsavings of $44 billion.\n  To quote Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Leavitt:\n\n       The benefits [of electronic prescribing] are \n     unchallengeable. E-prescribing is not only more efficient and \n     convenient for consumers, but widespread use would eliminate \n     thousands of medication errors every year. . . . E-\n     prescribing needs faster implementation. We have been through \n     all the public processes necessary to develop standards. The \n     technology is readily available and widely distributed. \n     Electronic prescribing will enhance the safety and \n     convenience for patients.\n\n  This bill provides important incentives for practitioners who choose \nto e-prescribe, and it eventually requires all doctors to e-prescribe. \nThis is a vital step forward for health care in this country and a \nfarsighted component of this legislation. I thank Senator Kerry for \ncrafting this important language, but also all the Senators on the \nother side of the aisle who have supported e-prescribing in Medicare, \nincluding Senators Alexander, Coleman, Corker, Cornyn, Ensign, \nGrassley, Martinez, Snowe, and Sununu. The need to promote health \ninformation technology is a truly bipartisan issue, and I am delighted \nto see it included in this important bill.\n  The measure before us also makes important reforms for private fee-\nfor-service Medicare. In light of this fiscal health care tsunami \ncoming down on us, I am deeply concerned that private fee-for-service \nMedicare Advantage plans cost roughly 119 percent of the cost of \ncovering the same individual in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. \nThis is a program that was sold to Congress as more efficient, a cost-\ncutting alternative to traditional Medicare.\n  History has proven those assertions to have been false, and now we \nshould learn from that mistake. It has added about $1,000 in costs for \neach beneficiary in a private plan. Medicare Advantage will cost the \nFederal Government $54 billion over the next 5 years and $149 billion \nover the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nThese excess costs have caused a rise in Part B premiums for those \nseniors enrolled in traditional Medicare of $2 per month. These excess \ncosts will cause the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund to become \ninsolvent 2 years earlier than otherwise expected.\n  I understand some Medicare Advantage plans offer benefits that are \nnot covered in fee-for-service Medicare. Unlike traditional Medicare, \nMedicare Advantage plans can strategically attract healthier seniors by \noffering better coverage for low-cost care and worse coverage for \nintensive services. Groups, including the Medicare Rights Center, the \nCommonwealth Fund, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and MedPAC, have \ndetermined that private plan beneficiaries either pay more or receive \nfewer services for hospital and home care than do seniors in \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Medicare Advantage, and particularly fee-for-service Medicare \nAdvantage, costs this system money it simply does not have. Seniors \ndeserve better, and this bill does better for them.\n  Seniors also deserve better when it comes to their Medicare Part D \nplans. Some of the very saddest stories that Rhode Islanders share with \nme as I host community dinners around my State concern their \nexperiences with the Part D prescription drug program.\n  An example is a young man named Travis who came to one of my \ncommunity dinners in Woonsocket, RI. Travis told me of his 90-year-old \ngreat-grandmother who is living independently in a walkup apartment \nbuilding in Woonsocket. She signed up for her Part D plan and was \ntaking a number of prescription medications. One day she arrived at her \npharmacy, went to the pharmacy window, only to be told that she had no \ncoverage. She had fallen in what we preposterously call the doughnut \nhole, a massive gap in the coverage, a trap for seniors. She was turned \naway from the window because she had not brought the money to pay for \nher prescriptions. She didn't have it. She went home and called her \ngreat-grandson Travis in tears. She would no longer be able to afford \nher apartment or the independence she had maintained for 90 years.\n  No American should be forced to choose between their dignity and \ntheir health, and it is a tragedy when this is an unnecessary choice.\n  The Congressional Budget Office concludes that privatizing that drug \nbenefit instead of simply adding the drug program to the established \nMedicare benefit costs almost $5 billion a year. The Center for \nEconomic and Policy Research reveals that the combined cost of \nprivatization and failure to negotiate prices is more than $30 million \na year.\n  Mr. President, I cannot look Travis in the eye and tell him the \nreason his great-grandmother cannot afford her independence any longer \nis because the Government needed to take the side of the pharmaceutical \nindustry in this contest. In 2004, the pharmaceutical industry was \nthree times more profitable than the median for all Fortune 500 \ncompanies, and from 1995 to 2002, it was the most profitable industry \nin the entire country.\n  Since the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act, companies have \nengaged in outrageous, egregious marketing practices. This legislation \nprohibits door-to-door sales, cold calling, and free meals. It puts \nlimits on cobranding, gifts and commissions and other hard-sell \npractices of both Part D and Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Our Nation's elderly have given much to this country as parents, as \ngrandparents, as teachers, as soldiers, as mentors, and as patriotic \nAmerican citizens. They deserve respect, they deserve protection, and \nthis bill affords them both.\n  I close by saying the bill also recognizes that mental health \ncoverage should be on par with any other illness seniors face, reducing \nthe copayment from the current staggering rate of 50 percent to a 20-\npercent copay by 2014. Senior citizens commit suicide at a higher rate \nthan any other age group. Mental health services are critically \nimportant for our elderly population. I am proud to support changes to \nmental health coverage in Medicare. I particularly wish to acknowledge \nthe leadership of my colleague in the Rhode Island delegation, \nRepresentative Patrick Kennedy, who has been such a leader on mental \nhealth parity. He is the chief sponsor of that legislation in the \nHouse, and I look forward to larger reforms in the area of mental \nhealth parity with Congressman Kennedy at the helm.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Baucus and particularly his staff for \ntheir tireless work in putting this measure together. I look forward to \nworking with him and this entire body to pass this bill and then to \nwork to enact future health care reforms to bring our system under \ncontrol.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of Senator Roberts. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about energy \nprices, as have many of my colleagues, and their impact on my \nconstituents and, for that matter, the constituents of all of us \nnationwide.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, the leadership of this body has decided to \nbring two bills to the floor that would have tremendous effects on the \npocketbooks of the American people. Unfortunately, after you take a \nhard look at these bills, you find out that neither bill would really \nreduce the price of energy. In fact, both would increase prices. But I \nwant to take time to highlight the impacts of the climate change \nlegislation, albeit somewhat late in the debate, and to make a few \ncommonsense points or observations.\n  At a time when Americans are suffering from high fuel prices and high \nenergy costs, and when fertilizer prices have increased by their \nlargest amount in the history of fertilizer prices, it is not in \nAmerica's best interest for the Senate to compound the problem. But \nthat is precisely what the climate change bill would do. By capping the \namounts of carbon emitted by coal-fired plants and natural gas \nprocessing\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nfacilities and energy-intensive manufacturing facilities, this \nlegislation is flawed. It passes the costs of meeting these \nrequirements down to the consumer.\n  Kansans will be particularly hard hit. Experts at the American \nCouncil for Capital Formation--again, the American Council for Capital \nFormation, and I urge all of my colleagues to pay attention to this \norganization--State by State they can tell you what will happen. They \npredict that Kansas will lose 36,900 jobs over about a decade or two, \nand that is equal to 2.5 percent of the total workforce, if we enact \nthis bill.\n  Kansans would also lose $7,283 in disposable income each year because \nof this legislation. You say how? Certainly higher utility rates, \nhigher gas prices, and all manufacturing and farm equipment costs due \nto the increase of the cost of inputs. A combine now out in western \nKansas, if you go to the dealer, will cost you, if you have the top \nrate combine, $350,000. Goodness knows what it would cost after this \nbill was passed and on down the road.\n  Anyone filling up with gasoline in the State of Kansas can expect to \npay 140 percent more for each gallon of gas. Yesterday the lowest rate \nin the State was Emporia, KS, home of William Allen White and the \nEmporia Gazette, very famous in Kansas history. In Emporia it was $3.70 \nper gallon. This bill would raise that to $5.18. This doesn't make any \nsense. Let me repeat that. It would raise the cost of gas for Kansans \nby 140 percent.\n  We have had a $1.71 increase in the average price of gas since the \nmajority took over in the Congress. My goodness, we don't need to be \ngoing over $5. I know there was a lot of rhetoric at that time that we \nwere going to fix that, hopefully in a bipartisan way, but obviously \nthat has not occurred.\n  Heating and cooling an apartment, a home, or an office building will \ncost 153 percent more in Kansas. Lawrence, KS, has some of the lowest \nelectricity rates in America. However, the average household spending \n$200 on electric bills for the month will now pay $306--$306.\n  This proposed legislation will have a particularly unfair impact on \nAmerica's heartland. Under this legislation, the Great Plains, the \nMidwest, and southern States pay more compared to those living on the \nwest coast or in the Northeast. I am sure that is true in Arkansas, the \nState the distinguished Presiding Officer represents so well in this \nbody.\n  It should also be noted that the Great Plains, the Midwest, and the \nSouth are home to some of the most fertile and highest producing areas \nof cash crops in the world.\n  Now, why would I mention that? This is the land that grows the crops \nnecessary to feed not only the United States and the American consumer \nbut a troubled and hungry world. As a matter of fact, our producers \nback in Kansas are servicing their combines now, as I speak, and \ngetting ready to begin wheat harvest, to fertilize their corn crop and \nmeet with their bankers to discuss how on Earth they can pay for it, \nand how much money is needed to purchase fertilizer and seed for next \nyear's crop.\n  Our Nation enjoys but unfortunately does not appreciate--if you pay \nmuch attention to the national media--the modern-day miracle known as \nU.S. agriculture, or maybe we should call it production agriculture. \nThis modern miracle provides the cheapest and the highest quality food \nsupply in the world, and the most inexpensive, even with the rise in \nfood prices and farm prices we have seen. This miracle is possible \nbecause of better breeding techniques combined with the availability of \nmanmade fertilizers. These fertilizers increase the yields per acre and \nhelp keep the world from going hungry.\n  Rather than thanking our producers, this bill tells them basically \nthey are not important. Rather than increasing domestic natural gas \nproduction, which is roughly 90 percent of the cost to produce \nsynthetic nitrogen, this bill forces natural gas facilities to regulate \nthe amount of emissions they emit.\n  A recent Doane agriculture study shows this legislation will add $6 \nbillion to $12 billion to total crop production costs. If it is \nenacted, it is likely to cost a Kansas wheat farmer an additional \n$31.87 per acre. That same producer would see his sorghum cost increase \n$43.56 per acre, corn $78.80 per acre, and soybeans $20.41 per acre.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the Chair.)\n  I want to be clear. Throughout the climate change debate, I have \nsupported the role agriculture can play in a voluntary system or, for \nthat matter, any manufacturer that does business in Kansas wishes to \nplay to certainly decrease the amount of CO2 emissions we \nemit into the atmosphere.\n  In fact, I introduced legislation some years ago and was able to \nsecure funding for a carbon sequestration research program at Kansas \nState University. What is that? That is carbon in the ground, good; \ncarbon in the air, bad. If you can sequester carbon in your normal \ncropping practices, you are being very helpful in regard to \nCO2 emissions and carbon in the air. This legislation was \nreauthorized in the 2008 farm bill, which is now the law, or will be \nthe law when we finally finish voting on it.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before us now, the climate change \nbill, provides little incentive for agriculture to play a role in any \nclimate change debate. This legislation leaves the decision as to which \nagricultural practices are eligible for the offset market to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The EPA is also designated to prepare \nthe operation and qualification methodology for agricultural offsets. \nAll right, that is fine. But the USDA already has the expertise, the \nbackground, and the ability to assist our producers, our farmers, and \nranchers with best management practices. That should reside with the \nUSDA, but it is not. In this bill, it is with the EPA.\n  I might add that the partnership between the USDA and the farmers and \nranchers measures quite a bit higher in regard to acceptability in farm \ncountry than the EPA, which sometimes--sometimes--and they have a role \nto play--tends to think of regulations as their fondest responsibility.\n  The legislation requires agricultural projects to be completed and \nreduction verified before the EPA decides whether to approve the offset \nallowance. This gives no assurance to which, if any, agricultural \nprojects will be accepted. So you have a climate change bill that \nbasically rules out agriculture, and that makes no sense at all.\n  The Wall Street Journal calls this legislation, the climate change \nlegislation, the largest income redistribution scheme since the income \ntax. That is quite a statement. This bill will hit Kansans where it \nmatters most, in their pocketbooks. I cannot support legislation that \nwill exponentially increase the cost of their food, their electric, and \ntheir fuel bills, so I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-conceived \nidea.\n  I want to indicate to the Presiding Officer that I received letters \nof concern in opposition from the following: the Kansas Farm Bureau, \nthe Frontier Farm Credit folks, the National Sorghum Producers, the \nKansas Soybean Association, the Kansas Independent Oil and Gas \nAssociation, the Air Transport Association, the National Business \nAviation Association, the Kansas City Power and Light, Weststar Energy, \nand Kansas Electric Cooperatives.\n  I commend the Fertilizer Institute and the Doane Advisory Services \nfor the analysis they completed on the relationship between energy \nprices and crop reduction costs.\n  I also thank Troy Dumler, an agricultural economist at Kansas State \nUniversity, for analysis on Kansas crop production costs.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Agreement--S. 3101\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to S. 3101 occur at 3 p.m. tomorrow, \nThursday, June 12; that following the opening of the Senate on \nThursday, the Senate resume the motion to proceed to S. 3101, with the \ntime until 3 p.m. equally divided and controlled between the leaders or \ntheir designees, with the final 40 minutes prior to the vote controlled \nas follows: 10 minutes each, Senators Grassley, Baucus, McConnell, and \nReid of Nevada, or their designees, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\n                      Medicare Physician Payments\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 3101, \nthe bipartisan effort introduced by our Senate Finance chairman, \nSenator Baucus, and the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, that will strengthen Medicare. This is a critically important \nbill that I hope we will have the support of the Senate on tomorrow to \nbe able to proceed to and to pass.\n  This important legislation not only prevents harmful cuts from \njeopardizing patient care, but it also sets the stage for modernizing \nour health care system through information technology. This is a very \nexciting part of this bill for me, with Senator Snowe having worked on \nthis issue, with many other colleagues now for some time, and it is a \nvery important step forward.\n  First and foremost, though, this legislation protects patients' \naccess to their trusted physicians. If Congress does not act soon, \nMedicare payments to physicians and health care professionals will be \ncut by 10 percent--10 percent--as a result of the fatally flawed \nsustainable growth rate formula or, as we call it, the SGR. It is sad \nthat we are once again going through this exercise. If I could, I would \nreform the flawed SGR formula once and for all. Personally, I wish to \nstop this process and create a new one that makes much more sense for \nphysicians and for patients and the Medicare system. It makes no sense \nfor us to go through this ordeal every 6 months or so and risk \njeopardizing seniors' access to care when we know the kind of cuts \nfacing physicians under Medicare would be devastating and would, in \nfact, directly impact access to care for those who rely on Medicare.\n  Physicians are the foundation of the Medicare system and our Nation's \nhealth care system, and patients of all ages depend upon our physicians \nfor their health care services, which they provide in an outstanding \nway every single day. Every aspect of our health care system, from \nhospitals to rural health clinics, relies upon the skills and services \nof physicians.\n  When I introduced my bill, S. 2785, earlier this year on stopping the \nSGR cuts, I heard from countless seniors and physicians, medical group \npractices, and hospitals in my State, all expressing support for the \neffort to stop these cuts. For example, one orthopedic practice in \nsouthwest Michigan wrote me and said:\n\n       Every year we have to wait until the last minute to see if \n     the rates will be cut or fixed. It makes it impossible to \n     budget and project for the next year. Especially for a \n     practice like ours, with nearly 50 percent of our patients \n     receiving Medicare. With the uncertainty and the increases \n     that we do get not keeping up with the cost of living, we \n     have to err on the side of caution, which leads to job cuts.\n\n  That is certainly an ongoing issue all across my State. We certainly \ndon't want to be seeing cuts as they relate to jobs or access under \nhealth care, compounding what is already happening in the health care \nsystem.\n  A radiologist in southwest Michigan reported having to close three \noutpatient x-ray offices over the past 5 years, and they are looking to \nclose another one this year. A surgery center told me it had to put off \ninvesting in an EMR and was forced to freeze any wage increases and \npossibly lay off staff. A medical group in mid-Michigan that staffs two \nemergency room departments determined that the scheduled reduction \nwould reduce its Medicare payments by nearly $175,000 a year--$175,000 \na year.\n  If the reduction were to go into effect and this legislation is not \npassed, or similar legislation is not passed, the group wrote me it \nwould be forced to reduce the workforce by either one full-time \nphysician or two full-time physician assistants--cutting back on the \navailability of health care services for seniors and the disabled in my \ncommunity. That is truly frightening when our emergency rooms are \nlosing staff.\n  I have, for too many years, heard from hospitals and others across \nMichigan about the difficulty in finding physicians who are able to \ntake Medicaid patients because the rates are so low. This is the first \nyear I have been hearing such great concern from hospitals, from \nhospital emergency rooms, about Medicare, the Medicare rates being so \nlow--without these cuts--and the inability to find physicians who are \nable to take those patients.\n  I am hopeful we can add language to S. 3101 similar to a bill I have \nintroduced with Senator Specter to begin to address the crises facing \nour emergency rooms because we have a much broader issue we need to \naddress there as well.\n  I am very proud of the work that over 20,000 MDs and DOs do in \nMichigan every single day, providing more than 1.4 million seniors and \npeople with disabilities, and over 90,000 TRICARE beneficiaries in \nMichigan with high quality medical services under the Medicare Program.\n  If Senator Baucus's bipartisan legislation does not pass, physicians \nin Michigan will lose some $540 million for the care of seniors and \npeople with disabilities over the next 18 months due to the 10-percent \ncut in payments for 2008 and the additional 5-percent cut for 2009. \nMadam President, $540 million of services, Medicare services, health \ncare services that will not be rendered to the people in Michigan is \nnot acceptable.\n  Michigan physicians are looking at cuts of more than $10 billion by \n2016; $10 billion in the next 8 years as a result of this flawed \nformula, and 9 years of cuts. We certainly can't expect that physicians \ncan continue to provide the same level of care if their payments are \ncut $540 million over the next 18 months alone. These cuts will be \ndevastating to our seniors and access to care.\n  Second, the lack of a predictable and equitable Medicare payment \nsystem hinders our investment in information technology, which we all \nknow we need to be investing in. We need physicians in hospitals and \nother providers to be investing in technology that not only allows \npeople to communicate with one another--electronic medical records and \ne-prescribing--but allows the very latest technology so that we have \nthe very highest quality, the ability to provide the most efficient \nprocesses of providing health care that is possibly available.\n  Health IT is very important to that. This bipartisan legislation \nrecognizes the need for investing in information technology, something, \nas I indicated before, that I am pleased to have worked on for the last \nseveral years with Senator Snowe. This bipartisan legislation would \nincrease the list of those sites under telehealth that would include \nskilled nursing facilities and dialysis centers and community mental \nhealth centers that would be able to receive reimbursement for \ntelehealth, which is so important. I thank Senator Conrad for his \nleadership. I am pleased to be joining with him and others on the whole \nquestion of expanding this part of the technology of telemedicine, \ntelehealth. In addition to improving access to care and facilities, we \nwill see significant cost savings achieved by avoiding transporting \nmedically fragile patients from one place to another. I am so proud, \namong many other advances in Michigan around health IT, telehealth is \nsomething that we have been using in rural parts of northern Michigan \nand the upper peninsula now for years. We have great leadership that \nhas been developed. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to \nparticipate and see what is done that allows people in remote parts of \nMichigan to be able to communicate directly with physicians, with \nnursing staff, and so on, to receive care they need without traveling \nlong distances. There are wonderful ways this can happen. This \nlegislation expands the ability for people to receive telehealth \nservices. This is important.\n  Additionally, this bipartisan bill moves us toward e-prescribing, a \nbasic building block for greater adoption of health information \ntechnology. There are incentives for doctors who write prescriptions \nelectronically, that improve both quality and efficiency. I thank \nSenator John Kerry and Senator John Ensign for working with me on the \nwhole question of e-prescribing and being in a position to put this \nforward, and I thank Senator Baucus again for his leadership in strong \nsupport of this effort.\n  Again, we in Michigan have been recognized as one of the top five \nStates in e-prescribing. We have had huge success in a regional \ncollaborative in southeastern Michigan called SEMI, the Southeastern \nMichigan ePrescribing Initiative that has brought together General \nMotors, Ford,\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\nChrysler, the UAW, insurers, and providers to work with consumers to be \nable to electronically create e-prescribing so the physician can in \nfact communicate directly with the pharmacy in the most accurate way \nwith the most accurate information. We have some 2,500 physicians in \nsoutheastern Michigan who are engaged in this.\n\n  Last October, a patient safety analysis found that SEMI alerted \ndoctors of potentially incorrect drug prescriptions that resulted in \nnearly 423,000 prescriptions being changed or canceled because of the \ninformation the doctor was able to receive. Possibly the physician was \nlooking at a particular medication that had an adverse drug \nrelationship with something else the patient was on, or maybe there \nwere concerns about allergic reactions or other information that was \nhelpful and gained through this process in the program through e-\nprescribing. SEMI also sent out more than 100,000 medication allergy \nalerts. When a formulary alert was presented, so physicians were \nalerted as to a problem with a particular drug they were thinking of \nprescribing, 39 percent of the time the physician changed the \nprescription.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 39 percent of the time when the \nphysician had more information they changed the prescription and \ntherefore addressed safety concerns or saving the patient or the \nemployer dollars.\n  In February, a physician satisfaction survey found that 9 out of 10 \nphysicians believed that e-prescribing met or exceeded expectations. \nThis is only one region of Michigan where it has been extremely \nsuccessful. We have incentives in this bill to be able to support \nphysicians using e-prescribing and being able to have some assistance \nto be able to purchase the equipment they need. I believe there are a \nthousand reasons why that is a great idea and one of the reasons I \nenthusiastically support this bill.\n  Third, this bill reauthorizes important rural provisions to ensure \nthat all Americans, regardless of where they live, have access to \nhealth care. We have, in Michigan, again, many small- and mid-sized \nproviders serving vast rural areas around our State. This is very \nimportant, to approve the payments for community health centers and \nambulances and other providers who are hit by declining Medicare \nreimbursement--as well as high gas prices, I might add.\n  Finally, let me say I am very pleased that an area of the bill \naddresses gathering more information on health disparities regarding \ngender or regarding race. It is taken from language in my HEART for \nWomen Act, to be able to gather more information for providers as to \ngaps where we need to be focusing more on particular kinds of services.\n  Many organizations such as the American Medical Association and the \nAARP have endorsed this bill and endorsed it strongly. I again thank \nSenator Baucus, as Finance chairman, for his leadership. I support \nfully his goal of providing this 18-month fix for physician payments as \nwell as providing other very important incentives for the future.\n  This bill is very much about the future with e-prescribing and with \ntelehealth and other information gathering. I very much hope that we, \non behalf of the 44 million people who rely on Medicare, will have a \nvery strong vote to proceed to this bill and have a strong bipartisan \nvote to adopt it. I am very hopeful that with a strong vote the \nPresident will decide to support this bill and sign this initiative.\n  It is critically important that we get this done. The physician cut \nis going to take place very shortly if we do not act. This bill does \nthe right thing and moves us in the right direction as it relates to \nhealth care reform.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am disappointed that those across the \naisle would not join with us to move to consider and debate the \nConsumer-First Energy Act of 2008.\n  This legislation is designed to protect consumers from artificially \nhigh fuel prices, to curtail the massive giveaway of taxpayer resources \nthrough the continuing tax breaks to oil companies, and to recapture a \nportion of the windfall profits they are making at the expense of hard-\nworking Americans. While the presumptive Republican Presidential \nnominee today recognized that gas prices can be expected to continue to \nclimb, I continue to wonder why so many Republican Senators voted along \nparty lines to ignore one of the biggest problems facing families \nacross the country.\n  Did they not want to debate why oil and gas companies should not \ncontinue to benefit from tax breaks while raking in record profits? Did \nthey not want to debate why members of the OPEC cartel, such as Iran \nand Saudi Arabia, when acting anticompetitively and fixing output so as \nto artificially raise oil prices, should be held accountable through \nlaws intended to protect competition, market forces, and consumers? The \nNOPEC provisions of the bill are drawn from the bill I cosponsored and \nthe Judiciary Committee has reported repeatedly over the last several \nyears, including in May 2007. Or did Republicans not want to debate why \nthe administration has failed to crack down on excessive speculation \nand manipulation of the oil commodities markets?\n  I guess none of us should be surprised that so many Senate \nRepublicans voted to prevent debate over these concerns and this \nlegislation. The Bush-Cheney administration opposes it and has already \nthreatened a veto. Senate Republicans are simply doing what they have \nbeen doing for the last 7 years--falling in line.\n  We need a President who will stand with the American people, not with \nthe oil companies and market speculators. I know that both President \nBush and Vice President Cheney have longstanding ties to the oil \nindustry, but over the last 7\\1/2\\ years, American consumers have \nsuffered enough. This administration has stood by and watched as the \nprice of a gallon of gasoline has gone from $1.45 to over $4.00. I \nwould have thought that an oil man who claims to be from West Texas \nwould recognize that when top executives of the oil industry come \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee and testify under oath that they \nwould make profits if oil were sold anywhere from $55 to $65 a barrel \nbut that it is, in fact, selling for over $130 a barrel, action needs \nto be taken. I would have hoped that the President who promised the \nAmerican people when he ran for office that his family's close ties \nwith the Saudi ruling family would help him successfully persuade them \nto increase oil production and cooperation would recognize that his two \nrecent, unsuccessful trips to the Middle East to beg the Saudis to \nincrease oil production should lead to effective government action by \nthe United States, not a threat to veto legislation. Most of all, I \nwould have hoped that Senators would join together to debate this \nmatter and take action to help the American people.\n  President Bush's ballyhooed statement in his State of the Union a \ncouple of years ago that we must end the oil addiction was nothing more \nthan empty words. They rank with his space travel initiative that went \nnowhere and more tragically with his hollow promise to rebuild New \nOrleans.\n  Their votes against debating the Consumer-First Energy Act ranks with \ntheir votes against debating the bill to correct the Supreme Court's \nLedbetter decision that locked American workers out of the courts, \ntheir votes against debating the restoration of habeas corpus, their \nvotes against debating comprehensive bipartisan legislation to begin to \nconfront global climate change, their vote against debating \ncongressional voting rights for the District of Columbia, and their \nvotes on so many matters that Republican Senators have acted to block. \nI hope that when the majority leader moves for reconsideration of the \nvote on the Consumer-First Energy Act, Senators will search their \nconsciences and do the right thing by voting to allow Senate \nconsideration of that legislation in the best interest of the American \npeople.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nConsumer-First Energy Act, and in particular title V, which would \nincrease oil market transparency and accountability.\n  Oil prices continue to set records. Last week the price of oil hit \n$138 per barrel. Not too long ago $38 seemed like an unheard of price, \nnot $138.\n  Gasoline prices now average above $4 per gallon nationwide. Some gas \nstations have to charge by the half gallon.\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\nTheir pumps cannot calculate in prices this high.\n  And there seems to be no relief in sight for consumers as we enter \nthe summer travel season.\n  Energy markets are not working--and speculation is adding an extra \n$20-$25 per barrel to the price of oil. We must protect these markets \nfrom manipulation, excessive speculation and fraud.\n  In the farm bill Congress finally closed the ``Enron loophole,'' and \nplaced all major electronic trades that could drive energy prices under \nthe watchful eye of the CFTC.\n  However, I remain concerned that there are no comparable protections \nin place when U.S. energy futures are traded on international markets--\npresenting yet another regulatory loophole for energy traders to \nexploit. So title V of this bill would close that loophole and ensure \nthat the trading of all U.S. energy futures--whether on foreign or \ndomestic markets--is done with transparency and with an audit trail.\n  Title V is based upon the Oil Trading Transparency Act, which I \nintroduced recently with Senator Carl Levin.\n  The Oil Trading Transparency Act would close the London loophole, \nwhereby traders of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil execute trades on \nan electronic exchange ``located in'' London, England, outside the \njurisdiction of American regulators.\n  Specifically: the bill directs the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, CFTC, to ensure that any foreign exchange operating a \ntrading terminal in the United States for the trading of a U.S. energy \ncommodity meets two regulatory requirements that currently apply to \nU.S. exchanges: (1) It must impose speculative trading limits to \nprevent price manipulation and excessive speculation, and (2) It must \npublish daily trading information to ensure market transparency.\n  The bill would also require the CFTC to obtain information from the \nforeign exchange to enable it to establish an audit trail and determine \nhow much trading in U.S. energy commodities is due to speculation.\n  Today the CFTC's weekly publication of speculation data for U.S. \nmarkets lacks any information about the oil trading conducted in London \nwhich makes up approximately 30 percent of the trading volume in West \nTexas Intermediate Crude Oil.\n  Let me explain why this provision is necessary. The United States \nplaces limits on speculative energy trades that contribute to high \nprices.\n  But traders of U.S. crude oil know that they can avoid U.S. limits \nand transparency requirements by trading crude oil futures on the \nLondon's ICE Futures Europe instead of the NYMEX exchange in New York.\n  CFTC acknowledged in a June 2 letter to me that traders can even use \nLondon as a refuge from U.S. speculation limits. CFTC's acting chairman \nwrote:\n\n       If CFTC instructed an oil trader to reduce the size of his \n     NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil position, the trader \n     would not be prohibited, under either the [Commodity Exchange \n     Act] or the Commission's regulations, from establishing a \n     similar position in the ICE Futures Europe WTI crude oil \n     contract.\n\n  That regulatory disparity means U.S. traders trading U.S. oil on the \nLondon exchange can engage in excessive speculation that affects U.S. \nprices and not report their trades.\n  The traders can do it by using computer terminals in the United \nStates with direct access to the London exchange. The contracts in \nLondon settle on the price in New York, so they are functionally \nequivalent ``look alike'' contracts.\n  According to CFTC, every single week since 2006 at least one trader \nhas held positions in London above the NYMEX spot month speculative \nlimit of 3 million barrels of oil.\n  Most weeks, five to eight traders have been above these limits, and \nat one point 22 traders were above the NYMEX limit.\n  And its not only contracts in the spot month. Sixty-four percent of \nthe time since 2006, at least one trader in London has exceeded out \nmonth position accountability levels that are set at 20 million barrels \nof oil in New York. CFTC reports that 48 different traders have been \nabove these limits at one time or another since 2006.\n  This legislation is necessary in order to close this loophole and \nrequire that foreign boards of trade that operate trading terminals in \nour country comply with the same speculation trading limits and \nreporting requirements that apply to U.S. trades.\n  What is Traded in London? Trading in London is regulated by the \nBritish, so some might wonder why we would ask our friends in London to \nimpose American regulatory standards.\n  I believe some of London's contracts matter more to America than \nEngland, and we need to make sure they are subject to our position \nlimit system.\n  For example, ICE Futures Europe lists U.S. crude oil--West Texas \nIntermediate--New England heating oil, and U.S. gasoline contracts.\n  West Texas Intermediate crude oil is produced here, used here, and \nnever leaves the United States.\n  Heating oil and gasoline are refined and used within our borders.\n  ICE Futures Europe is a wholly owned subsidiary of an American \ncompany, Atlanta based Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE.\n  Since buying ICE Futures Europe, ICE has shut down the trading floor \nin London and replaced it with a virtual, electronic floor.\n  Their American and British systems are so integrated that trading \n``in London'' recently shut down because an ICE data center in Chicago, \nIL, lost power.\n  And most importantly, British regulators are accountable to the \nBritish people who would naturally prefer that their government use its \nresources to prevent manipulation in markets that affect British \npeople, not Americans.\n  The British only have 80 people monitoring market abuses, \ninvestigating, and enforcing rules in all of their financial markets--\nincluding stocks, bonds, futures, swaps, and currency. Not one of these \n80 people is specifically assigned to monitor trading of West Texas \nIntermediate, American Gasoline, or New England heating oil.\n  This may explain why the CFTC tells me that British regulators are \nyet to bring a single manipulation case against traders in any of the \ncontracts for U.S. delivery.\n  That is why the audit trail established by this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  If CFTC gets trading data from London, it can pursue manipulation and \nfraud cases under their existing authority. But CFTC needs the records. \nIt needs the data to monitor markets that impact the price of energy in \nthe United States.\n  Bottom Line: CFTC needs this legislation in order to protect American \noil markets from manipulation and excessive speculation.\n  In the farm bill we took a major step in closing the Enron loophole. \nIt took us 7 years to close it, and millions of consumers paid the \nprice.\n  This legislation is needed to close a new loophole that opened in \n2006 when ICE Futures Europe began listing a U.S. based energy \ncommodity on its exchange in London. If we vote to pass the Oil Trading \nTransparency Act, we will close the London loophole in only 2 years.\n  Today's markets evolve quickly, and we need to make sure our market \noversight responds just as quickly. Let us not wait 6 years to close a \nloophole so large you could drive an oil tanker through it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, today I stand to recognize Army SGT Eric \nMoser, the son of Ken and Karen Moser of Lake Charles, LA, and to \ncommend his courage and service to our Nation and his brothers in arms.\n  On May 22, 2008, Sergeant Moser was awarded the Distinguished Service \nCross, the U.S. Army's second highest military decoration, making him \none of only nine soldiers to have received this decoration since \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Sergeant Moser, I know how proud your parents are of you, and all of \nLouisiana shares in their pride. Your actions truly exemplify \npatriotism, service to country, and spirit of the Army's famous 82nd \nAirborne Division, a unit that has distinguished itself on countless \noccasions from the beaches of Normandy, the jungles of Vietnam, to the \nsands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan.\n  On August 26, 2007, while serving with the 82nd's Charlie Company, \nSergeant Moser was attached to a sniper team that also included SGT \nJosh Morley of North Carolina, SP Tracy Willis of Texas, and SP Chris \nCorriveau from Maine.\n  The team was tasked with securing a defensive perimeter around a \nblock in Samarra, Iraq, while members of Charlie Company's 3rd Platoon \nconducted search operations on a location that was suspected of being \nused to manufacture improvised explosive devices.\n  Soon after their arrival on their positions, Sergeant Moser and his \nteam found themselves under attack, their presence having been alerted \nto by an al-Qaida informant. Pinned down from fire from multiple \nterrorists, Sergeants Moser and Morley held their positions and \nreturned fire until Sergeant Morley was killed while crossing a \nbuilding rooftop in search of the team's radio.\n  Sergeant Moser and the remaining team members fought off the \ninsurgents who were attempting to make off with Sergeant Morley's body. \nDespite struggling with a weapon that repeatedly jammed, Sergeant Moser \nwas able to return fire and protect Sergeant Morley's body during a \nfirefight that ultimately claimed the life of a second team member, SP \nTracy Willis.\n  The two remaining members of the sniper team, Sergeant Moser and \nSpecialist Corriveau, continued to fight off the terrorists and were \nable to protect the bodies of their fallen comrades. As they \nestablished contact with another Airborne outpost, the insurgents fell \nback and began to retrieve their dead.\n  Sergeant Moser and Specialist Corriveau then directed a GPS-guided \nbomb to the position where the surviving insurgents were hiding. It was \nlater confirmed that more than 15 of an established 40 al-Qaida \nterrorists were killed during the fight.\n  We honor Sergeant Morley and Specialist Willis for their ultimate \nsacrifice, and we pay tribute to their families. SGT Josh Morley is \nsurvived by his wife, his family, and a daughter whom he never had the \nchance to meet. And SP Tracy Willis leaves behind a loving family of \nhis own.\n  We also honor SP Chris Corriveau for his heroism. He was also awarded \nthe Distinguished Service Cross for his gallantry on August 26, 2007. \nHis actions also exemplify that of a hero and a paratrooper.\n  In the face of death and without regard to his personal safety, \nSergeant Moser brought great distinction on himself, the U.S. Army, and \nthe 82nd Airborne Division. I am sure he would be hesitant to \nacknowledge himself as a hero, and he does not need to do so. His \nactions distinguished him as such when on a rooftop in Iraq, he risked \nhis own life to ensure that no man was left behind.\n  Sergeant Moser, thank you for your service and heroism and God bless \nyou and your entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5518-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BETSY REIFSNYDER\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Betsy \nReifsnyder, a dedicated public servant who is retiring in July after \nnearly 25 years of service to the U.S. Congress.\n  Ms. Reifsnyder came to the Library of Congress in 1984 as part of an \nintern program and then moved on to the Congressional Research Service \nin 1985 as a reference librarian. She has worked in a number of \nchallenging roles, and will retire as the data architect of the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  Throughout her years at CRS, Ms. Reifsnyder has performed complex and \ninstitution-supporting duties. Her leadership, sound judgment, and \ncreative work, coupled with her technical expertise and her positive \napproach to any project or problem were keys to the early and continued \nsuccess of the Legislative Information System, LIS. Her dedication and \nability to find solutions have earned her a trust, and confidence, that \nechoes throughout the legislative branch.\n  An expert in the legislative process, data structures, and online \nsearch systems, she was instrumental in moving legislative data into \nthe Internet age. Ms. Reifsnyder has played an active role in the \ndevelopment of improvements and advanced features for LIS retrieval and \ndisplay to meet the needs of congressional staff.\n  Both Congress and the general public have benefited greatly from her \nwork on the THOMAS and LIS, systems which have allowed access to \nreliable and timely legislative information. Congressional Members and \nstaff will continue to benefit from her work, due to her major \ncontributions to the plans for LIS 2.0. Her vision and leadership have \nshaped the data-entry system for legislative summaries and other \nresources that have made it easier for all of us to have access to \nreliable legislative information.\n  Although, Betsy Reifsnyder will be retiring, her many accomplishments \nwill stand as a fitting tribute to her career and her person. Ms. \nReifsnyder's presence will be greatly missed, and I wish her and her \nfamily all the best as she enters the next phase of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5518-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5518-S5519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS RESEARCH, CURE, AND CARE ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 1459, the \nPsoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2007, \nand to encourage my colleagues to lend their support to this important \nlegislation. Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, painful, and \ndebilitating disease that affects as many as seven and a half million \nAmericans. Ten to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also suffer from \npsoriatic arthritis, which causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and \naround the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that in \nthe state of Connecticut as many as 89,000 adults live with psoriasis, \npsoriatic arthritis, or both.\n  No one knows exactly what causes psoriasis. With very few effective \ntreatments and no cure, this disabling disease often strikes between \nage 15-25, marking the beginning of a lifelong struggle for psoriasis \nsufferers. Psoriasis is often minimized and undertreated because \ntreatments are considered ``not medically necessary'' or ``cosmetic''. \nIf a patient is accurately diagnosed, the search for an appropriate \ntreatment can prove exasperating because treatments vary widely in \neffectiveness, can have serious adverse side effects, and can stop \nworking without warning.\n  Often misunderstood to be contagious or due to poor hygiene, \npsoriasis causes many patients to experience social discrimination and \nstigma. Studies have shown that psoriasis causes as much disability as \nother major medical diseases. In fact, lost productivity and forgone \nfuture earnings create an estimated burden of $114 million annually for \nAmericans with psoriasis.\n  Unfortunately, research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has not \nbeen made the priority it should be. S. 1459 would direct the National \nInstitute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases to expand \nbiomedical research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to \ncoordinate research efforts across the NIH. The bill would also direct \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a national \npatient registry for collection and analysis of longitudinal data on \npsoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Without such a resource, we will \nremain limited in our ability to evaluate the usefulness--and side \neffects--of the therapies that patients must endure throughout their \nlifetimes.\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n  Those suffering with psoriasis are also at an increased risk for \nnumerous other serious, chronic and life-threatening conditions such as \nheart disease, diabetes and mental health conditions. These co-\nmorbidities inflict a significant economic and social burden on society \nin addition to the individuals with psoriasis. This legislation would \ndirect the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene a summit \nof researchers, public health professionals, patient advocacy \norganizations, academic institutions, and Federal and State \npolicymakers on the current research, treatment, education, and \nquality-of-life activities conducted or supported by the Federal \nGovernment with respect to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, including \npsoriasis and psoriatic arthritis related co-morbidities. A \ncomprehensive report from this summit would provide a roadmap for \nfuture activities necessary to address current gaps and better our \nchances of finding a cure. Lastly, the bill would require a study and \nreport by the Institute of Medicine to address health insurance and \nprescription drug coverage as they relate to medications and treatments \nfor psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We must ensure that these \npatients receive the best regimen and most appropriate care for their \ndisease.\n  In closing, I would like to commend the National Psoriasis Foundation \nfor their more than four decades of leadership and work to improve \nquality of life for people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I \nwould also like to extend great thanks to my constituents, John and \nVivian Latella, who have shared their personal stories of the \ndifficulties of living with psoriasis. For them, and for the millions \nof Americans suffering from this disease, I urge my colleagues to join \nme in cosponsoring the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, \nCure, and Care Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5519-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 PAXIL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for the last few years, I have been \nlooking at how drug companies try and influence medical care in \nAmerica. Companies can do this by, for example, creating studies \nfavorable to their drugs, by hiring doctors to promote their products, \nand in some cases even intimidating critics of their drugs.\n  Today, I would like to talk about a different tactic by drug \ncompanies hiding data. I don't mean that they actually hide the data. \nBut they make these numbers so difficult to find that they might as \nwell be invisible.\n  Last February, I asked GlaxoSmithKline to turn over a couple of \nreports on Paxil, a drug used to treat depression. These reports were \nwritten by Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard.\n  Based on the review of documents uncovered in litigation, Dr. \nGlenmullen concluded that GlaxoSmithKline knew for almost two decades \nthat Paxil is associated with an increased risk of suicide. He \nsubmitted these reports as an expert witness in several lawsuits now \npending around the country.\n  So what did GlaxoSmithKline do with these reports? Well, the company \ntried to hide them. They went to the judge and asked to have Dr. \nGlenmullen's report and all the confirming documents placed under \nseal--that means that no member of the public could see them. In fact, \nGlaxo has been doing everything possible to ensure that this \ninformation remains under court seal.\n  It seems to me that GlaxoSmithKline tried to hide these reports \nbecause they seem to demonstrate what the company knew--that Paxil was \nassociated with an increased risk of suicide based on the company's own \nstudies. In fact, Dr. Glenmullen argues that GlaxoSmithKline knew this \nwhen they submitted the New Drug Application to the Food and Drug \nAdministration back in 1989.\n  Essentially, it looks like GlaxoSmithKline bamboozled the FDA.\n  How did GlaxoSmithKline get away with this? Easy, they just moved \naround numbers in their studies to make it look like Paxil was safe. \nHere is how Dr. Glenmullen says they did it. GlaxoSmithKline ran \nseveral studies comparing people on Paxil against people on a placebo, \nin other words, a sugar pill.\n  If a patient attempted suicide before a study began--let me emphasize \nthis: Before the study began--that person was automatically put into \nthe placebo group. That means the company was comparing Paxil users \nagainst patients who were already prone to suicide. So when you \ncompared the placebo numbers to the Paxil numbers, it looked like Paxil \nwas the same as the placebo.\n  But, when Dr. Glenmullen re-analyzed the data, he found that Paxil \nWAS associated with a risk for suicide. And it looks like this is what \nGlaxoSmithKline was trying to hide from the American public.\n  Thankfully, a judge in Kansas made one of Dr. Glenmullen's reports \npublic.\n  Finally, I would like to address GlaxoSmithKline's responses to my \nquestions about whether it hid data on Paxil. I am unhappy to say that \nGlaxo's answers were a little more than word games. I don't wish to use \nthe word ``lie'' but let me say this: their answers were less than \ncandid.\n  Let me give you one example. In a letter to GlaxoSmithKline, I asked \nthem when they learned that Paxil was associated with suicide risk. \nThey wrote back that they ``detected no signal of any possible \nassociation between Paxil and suicidality in adult patients until late \nFebruary 2006 . . .''\n  So GSK claims to a U.S. Senator they knew nothing about suicidality \nin adults until February 2006. But in the United Kingdom, government \ninvestigators found that the company had the data back in 1998.\n  Two weeks after I received the letter from GSK, England's Medicines \nand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency released a report on Paxil.\n  The report concluded that data from GlaxoSmithKline's own clinical \ntrials confirmed that patients under 18 had a higher risk of suicidal \nbehavior. This report involved 4 years of investigation by this agency \nwhich is England's counterpart to our FDA. It was the largest most \nthorough report in the history of that agency.\n  According to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, \nthe only reason that criminal charges were not filed in the UK is \nbecause ``the legislation in force at the time was not sufficiently \nstrong enough . . .'' So the company didn't get off because it didn't \ndo anything wrong. It got off because the laws in UK did not address \nsuch situations.\n  Today, I am asking the FDA to take a look at the same information \nthat was examined in the UK. And I am asking the FDA if we need to \nchange any laws here in the United States.\n  We cannot live in a nation where drug companies are less than candid, \nhide information and attempt to mislead the FDA and the public. These \ncompanies are selling drugs that we put in our bodies, not sneakers. \nWhen they manipulate or withhold data to hide or minimize findings \nabout safety and/or efficacy, they put patient safety at risk.

If a company knowingly \nviolates those certifications, it could be subject to civil and \npossibly criminal penalties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5519-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5519-S5520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEUROFIBROMATOSIS AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I rise today to highlight the \ndifficulties caused by neurofibromatosis, NF, the work currently being \ndone by the Federal Government to address this difficult disease, and \nthe importance of awareness about NF.\n  NF is a genetic disorder of the nervous system, which causes tumors \nto form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. NF is a \nprogressive disorder and is one of the most common genetic disorders in \nthe United\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nStates. An estimated 100,000 Americans have a neurofibromatosis \ndisorder. About half of those affected with NF have a prior family \nhistory of the disease.\n  NF has two distinct forms, NF1 and NF2. NF1 is the more common \nversion, occurring in 1 of nearly every 4,000 individuals in the U.S. \nIt has varying manifestations and degrees of severity resulting from a \nmutation of the NFI gene. Symptoms include common skin abnormalities \nand are often evident at birth or shortly afterwards. NF1 can cause \nlearning disorders, bone deformities, and may even be associated with \ncancer. NF2 is a much more rare condition, resulting from a mutation of \nthe NF2 gene, that is most frequently associated with hearing loss and \nvisual impairment.\n  The National Institutes of Health, NIH, supports critical research to \nfight NF, investing approximately $13 million a year. At NIH, the $1.5 \nbillion National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, \nsupports research and clinical trials to understand normal and abnormal \ndevelopment of the brain and nervous system to improve our \nunderstanding of the disease and our ability to prevent, treat, and \nultimately cure the NF disorders. Researchers have been able to locate \nthe exact NF1 gene, which they found normally works as a ``molecular \nbrake'' to keep cells from overmultiplying, and the NF2 gene, which \nthey found normally helps suppress tumors. It is the mutations of these \ngenes that cause the difficulties associated with NF. According to \nNINDS:\n\n       Understanding the molecular pathways and mechanisms that \n     govern these key proteins and their activities will offer \n     scientists exciting opportunities to design drugs that could \n     replace the missing proteins in people who have \n     neurofibromatosis and return their cell production to normal.\n\n  NINDS is currently researching how NF1 can also cause abnormal fetal \ndevelopment that can cause learning disabilities and cognitive deficits \nfor children. NINDS also supports research aimed at developing improved \nmethods of diagnosing NF and identifying factors that cause the wide \nvariations of symptoms and severity of the disorders.\n  As a practicing physician, I am encouraged that NINDS is performing \nresearch to help doctors equip parents for their child's education by \npinpointing associations between brain abnormalities and specific \ncognitive disabilities. This will help parents to develop and implement \nearly intervention programs.\n  Having treated patients with NF, I know firsthand the pain and \nsuffering associated with the disease and the difficulties it can cause \nfor parents. The ongoing Federal research activities though NIH are \ncritical toward fighting NF. I also applaud the tremendous efforts of \nprivate foundations and the thousands of NF volunteers and advocates \nacross the country. It is my sincere hope that public-private \npartnerships will continue to provide medical breakthroughs that can \nprevent, treat, and cure NF and other painful diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5520-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HONORING JACKLYN H. LUCAS\n\n Mr. BURR. Madam President, I wish to honor the life of Jacklyn \nHarrell Lucas. Mr. Lucas was born in Plymouth, NC, to Louis Harold and \nMargaret Lucas on February 24, 1928. He was in the eighth grade at \nEdwards Military Institute when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Lucas \nfelt an obligation to serve the country and refused to let age get in \nhis way.\n  Ten months after Pearl Harbor, Jack Lucas joined the Marine Corps \nReserve at the age of 14. He listed his age as 17 and joined without \nhis mother's consent. Lucas soon reported to Parris Island for basic \ntraining, where he qualified as a sharpshooter.\n  He was assigned to a machine gun crew and moved to Pearl Harbor at \nthe end of 1943 where he was promoted to PVT first class. A year later, \nLucas and his unit had not been deployed, so Lucas decided to deploy \nhimself. He stowed away on the USS Duel, which was carrying the 5th \nMarine Division to battle in the Pacific.\n  A month into the journey he came out of hiding. Despite being \nreported as AWOL a month earlier and having been reduced in rank, PVT \nJack Lucas was assigned to the 5th Marine Division. He was assigned to \na rifle team and longed to get into the fight.\n  On February 19, 1945, Lucas finally got his wish as he and 30,000 \nother marines stormed the beaches of Iwo Jima. On the second day of the \ninvasion, Lucas was pinned down with three members of his rifle team \nwhen two grenades landed in their foxhole.\n  His Medal of Honor citation describes best what happened next. \nPrivate Lucas ``unhesitatingly hurled himself over his comrades upon \none grenade and pulled the other one under him, absorbing the whole \nblasting force of the explosions in his own body in order to shield his \ncompanions from the concussion and murderous flying fragments.'' He \nsaved the lives of his fellow marines by an act that would almost \nsurely result in death, but Lucas survived.\n  Seven months and twenty-one surgeries later, Lucas was medically \ndischarged from the Marine Corps. He left the service with over 200 \npieces of shrapnel in his body. A month later he was awarded the Medal \nof Honor. Private Lucas was only 17 years old. He was one of 27 marines \ngiven the medal for their heroic actions at Iwo Jima. Eight-two marines \nwere awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II, and almost a third \nreceived the medal for their heroism during this historic battle. Lucas \nis the youngest person ever to receive this Nation's highest military \nhonor.\n  This Nation lost one of its best on June 5, when Jacklyn Harrell \nLucas succumbed to cancer. He is survived by his wife Ruby C. Clark \nLucas; 4 sons--William, Jimmy, Louis, and Kelly; a daughter, Peggy; 3 \nstepdaughters, Joan, Debbie, and Melinda; a brother, Louis; 15 \ngrandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.\n  Madam President, the determination, patriotism, and selflessness of \nJack Lucas should be admired by all. He was a fine North Carolinian and \na great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5520-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING HORACE P. AXTELL\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I am pleased to recognize an \nextraordinary honor bestowed upon Horace P. Axtell, elder of the \nNimiipu, more commonly known as the Nez Perce Tribe. Horace is a 2008 \nrecipient of the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA, National \nHeritage Fellowship, an annual fellowship that honors American folk \nartists for contributions to American culture. The highest federal \nhonor in the folk and traditional arts, only 10 NEA National Heritage \nFellowships are awarded every year.\n  Horace is a Nez Perce tribal historian, storyteller, singer and drum \nmaker. In fact, he is a spiritual leader of the Seven-Drum religion, a \ntraditional religion of the tribes of the plateau region that requires \npractitioners to memorize songs and accompany them on handmade drums. \nHe still builds these drums in the traditional way, curing hides and \nstretching them over wooden frames. Spending his youth listening to \nstories of the tribal elders, some of whom survived the 1877 war \nagainst the Nez Perce by the United States, Horace is now a respected \nelder himself and a pipe carrier for his tribe, a position of great \nhonor. He is the author of a memoir, the first one printed in over half \na century by a Nez Perce elder. He has received numerous awards \nincluding the President's Medallion from the University of Idaho, an \nhonorary doctorate from Lewis-Clark State College and the Washington \nState Historical Society Peace and Friendship Award.\n  It is an honor for me to publicly recognize the remarkable \nachievements of Horace P. Axtell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5520-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5520-S5521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              300TH ANNIVERSARY OF RIDGEFIELD, CONNECTICUT\n\n Mr. DODD. Madam President, today I recognize a significant \nmilestone for one of the towns in my home State of Connecticut. This \nyear, the town of Ridgefield is celebrating the 300th anniversary of \nits founding.\n  Ridgefield's heritage dates back to the founding of this country and \nthe American Revolution. A small militia force led by Generals David \nWooster and Benedict Arnold faced off here against a larger British \nforce at the Battle of Ridgefield on April 27, 1777. Whether it's the \ngraves of the soldiers\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\non both sides of the conflict who were killed and are now buried \ntogether in a cemetery on Main Street, or the cannon ball that remains \nlodged into the side of the Keeler Tavern, landmarks of this battle can \nstill be found throughout Ridgefield.\n  This beautiful colonial town of approximately 24,000 people has \nhistorically been known as a farming community. Today it is regularly \nrecognized not only for the high quality of its schools and tranquility \nbut for its world class restaurants and inns. Considered right after \nWorld War II as a potential location for the United Nations secretariat \nbuilding, Ridgefield has managed to retain its small town, New England \ncharm to this day.\n  The residents of Ridgefield are rightfully proud of the town's rich \ncultural and agricultural heritage and have organized a number of \nactivities to celebrate this momentous occasion. I ask my colleagues to \njoin with me in congratulating my many friends among the good people of \nRidgefield as they gather this year to celebrate their town's three \ncenturies of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5521-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR SCHUT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to take this time to \nrecognize Arthur J. Schut, a fellow Iowan who has dedicated more than \n30 years of his life to serving the disfranchised in Iowa communities \nwith his care, counsel and work to help individuals struggling with \nsubstance abuse. Arthur Schut, or Art as many people know him, has gone \nabove and beyond the call of duty, devoting his life to substance abuse \ntreatment in Iowa. And I would like to wish him all the best in his \nfuture endeavors as he moves on from Iowa to continue his efforts in \nother parts of the country.\n  Art has worked tirelessly to provide substance abuse care and council \nthroughout the State of Iowa. He has fought to minimize the negative \nstigma surrounding those struggling to overcome their substance abuse \nby educating families, lawmakers, and the public. He has worked with \ngreat effort towards securing funding and resources for those with \naddiction and mental health issues. His deep passion for his vocation \nhas led him to travel all across our great State and Nation for his \ncause, fighting on a local, State, and national level.\n  Art earned his psychology degree from Central College in Pella, IA, \nand obtained his master's in clinical psychology from the State \nUniversity of New York at Albany. After obtaining his degrees, he \ndevoted all his time to administering substance abuse care throughout \nIowa. He has held positions as treatment director, clinical director, \nchild psychologist, and community programming director in substance \nabuse agencies. He served as adjunct faculty at the University of Iowa, \nwhere he gave guest lectures and taught substance abuse courses. He \nadministers agency operations and programs in three regions of Iowa \nincluding outpatient offices in 16 Iowa counties, a prevention unit, an \nemployee assistance program, residential treatment programs and a \ndetoxification unit. In addition, Art has been the president and chief \nexecutive officer of the Mid-Eastern Council on Chemical Abuse, MECCA, \nin Iowa City and Des Moines for the past 16 years.\n  It is clear that Art Schut has a deep passion for treating and \nsupporting those who struggle with substance abuse and deserves our \nrecognition. His dedication and perseverance to his cause deserve \nimmense respect and honor. Art will be deeply missed. He is an amazing \nrole model, not only for his humanitarian efforts, but for his passion \nand zeal that can be seen in his devotion to his work.\n  Iowa is losing a great leader, but we can rest assured that Art's \ncommitment to his cause will never waver and he will continue to make \nleaps and bounds to provide substance abuse care and treatment no \nmatter what obstacles may stand in his way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5521-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING HONOR GROUNDS LLC\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I celebrate an inventive \nMaine small business that is helping to support our country's National \nGuard and Reservist families. Honor Grounds LLC distributes its own \nbrand of high-quality coffee to convenience stores and supermarkets, \nand a portion of the sales go to helping some of our country's most \ndeserving citizens.\n  Honor Grounds LLC is an enormously innovative project of Dan \nBoudreau, who is a longtime coffee distributor, as well as Catherine \nand John Salterio, principals at Consolidated Services, a beverage \ndistribution consulting firm in Minot. Several years ago, Mr. Boudreau, \nwho is a Maine Army National Guard veteran himself, sought a unique \navenue to give back to the Guard. Mr. Boudreau, together with the \nSalterios, developed a program to sell specially packaged Honor Grounds \ncoffee and to donate some of the profits to assist military families.\n  They launched the company earlier this year and report that retailers \nhave demonstrated immense support for the initiative. In fact, \nHannaford Brothers, one of the supermarket chains participating in the \nprogram, generously waived its usual stocking fee for Honor Grounds in \nrecognition of the program's significance. They offer three military-\nthemed flavors of coffee--Reveille Dark, Five Star Joe, and D-Day \nDecaf.\n  All donated proceeds from Honor Grounds go specifically to The \nPatriot Fund, which was designed to concentrate money in the hands of \ngroups that aid America's military personnel and their families. \nAlready, Honor Grounds has succeeded in funding several organizations \nnationwide, including the Maine Department of Veterans Affairs, as well \nas Tee It Up For The Troops, a golf fundraising nonprofit that supports \nthe families of disabled and fallen servicemembers.\n  Honor Grounds coffee consists of choice 100 percent roasted Arabica \nbeans, which translates to an exceptional cup of coffee. But more \nnotably, each bag of Honor Grounds coffee includes the story of a \nmember of the National Guard or Reserves. Each biography details the \nlife of one of our Nation's defenders, the heroes among us. More than \njust a nice touch, these narratives provide a link between soldier and \ncivilian, which makes the purchase of Honor Grounds coffee all the more \nmeaningful.\n  To expand the scope of its reach, supplement its retail sales, and \nultimately generate more funds for the Nation's military families, \nHonor Grounds recently implemented a fundraising partnership program. \nSchools, veterans and civic organizations, as well as other groups sell \nHonor Grounds coffee with their association's logo on the box, thereby \npromoting both the group and Honor Grounds. Notably, Honor Grounds \ndonates an extra $1.50 to that club's home State military families for \neach box sold.\n  Honor Grounds is not only a patriotic small business, but it also \nrepresents a truly creative approach to bolstering our Nation's support \nof those who serve. With the motto of ``Helping Military Members and \nTheir Families, One Cup at a Time,'' Honor Grounds is seeking to \nreinvigorate the gratitude our country's finest citizens have earned. I \nthank Mr. Boudreau and the Salterios for their selfless efforts, and \nwish them continued success in their magnificent achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5521-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5521-S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LELAND ROBICHAUX\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge Councilman \nLeland Robichaux of Houma for his dedicated service to Louisiana and \nthe United States of America. I would like to take some time to make a \nfew remarks on his accomplishments.\n  Mr. Robichaux started his career in oilfield services in 1964, \ntraveling the world with his family as a result. He helped found the \nSouth Central Industrial Association 10 years ago, serving as the \nbusiness organization's president from 2003 to 2004. Also active from \nthe beginning in membership initiatives and infrastructure issues, he \nearned the SCIA's Tillman Esteve Award last year for his contributions. \nOutside his job as a salesman for Oil States, an offshore oil-and-gas \nmanufacturer, he traveled annually with the Houma-Terrebonne Chamber of \nCommerce to Washington, DC, to lobby for hurricane protection for the \npast 8 years.\n  Mr. Robichaux was elected to the Terrebonne Parish Council District 6 \nseat last fall. He represented the parishes of southwest Terrebonne, \nDonner, Gibson, parts of Bayou Black and\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\nneighborhoods between La. 311 and Bayou Black Drive. The week before he \nwas sworn into office, Mr. Robichaux learned he had two tumors on his \nbrain, caused by cancer that started in his lungs. Despite his illness, \nhe continued to serve his constituents and was open about his cancer \ndiagnosis, and when asked about his progress, he shared information \nabout his treatments and his determination to press on.\n  Leland Robichaux passed away Sunday, June 1. In his roughly 4 months \non the council, he helped work on coastal-restoration and levee \nprojects. He is survived by not only family members but also the \ngrateful city of Houma and council who have lost a great man and great \nleader.\n  Thus, today, I rise to honor a fellow Louisianan, Leland Robichaux, \nand thank him and his family for his dedicated service to our State and \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5522-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 254.

A bill to reauthorize the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act and the \nRandolph-Sheppard Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Javits-Wagner-\nO'Day and Randolph-Sheppard Modernization Act of 2008. This legislation \nwas drafted after thousands of hours were spent listening to the \nconcerns of persons with disabilities and other affected parties.\n  The Randolph-Sheppard Act, enacted in 1936, gives persons who are \nlegally blind training, support and contracting priority to fulfill \ncertain Government food service contracts.\n  The Wagner-O'Day Act, enacted in 1938, required the Federal \nGovernment to make certain commodities purchases from organizations, 75 \npercent of whose direct laborers were blind. In 1971, Senator Jacob \nJavits fought to include individuals with other severe disabilities in \nthe law. The amended law--the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act--now requires the \nFederal Government to purchase over 11,000 commodities from \norganizations, 75 percent of whose workers have a severe disability.\n  Javits-Wagner-O'Day and Randolph-Sheppard are the two main Federal \nemployment and training programs for persons with significant \ndisabilities. Congress has paid them little attention, and has not \nrevised them, since their creation.\n  Beginning in 2003, Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD stakeholders approached \nCongress to seek our attention and help. Each group complained the \nother was getting too big a share of lucrative military dining \ncontracts.\n  In 2003 and 2004, the offices of Senators Gregg, Kennedy, Ensign and \nDodd tried to informally mediate. Neither the blind vendors nor the \nJWOD vendors would budge. The dispute intensified in the courts and in \nCongress, with each side accusing the other of waste, fraud and abuse.\n  When I assumed the chairmanship of the HELP Committee in 2005, I \ndecided to honor the stakeholders' longstanding request, and \ninvestigate their claims. My staff's initial findings were troubling, \nso I worked with my good friend Senator Kennedy to hold a bipartisan \noversight hearing.\n  Our hearing, in October 2005, documented several troubling facts. \nFirst and foremost, we discovered that the programs had produced bad \nquantitative results for persons with disabilities. There are about 15 \nmillion unemployed persons with disabilities between the ages of 16 and \n64. Javits-Wagner-O'Day and Randolph-Sheppard together had created only \nabout 48,000 jobs. Clearly we can--and must--do much better.\n  Second, the programs had stayed the same while the law, technology, \ncommercial customs and social norms had changed dramatically over the \npast decades. Since JWOD was enacted, Congress, through the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, ADA, Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA and Rehabilitation Act reauthorizations of 1992 and 1998, had \nmandated equal access, inclusion, choice, anti-discrimination and \ncontrol by individuals with disabilities over their own lives. The \nSupreme Court in its Olmstead decision held that the unnecessary \nsegregation of individuals with disabilities was an impermissible form \nof discrimination. Corporate good citizens such as Marriott had taken a \nleadership role in\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\nthe community to employ persons with severe disabilities in integrated \nwork settings. New technologies made it possible for persons who were \nlegally blind to use the Internet. These and countless other examples \nhighlight how Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD had become ancient statutes. \nThe world had changed dramatically since 1971. Persons \nwith disabilities needed and deserved better treatment than the law was \nproviding.\n\n  Third, regulatory neglect had given rise to waste, fraud and abuse. \nThe Randolph-Sheppard program was supposed to create good jobs and \nincreased opportunities for the many persons who are blind. Instead, we \nfound that 38 blind vendors were taking the lion's share of profits \nfrom huge military cafeteria contracts with an approximate total dollar \nvalue of $1.203 billion. Just as troublesome was the fact that less \nthan 5 percent of the employees hired to fulfill those contracts were \nactually blind. In addition, we found nonprofit executives were using \nJWOD to exploit persons with disabilities for improper financial gain. \nThe FBI and other Federal law enforcement officials raided a Texas JWOD \nnonprofit and discovered some shocking abuses that underscored the need \nfor Congress to act.\n  In 2006, I worked with Senators Kennedy, Ensign, Dodd, Burr, Clinton, \nIsakson, Reed, Hatch, Harkin, Roberts, Mikulski, Coburn, Bingaman, \nCollins, and Obama to develop solutions to these problems. The HELP \nCommittee staff spent thousands of hours meeting with hundreds of \nstakeholders, and listening to their ideas about how to fix these \nprograms. Then we drafted this legislation.\n  In 2007, the momentum we had set in motion for a reauthorization bill \nstalled and other priorities began to take precedence. I continued to \ntalk to and work with all of the stakeholders we could find, including \nthose representing small business.\n  Recent events put these issues back on the front burner where they \nbelong. On April 15, the Department of Defense and Department of \nEducation Inspectors General collaborated on a report, ``Assessment of \nContracting With Blind Vendors and Employers of Persons Who Are Blind \nor Have Other Severe Disabilities.'' In addition, the Committee for \nPurchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled--the principal \nregulator of the JWOD program--proposed modest tweaks to its \nauthorizing statute. I sincerely applaud the Committee for their hard \nwork in coming up with consensus fixes, but its proposal does not go \nnearly far enough.\n  As an alternative, I have updated the bill that the bipartisan HELP \nCommittee produced in collaboration with stakeholder groups in 2006. It \nfulfills the promise I made to the disability community to try to solve \nthe problems we found. The bill vitalizes and expands both programs. It \ncreates much more flexibility to provide real job training and real \nskill development so persons with disabilities can develop marketable \nskills and make meaningful career choices. The bill also empowers a \nstrong regulator to police both programs and make sure workers are no \nlonger exploited.\n  Finally, I have tried to stay out of the military dining facility \ndebate for years. But it has become a significant distraction to our \nmilitary. Accordingly, this bill establishes an even playing field in a \nway that will be clear and easy for the military to administer and \nparticipants in the process to understand.\n  Our main goal here is to create more and better jobs for persons with \ndisabilities. My bill moves us in the direction Congress should take to \nmodify these two important programs. I look forward to continued \ndiscussions with my colleagues and the stakeholders on all these \nissues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Sununu, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Burr, Mr. Ensign, and \n        Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 3118. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to preserve beneficiary access to care by preventing a reduction in \nthe Medicare physician fee schedule, to improve the quality of care by \nadvancing value based purchasing, electronic health records, and \nelectronic prescribing, and to maintain and improve access to care in \nrural areas, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nPreserving Access to Medicare Act of 2008.\n  If we do not act very quickly, the physicians who treat Medicare \npatients will face a 10.6 percent pay cut, effective July 1.\n  It is not in the best interest of America's seniors who depend on \nMedicare for their doctors to take such a significant cut.\n  Such a dramatic cut will affect access that seniors have to their \ndoctors.\n  The bill we are introducing today provides a 0.5 percent physician \nupdate for the remainder of 2008 and a 1.1 percent update for 2009.\n  This increase is identical to the one the majority is looking to \nproceed to tomorrow.\n  Preserving access to health care for Medicare beneficiaries is a \nfirst priority, but it is not the only thing we are accomplishing in \nthis bill.\n  The bill will also improve the quality of care in Medicare. It \nincreases the physician quality reporting bonus from 1.5 percent to 2 \npercent for 2009 and 2010.\n  The bill retains the Physician Assistance and Quality Improvement \n(PAQI) fund to specifically help avert future physician cuts.\n  It promotes value-based purchasing, e-prescribing, and electronic \nhealth records.\n  It includes a responsible rural package, including a rural home \nhealth add-on payment.\n  It returns the ownership of oxygen equipment to the supplier, not the \nbeneficiary.\n  The bill extends section 1011 of the Medicare Modernization Act for \ntwo years at a total of $400 million.\n  It phases out the duplicative Indirect Medical Education payments \nfrom Medicare Advantage.\n  The bill makes reforms to Medicare Advantage marketing practices to \ncurb abusive activities. It requires all MA plans to report on quality.\n  I also want to devote a moment to what the bill we are introducing \ntoday does not do.\n  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill \nwe are introducing today does not make cuts to payments for power \nwheelchairs.\n  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill \nwe are introducing today does not reduce payments for oxygen.\n  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill \nwe are introducing today does not make large, unwarranted cuts to \nMedicare Advantage, altering policy decisions designed to maximize \npatient choice.\n  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill \nwe are introducing today does not eliminate the PAQI fund, which \nCongress specifically created to help avert future physician cuts.\n  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill \nwe are introducing today does not expand eligibility for low-income \nMedicare programs, which would increase long-term entitlement spending \nand expand coverage under an already unsustainable program.\n  While well intentioned, this is not the right time for entitlement \nexpansions like this.\n  The Medicare program is headed for a fiscal crisis that demands \ncomprehensive reform.\n  Many would also like to add income-relating Part D subsidies to this \nbill as well. That change would make high income seniors shoulder a \ngreater share of their Part D premium just like already happens today \nwith premiums under Part B of Medicare.\n  These kind of changes need to be done. The other side has told us \nthat they cannot support increasing premiums on high income seniors in \norder to provide greater assistance to lower income seniors.\n  Many on our side are disappointed by their position.\n  So it seems we will need to reserve those reforms on premiums until \nwe are working on comprehensive Medicare reform in some future bill.\n  Finally, let me turn to the most critical difference between the bill \nwe are introducing today and the bill the majority wants to proceed to \ntomorrow.\n  The bill we are introducing today can be signed into law. The \nPresident will sign our bill.\n  The bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow--if it somehow \nwere\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nto make it to the President's desk--will be vetoed.\n  Republicans were not the ones that walked away from the negotiations \nand put a timely outcome of this effort in jeopardy.\n  I am ready to sit down on a bipartisan basis to find a compromise \nthat protects seniors' access to Medicare and that can be signed into \nlaw.\n  Today we are introducing a bill that accomplishes that.\n  Tomorrow we are voting to proceed to a bill that does not.\n  I hope we can move beyond this political exercise soon to accomplish \nwhat seniors are counting on us to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Preserving Access to Medicare Act of 2008\n\n                     TITLE I--MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS\n\nSubtitle A--Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act of 2008\n\n\n  Sec. 101.

The \n     Secretary would determine the applicable percentage increase \n     using a linear sliding scale ranging from 25 percent for low-\n     volume hospitals below a certain threshold to no adjustment \n     for hospitals with greater than 2,000 discharges of \n     individuals with Medicare Part A benefits.\n\n\n   Section 102.

Rebasing for Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs)\n\n       Starting for discharges on January 1, 2009, SCHs would be \n     able to elect payment based on their FY2006 hospital-specific \n     payment amount per discharge.\n\n\n     Section 106. Extension and Expansion of the Medicare Hospital \nOutpatient Department Hold Harmless Provision for Small Rural Hospitals\n\n       The provision would establish that in CY 2009, small rural \n     hospitals, including Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole \n     Community Hospitals under 100 beds, would receive 85 percent \n     of the difference between payments made under the Medicare \n     Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System and those made \n     under the prior reimbursement system.\n\n\n  Section 107. Clarification of Payment for Clinical Laboratory Tests \n             Furnished by Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs)\n\n       Under this provision, clinical diagnostic laboratory \n     services furnished by a CAH starting in July 1, 2009 would be \n     reimbursed at 101 percent of costs as outpatient hospital \n     services without regard to whether the specimen was collected \n     from a patient of the CAH so long as the individual from whom \n     the specimen was collected was in the same county as the CAH.\n\n\n              Section 108.

MedPAC Study and Report on Medicare Advantage Payments\n\n       Instructs MedPAC to study and report to Congress on ways to \n     reimburse Medicare Advantage plans that do not rely on \n     county-level Medicare payment area equivalents.\n\n\n  Section 167.

HONORING FRANK WOODRUFF BUCKLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In recognition of the historic \n     contributions of United States veterans who served in the \n     First World War, Frank Woodruff Buckles, the last surviving \n     United States veteran of the First World War, shall be \n     permitted to lie in honor in the rotunda of the Capitol upon \n     his death, so that the citizens of the United States may pay \n     their last respects to this great American.\n       (b) Implementation.--The Architect of the Capitol, under \n     the direction and supervision of the President pro tempore of \n     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     shall take the necessary steps to implement subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce \na resolution honoring the last surviving member of a heroic group, the \nAmerican World War I veterans. When the U.S. entered the First World \nWar in 1917, 4.7 million Americans donned a military uniform and fought \nwith the Allies struggling in an imperialistic battle of trench \nwarfare. Now, 90 years after America's entry into the war, only one \nveteran remains.\n  Corporal Frank Woodruff Buckles, born in 1901, was sent to England \nand France during the First World War after exaggerating his age on \nArmy paperwork. Eager to join the action, Buckles trained in the \nambulance services and acted as a driver, remaining\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nafter the armistice to escort prisoners of war back to Germany.\n  Mr. Buckles now stands as the last representation of the Americans \nthat served in the Great War. Though now distanced by the following \neconomic depression, subsequent World War and more recent conflicts, \nWorld War I still remains a critical part of our history, symbolizing \nthe emergence of our country as a superpower and demonstrating the \nwillingness and selflessness of those who serve in our military. These \nmen, 90 years later, still deserve the recognition and admiration of a \ngrateful nation.\n  In honor of Frank Buckles and the millions of veterans he stands for, \nI am introducing a resolution authorizing Mr. Buckles to lie in honor \nin the rotunda of the Capitol upon his passing so that citizens may pay \ntribute to the last member of this faithful group of Americans. After a \nperiod of repose, Mr. Buckles will receive final burial at the \nArlington National Cemetery, a privilege offered earlier this year. I \nintroduce this resolution now, so that Mr. Buckles will be aware of the \nrespect we wish to pay to him and his fellow veterans.\n  We should not allow this generation to fade from our society without \nshowing our appreciation of their service. As Ranking Member of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and on behalf of Senator Byrd, I ask my \ncolleagues to join us in extending this honor to Mr. Buckles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5530-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

We heard some reasons we should support the Baucus doctor \nfix. I happen to have been practicing in 2004 when the Senate did \nexactly what they are doing right now. This bill is going to guarantee \nthe doctor fix is not done by July 1. That is what is going to happen \nwith this bill.\n  Let me tell you, we are eventually going to fix the problem for the \ndoctors for 18 months. There is no question. Everybody agrees to that. \nBut what we are doing is, we are making sure we are going to add \nhundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars of cost in every State \nfor every private physician that is practicing.\n  And the reason is because the bill is not going to get changed by \nJuly 1, and they are going to be under the 10.9-percent cut. Then they \nare going to come back, whenever we finally get it done. They are going \nto have to refile all of that, and Medicare is going to have to repay \nall of this.\n  So this exercise in political gamesmanship, of working only with one \nside of the aisle, not working with Senator Grassley, to truly get this \ndone in a way that the President will not veto it and accomplish the \npurposes for which we all say we want, to eliminate the 10.9-percent \ncut for physicians, that is something we are going to lose grasp of, \nand we are going to create a hardship on every physician in this \ncountry because we are playing a political game with this rather than \nfixing the problem.\n  That brings me to my next point. Why is it every 18 months the \nphysicians in this country have to come and beg Congress not to cut \ntheir fees when we are not cutting the fees for the rest of the \nproviders throughout the Medicare Program?\n  What we have decided is that doctors make too much money. We have \ndecided that when they work 80 hours a week, one and a half to two \ntimes what everybody else works in this country, they spend their time \naway from their families making great sacrifices, that we are going to \nfund increases in the care for our elderly and seniors in this country \non the backs of physicians.\n  Now, I will not dispute the fact that there are some disparities in \nphysician\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\npay in this country, with some physicians making too much and far too \nmany making too little, especially primary care pediatricians, \npsychiatrists, and the like, those who are on the front lines. But this \nidea that we are going to fix temporarily, again, for 18 months, a \nproblem that we have to fix, which is the other problem with the Baucus \nbill, the only thing great about Medicare that will get us out of the \nlong-term costs is this idea of creating markets associated with choice \nand responsibility to give greater health care, greater choice, and \ngreater benefits to Medicare beneficiaries through competition.\n  I am the first to say that the Medicare Advantage Program has lots of \nproblems. But to get the Medicare Advantage Program, which is the one \nthing that tries to go toward market-oriented reform in Medicare, to \npay for this is ludicrous.\n  Senator Grassley has a competing bill--we just heard the second \nreading objected to by the Senator from Michigan so we cannot have a \nside-by-side vote on it--does all of the things that the Baucus bill \ndoes except it does not gut Medicare Advantage.\n\n  Well, why do we want to take the one factor in Medicare that is based \non markets, that is based on transparency, that is based on some \npersonal responsibility, and throw it out and have another program that \nright now every family in this country is on the hook for over $300,000 \nin unfunded Medicare obligations, and the Baucus bill guts the only \nthing that helps us solve that?\n  So the President is right to veto this bill. Even if it passes, this \nbill will not be overridden. So we are ensuring the fact that doctors \nwill experience, on July 1, a 10.9-percent cut. We do not have to do \nthat. They know we cannot do this and have it go to the President and \nget it vetoed and come back and get everything else down before July 1.\n  So by voting for the Baucus bill, what you are actually doing is \nensuring that every physician in this country that cares for Medicare \npatients is going to spend thousands and thousands of extra dollars, \nand that CMS is going to spend thousands and thousands and millions, \nperhaps $100 million, to come back and deal with the paperwork once \nthis is finally fixed.\n  Nobody thinks about that around here. We are playing political games. \nHow can you make Republicans look bad as they vote against a Baucus \nMedicare doctor fix? Everybody in this body wants to fix this payment \nsystem for doctors. There is one real reason we do; we want our seniors \nto be able to have physicians. And we know if an 11-percent cut goes \nthrough, many doctors will no longer be able to afford to care for \nMedicare patients, they will not be able to afford to. They cannot do \nit.\n  So if you cut 11 percent of their fees on Medicare, which are already \nalmost as low as Medicaid everywhere, which is about 40 percent less \nthan they get paid for anything else, you are asking them to serve \nMedicare at half price. And what they are going to do is they are going \nto make a choice. They are going to say: I cannot take care of Medicare \npatients.\n  So what we are going to ensure with the Baucus bill is that doctors \nare going to get a pay cut, maybe for a short period of time, but the \ninconvenience of that, the cost of that for political gamesmanship, we \nought to be ashamed of what we are doing. And it is exactly the reason \nwe have a low rating with the American people.\n  We know Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus can work this out. We \nknow it can happen. But the fact is, it was chosen to make it an issue, \nnot work in a bipartisan fashion, not come up with something that the \nPresident can sign, but instead to slow down the works. And what they \nwill do is markedly decrease availability of Medicare for seniors in \nthis country because the doctors, when they first see this, if they see \na 10.9-percent cut, some of them are going to abandon the Medicare \nProgram, and you are ensuring, if you vote for the Baucus bill, that \ndoctors will get a 10.9-percent cut for a short period of time.\n  You are ensuring that, in fact, what they are going to do is, they \nare going to have a whole lot more overhead because they are going to \nget a bill from the time it starts to the time it ends and finally gets \ncorrected, they are going to bill it twice, once for the primary at a \n10.9-percent cost, then they are going to get a bill again because it \nis going to be retroactively fixed. They are going to have to bill it \nall again. That is pure waste. That is typical government.\n  Why would we do that? What are we thinking? What we are thinking is \nshort-term partisanship. And we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Now I want to spend a few minutes talking about the climate bill. I \nhave been listening for 10 days on this issue. And I want to share some \nobservations.\n  It was said on the Senate floor that nobody has scientifically \ndisputed the underlying facts associated with climate change.\n  We cannot dispute underlying facts on climate change because climate \nchanges. It always changes. We have a history of knowing it changes. We \nknow that every 1,500 years we have global warming, whether we like it \nor not. It happens.\n  What we do not have is common sense and scientific methods looked at. \nI hear my friends, even on my side of the aisle, talk about anecdotal \nobservations that things are different. Sure they are different.\n  As a matter of fact, we heard the leading German scientists on \nclimate change saying we are going to have a 10-year break on global \nwarming. So I guess that means for the next 10 years CO2 \ninput is not going to have any effect on global warming. So we have \nconveniently changed the terms from global warming to climate change.\n  Well, I want Americans to ask themselves, what is climate change? The \nclimate changes all the time. Last week, the majority leader, on the \nSenate floor, said the tornados that were in this area were related to \nclimate change.\n  Like saying anecdotally we can prove there must be climate change \nbecause we saw tornadoes in the Washington, DC, area last week--do you \nknow how many times there have been tornadoes in this month in \nWashington, DC, throughout the years? Hundreds. But now we are \nanecdotally, because we see something new to our experience, \nassociating it with some phenomena. That is not science. That is \nignorance. That is using science in a way that bastardizes it.\n  The second point is, if we really want to know how we affect climate, \nit takes a lot of years to find that out. There are retrospective \nstudies we can do. As a matter of fact, they have been done. We have \nice core drilling that goes back about 3,500 years. We know exactly \nwhat the temperatures were in the north and in the south based on both \nice core drillings and ocean sediment drillings. We know that because \nwe know that isotopes of both oxygen and nitrogen decay at different \nrates. When those are measured, we can have a pattern of what the \nEarth's temperatures were and what the cycles of climate were. Nobody \nwants to embrace that. That is real science. But we ignore that. That \ndoesn't fit with the emotion that allows us to relate a policy that we \nwant to enact in a way that disproves it.\n  There is so much yet to be known about climate. We can't even predict \nwhat the weather is going to be tomorrow. Yet we have this supposed \nsettled science. The science isn't settled. The rhetoric is settled, \nbut the science is far from settled.\n  What do we know? Here is what we know. The most recent examples of \n1,500-year cycles are these: The Roman warming started in 200 B.C. \nPared with its other half, the Dark Ages, it ended in 900 A.D. We know \nthat historically. We know there was this warming cycle that came and \nwent. The medieval warming period, the little ice age period cycle, \nlasted that period of time from A.D. 900 to 1850. The modern warming \ncycle, which started about 1850 to present, is probably the first half \nof the change. What happened during the medieval warming period? The \nNorse populated Greenland. They fished from its coast. They had over \n60,000 cattle. They raised hay on what is now majority covered with \nice.\n  So we have been there before. We don't like to look at the historical \nfact because it doesn't fit either our populace viewpoint or give us a \nreason to enact a bill which, in my estimation, is the greatest--will \nbe, if we pass it--loss of freedom this country has ever experienced.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n  Freedom is directly related to the level and the amount of government \nwe have. Under the climate bill Senator Boxer has put out, you can \nguarantee a loss of your liberty. Anybody with any common sense knows \nthat. We are going to put all sorts of decisionmaking in the hands of \nbureaucrats. They are going to be deciding for you. So when bureaucrats \nstart deciding for you, that means you don't. If you don't like the \nresults, you have to prove your innocence. The onus becomes on you.\n  The unique thing about the American experience is that freedom is our \nbasic model. Liberty is ours. When we grow the Government, through $6.4 \nto $6.9, all the way up to supposedly $10 trillion in a tax structure \nthat is implemented through a great number of Government programs, \nGovernment boards, Government regulations, you can bet your freedom is \ngoing to be markedly limited.\n  The last thing I want to talk about is the very fact that we are \ntalking about not using resources we have. Even if you buy everything \nthat the alarmists with climate change and global warming would have \nyou, and let's assume they are all right, everybody agrees it is going \nto take us 20 to 30 years to get off of hydrocarbons as a method of \nenergy production, as a source of energy. We know that. If we were to \nstart building nuclear plants today, we would have every alternative \nenergy that we had, and it would still take us 15 to 20 years to start \nto begin to do that. So what is it that we fear about utilizing our own \nenergy resources?\n  My senior Senator sitting on the floor--and I can tell you that both \nof us, coming from Oklahoma, love our land. We love our streams. We \nlove our lakes. We love the wildlife that is everywhere you turn in \nOklahoma. We drill all over the place. We don't contaminate our \nenvironment at all. But we have a level of ignorance about what \nexploration is for energy in this country. It is done in a fabulous, \nsophisticated way. We now drill 1 hole and create 8 to 20 wells out of \n1 hole because the technology allows you to drill any direction you \nwant at almost any depth you want. So what happens is, we allow people \nwho are not aware of the technology of exploration to create a picture \nthat says exploration can't be done in an environmentally friendly way. \nThat is not true. We do it all the time in Oklahoma. Come visit.\n  Behind my home is a gas well. It was drilled 25 years ago. When they \nplugged it, everything about that was remediated. Do you know what is \ngrowing there right now is the most fabulous wild blackberries you ever \ntasted in your life. That is exactly the opposite picture that the \nalarmists want you to have about energy exploration.\n  The point I am making is, we have a hundred years, at a minimum, of \nhydrocarbons available to us that we could utilize in the next 5 to 10 \nyears and not utilize foreign imported oil from people who have vowed \nto take away our freedoms. The fact is, that gets blocked all the time \non the Senate floor on the basis of an irrationality that says you \ncan't do it.\n  We have two of the largest domestic natural gas producers in the \nworld in Oklahoma. In the Gulf of Mexico, you can't even see the rigs. \nIn 8,500 feet of water, 20,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, \nthey are drilling oil in a platform that is floating that moves less \nthan 8 inches based on gyroscopes. They have not once in all the years \nhad an environmental spill when they were doing that. That is how great \nthe technology is. Yet we have this fear that you can't do something.\n  At the same time that we have this fear, what we are doing is \nembracing $4.35 gasoline. We are embracing the funding of terrorists by \nour purchase of oil moneys that then go to fund terrorists. We have \nbecome schizophrenic. We have lost it. When we would deny the ability \nto use resources in this country that would stop the upward trend on \nthe price of oil, that would utilize oil shale to conversion for jet \naviation fuel, that would utilize oil shale for heating oil, that we \nwould not allow that, we will not allow the utilization of our own \nresources at our own negative benefit, what is the purpose of that?\n  I get written to all the time by constituents from Oklahoma about gas \nprices. Do you know what I tell them? I say: You should blame us. You \nshould blame the Congress. It is absolutely our fault we are in the \nposition we are in. We didn't act. From 1995 up through this year, \nevery time we have had a chance to increase exploration in a safe, \nenvironmentally friendly way in this country, it has been blocked. So \nnow we sit with the hardest of the hardest hit, the poor and less \nfortunate, trying to make a choice of whether they can even get to \nwork, let alone buy their groceries, because gas now and their energy \nneeds are such a large component of their family budget.\n  It is our fault, and we are going to sit around. We are going to \ndither, and gasoline is going to be $5.50 a gallon. The American public \nis going to react to that, and they are going to say: Maybe we ought to \ntake another look at these good energy companies that do it \nenvironmentally well and supply us power and energy and do not fund the \nvery people who want to take away our freedoms.\n  It is coming. This is part of the same rumble from the American \npublic that says we do not get it on spending. I was enlightened today \non a new bill that is getting ready to be introduced that I am going to \ntry to keep from coming to the floor that is a yearly authorization for \nthe Coast Guard. There is a 25-percent increase in it, but of that 25 \npercent, 80 percent is earmarks. We almost doubled the Coast Guard when \nwe created the Department of Homeland Security. Yet this year we are \ngoing to come close to a trillion-dollar deficit--$3,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child--and we still do not get it.\n  So the idea that Congress will not act to raise the level of \nsupplies, that Congress will not take off the tariff on imported \nethanol, refuses to take off the tariff on imported ethanol to protect \na false economy associated with corn ethanol--when, in fact, we have a \nshortage, as manifested by the price of the fuels that drive our energy \nand yet we will not act--the American people have a right to be \ndisgusted.\n  We are the reason gasoline is over $4. It is not the oil companies. \nIt is not the Middle East. It is us. Because we could have done \nsomething. We still can do something. But we heard political speeches \nall today because what we want to do is sue OPEC and create an excess \nprofits tax, and eventually a Btu tax, rather than increase the supply. \nWhat we should do is increase supplies. The American people get it. \nSomehow we do not.\n  My hope is that America will let us know. I think they are going to. \nMy hope is we will listen.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I came down to the floor for a totally \ndifferent purpose. But my junior Senator was talking, and I am so \nimpressed with some of the things he has shared with us today. He is \nbeing too kind in one area, though.\n  Sooner or later we have to say who is at fault in terms of the \nincrease. While he is right, it is us, I have and I would invite anyone \nto go to my Web site or go to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee Web site--it is epw.senate.gov--in there I have listed all \nthe bills, I say to my good junior Senator from Oklahoma, that have \ncome up since 1995 where we have tried to expand the supply of oil and \ngas in America, even the bills when we were a majority, when the \nRepublicans were a majority.\n  In October of 1995, we voted to implement a competitive leasing \nprogram for oil and gas exploration. That was within the coastal plain \nof ANWR, as well as offshore. It passed 52 to 47. Of that vote, 52 were \nRepublicans, 46 were Democrats--right down party lines. Then, the very \nnext month, on November 17--I remember that because that was my \nbirthday--the Senate voted on a motion to adopt a conference report on \nthe same thing--for a competitive leasing program for oil and gas \nexploration--and again it passed by almost the same margin. All the \nRepublicans voted for it. All the Democrats voted against it.\n  Now, those two bills were up there. And, of course, what happened? \nThe President at that time, Bill Clinton, vetoed those bills.\n  I could go from there all the way up to the present day.\n  In March of 2005, the Senate voted on an amendment to allow us to \nvote on ANWR--right down party lines: every Democrat opposed it; every \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nsupported it. On November 3, 2005, the same thing happened.\n  In June of 2007, the same thing happened. That was a better one, \nactually. That was the Gas Price Act. The Gas Price Act I am \nparticularly fond of because that was mine. We could have all the oil \nand gas production in the world that we need to bring down the price of \ngas, but if we cannot refine it, we are not going to be able to use it. \nSo as to refineries, right down party lines, the Democrats opposed any \nnew refineries in America.\n  This one was more difficult to oppose because I think most people who \nare understanding of what happens during a BRAC process--that means \nBase Realignment and Closing Commission--when that happens, the \ncommunities close by a major military installation that is closed \nsuffer economically, greatly.\n  What this would do is take those closed, BRACed out, military bases \nand turn them into refineries. That saves millions of dollars of \nGovernment money because otherwise they have to be cleaned up to \nplayground standards. You do not have to do that if there is going to \nbe a refinery on it. So it is something everybody wanted.\n  We arranged for EDA grants for communities to apply for to attract \nrefineries. We could have had a refinery in every area of America where \nwe closed military bases. But it was killed. On June 13, 2007, it was \nkilled--right down party lines. It was 43 to 52. Of that, 43 \nRepublicans voted for it; 48 Democrats voted against it.\n  In 2008, we had a similar vote on ANWR. The same thing happened; then \nagain on May 15 of this year.\n\n  I am saying this only to correct that one thing my junior Senator \nsaid, in that he was right, it is our fault, but this is strictly \npartisan. I think people are going to have to realize that. Until \npeople realize that, the same thing is going to happen. Until people \nwrite in, and the imagination is captured of the American people, and \nthey understand what is causing the high price at the pumps--it is a \nvery simple concept. As many have said, you should learn this concept \nin econ 101; that is, supply and demand--if you decrease the supply, \nthe price does not go down; it goes up. What they are trying to do with \nthe Energy bill to decrease the supply would cause the same thing.\n  That is not why I came to the floor. I am glad to join with my junior \nSenator and talk a few minutes about what he said about the science \nbehind this thing. This whole thing started back when they were trying \nto pass Kyoto. Like a lot of the cruddy things that happen in this \ncountry, it started with the United Nations.\n  The IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences--these people are \npolicymakers, not scientists--came out and said the science is here, \nthe science is settled, the science is settled, the science is settled; \nand they kept saying it louder and louder, and they were backed up by a \nvery liberal media. So the people actually believed the science was \nsettled. But the fact is, the science was not settled.\n  My junior Senator, Mr. Coburn, is right because time and time again, \nwe talked about the medieval warm period. We talked about the cooling \nperiods. Let's keep in mind that the climate has always changed in this \ncountry. God is still up there, and we are going to have these changes. \nThey have taken place.\n  The interesting thing right now is, as scientists will tell you, it \nhas been cooling ever since 2001. Also, another interesting thing is, \nthey talk about global warming, when, in fact, all during the 1990s, \nsupposedly it was getting warmer, the southern hemisphere was getting \ncooler. The Antarctic was getting cooler. The last time I checked, the \nsouthern hemisphere was part of the globe. So we did not have global \nwarming.\n  Now all these people who were saying that was true--and I think \nprobably the best example I used to use--it has been a while since I \nhave used it--is when Al Gore was the Vice President of the United \nStates and he decided to try to build a case whereby we would be \nratifying the Kyoto treaty. So he hired a guy named Tom Wigley, a top \nscientist in America, to put together a study. This is the charge he \ngave him. He said: Let's assume that every developed nation--not \ndeveloping; not China, not Mexico, not India--every developed nation \nsigned on to and ratified the Kyoto treaty and lived by its emission \nstandards, which they would not. Look at western Europe; 15 countries \nsigned on to it, and only 2 of the 15 have met the emission \nrequirements. But let's assume that is true, that they all do. How \nmuch, then, I say to you, Dr. Wigley, would this reduce the temperature \nafter 50 years? His result was this: If all developed nations joined in \nand ratified the Kyoto Treaty and lived by the emission requirements, \nit would lower the temperatures by seven one-hundredths of 1 degree--\nnot even measurable. So we go through all this economic pain.\n\n  I have never been as proud, I don't believe, of the Senate as I was \nlast week because when I compare what happened in 2005 when they had \nthe McCain-Lieberman bill, a very similar bill--not nearly as bad as \nthis bill but a similar bill; it was cap and trade, the concept was the \nsame--I was down here on this floor standing at this podium for 5 \nconsecutive days. I was the only one willing to voice the opposition. \nWe had a total of two Senators to come down in 5 days to give me \nsupport. However, last week, in only 3 days, 25 Senators came down.\n  It shows that this huge financial power base that is over there in \nthe far left environmentalist community--I am talking about the George \nSoreses and the Michael Moores and the various other groups that are \nout there in California; I call them the Hollywood elitists--those \nindividuals have all the money that they dump into all of these \ncampaigns. We were willing to take them on, and we won. The most votes \nSenator Boxer had with this change that took place in 2006--it is \nsupposed to be a much more liberal Senate, and it is--she could only \nget 44 votes, not a majority of 51, certainly not the 60 votes that \nwere necessary but only 44. I was just really pleased at that, in the \nfact that people are waking up. People recognize science is mixed. Some \npeople say the science is real, some say it is not, but one thing that \nis not confused is the amount of money it would cost.\n  We talked about this bill that we defeated--hopefully we didn't \ndefeat it. I hope it comes up so we can debate it longer. Let me make \nthis message right now to the Senate majority leader, Senator Reid: I \nwant you to bring this back to the floor so that we can talk about it \nmore and more and more and talk about the fact that this is a $6.7 \ntrillion tax increase. Senator Boxer would argue that, no, this has a \nbuilt-in system whereby poor people are getting some money back. When \nyou analyze the bill, that amount comes to $800 billion. In other \nwords, if we raise the taxes on the American people, for every $8 we \nraise the taxes, we are going to give them back $1. That is not a very \ngood deal, but that is in this bill; to make us less competitive and \nless able to be reliant upon our own reserves--huge reserves that we \nhave out there, that we could become energy independent overnight, that \nwe were going exactly the wrong way.\n  I saw a couple of editorials such as the Wall Street Journal which \nsaid that with gasoline selling at $4 a gallon, the Democrats picked \nthe worst possible time to bring up cap and trade. The issue is \nstarting to feel like the Hillary health care plan.\n  Anyway, I would even argue with some of the people who put in an \nanalysis as to how much that bill we defeated last week would have \nincreased the price of gas at the pump. They say 53 cents a gallon. \nHowever, that 53 cents a gallon is predicated--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding that we are in a \nperiod of morning business; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. I would like to continue my statements, then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The fact that it would increase by 53 cents a gallon I \nthink is conservative because that is assuming we would have 268 new \nnuclear plants. Now, the very people who are promoting this bill and \nwant to stop us from drilling, from exploring for oil and for gas, are \nthe same ones who are opposed to nuclear energy. So they say\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\nin that period of time, by 2030, the most nuclear plants we could have \nwould be 64. I think everyone agrees with that, so instead of 268 new \nplants, there will be 64. So you could say that--if you use the same \npercentages--it would raise the price of gas by $2, not just 53 cents.\n  Well, we defeated the largest tax increase ever this last Friday. As \nI saw the majority leader coming through, he was smiling, and I hope \nthat means he is going to bring it up so we can debate it more. I just \nget very excited about the fact that there has been a wake-up call in \nAmerica. After all of those lonely years over the last 7 years, now \npeople realize this is something that is not good for America. It took \n$4-a-gallon gas to make that wake-up call become a reality. So I am \nvery thankful it happened. I congratulate the Senate on its wisdom.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/11/senate-section/article/S5534-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
