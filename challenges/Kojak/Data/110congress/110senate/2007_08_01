Mr. President, today there will be 30 minutes of morning \nbusiness, and it will all be under the control of the Republicans. \nFollowing that time, the Senate will resume consideration of the \nchildren's health bill and then conduct 30 minutes of debate with \nrespect to the Ensign amendment. That time will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Ensign and Baucus. Upon the use or yielding \nback of that time, the Senate will vote in relation to the Ensign \namendment. Following the disposition of the Ensign amendment, the \nmanagers hope to come to a short agreement with respect to the Gregg \namendment and have a vote shortly thereafter. Senator Byrd is to be \nrecognized to speak for up to 30 minutes at 12 noon. Other votes with \nrespect to the bill are expected today.\n  Mr. President, we have two major amendments we have been told exist \nwith respect to this children's health legislation. One will be offered \nby Senator Kerry, which is going to increase the amount of money we \nbelieve is needed in this legislation. The other is by Senators Lott \nand Kyl, which is a substitute amendment. I hope those Senators who are \ngoing to offer those amendments will come and do them quickly. We need \nthese two amendments. That is what this legislation is all about. Other \nindividuals also have a right to offer amendments, but I do hope those \ntwo amendments will be offered very quickly. We need to finish this \nbill. We are going to finish this bill before we leave.\n  Of course, everybody knows we have, in the morning, the cloture vote \non ethics and lobbying. We will do that an hour after we come in in the \nmorning. I very much appreciate the willingness of the minority to work \nwith us and that we didn't have to go--because it was a privileged \npiece of legislation that came from the House, that we didn't have to \nwaste time from last night until tomorrow morning. I appreciate very \nmuch the Republicans allowing us to work on this legislation today. It \nwould have been a wasted day otherwise.\n  I hope we can get a lot of work done on SCHIP today. I will speak \nwith Senator McConnell as to when, if at all--and I hope it is not \nnecessary--we will file cloture on SCHIP to finish it. I hope we don't \nhave to do that. We had good luck last week on the first appropriations \nbill and not having to do that.\n  We have one other must-do item before we leave here, and that deals \nwith the surveillance program that everybody has read about and knows \nabout. That has to be done. I had a briefing meeting with Admiral \nMcConnell this morning, and he has sent some proposed changes to the \nlegislation up here. It is already here. We hope that will be enough to \nhave that legislation pass quickly. I hope we can get it done. It is \nsomething on which we all acknowledge we should give it the old college \ntry and do everything we can to complete that.\n  Those are the things we must do.\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\n  There are other things we would like to do. One of them is the \ncompetitiveness bill, which is very important. It is such an \ninteresting piece of legislation. In conversations with the most \nliberal members of my caucus, I find that they love this piece of \nlegislation, as do moderates and conservatives in my caucus, and it is \nthe same with the Republicans. They think this legislation is very \ngood.\n\n  I see my friend from Tennessee on the floor who worked with Senator \nBingaman on this early on. I hope we can do this before we leave. It is \nmy understanding that the conference, if not completed, is virtually \ncompleted. It would be good to do that before we leave. It would show \nreal bipartisanship.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know others are waiting to begin morning \nbusiness. Let me first add my hope with the majority leader that we \nwill be able to move through these bills with some expeditious action \nthis week. There has been so much delay in the Chamber. I know the \nmajority leader wishes to move through and get these things done. I \nhope we can do that.\n  I want to mention to the Senator from Nevada that I have offered to \nthe children's health insurance bill the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct. I did that yesterday as an amendment. There are 3 million children \nbenefitted by the children's health insurance bill, but there are 2 \nmillion American Indians who are subject to full-scale health care \nrationing. It is unbelievable what is happening.\n  We have had 11 separate bills introduced in the Congress since the \nauthorization for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act expired some \nyears ago, and none of them have moved. So I offered the amendment \nbecause I felt I had to do it to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram that is on the floor.\n  I indicated yesterday, however, in response to Senator Baucus, who \nsaid that he would mark up on September 12 in the Finance Committee the \nportions of the bill relevant to them, I indicated I would withdraw my \namendment from the children's health bill if I could get a commitment \nto get the Indian health care bill to the floor of the Senate. I have \nalready marked up the Indian health bill in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, my committee.\n  This is urgent. We have a problem with respect to rationing of health \ncare with American Indians. I ask my colleague--and I know we have \nvisited about it, and I know how strongly he supports American Indians \nand health care for them--can we have a commitment to get the Indian \nhealth bill to the floor of the Senate? If we can do that, I will \nwithdraw my amendment here in anticipation of having that debate on \nIndian health in the next couple of months in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, a tireless advocate for \nNative Americans his entire career, I have 22 different tribal \norganizations in the State of Nevada. You say ``rationing'' health \ncare. I think that is even being too generous because there is no \nhealth care rationed, in many instances, in Nevada. We have gone from \nhaving two wonderful hospitals for Native Americans and now we have one \nthat is closed. The other they don't use for acute care. It is a \nsituation that, for our country, should be an embarrassment. It is an \nembarrassment. People just don't know how bad it is.\n  I say to my friend, through the Chair, that we are going to do this \nbill this year. If it is reported out of the Finance Committee, we will \nfind a way to bring it to the floor. It is the right thing to do. We \ntalk about people who don't have advocates for them. My tribal \norganizations in Nevada don't have people back here advocating for \nthem. We need to advocate for them. I have to do that, especially on \nthis issue of health care. They deserve the basic minimum; they deserve \nthe ability to have some kind of health care. It is in such a state now \nthat I, frankly, don't know what to tell the tribal organizations when \nthey come to see me. There has been more than a decade waiting to do \nsomething about this.\n  So I support my friend from North Dakota and will do everything I can \nto move this forward and make a commitment that we will do something \nthis session of Congress.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that commitment of the majority leader is \nwelcome. I observe this: There are few places in this country where \nsomeone having a heart attack would be wheeled into an emergency room \nwith a piece of paper attached to their thigh by masking tape that \nsays:\n\n       To the hospital: By the way, if you admit this woman, \n     understand you are on your own because contract health care \n     from the Indian Health Service has run out.\n\n  Very few places in this country will you see that. It describes how \nunbelievably urgent it is to pass this bill. The commitment from the \nmajority leader is very welcome. It reflects his long-term commitment \nto deal with Indian issues.\n  The commitment from Senator Baucus to mark up his portion of the bill \non September 12 is welcome. Therefore, when we are back on the \nchildren's health bill, I will withdraw my amendment as a result of the \ncommitment to move it separately.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10532-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when I was first elected to the Senate \nin 2002, I recognized the so-called maiden speech tradition, and I came \nhere expecting to talk about U.S. history. I was so disappointed by the \ndebate that I found going on in February of 2003 about the President's \nappointment of Miguel Estrada to the Supreme Court that I spoke for a \nlong time one night about the unfairness that I felt about that. I \nthought he was a superbly qualified individual and that a case was \nbeing manufactured against him to try to prevent an up-or-down vote.\n  Then, along came the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering, of \nMississippi, who in the 1950s and 1960s, while others were making \nspeeches about civil rights, was living it out in the middle of \nMississippi, testifying against someone who was described as the ``most \nviolent living racist'' in Mississippi and putting his children into \ndesegregated schools at a time when others weren't. There was a \nmanufactured, unfair case against him.\n  The Senate came to its senses shortly thereafter and began to develop \na procedure where judges could get an up-or-down vote, which brings me \nto the matter of Judge Leslie Southwick, of Mississippi, whom the \nPresident has nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit--the same position for which Judge Pickering was \nnominated. Yet, despite his excellent qualifications, his nomination \nhas not been reported to the floor by the Judiciary Committee for a \nfair up-or-down vote. It seems that Judge Southwick may be the first \ntarget in a new round of character assassination by some in this body.\n  That seat has been vacant for 6 years. This is one of the most \nimportant courts in America. I was a law clerk on that court--actually \na messenger, but I was treated like a law clerk--to the great Judge \nJohn Minor Wisdom, who served with Judge Tuttle, Judge Rives, and Judge \nBrown, all of whom presided over the segregation of the South. I value \nthat court and the quality of judges who have been there.\n  Judge Southwick has that same quality. He has 11 years of service as \na Mississippi State appellate court judge. He had military service in \nIraq as a staff judge advocate. He has been a professor\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\nat Mississippi College of Law. He has had service as a senior Justice \nDepartment official. He has had more than 20 years in private practice \nin Jackson. He is rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American \nBar Association. He has been honored by the Mississippi State Bar with \nits Judicial Excellence Award.\n  What is it about the Democrats and Mississippi judges? This is an \nenormously well-qualified judge from Mississippi, and the Democrats, \napparently because he is from Mississippi, do not want to give him a \nfair up-or-down vote. That is totally unfair and it is beneath the \ndignity of this body and I object to it strenuously. This judgeship has \nbeen labeled a ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative \nOffice of the Courts.\n  What is the manufactured case? The case that has been made against \nhim, if a student were to send it in to any accredited law school, \nwould be sent back with an F and the student would be told to prepare \nbetter.\n  First, it is said he participated in an opinion he didn't even write \nwhich put the first amendment ahead of a racial slur. That is always--\nalways--a difficult decision to make, but the Mississippi Supreme Court \nsaid it was the correct decision. Judge Southwick reiterated his \ndisdain for racial slurs. He said the racial slur in question is \n``always offensive'' and ``inherently and highly derogatory.''\n  He did not even write the opinion. Yet for some reason that is \nthought to be inappropriate.\n  Then they said he joined in a case that used the words ``homosexual \nlifestyle.'' He didn't write the opinion. That phrase ``homosexual \nlifestyle'' may not be preferred by some, but it is very commonly used \nin American legal opinions by the U.S. Supreme Court, for example, in \nLawrence v. Texas, striking down the Texas ban on sodomy. It was also \nused by President Bill Clinton when he announced his ``don't ask don't \ntell'' policy. That is the manufactured case.\n  So I ask my colleagues to remember the difficulties we had in 2003 \nand 2004, when the Senate did not look at its best, when it was \nmanufacturing cases against otherwise well-qualified and distinguished \nmen and women who had been nominated to the court.\n  I hope the Judiciary Committee will bring Judge Leslie Southwick's \nname forward to the full Senate so we can have an up-or-down vote. He \ndeserves a vote. The Senate deserves to respect its traditions \nregarding nominees, and the American people deserve to be served by a \nman of such quality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 7 minutes, and at 6 minutes, if I am still speaking, will the Chair \nplease let me know.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there have been some in the leadership of \nthe majority, a few months ago, who declared the war in Iraq was lost. \nThere have been others who have been invested in two significant \ndebates we have had over withdrawing precipitously without any \nconsideration for the consequences. I have steadfastly supported our \neffort in the global war on terror and, in particular, our effort in \nIraq, cautious to understand we have had difficulties and we have made \nmistakes. But today I rise to ask those who have, in the past, declared \ndefeat or withdrawal to consider the alternative should America win.\n  Yesterday, in the New York Times, Kenneth Pollack and Michael \nO'Hanlon wrote a significant editorial--neither one an advocate, per \nse, of the war and the surge--that said this is a war we might win. \nNews that comes today from the Christian Science Monitor declares a \nprecipitous decline in the number of deaths of U.S. soldiers and \ncasualties and a tremendous decrease in IEDs.\n  On Monday night, the people of Iraq in every city, hamlet, and town \nturned out in the streets, and without a single injury, they celebrated \nthe victory of the Iraqi soccer team in the Asian soccer games.\n  We must ask the question: What do we say if, in fact, the tide has \nturned and we are winning? I think there may be some who will try and \nredescribe what victory is, and for that purpose, I wish to describe \nand remind everybody of what we already declared victory would be.\n  When President Bush asked all of us, and I supported going into Iraq \nto enforce Resolution 1441 of the United Nations with 29 other \npartners, we declared three goals: One, to find the weapons of mass \ndestruction and to depose Saddam Hussein; two, to allow the Iraqis the \nchance to hold free elections and write a constitution; and, three, to \ntrain the Iraqi military so it was capable of defending the people of \nIraq.\n  Saddam Hussein is gone, tried by his people and gone from this \nplanet. Weapons of mass destruction--no smoking gun was found, but all \nthe components were Scud missiles buried in the sand, elements of sarin \ngas in the Euphrates River, some of the biological mobile laboratories \nwe thought were there were found, and 400,000 bodies in 8 mass graves \nnear Baghdad in Iraq. So that was accomplished.\n  Second, the Iraqis held three elections, wrote a constitution, and \nnow meet in a parliamentary form of government. It may not be \neverything we like, but it is their Government and their progress, and \nAmerica gave them the opportunity to do it.\n  Now today in Iraq on the ground, Shiites who fought against us have \njoined with us against al-Qaida. Sunnis who fought against us have \njoined us in fighting against al-Qaida. In Ramadi, the streets are \nclear. The people in Baghdad are happy the American soldiers are there \nand afraid American soldiers may leave precipitously.\n  We are on the cusp of meeting the third goal. Iraqi troops--it is \nbeing recognized now--Iraqi battalions have, in some cases--not all, in \nsome cases--demonstrated the capability of holding the areas Americans \nhave secured. America's soldiers are in the same camps with Sunni, \nShia, and Kurdish soldiers of the Iraqi military.\n  This war is not over, but two-thirds of the goals we established are \naccomplished, and the third goal is within our reach. When we look in \nthe next 6 weeks toward September 15--and I don't know what General \nPetraeus is going to say, but I know what the New York Times is saying, \nI know what the Christian Science Monitor is saying, I know what the \nGeorgia soldiers I talk with or get e-mails from on the ground are \nsaying, I know what the attitude and morale of the American soldiers is \nand the hopes and aspirations of the American people. Today I ask that \nas we get ready to break, as we wait for the report on September 15, we \nneed to be prepared for victory, not invested in defeat.\n  This has been a tough battle. Some of my friends in Georgia have lost \ntheir children. They have fought for a dream Americans have fought for \nsince this great Republic was founded, and that is the right to self-\ndetermine your future.\n  I hope the Government of al-Maliki will accomplish some \nreconciliation. I hope they will accomplish a hydrocarbon deal. I hope \ndebaathification can work. But I hope we would not declare failure \nwhen, in fact, we have the opportunity it looks like to succeed. A lot \nof brave young men and women in America have invested their lives in \nthe chance to win a victory, not for ourselves but for mankind, for \ncivility, for peace, for democracy, and for all the principles upon \nwhich this country was founded.\n  So I hope for those who have been invested in the possibility that we \nwill fail, that they will get equally invested in the probability or \npossibility that we will succeed and that together, as a Congress, we \ncan reward those who fought so valiantly and see to it that one more \ndemocracy is born in the Middle East of this world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that appeared \nthis morning in the Christian Science Monitor and yesterday's article \nof Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack in the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\n           [From the Christian Science Monitor, Aug. 1, 2007]\n\n               U.S. Troop Fatalities in Iraq Drop Sharply\n\n                           (By Gordon Lubold)\n\n       U.S. troop fatalities in Iraq have plummeted from near-\n     historic highs just two months ago. The number of deaths \n     attributed to improvised explosive devices is down by more \n     than half. Violence is down in the four most dangerous \n     provinces.\n       The decrease is an apparent sign that, by at least one \n     indicator, the surge of American forces is doing something it \n     set out to do: tamp down the violence.\n       But even if this positive trend were to continue for the \n     next several months, the larger question remains unanswered: \n     will the reduced levels of violence push Kurdish, Shiite, and \n     Sunni groups to reach political reconciliation so that U.S. \n     troops can withdraw? U.S. military officials are wary.\n       ``Success does not hinge on the effectiveness or success \n     solely of the security situation,'' says one senior official \n     in uniform, who requested anonymity, echoing what many \n     military officials have said. ``It really depends on \n     political governance.''\n       As a single measure of success or failure in Iraq, the rate \n     of American fatalities has its own limitations. But it does \n     reflect the ability of the US to reduce insurgent-led \n     violence. Two months ago, U.S. fatalities climbed to 128, \n     making May the third deadliest month for US troops in Iraq \n     since the war began in 2003. But since then, as the surge of \n     30,000 new U.S. forces has arrived, fatalities have fallen \n     sharply. At press time, the toll for the month of July stood \n     at 74, a decrease of 42 percent compared with May. That's the \n     lowest fatality rate since last November.\n       When the surge was announced earlier this year, critics \n     said adding more troops in one area would simply force \n     insurgents to provoke violence in other areas. But according \n     to an analysis by Pentagon officials, fatalities are down in \n     July in all four of the most violent provinces of Iraq: \n     Baghdad, Anbar, Salahaddin, and Diyala.\n       In Baghdad Province, for example, 27 Americans were killed \n     as of July 24, down from 44 in May. In Diyala Province, six \n     Americans were killed as of July 24, a decrease from 19 in \n     May. Sunni-dominated Anbar Province to the west of Baghdad, \n     where violence has been tamped down in part because Sunni \n     sheiks have organized against Sunni extremism there, five \n     American service members were killed as of July 24, down from \n     14 for the month of May. Salahaddin saw the same trend, where \n     12 were killed in May, six in July. The four provinces \n     represent about 37 percent of the Iraqi population but nearly \n     80 percent of the violence that occurs in Iraq.\n       The toll from improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, has \n     also decreased considerably in the last two months. As of \n     July 24, 40 Americans had been killed in July, down from 95 \n     in May.\n       Iraqis are also seeing a decrease in violence. The number \n     of Iraqi security forces and civilian fatalities has declined \n     since May as well, according to icasualties.org, a website \n     that tracks such information. The site reports that there \n     were 1,664 civilians and Iraqi security forces killed in \n     July, down from 1,980 in May, but it notes that no such \n     tallies are completely accurate and are probably much higher.\n       The reduction in violence doesn't appear to be the result \n     of summer weather, when the intense heat might discourage \n     insurgent attacks. According to an analysis by the Marine \n     command in Anbar, violence trends upward from a low point in \n     January, when it's coldest, through summer to October for \n     each of the last three years. This year, according to Marine \n     Maj. Gen. Walter Gaskin, commander of Multi-national Force \n     West, the violence in Anbar has trended downward instead.\n       All this may be illustrating what to some is a new reality \n     in Iraq even if much of Washington has yet to acknowledge it, \n     says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution, a Washington-based think tank.\n       Mr. O'Hanlon has been critical of the war and has remained \n     skeptical of the current strategy. But on Monday, he \n     coauthored an Op-Ed in The New York Times titled ``A War We \n     Might Just Win.'' In it, O'Hanlon says he is impressed with \n     the improved security situation, the reasonably high morale \n     of US troops, and the increasing competency of Iraqi forces. \n     ``We are finally getting somewhere in Iraq, at least in \n     military terms,'' O'Hanlon wrote, along with Brookings \n     colleague Kenneth Pollack. ``As two analysts who have harshly \n     criticized the Bush administration's miserable handling of \n     Iraq, we were surprised by the gains we saw and the potential \n     to produce not necessarily `victory' but a sustainable \n     stability that both we and the Iraqis could live with.''\n       Military officials are heartened by decreases in American \n     fatalities but are reluctant to characterize it as a turning \n     point.\n       ``My initial thought is this is what we thought would \n     happen once we got control of the real key areas that are \n     controlled by these terrorists,'' Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, the \n     No. 2 American commander in Iraq, said on Thursday. ``It's an \n     initial positive sign, but I would argue I need a bit more \n     time to make an assessment of whether it's a true trend or \n     not.''\n       In May, noting the high number of casualties among American \n     forces, General Odierno said it was the result of taking the \n     fight to the enemy, going into places like Diyala and Baquba \n     to fight insurgents, and that he expected over time that the \n     number of casualties would decrease, as it appears to have \n     done now.\n       Odierno says he may need more time, but Congress is waiting \n     for an assessment as early as next month. That's when \n     Odierno's boss, Army Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander \n     in Iraq, is expected to provide a comprehensive report of the \n     security situation in Iraq. Military officials caution that \n     General Petraeus's assessment may not make specific \n     recommendations regarding a possible drawdown of the more \n     than 155,000 US troops currently serving in Iraq.\n       ``Petraeus is very, very cautious about how much success he \n     is going to advertise,'' the senior uniformed official says. \n     ``The culminating point is when the hearts and minds finally \n     tip'' in Iraq.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 30, 2007]\n\n                        A War We Just Might Win\n\n            (By Michael E. O'Hanlon and Kenneth M. Pollack)\n\n       Washington.--Viewed from Iraq, where we just spent eight \n     days meeting with American and Iraqi military and civilian \n     personnel, the political debate in Washington is surreal. The \n     Bush administration has over four years lost essentially all \n     credibility. Yet now the administration's critics, in part as \n     a result, seem unaware of the significant changes taking \n     place.\n       Here is the most important thing Americans need to \n     understand: We are finally getting somewhere in Iraq, at \n     least in military terms. As two analysts who have harshly \n     criticized the Bush administration's miserable handling of \n     Iraq, we were surprised by the gains we saw and the potential \n     to produce not necessarily ``victory'' but a sustainable \n     stability that both we and the Iraqis could live with.\n       After the furnace-like heat, the first thing you notice \n     when you land in Baghdad is the morale of our troops. In \n     previous trips to Iraq we often found American troops angry \n     and frustrated--many sensed they had the wrong strategy, were \n     using the wrong tactics and were risking their lives in \n     pursuit of an approach that could not work.\n       Today, morale is high. The soldiers and marines told us \n     they feel that they now have a superb commander in Gen. David \n     Petraeus; they are confident in his strategy, they see real \n     results, and they feel now they have the numbers needed to \n     make a real difference.\n       Everywhere, Army and Marine units were focused on securing \n     the Iraqi population, working with Iraqi security units, \n     creating new political and economic arrangements at the local \n     level and providing basic services--electricity, fuel, clean \n     water and sanitation--to the people. Yet in each place, \n     operations had been appropriately tailored to the specific \n     needs of the community. As a result, civilian fatality rates \n     are down roughly a third since the surge began--though they \n     remain very high, underscoring how much more still needs to \n     be done.\n       In Ramadi, for example, we talked with an outstanding \n     Marine captain whose company was living in harmony in a \n     complex with a (largely Sunni) Iraqi police company and a \n     (largely Shiite) Iraqi Army unit. He and his men had built an \n     Arab-style living room, here he met with the local Sunni \n     sheiks--all formerly allies of Al Qaeda and other jihadist \n     groups--who were now competing to secure his friendship.\n       In Baghdad's Ghazaliya neighborhood, which has seen some of \n     the worst sectarian combat, we walked a street slowly coming \n     back to life with stores and shoppers. The Sunni residents \n     were unhappy with the nearby police checkpoint, where Shiite \n     officers reportedly abused them, but they seemed genuinely \n     happy with the American soldiers and a mostly Kurdish Iraqi \n     Army company patrolling the street. The local Sunni militia \n     even had agreed to confine itself to its compound once the \n     Americans and Iraqi units arrived.\n       We traveled to the northern cities of Tal Afar and Mosul. \n     This is an ethnically rich area, with large numbers of Sunni \n     Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens. American troop levels in both \n     cities now number only in the hundreds because the Iraqis \n     have stepped up to the plate. Reliable police officers man \n     the checkpoints in the cities, while Iraqi Army troops cover \n     the countryside. A local mayor told us his greatest fear was \n     an overly rapid American departure from Iraq. All across the \n     country, the dependability of Iraqi security forces over the \n     long term remains a major question mark.\n       But for now, things look much better than before. American \n     advisers told us that many of the corrupt and sectarian Iraqi \n     commanders who once infested the force have been removed. The \n     American high command assesses that more than three-quarters \n     of the Iraqi Army battalion commanders in Baghdad are now \n     reliable partners (at least for as long as American forces \n     remain in Iraq).\n       In addition, far more Iraqi units are well integrated in \n     terms of ethnicity and religion. The Iraqi Army's highly \n     effective Third Infantry Division started out as \n     overwhelmingly Kurdish in 2005. Today, it is 45 percent \n     Shiite, 28 percent Kurdish, and 27 percent Sunni Arab.\n       In the past, few Iraqi units could do more than provide a \n     few ``jundis'' (soldiers) to put a thin Iraqi face on largely \n     American operations. Today, in only a few sectors did we\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\n     find American commanders complaining that their Iraqi \n     formations were useless--something that was the rule, not the \n     exception, on a previous trip to Iraq in late 2005.\n       The additional American military formations brought in as \n     part of the surge, General Petraeus's determination to hold \n     areas until they are truly secure before redeploying units, \n     and the increasing competence of the Iraqis has had another \n     critical effect: no more whack-a-mole, with insurgents \n     popping back up after the Americans leave.\n       In war, sometimes it's important to pick the right \n     adversary, and in Iraq we seem to have done so. A major \n     factor in the sudden change in American fortunes has been the \n     outpouring of popular animus against Al Qaeda and other \n     Salafist groups, as well as (to a lesser extent) against \n     Moktada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army.\n       These groups have tried to impose Shariah law, brutalized \n     average Iraqis to keep them in line, killed important local \n     leaders and seized young women to marry off to their \n     loyalists. The result has been that in the last six months \n     Iraqis have begun to turn on the extremists and turn to the \n     Americans for security and help. The most important and best-\n     known example of this is in Anbar Province, which in less \n     than six months has gone from the worst part of Iraq to the \n     best (outside the Kurdish areas). Today the Sunni sheiks \n     there are close to crippling Al Qaeda and its Salafist \n     allies. Just a few months ago, American marines were fighting \n     for every yard of Ramadi; last week we strolled down its \n     streets without body armor.\n       Another surprise was how well the coalition's new Embedded \n     Provincial Reconstruction Teams are working. Wherever we \n     found a fully staffed team, we also found local Iraqi leaders \n     and businessmen cooperating with it to revive the local \n     economy and build new political structures. Although much \n     more needs to be done to create jobs, a new emphasis on \n     microloans and small-scale projects was having some success \n     where the previous aid programs often built white elephants.\n       In some places where we have failed to provide the civilian \n     manpower to fill out the reconstruction teams, the surge has \n     still allowed the military to fashion its own advisory groups \n     from battalion, brigade and division staffs. We talked to \n     dozens of military officers who before the war had known \n     little about governance or business but were now ably \n     immersing themselves in projects to provide the average Iraqi \n     with a decent life.\n       Outside Baghdad, one of the biggest factors in the progress \n     so far has been the efforts to decentralize power to the \n     provinces and local governments. But more must be done. For \n     example, the Iraqi National Police, which are controlled by \n     the Interior Ministry, remain mostly a disaster. In response, \n     many towns and neighborhoods are standing up local police \n     forces, which generally prove more effective, less corrupt \n     and less sectarian. The coalition has to force the warlords \n     in Baghdad to allow the creation of neutral security forces \n     beyond their control.\n       In the end, the situation in Iraq remains grave. In \n     particular, we still face huge hurdles on the political \n     front. Iraqi politicians of all stripes continue to dawdle \n     and maneuver for position against one another when major \n     steps towards reconciliation--or at least accommodation--are \n     needed. This cannot continue indefinitely. Otherwise, once we \n     begin to downsize, important communities may not feel \n     committed to the status quo, and Iraqi security forces may \n     splinter along ethnic and religious lines.\n       How much longer should American troops keep fighting and \n     dying to build a new Iraq while Iraqi leaders fail to do \n     their part? And how much longer can we wear down our forces \n     in this mission? These haunting questions underscore the \n     reality that the surge cannot go on forever. But there is \n     enough good happening on the battlefields of Iraq today that \n     Congress should plan on sustaining the effort at least into \n     2008.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we all know and acknowledge that al-Qaida \nand other related terrorist groups are determined to strike at the U.S. \nhomeland. But a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Iraq would only serve \nto fuel that determination and, as a result, surrender Iraq to al-\nQaida, which would directly threaten the security of the United States \nand its allies.\n  Yesterday, we had a visit from Henry Kissinger who warned us that \nsuch a precipitous withdrawal would be revisiting the nightmare of \nVietnam, where our withdrawal there created genocide among those who \nhad supported us and other innocent Southeast Asians. This time, \nhowever, al-Qaida would follow us back to America. Al-Qaida would use \nIraq as a safe haven, as it once had in Afghanistan. Only this time \nwith oil revenues, in addition to a safe haven, it would be well \npositioned and financed to launch further enhanced attacks against the \nUnited States. Yet we continue to hear from the other side calls for \nwithdrawal, despite preliminary reports of progress resulting from the \nsurge, as my colleague from Georgia has so eloquently explained.\n  We continue to hear calls for timelines that would embolden the \nmorale of our enemies and dissuade the populace from cooperating with \nU.S. and Iraqi forces, and the latest and most recent development in \nthe string of defeatism has come from the House majority whip. This \npast Monday in the Washington Post, he stated that a strongly positive \nreport on progress in Iraq by General Petraeus would likely split \nDemocrats in the House and impede his party's efforts to press for a \ntimetable to end the war.\n  Now it appears some in the Democratic Party leadership are so \ninvested in retreat and defeat politically that despite whatever the \nnews is coming out of Iraq and regardless of the consequences, they are \ncommitted to defeat.\n  Why, I ask, is the majority focused not on our national security but \non scoring political points? I guess we should pull out, cede victory \nfor the terrorists in Iraq, in order to keep the Democrats united for \nthe general elections in 2008.\n  What we, the Iraqi people, and all freedom-loving nations face is a \nfundamental threat from barbaric cowards misrepresenting the true \nnature of peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists of mufsidoon, as \nthey should be called, are condemned evildoers distorting the Koran. \nThey are not jihadists. Jihad is pursuing a moral superiority. These \npeople who commit these acts are not insurgents or jihadists. The \nclearer we define the true enemy, the easier it will be to defeat them.\n  What we have seen for some time now is encouraging signs this has, in \nfact, happened, coupled with the surge that is showing progress. Sunni \nsheiks in Al Anbar have been working with us to take back their \nneighborhoods and villages, fed up with the mufsidoon al-Qaida \ncommitting atrocities.\n  My colleague referred to the Sunday New York Times article. Two men \nwho are strong opponents of the war in Iraq said, referring to al-Qaida \nand other Salafist groups, as well as Moktada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army:\n\n       These groups have tried to impose Shariah law, brutalized \n     average Iraqis to keep them in line, killed important local \n     leaders and seized young women to marry off to their \n     loyalists. The result has been that in the last 6 months, \n     Iraqis have begun to turn on the extremists and turn to the \n     Americans for security and help. The most important and best-\n     known example of this is in Anbar Province, which in less \n     than 6 months has gone from the worst part of Iraq to the \n     best. Today, the Sunni sheiks there are close to crippling Al \n     Qaeda and its Salafist allies. Just a few months ago, \n     American marines were fighting for every yard of Ramadi; last \n     week we strolled down its streets without body armor.\n\n  I observed the same when my CODEL visited Iraq in early May. The \nauthors said ``there is enough good happening on the battlefields of \nIraq today that Congress should plan on sustaining the effort at least \nuntil 2008.''\n  So if two of the war's harshest, most longstanding critics admit we \nare making a difference, why can't the Democrats give victory a chance? \nWhy can't they give millions of Iraqis a chance at freedom? Why can't \nthey acknowledge the progress being made?\n  Pollack and O'Hanlon said that the soldiers and marines know they \nhave a superb commander in General Petraeus.\n\n       . . . they are confident in his strategy, they see real \n     results, and they feel now they have the numbers needed to \n     make a real difference.\n\n  It is time my colleagues in the other party who claim to support the \ntroops actually do so in both words and deeds. Ignoring the progress \nbeing made by our troops because it does not suit the political ends of \nsome Democratic leaders is an egregious outrage. Advocating for a \nprecipitous withdrawal from Iraq would be a rallying cry for al-Qaida \nand other mufsidoon all over the world. What are we to say to the \nmillions of Iraqis who have sided with us in taking back their country, \nonly to see them slaughtered systematically after we leave the job \nbefore it is finished?\n  Our words should inspire our troops and those who are working with \nus. Rest assured our soldiers and marines are listening. A recent \nspeech by Marine Corps Commandant Conway underscores the point:\n\n       I sat this week and listened to a United States Senator who \n     criticized the U.S. effort\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\n     in Iraq as being involved in an Iraqi civil war while \n     ignoring the real fight against terrorism that was taking \n     place in Afghanistan.\n       With due respect to the Senator, I would offer that he is \n     wrong on two counts. The fact is that there is no civil war \n     taking place in Iraq by any reasonable metric. There is \n     certainly sectarian strife, but even that is on the declining \n     scale over the past six months.\n       Ironically, this strife was brought about and inflamed by \n     the very terrorists some claim do not exist in Iraq. The \n     sectarian strife is a tactic aimed at creating chaos with \n     little risk to the instigator while it ties down coalition \n     forces.\n\n  Yet, Mr. President, the retreat-and-defeat crowd, despite encouraging \nsigns the surge is working, despite the fact this new strategy has only \nbeen in place fully for just a couple of months, and despite the fact \nthat the Democrats have failed to offer any constructive alternatives, \nother than the ones that would cede defeat, continue to push down that \nline.\n  It is a huge disappointment to me, to others, to those who support \nour troops and the efforts to protect our homeland from the al-Qaida \nattacks that would surely follow a precipitous withdrawal. It is a huge \ndisappointment that this debate is not about how we can achieve victory \nbut how quickly we can declare defeat. This has become a political \ndebate. The focus of our national security has been sidetracked. As I \nhave said time and time again, we should debate legislation which \nprovides our troops with a clear path to victory, a victory which, \nsadly, many in this body are ready to award to al-Qaida and mufsidoon \nall over the world without ever having given the surge a chance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will say to my good friend from Missouri \nthat was a well-done presentation. I know how important this topic is \nto him because of his family's commitment to our military, and he, like \nmany other people in this country, definitely has a vested interest in \nthe outcome in Iraq in terms of family members.\n  The point I would like to make this morning, to build on this theme, \nis that I passionately believe the outcome in Iraq will not be a \nneutral event in terms of the overall war on terror, that success in \nIraq will not be confined to Iraq in terms of winning the war on \nterror, and a defeat in Iraq certainly will not be confined to Iraq. It \nwill spill over and empower extremists in the region and throughout the \nworld.\n  The reason I say that is this: Who is the enemy in Iraq? Is this \nreally a civil war? Certainly there are aspects of sectarian violence \nand people trying to seize political power through militia groups and \nthe use of violence, trying to destroy this democracy and win the day \nto control Iraq. There are Shia and Sunni groups trying to do that. But \nthe vast majority of Iraqis want to go a different way. They want to \nlive together and try to find some way to reconcile their past \ndifferences and not resort to the use of the gun. I do believe there is \nsome hope this will happen--and not just blind hope but realistic \nprogress in Iraq that can be seen if you are willing to look.\n  The challenges are real. The Iraqi central government has failed on \nmany fronts to reconcile the country politically. But, as my colleagues \nhave indicated, the surge, the additional combat power that started in \nFebruary and has been in place now for about 3 or 4 weeks, has made a \ndramatic difference in certain parts of Iraq.\n  Mr. O'Hanlon and Mr. Pollack's article has been often mentioned by \nRepublicans, and they have been critics of the war, but I would just \nlike to say to them, if they happen to be listening: I appreciate your \nwillingness to come back and report progress, and I also understand \nwhat you are telling us in your article, that we are a long way from \nhaving it right in Iraq and there are many challenges left. The \npolitical front has been stagnant, but the military front has moved \nforward in a very substantial way.\n  The surge, for me, is not so much that we have moved al-Qaida out of \nAnbar but that the people in Anbar, given a choice, have rejected al-\nQaida. The ability to make that choice was provided by the additional \ncombat power coming from the surge. An offensive strategy is now in \nplace, and it has replaced a defensive strategy. The old strategy of \ntraining the Iraqi police and military and hiding behind walls simply \nwasn't working. The new strategy of going out in the communities and \nliving with the Iraqi police and army is paying dividends.\n  Anbar truly has changed in a phenomenal way, as Senator Bond said. \nYou can go to Ramadi now--someplace you couldn't go a few months ago. \nAgain, the Iraqi Sunni residents of Anbar tasted al Qaida's lifestyle, \nhad an experience in terms of what al-Qaida would impose upon their \nfamilies, and said: No, thank you. And along comes American forces to \nhelp them reinforce that choice.\n  The biggest news in Anbar is that 12,000 people joined the local \npolice force in 2007, where there were only 1,000 in 2006. So that \nmeans when we do leave--and it is all of our goal to withdraw from \nIraq--the goal should be to withdraw with honor and security, and honor \nmeans you leave the country without those who helped you fight al-Qaida \nand other extremists getting slaughtered. I don't think we could leave \nthat country with much honor if we left in a way that allowed those who \nbravely stepped out and embraced moderation to be killed by the \nextremists. From a security perspective, it is important that we leave \nIraq in a stable situation and that the problems there do not spill \nover to the other parts of the region and the world at large.\n  Now, whom are we fighting? There are sectarian conflicts. There are \npower struggles to regain control of Iraq. That is part of the enemy. \nAl-Qaida is part of the enemy. And al-Qaida is really not limited in \ncontrolling Iraq. It is not their goal to take over central Baghdad and \nrun Iraq; their goal, in my opinion, is to come into Iraq and make sure \nthis attempt at moderation and democracy fails.\n  Is there a connection between al-Qaida in Iraq and bin Laden and his \norganization? About a week ago, President Bush came to Charleston, SC, \nand spoke at Charleston's Air Force Base. He made a very logical, \nreasoned case that there is a deep connection between al-Qaida in Iraq \nand the bin Laden infrastructure. To those who say that al-Qaida in \nIraq is really a separate organization with a separate agenda, I think \nyou are not understanding who the major players are and what their \nagenda includes.\n  No. 1, their agenda is to defeat us in Iraq and drive America out and \nbe able to claim to the rest of the world that they beat us. If you \ndon't believe me, ask Bin Laden or look at what bin Laden says. Bin \nLaden claimed, ``The Third World war is raging in Iraq.'' Osama Bin \nLaden says, ``The war is for you or for us to win. If we win it, it \nmeans your defeat and your disgrace forever.''\n  Well, I think he understands the consequences of a victory by al-\nQaida. He also understands the consequences of a defeat by America. The \nquestion I have is, Do we understand that? Do we understand what would \nhappen to this country and all forces of moderation in the Mideast and \nthroughout the world if it were perceived that al-Qaida in Iraq was \nable to drive the United States out of that country and leave it to the \nwarlords of terrorism?\n  Who is al-Qaida in Iraq? The founder of al-Qaida in Iraq was not an \nIraqi, it was a Jordanian--al-Zarqawi. He was a Jordanian terrorist. \nBefore 9/11, he ran a terrorist camp in Afghanistan. After joining \nOsama bin Laden, he left Afghanistan, after the fall of the Taliban, \nand went to Iraq. Zarqawi and his terrorist group formally joined bin \nLaden, pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden, and promised to follow \nhis orders in jihad. Soon after, bin Laden publicly declared that \nZarqawi was the prince of al-Qaida in Iraq and instructed terrorists in \nIraq to listen to him and obey him. Now, to me, that is a pretty \nserious connection.\n  Beyond Zarqawi, who was from Jordan, bin Laden sent an Egyptian, who \nwas a member of al-Qaida's international infrastructure, to provide \nsupport to Zarqawi and leadership. And the President gave a laundry \nlist of international terrorists tied to bin Laden who migrated to Iraq \nto build up al-Qaida in Iraq. They have the same agenda. The agenda is \nto defeat moderation where you find it, to try to control as much of \nthe Mideast as possible. And their agenda doesn't just include Iraq. \nThe Gulf States are next and after that Israel, and always us.\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n  Now, that is not what I am saying; that is what they say. So I think \nthe President made a very persuasive case that the infrastructure of \nal-Qaida in Iraq is very much tied to the bin Laden organization. If \nyou don't believe that, come down and let's have a debate about it.\n  Who else is our enemy in Iraq? Iran. This body passed unanimously a \nresolution authored by Senator Lieberman during the Defense \nauthorization debate, and part of that resolution was a laundry list of \nactivity by Iran, particularly the Quds Force, part of the \nRevolutionary Guard, in terms of trying to kill Americans in Iraq and \ndestabilize the efforts of building a democracy in Iraq. On February \n11, 2007, the U.S. military held a briefing in Baghdad at which its \nrepresentatives stated that at least 170 members of the U.S. Armed \nForces have been killed and at least 620 wounded by weapons tied to \nIran.\n  This resolution which we passed was a damning indictment of Iran's \ninvolvement in Iraq about training, providing funds, providing \nweaponry, and bringing Hezbollah agents from Lebanon into Iraq to try \nto assist extremist groups whose goal it is to kill Americans and to \ndestabilize this effort of democracy.\n  Now, why does al-Qaida come to Iraq? I said before that their biggest \nnightmare is a moderate form of government where Sunnis and Shias and \nKurds and all different groups could live together, accepting their \ndifferences, where a woman could have a say about her children by being \nable to run for office and vote and have a strong voice in society. \nThat is their worst nightmare.\n  Whether we should have gone to Iraq or not is a historical debate. We \nhave made plenty of mistakes after the fall of Baghdad. But the biggest \nmistake would be not to recognize that Iraq is part of a global \nstruggle. There are sectarian conflicts in Iraq; I acknowledge that. \nThere has been a major failure of political reconciliation; I \nacknowledge that. The old strategy was not working; I acknowledged that \n2 or 3 years ago. The new strategy is providing dividends in terms of \ndefeating al-Qaida in Iraq. The Iraqi people in the Sunni areas have \nturned against al-Qaida in Iraq. That is good news. Political \nreconciliation is occurring at the local provincial level. I hope it \nworks its way up.\n  Another aspect of Iraq, to me, which is undeniable--and I understand \nthe challenges, and I think I see the successes for what they are--is \nthat the Iranian Government's involvement in Iraq is major. It is \nsubstantial. It is designed to break our will. Their efforts include \nkilling our troops, and they are there to make sure this experiment in \ndemocracy fails because Iran's worst nightmare is to have a functioning \ndemocracy on their border.\n  So this is part of a global struggle, and the outcome will create \nmomentum one way or the other. I hope the outcome will be a success for \nmoderation and a defeat of extremism.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10537-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 976, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 976) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide tax relief for small businesses, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Baucus amendment No. 2530, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Grassley (for Ensign) amendment No. 2538 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to amend the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to \n     create a Disease Prevention and Treatment Research Trust \n     Fund.\n       Bunning amendment No. 2547 (to amendment No. 2530), to \n     eliminate the exception for certain States to cover children \n     under SCHIP whose income exceeds 300 percent of the Federal \n     poverty level.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 2534 (to amendment No. 2530), to \n     revise and extend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n       Gregg amendment No. 2587 (to amendment No. 2530), to limit \n     the matching rate for coverage other than for low-income \n     children or pregnant women covered through a waiver and to \n     prohibit any new waivers for coverage of adults other than \n     pregnant women.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \nnow 30 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2538.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the bill before us today would reauthorize \nSCHIP for 5 years with a $35 billion expansion in spending. But because \nof the way the budget gimmicks were worked in this bill, it is actually \nan expansion of somewhere around $110 billion.\n  This expansion, or at least part of it, is going to be funded by an \nincrease in the Federal tobacco tax by 61 cents per pack and up to $10 \nper cigar. The problem with the funding mechanism in this bill, the way \nI see it, is that for the funding to still be there, we actually need \nto encourage people to smoke. Today, in our health care system, smokers \ncontribute to a lot of diseases and this imposes large costs. In the \nfuture, as we raise the price of tobacco, fewer people smoking will \nmean less revenue. The proposal to fund the SCHIP expansion will yield \ndiminishing returns. In the future, the tobacco tax will not adequately \npay for the spending that is provided for in this bill.\n  This bill greatly increases dependency on the Federal Government and \nthe dependency of the Federal Government on this tobacco tax revenue. \nThe expansions included in this bill will have little bang for the buck \nin terms of reducing the ranks of the uninsured. As more money is \npoured into expanding SCHIP, less of the new funds will go to providing \ncoverage to low-income children who currently go without coverage. \nSCHIP expansion will only serve to coax individuals and families out of \nthe private insurance market and into Government coverage.\n  Undermining private health insurance coverage by creating more \nGovernment dependence is not an effective way to address shortfalls in \ncoverage. We should have more of a comprehensive approach. This \napproach should include fiscal discipline, not more taxes and higher \nspending. We should be working to strengthen private sector health \ninsurance options and increase parental choice and responsibility.\n  My amendment, however, will not address taking a more comprehensive \napproach to coverage. We will have other amendments during this debate \nthat will address more of a comprehensive approach to insurance \ncoverage.\n  I strongly believe in the role of Federal Government plays in \npromoting basic research. Some have noted that an increase in the \ntobacco tax should be used to fund the costs that tobacco imposes on \nour society. I agree with that. My amendment would establish a trust \nfund that will be known as the Disease Prevention and Treatment \nResearch Trust Fund. The revenue from increased tobacco tax rates in \nthe underlying bill will be transferred to this trust fund. From there, \nthe dollars will be made available to fund research on diseases that \nare often associated with tobacco use.\n  I also believe the chronic underfunding of research in areas such as \npediatric cancer need to be addressed, so I have expanded the \npermissible use of these funds to cover research on other diseases as \nwell. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to help discover new \nknowledge and treatments that improve and save lives.\n  Our current health care system is a sick care system. We do not spend \nnearly as much money on prevention as we do on getting people healthy \nonce they are sick. This trust fund will fund research into areas to \nkeep people healthy, to make sure we are spending money on disease \nresearch that actually keeps people out of hospitals, that keeps people \nas healthy as possible for as long as possible throughout their lives. \nI think this is a better use of taxpayers' dollars, especially when we \nare going to be raising those taxes on people who smoke. Let's use that \nmoney to fund disease research instead of taking people from the \nprivate health market onto the Government-funded health market.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is important to look at what this \namendment actually does. It is a remarkable amendment. What does it do? \nIt would try to spend the same dollar twice, take a dollar from tobacco \ntaxes, spend it in the trust fund and spend it on CHIP--doing two \nthings at once. I don't think we can do that in the real world. It is \ntoo good to be true. We can't do it. That is what the amendment says, \nbasically. I do not think the Senator wants to take money away from \nkids, from the CHIP fund, the CHIP program. The amendment doesn't say \nthat. I am sure he doesn't intend to do that. But what the amendment \ndoes say is the same dollars are going to be spent twice--one way we \nspend it is for this trust fund, the other way is we spend it on kids. \nI don't know how we do that; how in the real world we can do that. It \nis fantasy land. We can't do it.\n  Again, surely the Senator does not want to repeal the entire \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I am sure he doesn't want to do \nthat. He does not do that in this amendment. But he still sets up the \ntension between the two, between research and all the good causes the \nSenator talks about on the one hand, and children's health insurance on \nthe other, pitting one against the other. I don't think he wants to do \nthat. He does not do that directly but he does that indirectly by \ntrying to spend the same dollar twice. That might be possible in \nHogwarts; it might be possible in Harry Potter's world. But I don't \nthink it is possible in the real world.\n  Back here in the real world I want Senators to know this amendment is \na thinly veiled attempt to steal the funding from the children's health \ncare program. It is an attempt to undermine children's health care \ncoverage. That is what this bill does. It takes a dollar from the \ntobacco tax--it is amazing--and that dollar is going to be spent on \nthis trust fund and that same dollar is going to be spent on children's \nhealth care. We can't do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, our amendment clearly takes the money from \nthe increase in the tobacco tax, and instead of dedicating to the \nexpansion of SCHIP, puts it into a disease research trust fund. SCHIP \nis still authorized; we don't do anything to the underlying program \nthat currently exists. We take the money out of the expansion, this is \ntobacco tax money out of the expansion, and we apply it to the trust \nfund to be used for disease research. That is what this bill does. That \nis what the amendment does.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question on that one point?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes, but let me explain it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will take it on our time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Let me explain it to you and then I will yield for a \nquestion. It says:\n\n       There are hereby appropriated to the Disease Prevention and \n     Treatment Reserve Trust Fund--\n\n  which we are talking about here,\n\n     --amounts equivalent to the taxes received in the Treasury \n     attributable to the amendments made by section 701. . . .\n\n  That is the tobacco taxes. We are taking the tobacco taxes, which \nwould fund part of the increase the SCHIP expansion, and apply it to \nthe Disease Prevention and Treatment Research Trust Fund. We are not \ntaking money out of the trust fund; it is the revenues generated from \nthe expansion of the tobacco tax from which we are taking the money.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So the Senator wishes to take all the tobacco taxes in \nthe underlying amendment, take all those dollars away from kids?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is not exactly right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is exactly right.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. As you heard in my statement, pediatric cancer research \nis underfunded.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, take it from the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. We are taking it from the expansion, which is not just \nchildren. We are going to have other amendments to make sure the \nprioritization is on low-income kids. Part of the expansion is in \nStates where the folks being covered are not just those under 200 \npercent of the poverty level. The expansion of SCHIP has been part of \nthe problem. I believe in actually covering everybody, but doing it in \na way that is different than the approach in the bill. What we want to \ndo is take the tobacco taxes and take those funds that are raised by \nthe tobacco taxes and dedicate those funds to disease research. The \nbudget gimmicks used in the SCHIP expansion are so phony that it is \nridiculous, some of the worst I have seen around here. These gimmicks \nassume these folks are going away in a few years, that they are not \ngoing to be on the program at the end of the 5-year reauthorization. \nThis is how they got the SCHIP expansion to meet pay-go requirements.\n  But we say let's take the money and put it in a trust fund and with \nthose real dollars that are in the trust fund, we are going to fund \ndisease research that will help children, that will help adults, that \nwill help all Americans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for another question again, again \non my time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't mean to be condescending here, but has the \nSenator read the CBO analysis? I am sure he has. And, having read that, \nisn't it clear that a large share of the dollars in this bill from the \ntobacco tax are to maintain current coverage? That is, if we do not \nprovide the $35 billion in this bill, that is the funds from the \ntobacco tax, that many kids are going to lose coverage? In fact, isn't \nit true that CBO says about 1.4 million children will lose coverage--\nnot just maintain, but lose coverage if we do not have this bill?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is exactly why I believe in a comprehensive approach \nto solve the problem we have in the country. You do not take care of \nall of the children in America in this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Of course not.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I believe in taking a more comprehensive approach that \nactually doesn't increase the dependence on the Government. I am \naddressing something different with this amendment. What I believe is \nwe should do this amendment to fund disease prevention research, but \nthen do a comprehensive approach that takes care of kids, that takes \ncare of those uninsured adults, that gets them into the private \ninsurance market. The more people, especially a lot of younger people, \nhealthier people who are currently uninsured, whom we get into the \nprivate health insurance markets--the more the better. There are \nseveral proposals out there, whether it is tax credits or tax \ndeductions; there is a blend of the two that has been talked about. We \nneed to explore those because if we are doing it in a way that will \ntake care of the uninsured, we bring in the folks who are healthier \nwhich will bring down the cost of health care insurance for all \nAmericans.\n  That is the direction we should be going. SCHIP will take people out \nof the private insurance market. The program, the expansion you have \ndone--and this is according to CBO--will take children who are \ncurrently in the private health insurance market and it will move them \nto Government programs. There will be a great incentive in the future \nto do more and more of this.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is important to talk about the \namendment, not all these other very important points with respect to \nhealth care. The effect of this amendment, the way it is written, will \nbe to spend the same dollar twice. If the effect is what the Senator \nsays it is, and he intends it--although that is not the amendment--if \nhe intends to have all additional tobacco taxes go to the trust fund, \nthen the net effect of this amendment is about 1.4 million American \nlow-income kids will lose coverage. That is CBO. They will lose it, if \nthat is the intent of the amendment.\n  The actual effect of the amendment the way it is written is the \ndollars have to be spent twice. We can't do that. I don't know how we \ndo that. But, again, if the intent of the amendment is dollars do not \ngo to kids, then the effect of the amendment is about 1.4 million\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\nchildren will lose health insurance coverage; that is 5.7 million fewer \nkids will be covered under insurance than under our amendment.\n  In the Senator's own statements, he admits it. He apparently does not \nwant to add dollars, he wants to take away the $35 billion raised by \nthe tobacco tax and the honest effect of that $35 billion is to help \nprevent about 1.4 million kids from losing coverage as well as adding \nadditional coverage. It is both. If the amendment is what the Senator \nwants it to do and says it is, then about 1.4 million kids will lose \ncoverage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to be clear, this amendment funds cancer \nresearch, including:\n\n        . . . pediatric, lung, breast, ovarian, uterine, prostate, \n     colon, rectal, oral, skin, bone, kidney, liver, stomach, \n     bladder--\n\nany kind of cancer you can think of.\n\n       Respiratory diseases . . . chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease--\n\n  We hear so much about that today.\n\n     --tuberculosis, bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. All the \n     related problems we see so much with smoking: \n     ``Cardiovascular diseases''--a huge killer in the United \n     States with huge costs to our health care system. We are \n     going to fund a lot more research with this money. I think \n     this money is going to some very good things in America, \n     things that will benefit not just children but will benefit \n     all Americans. It doesn't spend the money twice as I pointed \n     out. It takes the money from the expansion and actually \n     spends it, I believe, in more appropriate areas. Then, later \n     in the bill, we are going to be offering some alternatives \n     that will make sure the kids are covered and we will be \n     looking at some other alternatives to do more comprehensive \n     care.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have not.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter \nfrom Dr. Neal Birnbaum, president of the American College of Radiology, \nprinted at the end of my remarks on amendment No. 2538. The letter \nexpresses support for my amendment, which would use the tobacco tax \nincrease to fund research on diseases that are often associated with \ntobacco use, including arthritis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    August 1, 2007\n     Hon. John Ensign,\n      U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ensign: The American College of Rheumatology \n     greatly appreciates your leadership and amendment of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create a Disease Prevention \n     and Treatment Research Trust Fund (H.R. 976). This piece of \n     legislation is of vital importance to the rheumatology \n     community.\n       Arthritis currently affects over 46 million Americans, \n     including 300,000 children. It is the nation's leading cause \n     of disability and cost the U.S. economy approximately $128 \n     billion annually in medical costs and lost productivity.\n       We appreciate your efforts in bring forth this amendment \n     that would use the tobacco tax increase to fund research on \n     diseases that are often associated with tobacco use such as \n     arthritis. This is a disease that has been chronically \n     underfunded.\n       We will send supporting materials in the coming days \n     regarding the increased prevalence of Rheumatoid Arthritis in \n     smokers.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Neal Birnbaum, MD,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                 American College of Rheumatology.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am willing to yield back time so we can get back on \nschedule for a 10:30 vote, if that will be OK with the Senator?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't want to belabor the point. Some of the points the \nSenator makes are very good. Sure, he wants to do more research, but \nstill the fact is the amendment takes dollars away from kids, away from \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  In the children's health care program, 1.4 million American children \nwill lose coverage under the Senator's amendment. That is CBO, that is \nnot me. That is CBO. I do not think we want to take away our current \ncoverage under the program.\n  One minor point that is not relevant to the amendment, but is \nrelevant to the bill, is the Senator talks a little about something \ncalled crowd-out; that is, the number of kids who might not have \nprivate coverage who move to the CHIP program. That happens in every \nsingle program.\n  Do you know what the crowd-out estimate was with the Medicare \nModernization Act, Part D? It was 75 percent. That was the estimate on \nhow much crowd-out there would be for that legislation, which this body \nstrongly supported. It actually turned out to be much less than that.\n  When this program was initially enacted in 1997, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, CBO estimated crowd-out to be 70 percent. It \nwas much less than that. We have asked the CBO Director to design this \nlegislation to minimize crowd-out as well as we possibly can. And he, \nin testimony before the committee, said: You have done a very efficient \njob to minimize so-called crowd-out.\n  So we are cognizant of the point. But the main point is to get more \nhealth insurance coverage for kids. That is what the underlying bill \ndoes.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

About six other Members did as well. \nCould I please be recorded as having voted no? If I were here, I would \nhave voted no on the previous amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was likewise in the committee when we were informed by \nthe chairman and ranking member that we had an extra minute to finish \nthe markup. But the best I can do is add, if I were present, I would \nhave voted no.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I was in a similar situation. I would have \nvoted no had I been here. I was also in the same committee meeting.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I had the same problem the other \nMembers had. If I were here, I would have voted no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as a member of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, we were advised that we would be given leniency on this vote \nthrough our chairman, through communication, I assumed, from leadership \nstaff. We did not come on a timely basis. I would like to be recorded \nas aye. It will not make a difference in the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I was also in Homeland Security. We were \nadvised by the chair that we would be able to make the vote. Obviously, \nwe weren't. I would like to be recorded as voting no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I also was in the Homeland Security markup where we \nwere informed that the vote would be held open so we could finish the \nmarkup. Had I been in the Chamber, I would have voted no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. \nI apologize to my colleagues for any misunderstanding. We had a very \nbusy agenda, important matters that we needed to get done today. I did \nmake a request that the vote be held open. It was the wisdom of the \nChair not to do so. I particularly express my regret to my colleagues, \nfor some of whom this was the first rollcall that they have missed. \nAnyway, for myself, had I been here I would have voted in the negative. \nIt would not have altered the result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I also was detained. Were I here, I would have voted no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I also was at the Homeland Security \nmarkup. I am sure that anyone observing this is surprised that so many \nSenators in one setting, having been notified by the cloakroom, were \nput in a position where they missed a vote. Had I been here, like all \nmy other colleagues, I would have voted aye. As we see, given that so \nmany of our colleagues have to make this point to the Chair, we have \nnow exceeded by far any time that might have been saved by cutting off \nthe vote in an atypically short way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as did my other committee colleagues, I \nmissed the vote. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very happy to see the Committee on \nHomeland Security doing its work. I think the country is very pleased. \nThank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let us have order in the Senate. May we have \norder in the Senate, Mr. President.\n  Why all this consternation about this vote? Were Senators promised \nthey would have a chance to vote? They were. And we did not hold the \nvote for them. Now, we ought to do what we promised Senators we will \ndo. Shame.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. As one of the most leading Parliamentarians in the history \nof the Senate, would it be appropriate by unanimous consent to reopen \nthat vote so that the----\n  Mr. BYRD. May I ask the Senator, what did he say?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator if he feels it is appropriate to reopen \nthe vote so that vote could be reconsidered and Senators could----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would object to that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, can I be heard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very sorry people missed the vote. We \nwaited almost 25 minutes for the vote. And I am sorry. Senator \nLieberman certainly did not do anything intentionally. He thought the \nvote would be held open. I have checked with the very loyal staff we \nhave in the cloakroom, and there was a misunderstanding between the \ncloakroom and Senator Lieberman.\n  But, regardless, I hope everybody understands we have to have some \nsemblance of order around here. We are doing our very best to save \npeople time. One of the things we are doing to save time is have a vote \nstart on time and end on time. A 15-minute vote is a 20-minute vote. \nThis vote was cut off approaching 25 minutes.\n  So I am sorry that people missed the vote. I had one Senator tell me \nit was the first one they missed. It is a favor to that person. I say \nthe first vote I missed took a lot of the pressure off.\n  This vote passed, I think, 2 to 1. It is not a very difficult issue. \nI am so sorry that people are disturbed about following the rules here. \nThat is what we are doing.\n  I appreciate my friend from Montana because if he had not objected, I \nwould have.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, apparently this was a sorry situation. \nNobody's vote would be changed. Why can't we ask unanimous consent that \nthese votes be counted?\n  Mr. REID. Because I will object to it.\n  Mr. HATCH. You would object to it?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. What was the Senator's request?\n  Mr. HATCH. I was requesting that we should consider unanimous consent \nthat their votes be counted.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, Mr. President, we cannot do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. We cannot do that. I hope Senators \nwill pay a little more attention.\n  Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I had the floor, and I yielded to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I was caught in this situation a while back, and I have cast more \nvotes than any Senator in the history of this Republic, and it was \ncalled on me. I regretted that.\n  Sometimes I think we get a little bit too hung up. The Senate is a \nbody in which we talk to one another, we talk with one another, we \nthink about one another, and we think of one another's problems. We can \nget a little bit too hung up on the time on a vote. A vote is \nimportant. The people send me here, the people of West Virginia--who \nhas the floor, Mr. President?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, you do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana yielded time to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Now, the people send me here to vote. That is my right. Of course, I \nought to get here, be here on time. But the people expect Robert Byrd--\nthe people of West Virginia expect Robert Byrd--to vote. So let's do \nnot get hung up on 60 seconds or 30 seconds or whatever it is. Let's \nhave a little bit of accommodations to one another.\n  I hope I am not speaking out of turn. I hope I am not saying too much \nor making too much of nothing. But I am sent here to vote, and I hope \nwe will accommodate one another. We Democrats ought to accommodate one \nanother, and we ought to accommodate the Republicans, too.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Montana yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to all my colleagues, we have been in \nthis session now for 7 months. This is something we all decided would \nbe best for the institution. We all decided this. This is not something \nwe put into effect yesterday. And I say to my dear friend, the senior \nSenator from Utah, I understand his compassion. He does not want to \nmiss votes. But if we decide to change it this time, then we will be \ndoing it every time people miss a vote.\n  Now, it would be different--I say to my friend, the ``Babe Ruth'' of \nthe Senate, Senator Byrd, this was not 60 seconds, a few seconds off. \nWe have a lot of work we need to do here. The vote was a 15-minute \nvote. We waited almost 25 minutes. So I think we have been fair.\n  The one I feel worst for is my friend Joe Lieberman, because he felt \nthey had the time to get here. I have checked with the cloakroom, and \nthey emphatically said there was a misunderstanding, because they have \na time, they know when the vote is going to end. When everybody calls, \nthey say there is no extension, the time the vote will end is such and \nsuch a time. They have been instructed to do this because one Senator \nmissed a vote Monday. So the cloakroom has instructions as to what to \ndo.\n\n  I am sorry people missed votes, but remember, this is not anything \nthat is new. It is something that has been going on for 7 months, and \nwe have a lot of work to do. I respectfully suggested to one of my \nfriends, who said: Well, we wasted all this time; we could have gone \nahead and waited for everybody--but while we are waiting for everybody \nto come and vote, some people got here on time, and other people have \nwork they want to do, waiting for people to get here on time.\n  So I think it is best for the body that we stick to our 15 minutes, \nplus 5 minutes. That is when the vote will be called. For those of us \nwho have had service in the House--many of us have--you do not have any \nwiggle room in the House. That vote is over, and you are through. It is \ndone mechanically, and you are all through. We do not want it to be \nlike the House. This is the Senate, and we want it differently. That is \nwhy we have a 5-minute leeway.\n  I appreciate everyone's thoughtfulness, but I am certainly trying to \ndo the right thing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield \nfor one observation?\n  I understand totally that the leader has to have a firm principle. \nAnd when it is one person who is late because they are off the Capitol \ngrounds or something such as that, I think that is totally legitimate. \nThis is something I have never seen since I have been here for 14 \nyears, where a committee is meeting, with important business, and the \ncommittee chairman gives people the comfort that the vote is going to \nbe held, and so you have around 12 people who have missed a vote.\n  I ask one more time for, just this once, a unanimous consent and will \npropose a unanimous consent that we reopen this vote.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say this. I have heard everyone loudly and clearly \nbecause we have spent a lot of time on this. Just so everyone has the \ntotal, absolute understanding, in the future--Senator Leahy; Senator \nLieberman; Senator Baucus; Senator Kerry; Senator Dorgan; Senator Byrd, \non Appropriations--if Appropriations chairmen tell you there is more \ntime to vote, there is not any. Therefore, if the chairman is trying to \nkeep you there, and the time is running, walk out of there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those Senators who missed the vote \nbecause of the misunderstanding with Senator Lieberman be allowed to \ncast their votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, Mr. President. That has never been done.\n  Mr. REID. Never been done. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request is not in order and prevented by \nthe rules.\n  Mr. REID. We tried, Kay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest we get back to business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2587\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Gregg is ready for a \nvote with respect to his amendment, so I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual form for debate prior \nto a vote in relation to the amendment, that no amendment be in order \nto the amendment prior to the vote, and that upon the use of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand this is a 45-minute vote?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It may be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, can we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the Gregg amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will claim my time, but I want the Senate \nto be in order before I begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Senate for the \nSenator from New Hampshire. Will the Senate be in order.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment essentially says what the \nbill is titled and represents to be, which is that the funds will go to \nchildren, to help children get health insurance. This amendment says \nthat adults can continue to be insured by States at the reimbursement \nrate, which is the Medicaid rate, should they so desire, but that a \nhigher rate should not apply to adults by putting adults under a \nchildren's program.\n  The problem is very simple. States are gaming the system. They are \nusing the SCHIP program, which gives a higher reimbursement rate, to \nbring into the system adults, and then they take that money and \nbasically use it in their general fund. This is not appropriate. It is \nnot appropriate, first, to have adults funded under a children's health \ninsurance program. Secondly, it is not appropriate to give States the \nability to game the system in this manner.\n  So I hope people will vote for this amendment, which essentially \nkeeps the program for children and actually expands the number of \nchildren who can be covered by saving some money that is being spent on \nadults.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there are legitimate issues being raised \nabout how adults are dealt with in this SCHIP bill. First of all, \nadding adults to SCHIP should have never been allowed. It was wrong \nwhen the Clinton administration started it. It was wrong when the Bush \nadministration continued it. Stopping it is the right thing to do.\n  However, I think this amendment goes too far, too fast, and I \nencourage my colleagues to consider how the Finance Committee bill \ndeals with adults. Let me be clear, in some States, the problem is \nextreme. Some States cover more adults than children. The even bigger \nproblem is that several States that cover large numbers of adults have \nvery high rates of uninsured children. This problem started under the \nClinton administration but the Bush administration made it worse. Both \nthe Clinton and the Bush administrations helped push Humpty-Dumpty off \nthe wall. Now, it is our job to try to put the piece back together.\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\n  Advocates for parent coverage under SCHIP argue that in order to get \nkids covered, you have to cover the parents. I don't buy that argument; \ntoo many States that are covering parents are still among the worst in \nthe country at covering kids. But the Congressional Budget Office does \nbuy the argument that covering parents will get a few more kids \ncovered. And they estimate that a reduction in parent coverage will \nlead to a reduction in children covered, so we have to be cautious. \nThis amendment will lead to children losing coverage.\n  So what we have done in the Finance Committee bill is to say to \nStates covering parents: put up or shut up. You either cover the kids \nor you get a far smaller Federal match for the parents you want to \ncover.\n  The bill before us eliminates coverage under SCHIP for childless \nadults by 2009. It eliminates the enhanced match for parents currently \ncovered under SCHIP and prohibits new state waivers for parents. CBO \nestimates that it would reduce spending on adults by $1.1 billion. \nFurthermore, the easiest way to put the emphasis back on lower-income \nkids is to refocus the SCHIP program away from adults. The Finance \nCommittee bill redirects States' efforts to low-income children.\n   Our bill covers 1.7 million kids in Medicaid who are currently \nuninsured. We are not talking about adults. We are not talking about \nmiddle-income kids. We are talking about 1.7 million of the poorest \nuninsured kids in this country.\n  As a former Governor, I am sure the Senator from New Hampshire can \nappreciate that concept. If your States will only get a lower matching \nrate for covering adults in SCHIP but significant financial incentives \nfor covering low-income kids, where will you direct your energies? The \nparent policy in the Senate bill represents a reasonable compromise and \nI urge my colleagues to oppose the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, four quick points. No. 1, we clearly want \nto bring this program down for kids, and this legislation does that. \nNo. 2, the current expansion--not to point fingers anywhere--is \nbasically as a result of the waivers this administration has given to \nStates. That is the main reason for others. That is the main reason we \nhave expansion to cover adults in States. No. 3, we are addressing this \nin this bill. We cut back on adults in this bill. But No. 4 is, we want \nto draw the line here a bit, and not totally cut adults off cold \nturkey, but, rather, childless adults would be cut back and zeroed out \nafter 2 years, but then parents are phased down. But CBO has said when \nyou do not cover parents, then you are also not covering some kids. The \ngoal is to cover kids. I think the legislation is a fair, good, solid \nway to restrict coverage of adults, and I urge my colleagues, do not \nsupport this amendment, which is too draconian and goes too far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2593 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n     Coburn, and Mr. DeMint, proposes an amendment numbered 2593 \n     to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the legislation for \nallowing me to go forward with this alternative amendment at this time. \nI think it is important on an issue of this nature that we have a full \ndiscussion and amendments offered and debated and voted on. That helps \nus get to a conclusion on a major piece of legislation such as this \nwithout it turning into a late-night ugly session.\n  This alternative is intended to show we fully intend to be supportive \nof the SCHIP program--the program for children's health insurance--and \nwe want it to be done in a responsible way and in a way that actually \nincreases funding to make sure the children it wants to cover are \nactually covered.\n  This is an effort of good faith to come up with an alternative that I \nthink is better, in many ways, than the underlying Baucus and others \nlegislation. I have, on two previous occasions, indicated that part of \nmy big problem is the pattern of the coverage going up and up, to the \npoint where States that have waivers now, and under the underlying \nbill, middle-income children would be covered, and that we are on a \nsteady march to say all children ought to be covered regardless of \nincome.\n  I think that is a mistake. I think it is unaffordable. It will lead \nto disruptions, and it will lead to significant tax increases, or it \nwill start to put our children against the parents. The way the House \nproposes to pay for this underlying bill is to go after funds in the \nMedicare Program. At least this bill doesn't do that, but it does pay \nfor the increases with tax increases--yes, tobacco tax increases, but \nstill tax increases which, in my opinion, are not going to be \nachievable and which will leave a huge hole in the funding.\n  So what we do in the alternative is to direct our attention at the \ncore mission, which is low-income children--not adults, not middle-\nincome children. We pay for it in a way that would equalize this \nMedicaid coverage in our States. So I think overall it is a very good \nalternative.\n  We have a number of Senators who are cosponsors of the legislation \nand would like to speak on it as we go forward this morning and into \nthe afternoon.\n  Again, we all support reauthorization of the so-called SCHIP program, \nand we want to ensure that children have access to good, quality health \ncare insurance. How you do it is the difference. We have come up with a \ndifferent alternative that does it better because it puts kids first. \nIt makes sure we take care of the kids, not an ever-growing list of \nkids and not a lot of adults. I\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nthink you have to do it in a fiscally responsible way so we don't have \nhuge holes develop in the outyears. One of the problems in the \nunderlying bill is that down the road, in 6 years or so--and before \nthat, in my opinion--the numbers are not going to add up. We will not \nhave the income we were going to have, and there will be an explosion \nof the costs that are involved. So I think we should pay attention to \nthe impact not just next year, or in 5 years, but it will be the \nsituation in 7 or 8 years. That is what this bill does.\n  We have heard talk in the last couple of days from our friends on \nother side of this issue that they are concerned about the insurance \nfor kids. I believe that, but that will be done in this bill. Let me \ntell you why. Under the Kids First amendment we sent to the desk, 1.5 \nmillion more children will be covered under SCHIP in 2017 than under \nthe Baucus bill. Yes, that is a long way down the road, but the truth \nof the matter is we need to look at these programs over a 10-year \nperiod, not just the 5 years, because the commitments we make in that 5 \nyears will continue to go up. We need to think about what is going to \nbe the impact. You heard it right. It would cover actually more \nchildren in 2017. The Kids First bill will cover 3.6 million children. \nThe Baucus bill will cover 2.1 million children in the SCHIP program.\n\n  The Kids First bill actually spends more money than the Baucus bill. \nYou heard that right. We increase SCHIP spending by $9.3 billion over \nthe next 5 years, expanding coverage to 1.3 million new children. \nBecause the Kids First Act doesn't rely on any kind of budget gimmicks, \nas the underlying bill does, we can actually spend more on SCHIP over \nthe budget window than the underlying bill does. I think it is \nimportant we focus on honest budgeting.\n  I realize honest budgeting is quite often in the eye of the beholder, \nbut I don't think anybody would deny there are budget problems with the \nunderlying bill. The Baucus bill has a long-term budget point of order \nagainst it, meaning that over the long-term it will significantly \nincrease the budget deficit. The reason for this is the budget bill \nrelies on the declining revenue. When you have the amount of increase \non tobacco products included in the underlying bill--61 cents a pack \nfor cigarettes and, of course, the same application to other tobacco \nproducts, including cigars--you are going to get less revenue than you \nproject. People will not be able to afford it. They are going to change \ntheir habits. Some people would say that is going to be good for \nhealth. OK. I am not a big advocate of smoking, even though I smoke a \npipe privately. Nobody here has ever seen me do that.\n  I think we have to be honest about what is going to be the impact the \nnext 5 years. This will also contribute to an increase in Medicaid \ncosts because the Baucus bill reduces SCHIP funding in those outyears, \nand CBO assumes those kids will have to be moved to Medicaid. That is \npart of what is going to be happening. More children will be under \nSCHIP under the bill and more children will be on Medicaid and more \nchildren will be coming off private health insurance. I don't think we \nwant to do at least two out of those three things.\n  So I think it is important we cover the children in the low-income \narea and that we cover more children. That is what this alternative \ndoes. This amendment doesn't have a dime in tax increase to pay for it. \nIt would not be subject to a point of order. Then it does a couple of \nother very important things. Unfortunately, last year, we never could \nget action on the associated health plans, the small business health \nplans.\n  We were so close, and yet because of some objections, perhaps \nlegitimately, that the sponsors could not agree on, we did not give \nthis opportunity to small business women and men to cover more of their \nemployees, and they would like to. I talk to small business men and \nwomen. They don't understand why they cannot form groups and provide \ncoverage to these low-income, entry-level workers, a lot of times unwed \nmothers, high school dropouts.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why we do not give that \noption. It would probably be a way that 10 to 20 million more working \nadults could get coverage. We do include in the bill the small business \nhealth plans.\n  We also include important health savings accounts reforms and provide \nfor a study of ways to increase health insurance coverage through \nreforms to our Tax Code to enhance tax equity.\n  The Kids First Act is an amendment that all my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, should support. The amendment enrolls \nmillions more kids in SCHIP than the underlying bill and does it in a \nfiscally responsible way and avoids budget points of order. It will not \nexpand Medicaid spending.\n  I urge my colleagues to actually take a look at this legislation. We \nhave spent a long time coming up with it. I actually thought this was \nprobably the bill that would come out of the Finance Committee when we \nstarted. We had bipartisan meetings. We talked about, OK, do we want to \ndo this health insurance program for children? Yes, we do. How much do \nwe want to do, and how are we going to pay for it? Of course, there \nwere those in the beginning who said: No, we need a lot more than this. \nWe need an increase of $50 billion or more.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, feels strongly \nabout that point. He made his point legitimately. He said: Should we \njust decide how many we want to cover and don't worry about the cost \nand just do it? No, I think we also have to worry about the cost of \nthese programs and how it is going to be paid for, who pays for it.\n  One of the things that worries me because we have this gap in the \noutyear funding--we have had pictures of children on the floor of the \nSenate. I have some grandchildren I worry a lot about--a 9-year-old \ngrandson and two little girls, just under 6, and one 3. My daughter is \na working mom full time, partially so her family can have insurance \ncoverage, and her husband is a small businessman, an entrepreneur. It \nis not easy working full time as a mom, having two children, and \ndealing with other issues she really cares about, such as charitable \nactivities. I worry about them. She is working to make sure they have \nthis coverage, but I am worried they are going to be saddled with the \ncost of this extra coverage.\n  So let's do what we can affordably while complying with the \nunderlying core mission of making sure that low-income children have \naccess to this coverage. Generally speaking, my daughter and her \nhusband would be considered middle-income Americans. That is what they \nwould consider themselves. Yet they are having to work to get the \ncoverage they want and barely making it so that others can have \ncoverage who are making probably almost as much money as they are. I \ndon't know, the way things are going, they might be eligible for this \nprogram. I don't think they should be.\n  Common sense is what is called for. We have a long way to go. There \nis no question the House bill is going to be much larger and funded in \na much worse way. By putting down this marker, giving Members a \nlegitimate alternative that a lot of Senators have been involved in, is \na good way to go.\n  I urge Members to support this alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, have I been recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I recognize the Republican leader.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Republican leader yield for a moment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Vermont like to ask the Senator \nfrom Kentucky a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I said, will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader wishes to \nbe on the Senate floor, and I ask the Senator from Kentucky if he will \nyield for a brief quorum call so that the distinguished majority leader \ncan be on the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will be happy to accommodate that \nrequest. It was my understanding that\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\nthe majority leader was on the way, and I thought I would get started. \nBut I will be happy to wait until he walks through the door, if that is \nthe request of my good friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Lott amendment the pending \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that it be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2599 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 2599 to amendment \n     No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate Judge Leslie Southwick \n               should receive a vote by the full Senate)\n\n       At the end of the substitute, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NOMINATION OF \n                   JUDGE LESLIE SOUTHWICK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Judge Leslie Southwick served on the Mississippi Court \n     of Appeals from January 1995 to December 2006, during which \n     time he was honored by his peers for his outstanding service \n     on the bench.\n       (2) The Mississippi State Bar honored Judge Southwick in \n     2004 with its judicial excellence award, which is awarded \n     annually to a judge who is ``an example of judicial \n     excellence; a leader in advancing the quality and integrity \n     of justice; and a person of high ideals, character and \n     integrity''.\n       (3) The American Bar Association has twice rated Judge \n     Southwick well-qualified for Federal judicial service, its \n     highest rating. As part of its evaluation, the American Bar \n     Association considers a nominee's ``compassion,'' ``open-\n     mindedness,'' ``freedom from bias and commitment to equal \n     justice under law''.\n       (4) In 2006, the President nominated Judge Southwick to the \n     United States District Court for the Southern District of \n     Mississippi.\n       (5) Last fall, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously \n     reported Judge Southwick's nomination to the full Senate for \n     its favorable consideration.\n       (6) In 2007, the President nominated Judge Southwick to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       (7) The Administrative Office of the Courts has declared \n     the Fifth Circuit vacancy to which Judge Southwick has been \n     nominated a ``judicial emergency'' with one of the highest \n     case filing rates in the country.\n       (8) Judge Southwick is the third consecutive Mississippian \n     whom the President has nominated to address this judicial \n     emergency.\n       (9) Both Senators from Mississippi strongly support Judge \n     Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit, and they \n     strongly supported his 2 predecessor nominees to that \n     vacancy.\n       (10) The only material change in Judge Southwick's \n     qualifications between last fall when the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee unanimously reported his district court nomination \n     to the floor, and this year when the Committee is considering \n     his nomination to the Fifth Circuit is that the American Bar \n     Association has increased its rating of him from well-\n     qualified to unanimously well-qualified.\n       (11) While on the State appellate bench, Judge Southwick \n     has continued to serve his country admirably in her armed \n     forces.\n       (12) In 1992, Judge Southwick sought an age waiver to join \n     the Army Reserves, and in 2003, he volunteered to serve in a \n     line combat unit, the 155th Separate Armor Brigade. In 2004, \n     he took a leave of absence from the bench to serve in Iraq \n     with the 155th Brigade Combat Team of the Mississippi \n     National Guard. There he distinguished himself at Forward \n     Operating Base Duke near Najaf and at Forward Operating Base \n     Kalsu.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit should receive an up \n     or down vote by the full Senate.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in 1992, a Mississippi lawyer named \nLeslie Southwick wanted to serve his country in the Armed Forces. At \n42, he was too old to do so, but service to others is a duty that \nLeslie Southwick has always taken very seriously, whether in the \nJustice Department or on the State bench or with Habitat for Humanity \nor in doing charity work for inner-city communities. So in 1992, 42-\nyear-old Leslie Southwick sought an age waiver to join the U.S. Army \nReserves. The country had the good sense and the good fortune to grant \nhis request.\n  Leslie Southwick continued to serve in the Armed Forces after he was \nelected to the State court of appeals in 1994. He conscientiously \nperformed his military and judicial duties, even using his vacation \ntime from the court to satisfy the required service period in the \nMississippi National Guard.\n  In 2003, Lieutenant Colonel Southwick volunteered for a line combat \nunit--this is 2003--a line combat unit, the 155th Separate Armor \nBrigade. His commanding officer, MG Harold A. Cross, notes that his \ndecision ``was a courageous move, as it was widely known at the time \nthat the 155th was nearly certain to mobilize for overseas duty in the \nnear future.''\n  Colleagues such as attorney Brian Montague were not surprised. This \nis what Brian Montague had to say: ``Despite love of wife and \nchildren,'' Leslie Southwick volunteered for a line combat unit over a \nsafer one ``because of a commitment to service to country above self-\ninterest.''\n  In August of 2004, Leslie Southwick's unit mobilized in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. His commanding officer states that he \ndistinguished himself at forward operating bases near Najaf. Another \nofficer, LTC Norman Gene Hortman, Jr., describes Southwick's service in \nIraq as follows:\n\n       Service in a combat zone is stressful and challenging, \n     oftentimes bringing out the best or the worst in a person. \n     Leslie Southwick endured mortar and rocket attacks, travel \n     through areas plagued with IEDs, extremes in temperature, \n     harsh living conditions--the typical stuff of Iraq. He \n     shouldered a heavy load of regular JAG officer duties, which \n     he performed excellently. He also took on the task of \n     handling the claims of the numerous Iraqi civilians who had \n     been injured or who had property losses due to accidents \n     involving the U.S. military. . . .This involved long days of \n     interviewing Iraqi civilian claimants, many of whom were \n     children, widows, and elderly people, to determine whether \n     the U.S. military could pay their claims. Leslie always \n     listened to these Iraqi claimants patiently and treated them \n     with the utmost respect and kindness. He did this not just \n     out of a sense of duty, but because he is a genuinely good \n     and caring person. His attitude left a very positive \n     impression on all those that Leslie came in contact with, \n     especially the Iraqi civilians he helped. This in turn helped \n     ease tensions in our unit's area of operations . . . and \n     ultimately saved American lives.\n\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hortman concludes that Leslie Southwick ``has the \nright stuff'' for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals--``profound \nintelligence, good judgment, broad experience, and an unblemished \nreputation.'' Lieutenant Colonel Hortman added:\n\n       I know him and can say these things without reservation. \n     Anyone who says otherwise simply does not know him.\n\n  Stuart Taylor writes in the National Journal that Leslie Southwick \n``wears a distinctive badge of courageous service to his country,'' and \nthat he ``is a professionally well-qualified and personally admirable'' \nnominee for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Southwick does not seek thanks or notoriety or charity for his \nmilitary and other civic service. He asks to be judged fairly--to be \njudged on the facts, to be judged on his record. It is the same \nstandard he has applied to others as a judge, a military officer, a \nteacher, and a mentor.\n  It is a standard for which he is well known and admired. By that \nstandard, he is superbly fit to continue to serve his country, this \ntime on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  His colleagues know this, as do his home State Senators. His peers \nwithin the State bar know this. They honored him as one of the finest \njurists, declaring him ``an example of judicial excellence; a leader in \nadvancing the quality and integrity of justice; and a person of high \nideals, character, and integrity.''\n  The American Bar Association knows this as well. It has twice given \nhim its highest rating, ``well qualified,'' and in so doing found him \nto be exemplary in\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\nthe areas of compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias, and \ncommitment to equal justice under law.\n  Even Democrats on the Judiciary Committee know this because just last \nfall, all of them--again, all of them--looked at his record and \napproved him for a lifetime position on the Federal bench.\n  But it appears that Democrats on the committee may now apply a \ndifferent standard to Judge Southwick. A member of the Democratic \nleadership who serves on that committee states that what is \n``determinative'' is whether a judicial nominee is perceived to be \nfair.\n  The notion that perception, rather than reality, will be dispositive \nin evaluating a nominee is at odds with the principle of the rule of \nlaw. And it is not fair to manufacture a false impression of someone \nthrough insinuation and innuendo, and then use that falsehood to defeat \nhim. In the case of Judge Southwick, the sudden ``perception'' about \nhis fairness is driven by those who do not even know him, and it is \ndisproved by his long record by those who know him very well.\n\n  All nominees deserve to be treated with dignity, but a selfless \npublic servant and veteran such as Leslie Southwick deserves to be \ntreated with respect as well. It is disrespectful for the same members \nof the Judiciary Committee who unanimously supported his nomination \nlast fall to now turn around and unanimously oppose him. There is only \none change in Judge Southwick's credentials between last year and now. \nThe ABA, hardly a bastion of conservatism, has actually increased--\nincreased--its rating for him from ``well qualified'' to ``unanimously \nwell qualified.'' Now what that means is that every single member of \nthe ABA committee evaluating Judge Southwick's credentials for the \nFifth Circuit, every single one of them gave him the highest possible \nrating--a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating.\n  A party-line committee vote would not be a ``perceived'' flipflop or \na ``perceived'' injustice but an actual one. This is not a question of \nperception; this is a question of actually ignoring the reality of this \nman's record. It would make clear that despite the promise of a new \nstart on judicial nominations that the Senate majority leader and I \nhave been hoping for all year, when push comes to shove, we will treat \nnominees unfairly based upon a manufactured perception.\n  This sad standard is not only unjust, but it is actually unwise. As \nwe all know, once established, precedents in the Senate are extremely \ndifficult to undo. Establishing a third-party perception standard on \nthe Southwick nomination will be bad for this Congress and really, more \nimportantly, I will say to our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, bad for future Congresses regardless of who is in the White \nHouse and which home State Senators support a nomination. The standard \nwe set now with a Republican in the White House and a Democratic Senate \nmight well be the standard applied in a future Congress if, for \nexample, it were a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic Senate.\n  Because such a decision will affect us all, and for the worst, it is \nappropriate for the Senate collectively to express its view on whether \nit wishes to go down this path, whether it wishes to undo the good work \nand good will that brought us back from the precipice just a few years \nago. It is for that purpose that I have offered the sense of the Senate \non the Southwick nomination. I encourage my colleagues to review it, to \nreview the record, and to think long and hard about whether we want to \ndeny this good man an opportunity for a vote here in the Senate.\n  Again, Mr. President, at the risk of being redundant, let me just say \nthat the majority leader and I have been working hard all year to try \nto improve the confirmation process. I think that is a very wise thing \nfor the majority to do because someday they may have the White House \nagain, in spite of the best efforts of people like me. Once we \nestablish an unrealistic standard for the treatment of qualified \njudicial nominees for the circuit court, there will be a great \ntemptation on the part of the other side of the aisle to apply the same \nstandard in the future.\n  There are plenty of grievances from the past. We have had Republican \ncomplaints about Democrats and Democratic complaints about Republicans. \nI guess the fundamental question is, When do we stop it? When do we \nstop it? For the sake of the institution, for the sake of the country, \nand for the sake of the party that may not currently occupy the White \nHouse, when do we stop?\n  It strikes many of us that the Leslie Southwick nomination is a good \ntime to stop it because we all know he is extraordinarily well \nqualified. There is really no serious argument otherwise. And if we \ncan't stop it now, Mr. President, when will we stop it?\n  So I think this will give us an opportunity to let all of the Senate \nexpress themselves, rather than just a few in one committee, on the \nappropriateness of this nominee.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia is going to be recognized now; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can interrupt my friend for a minute, \nwill the Senator yield to me to make a brief statement regarding the \nstatement made by the distinguished Republican leader, to be followed \nby 5 or 6 minutes by the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and then the Senator from West Virginia would, of \ncourse, have all of his time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes, I will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it appears at this time that we will move to \ntable this sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by my friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader. I appreciate his advocacy for Judge \nSouthwick. Some of us have a different opinion about Judge Southwick, \nand that has been made a part of the record already. I would refer to \nthe Congressional Record of July 20, where I gave an extended statement \non Judge Southwick and why I thought he should not be confirmed, but \nthere will be more time to talk about this.\n  We have done a very good job, working with Senator Leahy, in clearing \njudges. We have a bump in the road with this one, there is no question, \nand the bump is still there. I admire and appreciate the work done by \nthe Senator from Vermont because we have been through some difficult \ntimes in recent years with the Judiciary Committee. Senator Leahy will \nmake a brief statement about some of the travails we have had.\n\n  Judge Southwick has had a hearing. It is up to the Republicans--\nnamely, Senators Lott and Cochran--whether they want to vote in that \ncommittee. That is so much more than was given to Senator Clinton's \nnominees, where about 70 never even had a hearing.\n  So we will have more time to debate this at a subsequent time, and \nsometime later today I will confer with my distinguished Republican \ncolleague, the minority leader, to determine when I will offer a motion \nto table or Senator Leahy will offer a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. First, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia for his usual courtesy and giving me some time to \nspeak. I have had the privilege of serving almost 33 years--a third of \na century--with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. Of \ncourse, I know my 33 years pale in comparison with the time he has \nserved.\n  While the distinguished Republican leader is on the floor, he and I \nhave worked closely together on many things. I will not make comments \nabout crocodile tears and all that, but it is interesting that he spoke \nof Judge Southwick being passed out unanimously last year. He forgot \nthe fact that when he was being cleared for a vote by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate, a Republican objected.\n  The Republican leader has forgotten that the Senate has confirmed 25 \nnominations for lifetime appointments this year--more than were \nconfirmed, for example in all of 2005 with a Republican chairman and a \nRepublican majority.\n  The leadership over there has forgotten that we Democrats--we \nDemocrats--have confirmed more of President Bush's nominees for any \ngiven period of time while we have been in\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\ncharge than the Republicans did. We have had three different \nleaderships in the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate itself \nduring the time President Bush has been in office. During the time that \nthe Democrats have been in charge, we have actually confirmed more of \nPresident Bush's nominees than the Republicans did.\n  The weeping and gnashing of teeth going on makes me think that \ncongressional Republicans love to shut down the Government and seem \nintent on manufacturing excuses to do so. In 1995 Newt Gingrich was so \nupset by the door he had to use on Air Force One--most people would be \nthrilled to fly on Air Force One--that he shut down the Government. \nWhen they were in the Senate majority a few years ago, Senate \nRepublicans insisted on a 40-hour debate on their own President's \ncourt-packing scheme. And then we found out that during that time they \nwere stealing our computer files. The then Republican leader had to \nfire one of his own aides for stealing computer files from the \nDemocrats. So the weeping and gnashing of teeth that is going on leaves \na little bit to be thought about.\n  The Senate has confirmed 20 circuit court nominations and 125 Federal \njudicial nominees during the 2 years I have been Judiciary Committee \nchairman. Compare that to the numbers of the Republicans. During the \nBush presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges and more \ntotal judges have been confirmed, in less time, while I served as \nJudiciary Chairman than during the longer tenures of either of the two \nRepublican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities. Yet you \nwould think that somehow we are holding up everybody.\n  I would point out that it was the Republicans who pocket-filibustered \nover 60 of President Clinton's nominees. I think we have stopped two or \nthree of President Bush's. Sixty-one. The distinguished Republican \nleader said he hoped all this would stop. Well, we are not going to do \nwhat they did. Incidentally, 17 of those were circuit nominees. Let me \nmention their names for those that have short memories: Barry Goode, \nHelene White, Alston Johnson, James Duffy, Elena Kagan, James Wynn, \nKathleen McCree Lewis, Enrique Moreno, Allen Snyder, Kent Markus, \nRobert Cindrich, Bonnie Campbell, Stephen Orlofsky, Roger Gregory, \nChristine Arguello, Andre Davis, and Elizabeth Gibson. These are just \nsome of the ones they pocket-filibustered.\n  Now, on Judge Southwick, I had him on the agenda. I took him off the \nagenda at the request of the Republicans. We actually had him on one \ntime, and we did not get enough Republicans to show up to make a quorum \nto vote on him. I took Judge Southwick's nomination off the agenda at \nthe request of Republican Senators. Neither the junior Senator from \nMississippi nor the senior Senator from Mississippi nor the \ndistinguished Republican leader has asked me to put him back on the \nagenda.\n  I am growing somewhat tired of the statements being made publicly \nabout delay, many of which I do not attribute, of course, to my \ncolleagues, so I put Judge Southwick's nomination back on the agenda \nfor tomorrow.\n  I must say--and I will close with this--this makes me think about the \nfirst time I was chairman of this committee in the first Bush \nadministration, knowing that we come from a time when the Republicans \nhad pocket-filibustered 61 of President Clinton's nominees and one they \nhad voted out almost unanimously from the committee whom they then \nambushed on the floor, the distinguished James Graves, an African \nAmerican who then became chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, \nthe distinguished African American whom they humiliated by voting him \nout of committee, with no real objections, and then, in lockstep, with \nno notice, voted him down on the floor of the Senate. One of the most \ndistinguished African-American jurists in the country, the Republican \nleadership decided to vote him down. But notwithstanding that, I tried \nto change that.\n  I remember when the Republicans asked me to have a hearing on a \ncontroversial nominee of theirs. They were very concerned about it. I \nactually came back from Vermont, which is not an easy thing to do in \nAugust, to leave that beautiful State--it is like leaving the beautiful \nState of West Virginia during the month of August, one of our prettiest \ntimes--but I left Vermont, came back, and held a hearing on that \nnominee so we could arrange in the first week of September to get him \npassed. Do you know what happened, Mr. President? Do you know what the \nreaction of the Republicans was? They trotted out a member of their \nleadership to tell the press how terrible it was that I held a hearing \nduring August, even though that was the only way they were going to get \ntheir nominee through. That was hypocrisy.\n  Mr. President, with that, I will just point out again that there is \nno question of the numbers. The Democrats have moved more of President \nBush's nominees more quickly than his own Republicans have when they \nhave been in charge. If we are able to confirm just the five \nnominations for lifetime appointments to the federal bench currently on \nthe Senate's executive calender, I will have presided over the most \nproductive 2-year period for judicial confirmations in the last 20 \nyears, with 130 confirmations. Let us stop the crocodile tears. Let us \nstop the hypocrisy. Let us stop the grandstanding and worry about what \nis best for the courts. This administration has played politics with \nthe judiciary more than any of the six administrations I have served \nwith--not for but with--and I think one example of their knowing what \nis best for law enforcement, what is best for the judiciary, is this \nadministration's strong support of the current Attorney General.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was 122 degrees in Baghdad today. The \nIraqi Parliament thinks it is too hot to work and has gone on vacation. \nOur soldiers don't have that luxury. Our brave men and women continue \nto patrol the hot streets of Baghdad in full battle gear. They will get \nno vacation. They continue to risk their lives in the sand and in the \nheat, supposedly to give the Iraqi politicians ``breathing room'' to \nbuild a political consensus. Those politicians are now on vacation.\n  A majority of Iraqis now say that we are doing more harm than good by \nstaying in their country. Perhaps I should say that again. A majority \nof Iraqis now say that we are doing more harm than good by staying in \ntheir country.\n  Every day brings more terrible news of American casualties. What has \nthe response from this administration been? ``Wait. Wait. Give us more \ntime.'' Our President has been saying that for the last 4 years, and it \nis clear that he will keep on saying it for as long as we keep on \naccepting it. So I am angry. This is my 49th year in the Senate. I \nbelieve it is the first time I have said that. I am angry. Every Member \nof this body should be angry, angry that the Iraqi Government is on \nvacation while our troops, American troops, U.S. troops--your troops, \nmy troops, our troops--fight and die in their civil war.\n  Everyone, including General Petraeus, agrees that there is no \nmilitary solution in Iraq. None. Iraqis will have to make the hard \npolitical compromises necessary to force a national consensus. Nothing \nthe U.S. military does can force them to make those compromises. But, \nrather than work to craft a political solution, the Iraqi Government \ndecided to take the entire month of August off.\n  And where has our Congress been? I am deeply disappointed that the \nSenate has once again failed to have a real debate on the issue of the \nwar in Iraq. There is no issue currently facing our Nation that more \ndeserves the attention of this body, and yet we continue to have empty \nprocedural votes instead of passing legislation that would mandate a \nchange of course, as a large majority of Americans want. We are, in \nfact, charged by the Constitution to have that debate, and yet we wait. \n``Wait until September,'' the critics say. ``Wait until the new \nreport.'' How many reports must this Congress read before we see the \nhandwriting on the wall? I, for one, am tired of waiting. The American \npeople are tired of waiting. Our brave soldiers and their families are \ntired of waiting.\n  The President and his supporters in Congress are fond of painting a \npicture of what would happen following a precipitous withdrawal from \nIraq, and they paint with a pallet of fear. But\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\ntheir picture is not reality. It is easy to win an argument against a \nstraw man, but we are not calling for a precipitous withdrawal. The \nproposal that 53 Senators voted in favor of recently called for a \nphased redeployment of troops to focus on the threats that truly face \nus, not a hasty and radical complete pullout.\n  I opposed this terrible war from its beginning, but I recognize we \nare there now and some actions can't be so simply undone. Our first \npriority must be that of protecting U.S. interests, and the simple \ntruth is that we do have vital interests in the region. The question is \nhow to best protect those interests.\n  The President of the United States, President Bush--and I say this \nmost respectfully--the President says that al-Qaida wins if we leave \nand that if we pull out the terrorists will follow us home. Let me say \nthat again. The President says that al-Qaida wins if we leave and that \nif we pull out the terrorists will follow us home. Al-Qaida is our \nenemy, but are we really defeating them by trying to referee a \nsectarian civil war between Shia and Sunni that has been going on for \nover 1000 years? The President's own advisers now admit that al-Qaida \nis as strong today as it was before 9/11.\n  Al-Qaida is resurgent in Pakistan and Afghanistan. When the President \nof the United States took his eye off the ball and diverted our \nnational attention from Osama bin Laden and his terrorist training \noperation in Afghanistan, the President dealt the security of the \npeople, the American people, a major blow.\n  Iraq did not attack the United States on 9/11. No Iraqi, not one--not \none--was involved in those attacks. Al-Qaida may now be in Iraq. But it \nwas not there before we went in and handed them a new training ground \nfor fresh recruits.\n  More importantly, al-Qaida is not the core of the problem in Iraq. \nAl-Qaida is not the core of the problem in Iraq, no matter how often \nthe President says that it is. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell \nsaid recently that al-Qaida was only 10 percent of the problem in Iraq. \nThe real problem in Iraq is not al-Qaida, the real problem is the \nmultiple civil wars that are raging: Shiia versus Sunni, Shiia versus \nShiia, Sunni versus Kurds.\n  The argument that if we lose in Iraq, they will follow us here is \npure hogwash. Nonsense. Did you hear me? I say, did you hear me? Let me \nsay it again. The argument that if we lose in Iraq, they will follow us \nhere is pure hogwash. H-o-g-w-a-s-h. Hogwash.\n  I have heard that time and time again. If we lose in Iraq, they will \nfollow us here. That is absolutely hogwash. Nonsense. What is keeping \nterrorists from coming here now? Tell me. So we heard the argument: If \nwe lose in Iraq, they will follow us here. Well, what is keeping the \nterrorists from coming here now? Certainly not the fact that our \nmilitary is in Iraq. Our military was not in Iraq when hijackers with \nbox cutters flew planes into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. \nHave we such short memories? I saw those planes attack the World Trade \nCenter. I have not forgotten it.\n  Keeping our troops in Iraq is not what is going to keep a terrorist \nattack from happening again. So I repeat that. Keeping our troops in \nIraq is not what is going to keep a terrorist attack from happening \nagain. The real threat, the real threat, the real threat is in Pakistan \nand Afghanistan, as the President's own advisers admit.\n  Principled people in this country, let me say that again, principled \npeople--in other words, people of principle in this country and in the \nCongress are calling for a change in strategy, not because they are \nweak, not because they are scared, not because they are callously \npolitical, they are calling for a change because it has become patently \nobvious that what we are doing is not making us safer, it is making us \nless safe.\n  They are calling for a change because it has become patently--p-a-t-\ne-n-t-l-y--obvious that what we are doing is not making us safer, it is \nmaking us less safe.\n  Now, as U.S. officials absolutely wake up to the resurgence of al-\nQaida in Afghanistan and urge President Musharraf's Government to crack \ndown in Pakistan, we confront great anger in the region. I think that \nstatement is entitled to a rehearing.\n  Now, as U.S. officials slowly wake up to the resurgence of al-Qaida \nin Afghanistan and urge President Musharraf's Government to crack down \nin Pakistan, we confront great anger in the region.\n  Our continuing occupation of Iraq has damaged our credibility and \naroused suspicions about the depth of the U.S. commitment to the \nsovereignty of other nations. There is a lesson here. It is this: If \nyou are marching in the wrong direction or if you are fighting the \nwrong fight, unflinching persistence is not a sign of strength, it is a \nsign of stupidity.\n  If you are marching in the wrong direction or fighting the wrong \nfight, unflinching persistence is not a sign of strength, it is a sign \nof stupidity. Yet amazingly we hear plans of continuing for 2 more \nyears our pointless, senseless occupation in Iraq.\n  I said it was wrong in the beginning. It was wrong from the start. It \namazes me when we hear plans of continuing for 2 more years our \npointless, costly, senseless occupation in Iraq.\n  The seas are rising and our present course is headed for an iceberg. \nTurn around. Turn around, Mr. President. Turn around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the current health \ncare discussion on the floor and take a few minutes to address this \nvery important issue.\n  SCHIP is a great program that is called Kid Care in the State of \nFlorida, where it has very successfully, over the past many months, \nbeen a good program in reducing the amount of children without health \ninsurance.\n  I support its reauthorization as proposed in the McConnell-Lott \namendment. I support a straight reauthorization because the \nalternative, the Democratic bill before us, greatly steers the program \naway from the original intent. The intent of this program is to provide \nhealth care for low-income children.\n  Instead, the underlying bill redefines SCHIP. It redefines the \nprogram to make SCHIP cover more adults and people well outside \npoverty. This bill will make families make a choice. A family of four \nmaking $82,000 a year could remain on private insurance, paid out of \npocket, or they could take public-funded insurance.\n  That kind of choice will cost Americans about $37 billion a year by \nthe year 2012. This kind of expansion of Government-controlled health \ncare is counter to any effort to reform our health care system. The \nquestion comes: Why are we considering this expansion? Why take the \nfocus away from the children SCHIP was intended to serve? SCHIP has \nsuccessfully achieved what it set out to do and has significantly \nreduced the number of uninsured children.\n  Last year, 6.6 million children received health insurance through \nSCHIP. Rather than change the purpose of the program, as Democrats have \nproposed, we should refocus SCHIP on finding and covering the low-\nincome children who are eligible for the program but are not yet \nenrolled.\n  The McConnell-Lott bill turns the focus to the original purpose, \nhelping ensure children from low-income families have health insurance.\n  Instead of an expansion toward Government-run health care, the \nRepublican alternative authorizes the program to keep the focus on \nchildren and invests an additional $14 billion into the program.\n  Additionally, the Republican alternative provides important practical \nand easily implemented reforms to make health insurance more affordable \nfor the uninsured. Part of the problem with SCHIP right now is we can't \nfind all the kids who need it. The Republican alternative commits $400 \nmillion over the next 5 years for improved outreach programs. This \nmoney targets enrolling low-income children. These funds target the \nlow-income children SCHIP was meant to help. We have a problem when we \nhave children who have no health insurance but yet we have not reached \nout and touched them. This new reauthorization will put the funds \nbehind going out and doing the outreach necessary to ensure that all \nchildren who are uninsured\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nwho could be covered under this program are reached.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Baucus plan will \ncover 600,000 new uninsured individuals at higher income levels, but \nthen the plan would also cause 600,000 privately insured individuals at \nthese income levels to drop their private coverage. Ironically, the \nBaucus bill drives people out of private insurance and into Government-\nsponsored health care. Under the Baucus plan dependency on government \nhealth care will increase significantly. In total, CBO says that 2.1 \nmillion individuals will move from private coverage to Government \ndependency if the Baucus plan is implemented. This isn't the health \ncare reform Americans want. This isn't in the best interest of our \ncountry.\n  Before we take this step of moving people on to Government plans, \nlet's have a broader debate. Let's think about the ramifications and \nthe opportunities. We can do better by providing Americans with more \nindividual freedom and more choice while increasing health care \ncoverage and security. We can help more Americans to own their own \nhealth care, take it with them from job to job, and partner with States \nto make that policy more affordable. That is why some of my colleagues \nand I have introduced the Every American Insured Health Act.\n  The principles for health care reforms our bill addresses include tax \nequity. It is indefensible that Americans who buy insurance on their \nown are treated differently than those who buy insurance through their \nemployer. Our bill amends the Tax Code to treat all Americans equally \nwhen it comes to the purchase of health insurance. The effect will be \nthat health care will be accessible and affordable whether an employer \noffers coverage. As the name implies, the Every American Act provides \neveryone in America, regardless of income or employer, refundable flat \ntax credits--$2,160 per individual or $5,400 per family. The Wall \nStreet Journal wrote in a recent editorial that restoring the tax \nparity of health in dollars would go a long way to improving the system \nand increasing access and affordability for everyone, including the 16 \npercent or so who today find themselves uninsured. It would also allow \nindividuals to buy policies themselves rather than rely on their \nemployers and take those policies with them wherever they work.\n  The flexibility the bill we propose is founded on the belief that \nGovernment's role should be to organize the health care marketplace and \nthen let consumers make choices. We provide the opportunity for every \nindividual family to choose the health care policy that best meets \ntheir needs. When you have a competitive marketplace, you get more \nchoices, better care, and lower prices.\n  To get that market, our bill improves health insurance affordability \nin State marketplaces. It gives incentives, not mandates, for State \ninsurance marketplace reform to create more options and more \ncompetition. The bill provides States the incentive to make health \ninsurance more affordable and accessible by establishing a process to \nassist States in ensuring competitiveness. States will be given a menu \nof choices such as the incentive to establish a statewide insurance \npool or establish high-risk mechanisms such as high-risk pools or \nreinsurance and improve their markets to enable insurance plans to \noffer at least one affordable policy valued at 6 percent of median \nincome. This approach achieves the goals of universal coverage in a way \nthat is truly American, by decreasing the number of uninsured \nAmericans, thereby lowering health care costs for all Americans. This \nprovides every American the right to choose their own health insurance \nplan.\n  Finally, our approach authorizes incentives for States to reform \ntheir health insurance markets to ensure the availability of \naffordable, high quality health insurance for individuals and for \nfamilies. For too long Congress has skirted the real issue that affects \nAmericans and their health insurance. It is time to start finding \nsolutions to the problems instead of putting Band-Aids on programs and \nsystems that are truly failing all Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject the Baucus amendment, reject efforts to \nredefine and socialize our health care system. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport the McConnell-Lott amendment because it helps ensure that \nchildren in SCHIP continue to be served by the system and the program \nthat was intended to serve them, broadening those who today could \nbenefit from the program but are not there utilizing the opportunity \nbefore them because we have not reached out to them, and then also, as \nwe do this, let's broaden the debate over fixing our entire health care \nsystem. It is a debate that is long overdue. It is a debate America \nyearns for. I look forward to engaging in that debate, how we continue \nto provide America the best and most sophisticated health care in the \nworld but to make sure that every American participates in the \nopportunity to receive that best of health care we have to offer \nanywhere in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Senator Cantwell is on her way to speak. \nShe is not here. I see the Senator from Pennsylvania on the floor. I \nknow he desires to seek time. I urge the Chair recognize the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania who I think is going to speak about 8 to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2599\n\n  I have sought recognition to speak briefly on the nomination of Judge \nLeslie Southwick to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I have \nspoken extensively about Judge Southwick in the past, but I do want to \naddress a few remarks on the pending amendment offered by Senator \nMcConnell and myself on the sense of the Senate that Judge Southwick \nought to have an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate. It is my \nhope that we will proceed on judicial confirmations in a spirit of \nbipartisanship. Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and \nI have worked very closely on that in this Congress, as he and I did in \nthe 109th Congress when I was chairman and he was ranking member.\n  This body has seen some very controversial moments: in 2005, with \nfilibusters against President Bush's nominees and the threat at that \ntime to invoke the ``nuclear'' or ``constitutional option'' which would \nhave brought the Senate to a standstill. We avoided that showdown and \nthen worked harmoniously, in a dignified way, with Supreme Court \nnominations in 2005 and 2006. It is my hope we will find a way through \non the Southwick nomination. I hope we do not have this vote degenerate \nback to a party-line vote without the kind of independent thought the \nSenate ought to exercise in evaluating the question which is whether \nJudge Southwick ought to have an up-or-down vote.\n  Judge Southwick has an extraordinary record. I do not use that word \nlightly. He served on the Mississippi State appellate court for some 12 \nyears. He has been a party to some 8,000 decisions. He has written 985 \nopinions himself. He is rated unanimously well qualified by the \nAmerican Bar Association. He passed out of the Judiciary Committee, \nunanimously, for a district court judgeship. He has been an adjunct \nprofessor at a law school. He was clerk of the Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit, so he has experience there. In a very unusual way, in \nhis fifties, he volunteered for the Judge Advocate General's Corps, \nvolunteered to go to Iraq and served there in a heavy combat zone.\n  I have had occasion to talk to him at great length, and he is a \nscholarly, intellectual, experienced lawyer, an experienced jurist. I \nhave put into the Record detailed statements about many of his \ndecisions where he has found in favor of the so-called little guy, \nfinding in favor of people who have tort claims for injuries sustained, \nin favor of employees in employment cases.\n  The only two situations which have been brought up in opposition to \nJudge Southwick are two cases where he concurred in an opinion, two \nopinions which he did not write. In one of the opinions, it was a \ncustody case, and the court found in favor of the father. There was a \nreference to the ``homosexual lifestyle'' of the mother which is a term \nthat is used with some frequency. I think there could be more \ndiscretion in that language, but the\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\ncourt found in favor of the father because of his community roots, \nbecause of the home he could provide for the child, and because of the \nfather's income. The important thing about that case was its procedural \nposture. That was the sum and substance of that matter.\n  There was a second case where the issue involved a racial slur which \nadmittedly was reprehensible. It was said by an individual, a public \nemployee, about a fellow worker who was not present at the time. The \nsubject did not hear the slur. There was an immediate apology. There \nwas no workplace disturbance. The issue then came before an \nadministrative review board that found that although the comment was \nreprehensible, under these facts it was not sufficient to support \ntermination of employment. That issue then came back before the \nappellate court on a very narrow question. The question was whether the \ndecision by the administrative board was arbitrary and capricious, \nwhich is lawyer talk for whether there was any evidence to support the \nboard's ruling. The court felt that there was evidence to support the \nconclusion that there was not sufficient grounds for firing. The case \nthen went to the State Supreme Court, and the State Supreme Court \nremanded on the limited question about having more detailed factual \nfindings. But the Supreme Court of Mississippi agreed that the incident \nwas not sufficient to warrant a permanent firing.\n  That is the sum and substance of the objections. When you look at the \nfull record, you see that Judge Southwick ruled in a case where the \ntrial judge had excluded evidence that the victim of a crime was gay, \nand Judge Southwick upheld the ruling that that would have been \nprejudicial, defense counsel should not have been permitted to ask that \nof a victim, seeking only to prejudice the jury. It did not having any \nbearing on the issue involved in the case. This supports the conclusion \nthat Judge Southwick, in the custody case to which I referred, did not \nhave any demonstrate traits or indications that he was biased or \nprejudiced or unjudicial in his approach to that particular issue.\n  It is my hope we will take a careful look at Judge Southwick's record \nbefore casting votes. I understand there will be a tabling motion. We \nshould look at the underlying merits.\n  When we had the controversy in 2005, I urged my colleagues in the \nstrongest terms to take a look at whether they thought individually \nfilibusters were warranted against Priscilla Owen and Bill Pryor and \nJanice Rogers Brown. I asked my Republican colleagues to take a look on \nthe merits as to whether it was warranted to talk about a ``nuclear'' \nor ``constitutional option.'' I make the same plea here today. Let's \nnot be bound by a party-line vote, ignoring the merits.\n  There have been comments on the floor today, as there have been in \nthe past, about President Clinton's nominees being improperly treated. \nI agree with that today, and I agreed with that when it happened, and I \ncrossed party lines. I have crossed party lines to vote for President \nClinton's judicial nominees when they were qualified. I hope we will \ncome in the Senate, take a look at the individuals, take a look at the \nmerits, and not move for a party-line consideration, and not avoid a \nvote, to have the man bottled up in committee. That smacks of the days \nof Senator Jim Eastland, when the Judiciary Committee bottled matters \nand prevented the Senate from voting on them.\n  I can understand there are some Senators who do not want a vote on \nJudge Southwick, but that is what we are here for. That is the pay \ngrade--to vote. So I urge my colleagues to look at this matter on the \nmerits. I hope we do not have our actions disintegrate to the kind of \ncontroversy we had a couple years ago, but that we can move beyond this \nto the kind of bipartisanship which Senator Leahy and I have been able \nto muster for the Judiciary Committee.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for allowing me to speak. I know the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Lindsey Graham, has a few comments. I \nexpect he will be very brief on the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might inquire of the Senator from South \nCarolina, how long does he wish to speak? We have been trying to go \nback and forth.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Because that will be three on your side in a row before \nwe go back to this side. Is the Senator speaking on the same subject?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I urge the Presiding Officer to recognize the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. I appreciate the \nrecognition. I wish to speak very briefly on the matter pending before \nthe Senate.\n  The whole idea of the confirmation process of judges has taken a kind \nof wrong turn for many years now. There is plenty of blame to go around \nfrom both parties. But one thing I wish to have happen in the Senate--\nfor the good of the country--is to make sure when well-qualified people \ncome before this body, they are put through their paces about their \nqualifications, their abilities, their disposition, their demeanor, \ninquiring as to how they think and what drives their thinking, but, at \nthe same time, understanding that our job is to confirm people who are \nsent over by the President--elections do matter--and that when we look \nat a nominee, we part the politics of the last election, of the next \nelection, and focus on the individual who will serve for a lifetime.\n  It is important to understand the nominee before this body, Mr. \nSouthwick, has been serving as a judge in Mississippi since 1995. As \nSenator Specter indicated, he has been involved in thousands of \ndecisions in a concurring role, and he has offered hundreds of \ndecisions.\n  He joined the military, and volunteered, as a lieutenant colonel to \ngo serve in Iraq at the age of 52.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously considered him well \nqualified, saying very glowing things about his temperament, his \ndisposition. This is someone who has been looked at by people outside \nof politics and found to be extremely well qualified.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Carolina yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to ask the Senator two or three questions about \nthis nominee after he completes his remarks. I would be glad to wait \nuntil the Senator finishes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely. I will be glad to.\n  I do not want to infringe on the 5 minutes. But the bottom line, I \nguess to my good friend from Illinois, is, I do not think this is about \nqualifications at all. I think this man has lived a good life in the \nlaw and seems to be a good person, from what I understand from everyone \nwho has spoken on his behalf. It is not a question about a character \nflaw or a lack of legal ability. It is about two cases.\n  As Senator Specter said, one case involved a racial slur that is a \nhorrible term. The administrative review board, which took up that \nmatter--should the person be fired because of this racial slur--found \nit was not a repeated event--under Mississippi law, it has to be more \nthan an isolated event--it did not disrupt the workplace, there was an \napology made and accepted, and the board found that this was not \nsufficient to terminate the person.\n  It went to the Mississippi Court of Appeals, and they, under \nMississippi law, had to determine whether the administrative review \nboard made an arbitrary and capricious decision, whether there is any \nevidence to support the court's finding, and they upheld the court's \ndetermination.\n  Judge Southwick, in that case, commented many times about how \noffensive the word was, and there is no place in society for this word \nto be used without it being considered to be offensive. But judges have \nto apply the law, not emotions.\n  I guess the question I have is, is there any belief on anyone's part \nthat his concurrence in this upholding of the administrative review \nboard suggests that he, as a person, is racially biased? Does this \nsuggest he is defective as a person, that he harbors animosity against \none group or another? I\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\ndo not think anybody can reasonably conclude that.\n  Judges sometimes have to be involved in emotional decisions. If \npeople want to march through Jewish communities holding the Nazi flag, \nthat is horrible, but under the law that is allowed on certain \noccasions.\n  The second case is about the term ``homosexual lifestyle.'' It was a \ncustody case, and he was in an appellate review situation. That term \nwas used in the underlying decision by the judge in terms of custody, \nbut that term has been used in many other cases throughout the country \nin different jurisdictions.\n\n  I guess my question is, do you take these two cases, where he \nconcurred, to say there is something wrong with him? Did he do \nsomething out of the mainstream of the law? And does it show that he, \nJudge Southwick, is somehow not the type person you would want to sit \nin judgment of your case or your family?\n  I think what we are doing to him is incredibly unfair. There is no \nreal evidence at all this man, as a person, harbors animosity against \none group versus the other. Quite to the contrary, from everything I \nsee in the record, he has been a very decent, scholarly man who has \napplied the law in an admirable fashion.\n  So I wish we could allow an up-or-down vote on this fine fellow.\n  I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from South Carolina will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under the previous administration of President Clinton, \nthere was considerable controversy in the Judiciary Committee about \nwhether President Clinton's nominees would receive a hearing and a \nvote. In scores of instances, nominees were given neither.\n  Can the Senator from South Carolina put in the Record now whether \nJudge Leslie Southwick was given a hearing before the democratically \ncontrolled Senate Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I believe he was, yes. I believe so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, he did receive such a hearing.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I attended the hearing. I thought it was very fair at \nallowing both parties to ask Judge Southwick questions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. All right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since the sense-the-Senate resolution before us suggests \nJudge Southwick's name be removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand brought directly to the floor, I wish to ask the Senator from South \nCarolina, has there been any effort by any Democrat on the committee to \nstop Senator Specter or any Republican from calling Judge Southwick's \nname for a vote in the committee?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As I understand it, the problem with Judge Southwick is \nthat it appears there has been some effort to try to get the \nMississippi Senators to nominate someone else. And there has been the \nsuggestion he could be a district judge but we want someone else to be \nthe court of appeals nominee. I do not think that is a process we \nshould engage in. So there are a lot of politics behind this \nnomination. We should not allow that to happen. We should not basically \nhold hostage the ability of the Senators from Mississippi and the \nPresident to put someone forward. If we think they are not qualified, \nvote them down. But playing politics, trying to change the nominating \nprocess, I do not think is kosher. And I think that is what is going \non.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My question directly is this: Is the Senator aware of any \neffort to stop Senator Specter or any Republican Senator from calling \nJudge Southwick's nomination for a vote in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. But I am aware of an effort to get Judge Southwick \nreplaced with another person more acceptable to the Democratic majority \nand, basically, to take away from the President the ability to nominate \na well-qualified person for this slot and, basically, neutralize the \ntwo Mississippi Senators, who I think have chosen wisely. I think that \nis politics that is dangerous for us to play, and I wish we would not \ndo it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to ask the Senator to yield for a question. I \nsee Senator Leahy has come to the floor.\n  I can say for the record--he can back me up--not only was Judge \nSouthwick given a hearing--which many nominees in the previous \nadministration were not given a fair hearing, I believe; and I think \nall present would say--there has been no effort to stop Senator Specter \nor any Republican from calling this nomination for a vote.\n  I wish also to ask the Senator from South Carolina, is he aware of \nthe fact that the only African-American Congressman from the State of \nMississippi, the Magnolia Bar Association, which represents most \nAfrican-American attorneys in Mississippi, and the major civil rights \ngroup have expressed their opposition to the nomination of Judge \nSouthwick?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I understand there is some opposition from African-\nAmerican elected officials. What I would say to that is, being a son of \nthe South, I am very sensitive to all of this. I have lived all my life \nin South Carolina, and I understand the sins of the past. They are very \nreal. I can remember growing up. My dad owned a bar where African \nAmericans came into our bar and they had to buy their products to go. I \nremember that very well as a young man. I see things changing for the \nbetter, and we have a long way to go.\n  But what I see here, I say to my good friend from Illinois, is a man \nwho has lived his life very well, who has been part of the solution, \nnot the problem, who has never used the robe to impose arbitrary \njustice, who is trying to be a constructive member of the Mississippi \njudicial community, who has worked hard to make something of himself, \nand he is being accused of something he is not.\n  I do not care where the criticism comes from. What I am going to \nevaluate is what the facts are about this man. This is a good man, who \nhas been a good judge, who is well qualified, and who is being unfairly \nlabeled based on two cases that are being turned upside down. We are \ngoing to ruin the judiciary if we continue to play this game.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is the Senator aware of the fact that, \nformerly, when Judge Southwick was on the calendar as a nominee to be a \ndistrict judge--Republicans were in charge--that when he was up for a \nvote, agreed to by the Democrats, he did not get a vote because of a \nRepublican objection to a slate of judges? Is he aware of that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, I was not. It is my understanding there was no \nobjection on your side about him being a district court judge. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEAHY. To answer that question, he was voted out for a district \ncourt judgeship, an entirely different type of judgeship than a court \nof appeals judgeship. It was in a package to be confirmed, I guess by \nunanimous consent, with the Republicans in leadership, and a Republican \nSenator from Kansas objected to one of the nominees, and, of course, it \nbrought down the package.\n  If I understood the Senator correctly, he was worried about political \nactions. Was he aware--I know he was not able to make a couple recent \nmarkups of the Senate Judiciary Committee, although he is a member. Is \nhe aware of the fact that Mr. Southwick is on the agenda for tomorrow's \nmarkup?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I believe I am aware of that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Was he aware of the fact that he was taken off the agenda \nearlier at the request of the Republicans?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I am, because it is my understanding, if I could \nreclaim my time--and I am sorry to run over, I say to my good friend \nfrom Ohio--here is what I think is happening. I think everybody was OK \nwith him being a district court judge, except maybe somebody on our \nside, and if the problem with this man is he has associated himself in \na way that disqualifies him because of a racial problem, why should he \nbe a district judge? If his problem is that he is against people \nbecause of sexual orientation unfairly, why would he ever be a district \njudge? So the point is that if he was good enough for a district judge \nbased on his qualifications, why shouldn't we give him an up-or-down \nvote in a fair way in terms of the court of appeals?\n  So I think what is going on here is that we are trying to replace the \ndiscretion of the President and the two\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\nSenators from Mississippi to play with a court of appeals nomination of \nMississippi in a way that will come back to haunt all of us, and I just \nwish we wouldn't do it. Give this man an up-or-down vote on the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield on that point, \nwhen the Republicans were in charge of the responsibility of bringing \nforth his record, they never brought forth either the sexual or the \nracial issues that have been raised when he was up for district court \njudge. But we will discuss this tomorrow. I hope the Senator will be \nable to join us at the markup tomorrow. We have had a couple of \noccasions when the President's nominees for judges have been on our \nagenda and Republicans did not show up to make a quorum. I don't know \nif this helps to keep their numbers--I remind the Senator, however, \nthat with the Democrats in charge, the time the Democrats have been in \ncharge, President Bush's judges have been confirmed at a far more rapid \npace and in greater numbers--in greater numbers--than they have been \nunder a Republican-controlled committee or Senate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we will be there at the committee \ntomorrow, and I will yield the remainder of my time so we can get on \nwith other business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we now have had three speakers from the \nRepublican side of the aisle, three in a row, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following speakers be recognized: Senator Harkin \nimmediately, and following Senator Harkin, Senator Cantwell will speak, \nand that would be the request at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the decade since it was first \nauthorized, the Children's Health Insurance Program has been an \nextraordinary success story. It has reduced the number of uninsured \nlow-income children by a third, providing basic health insurance to 6.6 \nmillion children whose parents cannot afford private insurance but who \ndo not qualify for Medicaid.\n  In my State of Iowa, the Children's Health Insurance Program has \nbrought health insurance to nearly 50,000 children. Think about that: \n50,000 kids who otherwise have had no health insurance have had access \nto regular checkups and prompt treatment of illnesses and injuries. By \nany measurement, this is a stunning success.\n  Let me introduce to my colleagues one of those 50,000 success \nstories. Her name is Jenci Ruff. She lives in Knoxville, IA. When she \nwas in the third grade, she began having trouble seeing the blackboard. \nThe school nurse recommended that she have her eyes tested, but her \nparents couldn't take her to a doctor; they were living paycheck to \npaycheck; they had no health insurance. By fourth grade, Jenci still \ncouldn't see the blackboard and she began having headaches.\n  Fortunately, Mrs. Ruff learned about the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. She enrolled Jenci and her little brother. Jenci was referred \nto an eye specialist and received treatment. A year and a half later, \nher vision has greatly improved and her headaches have gone away. Mrs. \nRuff believes that the treatment made possible by the Children's Health \nInsurance Program saved her daughter from going blind. In addition, \nJenci's brother, prior to starting school, was able to get the \nnecessary shots and physicals he needed.\n  As Mrs. Ruff told the Des Moines Register:\n\n       Before, Jenci was having such a hard time to get through \n     her reading. Her grades have improved. Her attitude about \n     school has improved. But if she hadn't had this program--\n\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program--\n\n       we never would have made it to a specialist.\n\n  I am very happy for Jenci Ruff and her brother and her family. But I \nhave to ask, Don't we owe it to all of America's kids? Surely, in a \nhumane, decent society, no child should go uninsured. No child should \ngo without regular checkups and prompt treatment of illnesses and \ninjuries.\n  That is why it is incomprehensible--incomprehensible--to me that \nPresident Bush is pledging to veto this bill because it would extend \ncoverage of the CHIP program to too many kids. How could we extend it \nto too many kids? Instead, the President proposed $4.8 billion in \nadditional funding over the next 5 years. That is less than what is \nneeded just to maintain current enrollments. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the President's proposed funding would cut \n1.4 million children and pregnant women from the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. How could anyone say that Jenci Ruff should have \nbeen cut from the children's health program? It saved her. It saved her \nfrom going blind. Yet we are told we don't have the money for this? \nNonsense. Just think what it would have cost society if Jenci had gone \nblind, God forbid. What would the cost to society have been for her \nlifetime of special education, special schools, seeing-eye dogs, and \nall of the other things? How much more productive is she going to be \nnow? Talk about penny wise and pound foolish.\n\n  The President just doesn't get it. Sometimes, when people are born \nwith a silver spoon in their mouths and they have had all the \naccoutrements, they have had all the wonderful hospitals and doctors \nall their lives, they somehow--and I don't say this of everyone, but \nsome people just can't imagine that everyone is not like them. Well, \nthere are a lot of people who do not have the kind of wherewithal you \nmay have had growing up.\n  So it is not just a public policy choice. I think the choice we have \nis a very moral choice: Do we go forward and extend health insurance to \nmore kids from low-income families or do we cut these children from the \nrolls, condemn them to a childhood without checkups, without decent \nhealth care, without necessary medical treatment--that is, until they \nshow up in the emergency room.\n  We all know too well what it means when a child does not have health \ninsurance, when they don't even have access to basic medical care. \nEarlier this year, the Washington Post reported on 8-year-old Deamonte \nDriver of Prince George's County, MD. Deamonte was suffering from an \nabscessed tooth, but his mother could not afford to take him to a \ndentist. Eventually, the abscess spread to Deamonte's brain. He was \ntaken to an emergency room, but tragically, after two operations and \nmore than 6 weeks of hospital care costing upwards of $250,000, \nDeamonte--this young guy right here, Deamonte Driver--died. He died \nfrom an abscessed tooth. In the 21st century in the United States of \nAmerica, this child died because he had an abscessed tooth because he \nis so low-income, he didn't have health care and mom didn't have any \nmoney. Not until he got so sick that they rushed him to the emergency \nroom, and he died.\n  Why in the world would President Bush want to cut more than a million \nchildren from the rolls of the Children's Health Insurance Program and \nput them in jeopardy--the kind of jeopardy that took Deamonte's life? \nWhat is the real cost of denying children access to basic health care? \nWell, in the case of Deamonte Driver, if you want to know just in money \nterms, a quarter of a million dollars in emergency hospital bills, and, \nmost importantly, it deprived Deamonte of his life and a very happy \nfuture.\n  So you compare the positive fate of Jenci Ruff, who is covered by the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, to the tragic fate of Deamonte \nDriver, who was not. This is not just a tale of two kids and two very \ndifferent outcomes; it is the tale of two choices, the two choices we \nhave to make. So we must make the right choice. Surely some things are \nbeyond partisan disputes and ideological obsessions. Surely we can come \ntogether here to support extending health insurance to more kids in \nlow-income families.\n  Some have argued that the President's pledge to veto this Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is the death knell of compassionate \nconservatism. We have all heard about compassionate conservatism. Well, \nI would just point out that the President's threat of a veto is \ndisappointing. But I would like to note on the positive side that this \nbill enjoys the strong support of a large number of conservatives, \nmoderates, and liberals here in the Senate and in\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\nthe other body, and it has no more outspoken champion than my \ndistinguished senior colleague from the State of Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, who I see just arrived on the floor. So, as I said, this cuts \nacross ideological lines. This is no conservative, liberal, moderate, \nup, down, sideways kind of issue; it is a basic moral issue that we \nhave to confront.\n  I would say on behalf of my colleague from Iowa and so many \nRepublicans who are supporting the Children's Health Insurance Program \nthat compassion and common sense is alive and well with these \nRepublicans. I applaud them for it. With their support, we intend to \nmove forward with a bill that is not only strongly bipartisan but that, \naccording to a recent Georgetown University poll, is supported by 9 in \n10 Americans, including, I might add, the poll said 83 percent of self-\nidentified Republicans. So again, this is not a partisan issue. Now, it \nmay be an issue with this President and his ill-conceived notions, but \nit is not a partisan issue.\n  Lastly, this program has been a Godsend to my State of Iowa. As I \nsaid earlier, 50,000 kids in Iowa are covered who obviously would not \nhave been. We call it the HAWK-I Program in Iowa, the Healthy and Well \nKids in Iowa--the HAWK-I Program. The top income limit for Iowa \nfamilies is 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, which comes to \nabout $34,000 for a family of three, and, along with Medicaid, provides \nprimary and preventive services to 3 out of every 10 Iowa kids. Yet, \neven with these programs I am talking about--Medicaid and HAWK-I--even \nwith those two, an estimated 30,000 to 55,000 Iowa children remain \nuninsured. With the new funding provided in this bill, Iowa could cover \nnearly 15,000 more children over the next 5 years.\n  Expanding this program to cover more low-income kids is not only the \nright thing to do, it is the smart and cost-effective thing to do. We \nknow when children get access to preventive and primary care services, \ngood things happen. Kids get better health outcomes. They stay out of \nthe emergency room. They get better grades. They do better in school. \nOne dollar spent on the CHIP program can save many more dollars in \nhealth care expenses.\n  When an asthmatic child is enrolled in the program, the frequency of \nattacks declines by 60 percent and the likelihood that they will be \nhospitalized for that condition declines by more than 70 percent. If \nanybody has been paying attention, you know that kids' asthma has been \non a huge increase in this country, especially among poor kids. Well, \nthis is one way of keeping them out of the hospital. It is providing \nthem with this kind of preventive coverage.\n  I might also add that the Children's Health Insurance Program is \nvitally important to rural Americans--rural States such as Iowa. The \nsimple fact is that rural kids are more likely to be poor. In the most \nrecent survey, 47 percent of rural children--47 percent--live in low-\nincome families. So they are not only more likely to be poor, their \nparents are less likely to have any access to an employer-based health \ninsurance program. So in the absence of the CHIP program and Medicaid, \nmillions of low-income rural families have no other health insurance \noption, period. They live in small towns. They work for small \nemployers,--mom-and-pop places that employ two or three or four or five \npeople. They don't have the wherewithal to provide employer-based \nhealth insurance. They don't pay a lot of money. But these people are \nhard-working. They go to work every day and they work hard; they just \ndon't make a lot of money. They live in a rural area, so they don't \nqualify for Medicaid, but they don't have enough money to buy health \ninsurance. That is why this program is so important to rural America.\n  Experience shows that rural children are also difficult to enroll in \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, even when they are eligible. \nAgain, low-income parents are often required to travel long distances \nto enroll their kids. In addition to high travel costs, there are \nlanguage and sometimes cultural barriers. For these reasons, I am \npleased that this bill would establish a new grant program to finance \noutreach and enrollment efforts targeted to rural areas.\n  So not only has the Children's Health Insurance Program been a great \nsuccess, it is more important today than ever. In the decade since the \nprogram was created, we know the cost of insurance has skyrocketed and \nthe number of Americans covered has fallen dramatically. But this has \nbeen a safety net for millions of low-income American families.\n  The bill before us would maintain coverage for the 6.6 million \nchildren currently covered and would extend coverage to more than 3 \nmillion more low-income, uninsured children over the next 5 years. That \nis a good and noble goal.\n  Obviously, if I had my druthers, I would say we ought to cover all \nkids--every child in America whose family does not qualify, does not \nhave employer-based insurance, and whose income is such that they \ncannot afford private insurance. They ought to be covered by this \nprogram. They said this would cost $50 billion over the next several \nyears. Well, then they made an agreement to make it $35 billion instead \nof $50 billion. OK, fine. I understand compromise around here. But that \ndoesn't remove the fact that, even with this bill, millions of low-\nincome kids will still be left without health insurance coverage. That \nis our task--to fill that gap. We may not get it done this year, but at \nleast we can get this done this year and, hopefully, we can finish the \njob next year and cover every kid in America with health insurance.\n  It is time to put partisanship, ideology, and politics aside and pass \nthis bill. Hopefully, the President will see more clearly his \nobligation to sign it and not veto it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program and why we need to reauthorize the program \nthat is about to expire in September. I thank Chairman Baucus and \nSenators Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch for their countless hours of \nmeetings before the Senate Finance Committee, which met to mark up this \nbipartisan package. The fact that the bill passed out of committee with \nsuch a bipartisan effort shows people are working on both sides of the \naisle to make children's health care a priority.\n  While my colleagues have talked a lot about what the administration \nhas threatened to do in vetoing this legislation, in fact, as my \ncolleague from Iowa mentioned on the floor, the President's own budget \nrequest doesn't put enough money on the table to take care of those \ncurrently enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. In a \nbipartisan effort in the Senate, we are working across the aisle to say \nwe want to do more, we want to cover about 3.2 million more children.\n  I thank my colleagues and their staff for coming up with this \ncomprehensive bill and moving us further down the way to covering more \nchildren in America, as it is such a priority.\n  Some of my colleagues have mentioned why this is such important \ntiming, and many have mentioned the fact that the bill's authorization \nis expiring in September. I think there is a more important reason. The \nimportant reason is we are seeing the cost of health care continue to \nrise; the fact that premiums have doubled, probably, in the last 5 to 6 \nyears; the fact that insurance now is somewhere between $12,000 and \n$14,000 a year. A family who is at an income of $40,000 a year for a \nfamily of four is finding it very hard to keep pace. Those premiums may \nhave doubled, but I guarantee you their wages and salaries have not \ndoubled. So more and more people are finding themselves in the \nunfortunate situation of not being able to provide health care for \ntheir children.\n  I can tell you, in talking to people from all over Washington State, \nthere is nothing more concerning to the parents than the health of \ntheir child and nothing more scary than to think they may not be able \nto get the health care attention their child needs.\n  So for us, we have a choice--a very smart choice. This is a cost-\neffective bill. If you think about the costs of providing children's \nhealth insurance under this proposal, we are helping families who \ncannot afford private insurance, or cannot find it available in the \nmarketplace, or maybe their employer is not providing it. Now, under \nthis program, with State and Federal\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\nmatching dollars, these families can provide health insurance for \nroughly $2,000 a year per child--maybe a little more or a little less, \nin some instances, for those currently on the program to the new \nenrollees.\n  Think about that. Think about the fact that if you don't have health \ninsurance and a child is delayed in getting that health care or has to \nwait until the last minute to go into an emergency room, I guarantee \nthe cost of a child's visit to an emergency room is probably going to \nbe at least $3,000. The fact that we can make this prudent investment \nfor 3.2 million more children; not only is this about their health and \nsafety for the future, but it is about a plan that helps us in making \nsure we have an efficient health care system, giving those children \ntheir due need.\n  Too many families, as I said, are being forced to go without this \ncoverage. What does that mean? We talk about preventive care and \nmaintenance care. It means that these children are going without \nregular checkups, that they are missing more school than other \nchildren, and that they have to wait in the emergency room to get an \nanswer about something that is a basic illness. It means that if simple \ninfections--such as an ear infection or cavities or asthma or \ndiabetes--go untreated and they spiral out of control, that child may \nfall further and further behind in their academic career. I believe no \nchild should be forced into a special education program because their \nhealth care needs haven't been provided for.\n\n  This bill provides better coverage so we can treat things such as \ninjuries and infections, detect far worse things such as chronic \nillnesses and make sure we are managing the conditions of children \nbefore they get out of control.\n  I know it is upsetting to my colleagues to read things such as: \nUninsured children are four times more likely to delay their health \ncare or that uninsured children are four times more likely to go \nwithout a doctor visit for 2 years or that uninsured children admitted \nto hospitals due to injuries are twice as likely to die while in the \nhospital as their insured counterparts.\n  Those are horrible statistics that point to the dilemma of not \nproviding health care coverage for children.\n  I know my colleagues have been out here on the floor debating this \nissue as it relates to fairness and geography. I tell you, no child \nknows they are somehow prohibited from getting access to health \ninsurance because of geography. Nor should the Senate make the mistake \nin thinking we are making geographic choices.\n  This bill is about flexibility. It starts with the flexibility of \nindividual States because this is a partnership between the States and \nFederal Government in deciding what percentage of the Federal poverty \nline they are going to cover.\n  You can see on this chart the States in white have been more \naggressive in covering a higher percentage of the Federal poverty line, \nand those in the gold color are obviously below 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty line. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why \ncertain States are more aggressive or active in covering their area. If \nyou look at the income and cost of living in these areas, they are \nchallenged by what it takes to maintain a household, to put their \nchildren in school, and to take care of their health care needs. For \nexample, there are parts of the country such as New Jersey, which the \nPresiding Officer is from. If you look at what it takes to provide the \nsame goods and services in New Jersey and compare that with someplace \nlike Arkansas, you are talking about a $13,000 difference in what it \ncosts to provide the same services. In Little Rock, it may cost $30,000 \nfor those goods and services, compared to $43,000 in New Jersey. That \nis why this flexibility is so important in the program. The fact that \nwe allow States to determine its costs and we match that with Federal \ndollars.\n  The second thing we have not focused enough on is the fact that we \nalso have disparity in insurance costs. Look at what it costs to \nprovide insurance. For example, it is expensive to provide health \ninsurance in Seattle, which costs about $13,000 a year. If you look at \nNew York, it is $16,542. So the notion that somehow New York or New \nJersey are getting a better deal because they live in a high-expense \narea of the United States and somehow, even with that extra cost of \ninsurance, we should prejudice legislation from serving those children, \nI say that is a mistake. Every child in America who is covered by this \nhealth insurance program will be healthier, and every child who is \ncovered and healthy will not only be a more contributing citizen to our \nsociety, but also we are going to reduce our own health care costs in \nthe future.\n  So it is a wise and prudent plan to have such diversity in this \nproposal. I ask my colleagues, before they come out and look at \nformulas and offer amendments that basically cut States from having the \nflexibility in these formulas, to consider the geographic disparity and \nthe challenges those individual States face.\n  I believe the Children's Health Insurance Program provides a critical \nbackstop to families. They would rather be in a situation where they \ncould provide the health insurance and care, I am sure, for themselves. \nI have certainly met Washingtonians who have given up their own health \ninsurance to provide health insurance for their children.\n  We need to prevent the number of uninsured children in this Nation \nfrom growing, and this bill, the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nshould be reauthorized and expanded to make sure we do stop the number \nfrom growing and that we attach our principles of covering at least 3.2 \nmillion now and, as we see brighter budget days coming back, covering \nthe rest of the children in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nher usual very thorough and persuasive statement on the floor about the \nneed for flexibility in this important program and the recognition that \nhealth care, similar to everything else, costs differently depending \nupon where you are in the country. I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor reinforcing that important point.\n  The larger point is that today, in this Congress, we are on the verge \nof providing the greatest expansion of health coverage for our children \nsince the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program a decade \nago. I believe--and I don't imagine anybody in this Chamber would argue \nwith this belief--that every child deserves a healthy start in life. \nCertainly, we try to provide that healthy start for our own children, \nand we give a lot of lip service to the idea that we should provide it \nfor all children. Yet far too many children in our Nation--more than 9 \nmillion--do not have health care.\n  I was very proud to help create the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram during the Clinton administration, working on this legislation \nduring my time as First Lady. After the bill passed, I worked to get \nthe word out to try to help more children and their parents understand \nwhat this new program could mean for them and encourage them to sign up \nin the first few years. In the Senate, I have continued that effort, \nfighting to ensure that health care for children has the priority in \nour budget that it deserves.\n  Today, thanks to the work of so many, CHIP provides health insurance \nfor 6 million children. In New York alone, almost 400,000 children \nbenefit from this program every month. With the legislation that \nChairman Baucus and Senators Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch helped to \ncraft, an additional 50,000 children in my State of New York will have \naccess to health insurance coverage.\n  This legislation will also help enroll many of the 300,000 children \nin New York who live in families who are already eligible because their \nfamilies make less than $52,000 a year, 250 percent of the poverty \nlevel for a family of four.\n  In total, across our country, 3.2 million children who are uninsured \nwill gain coverage. That will reduce the number of uninsured children \nby one-third over the next 5 years.\n  If we can afford tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and \ntax cuts for oil companies that are making record profits, I certainly \nthink we can find it in our hearts and our budget to help cover \nmillions of children who deserve a healthy start.\n  I want to be clear. If the President vetoes this bill, he will be \nvetoing\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nhealth care for more than 3 million children. And, once again, the \nPresident will have put ideology, not children, first.\n  Earlier this year, I was proud to introduce legislation with \nCongressman John Dingell to reauthorize and expand CHIP, and I am very \npleased that a number of the ideas in our bill are included in this \nlegislation, such as cutting the redtape and bolstering incentives to \nget eligible children into the program.\n  The legislation also improves access to private coverage and expands \naccess to benefits, such as mental health and dental coverage.\n  This is so important, and I applaud the Finance Committee, under \nChairman Baucus's leadership. Mental health and dental coverage are too \noften left out when we talk about health care.\n  Not far from where I am standing, in the State of Maryland last year, \na young boy, Deamonte Driver, had a toothache. His mother sought help \nfor him to get dental care. She called dentists, but they were not \ntaking any more children on Medicaid or on CHIP. Then she got help from \na legal aid group that helped poor families. They called around. I \nthink they called 27 or 28 dentists who said: Look, our quota for poor \nkids is filled.\n  Deamonte Driver's toothache turned into an abscess, and the abscess \nburst, infecting his bloodstream, and he ended up in the hospital where \ndoctors valiantly tried to save his life from the brain infection that \nresulted from the abscessed tooth that had not been treated. This young \nman died.\n  When one thinks about the loss of a child over something that started \nas a toothache, it is heartbreaking, but it is not by any means an \nisolated case. At the end of Deamonte's life, the State of Maryland and \nthe U.S. Government ended up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars \nfor emergency care, for intensive care, for life support, to no avail, \nfor want of $80 to $100 to find a dentist who would care for Deamonte.\n  I commend the authors of this bipartisan bill for their work and for \nbringing forward a practical, fiscally responsible compromise that will \nallow us to reauthorize this important program and expand coverage. I \nam eager to see that it is signed into law.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the bill we are considering this \nweek fails to include the Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement \nAct, which I introduced with Senator Snowe. Senator Snowe and I have \nbeen working on this legislation for a number of years. This bipartisan \nbill would give States the flexibility to provide the same Medicaid and \nCHIP coverage to low-income legal immigrant children and pregnant women \nas is provided to U.S. citizens. I underscore that. We are talking \nabout legal immigrant children and legal pregnant women.\n  I believe we should provide this flexibility to States because the \ncurrent restrictions prevent thousands of legal immigrant children and \npregnant women from receiving preventive health services and treatment \nfor minor illnesses before they become serious. Families who are unable \nto access care for their children have little choice but to turn to \nemergency rooms, and this hurts children and pregnant women, plain and \nsimple.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to lift the ban on \nMedicaid and CHIP coverage for low-income legal immigrant children and \npregnant women.\n  I also am disappointed that some of my colleagues have expressed \nconcern about States, such as New York, New Jersey, and others, that \nhave chosen to cover children above 300 percent of the poverty level. \nThe legislation we are considering on the floor of the Senate would \nallow New York to continue doing this and receive the CHIP matching \nrate. We should not punish children and their families who live in \nhigh-cost areas and who need health care coverage.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against any effort to undermine the \nextension of health care in high-cost States where it costs more, as we \nheard from Senator Cantwell in her statement on the floor, to provide \nthe same coverage and treatment one would get elsewhere in our country.\n  I am proud we are debating a bill to expand health care to 3.2 \nmillion children, but the fact is, there should be no debating the \nmoral crisis of 9 million children without health care, no debating the \nmoral urgency of strengthening our health care system for children and \nall Americans.\n  Ultimately, the answer will be in a cost-effective, quality-driven, \nuniquely American program that provides health care to every single \nman, woman, and child in our country. But until we get to that point, \nit is imperative that the Congress pass this bill before we go out for \nrecess and send it to the President, with the hope that he will sign it \ninto law.\n  I also wish to mention another issue we urgently need to address. \nLast week, the bipartisan Commission on Care for America's Returning \nWounded Warriors, chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, issued its final \nreport on the need to reform the medical care that our troops and \nveterans receive.\n  The Commission found in an excellent report--it is not one of these \ncommission reports that just takes up a lot of space on the shelf. It \nis very pointed, with six specific recommendations, and it found that \none of the most important ways to improve care for injured \nservicemembers is to improve support for their families. That is why I \nintroduced a bipartisan bill, the Military Family and Medical Leave \nAct, with Senators Dole, Mikulski, Graham, Kennedy, and Brown, to \nimplement a key recommendation of the Commission. We have offered this \nas an amendment to the CHIP legislation.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act was the first bill signed into law \nunder the Clinton administration. It came about because of a lot of \nhard work, led by Senator Dodd in the Senate, and others, and it has \nproven to be enormously successful, helping more than 60 million men \nand women who try to balance the demands of work and family.\n\n  I believe it is time to strengthen the act for military families who \nfind themselves in a very difficult situation. They should be given up \nto 6 months of leave to care for a loved one who has sustained a \ncombat-related injury.\n  Currently, these spouses, parents, and children can receive only 12 \nweeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. All too often, \nthis is just not enough time, as injured servicemembers grapple with \ntraumatic brain injuries, physical wounds, and other problems upon \nreturning from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. In fact, 33 percent of \nactive duty, 22 percent of reservists, and 37 percent of retired \nservicemembers reported to the Commission that a family member or close \nfriend had to leave their home for extended periods of time to help \nthem in the hospital. About 20 percent said family or friends gave up \njobs to be with them to act as their caregiver. This is a step that we \ncan take immediately that will make a real difference.\n  Many of us have been to hospitals in our own country--Walter Reed, \nBrook Army Medical Center--and other places in the world, such as \nLandstuhl in Germany, where we have seen our wounded warriors. There is \nabsolutely no doubt that having the support, assistance, and comfort of \na family member during that process when a young man or woman who has \nserved our country is brought from the battlefield to the hospital \nmakes a big difference in recovery and rehabilitation.\n  I think all of us agree that not only do our men and women in uniform \nmake tremendous sacrifices on our behalf, so do their families. As a \nnation, we have a duty to provide them with the support they deserve.\n  Expanding access to health care for children and providing better \nsupport for our military families comes down to basic values that we as \nAmericans hold dear. I think we all agree every child deserves a \nhealthy start and every man or woman who wears the uniform of our \ncountry deserves more than words of support. The promise of America is \nrooted in these values, and I am very proud to support the bipartisan \nlegislation expanding health care for children, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and Senators from both sides of the aisle who are \nsupporting our military families who are caring for those who have been \ninjured in service to our country.\n  Finally, we hope on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue there will \nbe a\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\nchange of heart; that the President will decide to sign this \nlegislation and relieve the burdens of ill health and inadequate access \nto health care that haunt the lives of so many American families.\n  Mr. President, please support this effort in every way possible by \nsigning the legislation that will be sent to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know Senator Hatch wishes to speak on \nthe underlying bill, the Children's Health Insurance Program. He is on \nhis way to the floor. In the meantime, I see the Senator from Michigan \nis here, a very valuable member of the Finance Committee. She works \nvery hard. She would like to speak on this bill. I thank her for coming \nto the floor. I urge the Chair to recognize the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, again, as I said when we first took up \nthis bill on Monday evening, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis passion in bringing us to this point, he and the ranking member, \nSenator Grassley, as well as, of course, Senator Rockefeller with his \ndeep commitment, and Senator Hatch as well.\n  This is a truly bipartisan effort. It is the way we should be \nlegislating--coming together. It is a compromise. If I were writing a \nbill by myself, I would add more dollars. There are Members on the \nother side of the aisle who would, in fact, do less. But it is a real \ncompromise.\n  I start out today speaking to the fact that it is a compromise. As a \nmember of the Budget Committee, having worked with our chairman and \nmembers very hard to produce a budget resolution that really does \nreflect a new direction in values and priorities, I worked very hard to \nhave us achieve a set-aside of $50 billion for children's health care \nin the budget resolution.\n  In my heart of hearts, that is where I want to be. I also know that \nany significant expansion is a victory not only for us and for the \nSenate but, most importantly, for children and their families.\n  I know there will be an effort to expand to the full amount that we \nall wish to do--I think on this side of the aisle, certainly, that is \nwhere we want to be, and our House colleagues have focused on that as \nwell. But I also know that we have a President of the United States who \nshockingly has said that he will veto providing children's health care, \nan expansion of more than 3.3 million children to receive health care, \nchildren of working parents. The vast majority of them have a mom or a \ndad working one job, two jobs, maybe three jobs trying to make ends \nmeet, but who can't afford health insurance, don't qualify for \nMedicaid, but find themselves desperately wanting to make sure their \nchildren have all that they need, as all of us want as parents.\n  So we are in a situation where the President of the United States has \nindicated he does not share that view. His budget, in fact, is a budget \nthat he proposed to us that would cut children. It would cut children \nwho are currently being provided health insurance. It would eliminate \ntheir health insurance. So on the Finance Committee, we came together \nunder very strong bipartisan leadership to find a common ground, the \nmiddle ground, to be able to increase the number of children who \nreceive health insurance and be able to make sure that the 6 million \nchildren who currently have health insurance are allowed to maintain \nthat insurance. We have come to a compromise, and it is a compromise I \nsupport.\n\n  As we face a potential veto from this President, it is critical that \nwe have the strongest possible bipartisan vote coming from the Senate. \nIf in fact the President follows through and vetoes this, I hope we \nwill have enough votes to override that veto in a strong bipartisan \nspirit, the spirit that brought us together originally when the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program was originally passed. I urge \ncolleagues to support the Finance Committee version and what we have \ndone as the best way to get us real health care expansion for children.\n  Then we will come back, and I will be right back as a member of the \nBudget Committee next year, proposing again that we expand what we are \ndoing to make sure that every child who does not have health insurance, \nwhose family is working hard but doesn't qualify for Medicaid and \ndoesn't have the ability to get private insurance, has the health care \nthey need.\n  We have, I understand, another proposal in front of us, an amendment \nthat would take us backward. I understand Senator Lott has offered an \namendment that has actually been dubbed the CLIP amendment, instead of \nCHIP--Children's Health Insurance Program--CLIP meaning ``Children \nLosing Insurance Program.'' Again, we don't need anything that is going \nto take us backward and have fewer children receiving health insurance.\n  I want to see us make a major commitment to universal health \ninsurance in the greatest country in the world so that everyone has the \nopportunity to be able to receive the health care they need. We should \nbe striving to achieve nothing less than that.\n  The Lott amendment, first, will cut children's health care and take \nus down the road of debating the number of policies individually that \nMembers may support, policies I find great concern about, and policies \nthat will actually increase the number of uninsured, such as expanding \nthe health savings accounts. I urge colleagues to oppose the Lott \namendment because it takes us in absolutely the wrong direction if we \nwant to cover children of low-income working families, and if we want \nto make sure they have what they need to be able to grow up and be \nsuccessful in America.\n  I have also heard debate about the cost of this legislation, and it \nis important to look at what we are talking about in terms of our \nvalues and priorities when we debate any piece of legislation. \nEverything we do here is about values and priorities. Right now, every \nmonth, we are spending $12 billion in Iraq--$12 billion. Regardless of \nhow any one individual feels about the war in Iraq, we are spending $12 \nbillion--not paid for, not a part of the budget--$12 billion a month. \nThis bipartisan effort to provide health insurance for more than 3 \nmillion more American children in this country is a cost of $7 billion \na year--a year; less than what we are spending in 1 month in Iraq. That \nis the right value and the right priority. This is paid for, it is \nresponsible and, most importantly, it is the moral thing to do in the \ngreatest country in the world, in my opinion. This is not too much to \ninvest in the future generation of America.\n  Yesterday, the chairman and I, a number of us, had an opportunity to \nbe with a wonderful woman, Kitty Burgett, from Ohio, who spoke about \nthe importance of children's health care in her family. I know it was a \nvery moving experience to hear her, and I wanted to share her story. I \nhave certainly other stories from Michigan as well, but Kitty came to \nthe Nation's capitol to share what the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram has meant to her and to her family.\n  Kitty is a widow whose husband died in 1990, leaving Kitty and her \ntwo young children without income or insurance. She had Social Security \nsurvivor's benefits, but even that little income put her and her \nchildren over the Medicaid eligibility levels, so they didn't qualify \nfor low-income health insurance because of their survivor benefits. She \nstarted working but earned very little. Nonetheless, she purchased \ninsurance for her children, because like all of us who are parents, she \nwanted to make sure her children had what they needed. She wanted to \nmake sure if they were sick, she was able to care for them with health \ninsurance. So she purchased that insurance, but the cost rose every 6 \nmonths, and she finally had to drop it because of the cost. That is an \nuncommon story in America today.\n  Then along came the Children's Health Insurance Program. Kitty \nimmediately enrolled her children. She had a daughter who was 12. Her \nson was a bit younger. Her daughter then began to develop problems, \nand, ultimately, at age 15, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She \nwas ill. She was hallucinating and she had major mood swings--as those \nof us who are familiar with that disease understand--from depression to \nhighs and hallucinations. She couldn't concentrate at school. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program was there so Kitty could get her \ndaughter some help. It covered her medications and therapy and \neventually some new medicines that brought\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\nher illness under control. Her daughter is now 22 years old. She is \nmarried, she is working, and she is insured. She has an 18-month-old \ndaughter named Scarlet. Kitty says the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram kept her daughter from a lifetime of institutionalization, and, \ninstead, she is a productive, contributing member of society and a \nloving mother to Scarlet.\n  That is what this is all about, giving people in America--parents, \nthe vast majority of whom are working--the ability to provide their \nchildren with the health care they need so they can go on to be \nsuccessful, thriving, contributing adults in America.\n  I might also mention I am very pleased that the bill in front of us \nexpands the opportunity for what is called mental health parity, so \nthat if there is insurance provided, mental health care will be a part \nof that. I congratulate Senator Kerry and Senator Smith, who have led \nthat effort to expand us into the area of more adequately covering \nmental health care for children.\n  This program covers children all over the country. It is interesting \nto note that there are more children uninsured in rural areas than in \nurban areas. This will make sure that, in fact, all of the children who \nqualify under this program are able to receive the health care they \nneed. Right now, in Michigan, we have about 60,000 children who are on \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program and another 90,000 who are \neligible--who qualify right now under the program we wrote--but because \nfunds aren't available for outreach, funds aren't available to do what \nis necessary, we are not able to provide those families, those \nchildren, with health insurance. This bill goes a long way to making \nthat happen.\n\n  I have heard so many stories from Michigan, and it touches your heart \nwhen you think about the way families are struggling to be able to care \nfor their children at the same time costs are going up at every turn. \nWe have folks who are working harder than ever: They turn around and \ngas prices go up; they turn around and their insurance premium goes up; \nthey turn around again and look at the cost of college, and those costs \nhave gone up. We addressed the cost of college last week. Those things \ngo right to middle-income families--student loans and Pell grants and \nthose programs that allow more people to have the opportunity to go to \ncollege and send their children to college.\n  The reality is that on every side families are feeling squeezed--\nworking harder and costs going up and up and up. Children's health care \nis one way, another critical way, we can help families. I think of \nChad, a gentleman in Michigan. He and his wife have two young children. \nHe works for a small landscaping business with an ``off season'' of 3 \nto 4 months in the winter when he is not working. If the couple \npurchased insurance through Chad's employer, it would be an additional \n$300 a month, which for them is not affordable. Through MIChild, which \nis our children's health program, both his sons are able to get the \ninhalers they need for their asthma. How basic, in America, in the \ngreatest country in the world, to make sure that children can handle \ntheir asthma.\n  I also heard from Pam, who is a full-time preschool teacher and \nmother. Her monthly premiums of $384 a month, or over $4,500 a year, \ntake up over one-fifth, or 20 percent, of her pay. Through the MIChild \nprogram, she was able to get the specialized care she needed for her \nyoungest daughter, who suffers from a rare seizure disorder.\n  I could go on and on, but I will not. We all have stories of families \nwho are wanting the best for their children, who want the American \ndream. They do not want to go to bed at night and have to say, please, \nGod, don't let the kids get sick, don't let something happen tonight or \ntomorrow because I don't know what I am going to do--we don't have \nhealth insurance. We are the greatest country in the world and there is \nno excuse for any family finding themselves in that situation.\n  We have in front of us a bill that is a true bipartisan compromise. \nFor me, it is a step in the right direction to universal care, and an \nopportunity to come up with a uniquely American way to provide \nuniversal health care for everyone in America. I believe health care is \na right, not a privilege, in the greatest country in the world, and we \nshould act like that. This important legislation is part of keeping \nthat promise.\n  We started down the road with covering children whose parents are \nworking, who do not qualify for low-income help through Medicaid \nbecause they are just above that limit, but aren't able to get the \ninsurance they need for their families. We have children who qualify \ntoday but, because the resources aren't there, they are not able to get \nthe health insurance they need. This legislation will say that more \nthan 3 million more children--families--in this country will not have \nto go to bed at night worrying about whether their kids are going to \nget sick tomorrow.\n  Finally, I say again that this is about values and priorities. Always \nit is about values and priorities. This is the right thing to do. It is \nthe moral thing to do. When we find ourselves in the situation of \nspending $12 billion a month on the war in Iraq, not paid for, and in \nfront of us we have the ability with $7 billion a year to cover over 3 \nmillion more children with children's health care, the 6 million who \nhave insurance now and over 3 million more in America, responsibly done \nand paid for, this is the right thing to do. It is the moral thing to \ndo.\n  This is a great success story, and I am very hopeful we will see a \nvery strong bipartisan vote when this comes before the Senate for a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside in order that I may offer an \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2554 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2554, now pending \nat the desk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Dole] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2554 to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide for \n a 60-vote point of order against legislation that includes a Federal \n  excise tax rate increase which disproportionately affects taxpayers \n  with earned income of less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty \n                                 level)\n\n       On page 217, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BUDGET POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT \n                   RAISES EXCISE TAX RATES.\n\n       Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\n          ``POINT OF ORDER AGAINST RAISES IN EXCISE TAX RATES\n\n       ``Sec. 316.  (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in \n     the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, \n     amendment between Houses, motion, or conference report that \n     includes a Federal excise tax rate increase which \n     disproportionately affects taxpayers with earned income of \n     less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, as \n     determined by the Joint Committee on Taxation. In this \n     subsection, the term `Federal excise tax rate increase' means \n     any amendment to any section in subtitle D or E of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, that imposes a new percentage \n     or amount as a rate of tax and thereby increases the amount \n     of tax imposed by any such section.\n       ``(b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--\n       ``(1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       ``(2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.''.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, nearly every Senator in this body agrees we \nshould not increase the tax burden on low-income individuals and \nfamilies. Unfortunately, the bill before us would do that by raising \nthe tobacco tax by 156 percent. No other Federal tax hurts the poor \nmore than the cigarette tax, according to the Tax Foundation. Of\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\nthe 20 percent of the adult population that smokes, around half are in \nfamilies earning less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. \nFurthermore, a massive and highly regressive tax increase on an already \nunstable product is a terribly irresponsible way to fund the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  My amendment is very simple. It creates a 60-vote point of order \nagainst legislation that includes a Federal excise tax increase that \nwould disproportionately affect low-income individuals, defined as \ntaxpayers with earned income less than 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level.\n  A majority of my colleagues say they oppose increasing the tax burden \non lower income families, or even oppose tax increases outright. I, \ntherefore, would expect that this commonsense amendment would receive \ntremendous support in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment now be laid aside, with the \nunderstanding we will return to it at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, is about to speak. As he gets ready to speak, \nthere are a couple of points I wish to make. We are still working the \nnumbers on the McConnell-Lott amendment. I wish to point out a couple \nof points.\n  No. 1, the McConnell-Lott amendment, although it is advertised to do \nthis, does not put kids first. Despite prohibiting coverage of \nnonpregnant adults and limiting all State income disregards, this \nlegislation does not cover substantial numbers of additional children.\n  On the surface, they think they may cover 700,000 additional kids, \nbut we are trying to get the numbers from CBO and trying to determine \nthe actual effect; whereas, the Finance Committee bill the CBO has \nanalyzed very carefully it will cover an additional 4 million children. \nAbout two-thirds of those will be on Medicaid, and roughly a million \nwill be under the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The big difference is the different effects between the Finance \nCommittee-passed bill and the McConnell-Lott bill on uninsured \nMedicaid-eligible children; that is, children today who are not on \nMedicaid but are eligible--what is the effect of the two various \napproaches on those low-income kids.\n  Again, I give the caveat we do not have all the actual language and \ndo not have all the numbers exactly crunched by CBO, but a first \nanalysis essentially looks like this. It looks basically like the \nMcConnell-Lott bill will not add many new kids to be covered under \nMedicaid; whereas, the Finance Committee bill has about 1.7 million \nchildren now not covered under Medicaid who will be covered.\n  It is complex legislation we are considering. This is a Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. But as we work to get more kids covered under \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, by definition there are going \nto be more kids also covered under Medicaid--that is children whose \nincome levels are so low they are covered under Medicaid as opposed to \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  There is a huge difference there. It looks like the McConnell-Lott \nbill will not help the very low-income kids who are currently eligible \nunder Medicaid to be covered. In fact, the Finance Committee bill \ncovers at least five times more.\n  I might say a word about the so-called crowding out. Senators are \nconcerned this legislation will have the net effect of encouraging some \nchildren, now under private health insurance, to drop their private \nhealth insurance coverage to take advantage of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program expansion. There are a couple of points about that.\n  No. 1, under the McConnell-Lott amendment, it looks like their so-\ncalled crowd-out ratio is even more adverse from their perspective than \nthe crowd-out ratio under the Senate Finance Committee bill. I don't \nwish to belabor the point. It is roughly the same, roughly 30 percent, \nbut their crowd-out rate is a little greater on a percentage basis as \nto how many kids are there who will drop private health insurance for \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. But theirs is no better in \nfact a little worse, from that perspective.\n  Also, it is important and worth noting that when Congress passed the \nMedicare Modernization Act a few years ago and it provided for the Part \nD benefits for senior citizens, CBO said the crowd-out rate for that \nprogram would be much higher--and it was. I think there is one estimate \nbeginning at 75 percent. I think it dropped to around 40 percent. I \nmight not be entirely accurate on those numbers, but it is much higher \nthan the 30 percent predicted under the Finance Committee CHIP bill and \nalso about the same under the McConnell-Lott substitute.\n  In addition to that, we on the Finance Committee wanted to reduce the \nso-called crowd-out as much as we possibly could. We asked the \nCongressional Budget Office, especially the Director of the Budget \nOffice, Peter Orszag, to tell us on the committee what did we have to \ndo on this legislation; tell us how we should write it to minimize \ncrowd-out as much as we possibly can, be as efficient as we possibly \ncan. He told us what to do and we did it.\n  In the Finance Committee markup, when asked about crowding out; that \nis, kids moving from private health insurance coverage over to the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, he said you have done it \nefficiently. You have done it as well as you can do it.\n  I wish to make the point very clear. While we are helping children, \nwhile we are helping low-income kids get health insurance--as we \nclearly should--we also do not want to disrupt the private industry any \nmore than need be.\n  It is important to remember that States are given power to decide how \nthey want to administer the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is \nup to the State. Some States add it to Medicaid. Some States have \nseparate programs. Most States use health insurance companies to \nadminister the health insurance program, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, with copays and deductibles, and so forth. So those \nwho on the surface might be concerned if their ideology is it should be \nprivate health insurance, not the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nshould not be too concerned, frankly, because we have gone the extra \nmile to make sure that so-called crowd-out is minimized as much as we \npossibly could.\n\n  I will have other points to make later on about the McConnell \nsubstitute. Basically, I wish to say it states that if you are at 200 \npercent poverty or a little above 200 percent of poverty, despite what \nwe anticipated when we passed this legislation in 1997, I am sorry, you \ncan't go above 200 percent if you want to have the benefit of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Programs match rate, which is a little more \nbeneficial to the States than the Medicaid match rate. That is not \nright. So many States are at least above 200 percent of poverty. I \nthink that is wrong.\n  The other major thrust of the McConnell substitute is if you are \nabove 200 percent of poverty, you have to go into the private market. \nThat encourages them very strongly. That is not right either. \nFundamentally, the Children's Health Insurance Program was written \nfirst, in 1997--again, it is a block grant program that gives States \nflexibility and recognizes that every State is different.\n  So often Senators say we should not enact one size fits all. I have \nheard that 100 times around here. Basically, that is correct--not \nalways but basically. Senators who are advocating McConnell-Lott say \none size fits all, basically, not recognizing that different States \nhave different costs of living, some States are much more expensive to \nlive in than others.\n  I saw a chart the other day that showed if you take 200 percent of \npoverty and matched that against the cost of living in various States \nin our country, in some States, the parity level would be maybe down \naround, oh, say, 150 percent of poverty. But there is one State that \nwas 300 percent. If you translate the 200-percent nationwide figure to \nwhat the cost of living is in that State, it comes out to 300 percent. \nI think that is fair because different States are so different.\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, now, that the pending amendment also be \ntemporarily laid aside so Senator Kerry may offer an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me begin first of all by thanking the \ndistinguished chairman of the finance committee on which I have the \npleasure of serving, whose leadership has been critical in bringing \nthis bill to the floor. He and Senator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller, \nand Senator Hatch deserve the thanks of children all across America, of \nall those advocacy groups fighting for children's health care, and \ncertainly of our colleagues who care about it and have been fighting \nfor it for a long time. They have shown real leadership in bringing \nabout an important compromise by fashioning a bill that was reported \nout of committee with bipartisan support.\n  We all understand how difficult that can be, sometimes. Sometimes the \nnegotiations in our committee are out of balance because of the \nmembership of the committee and you may have a different feeling when \nyou finally get to the floor. So I applaud the Senator from Montana. I \nwill say up front, I know that if he had his druthers, he would vote \nfor this on the floor of the Senate now. I also know when you are the \nchairman and you fashion a compromise in your committee, you have to \nstick with your compromises. Everybody here understands how that works. \nSo I recognize that this is an amendment that is difficult for him in \nthe context of this overall bill.\n  But I ask my colleagues to think about this amendment outside of the \ninside game of the Senate. I ask my colleagues to think about this \namendment outside of the parliamentary agreements that have to be made \nin order to get something out of the committee and actually get it to \nthe floor so we can all consider it. But I also ask my colleagues to \nremember that when it gets to the floor, we have a chance to vote as \nSenators, all of us--not as members of the committee. Certainly, the \nvast majority of the Senate is not bound by what happened in a \ncommittee. We are bound by our responsibility, each and every one of \nus, to our constituents in our States and to our beliefs about what is \nbest for the country.\n  I believe, first of all, the legislation that the Senator from \nMontana and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, have brought to \nthe floor is important for the country. I think everybody agrees on \nthat. I think this bill is going to pass with a pretty significant \nvote, ultimately, at its current $35 billion level. But as we debate \nthe future of health for our children, I think we have a responsibility \nto think about it above and beyond the compromising process of the \nSenate.\n  I believe we have to think about it in macro policy terms and also--I \nknow the word gets bandied around here on the floor, and it doesn't \nalways have a lot of meaning anymore--in ``moral'' terms. We have a lot \nof difficulty sometimes translating what is moral in most people's eyes \ninto legislation. But the fact is I heard Senators on both sides of the \naisle, and particularly some of those most responsible for helping to \nnegotiate this on the other side of the aisle--I have heard them say we \nhave a moral imperative to take care of children's health care. I have \nheard them say we ought to be covering all children.\n  Of course, we ought to try to cover all children, but isn't it a \nshame that we can't seem to do that because it costs too much. The \nSenator from Mississippi came to the floor and spoke about this. He \ntalked about how some want an increase of $50 billion or more and \nsuggested that I approach this purely with an attitude where I say \nlet's decide how many kids we ought to cover, and it does not matter \nwhat it costs, let's go pay for it. Well, that is a little bit of a \nmisinterpretation of what I have actually said about it. I have said we \nought to decide if we think it is worthwhile to cover all children, and \nthen see if we can pay for it. I did not say pay for it no matter what. \nSee if we can pay for it, but at least decide what your priority is.\n\n  If your priority is to cover children which is an important moral \nimperative, it has a value to our society, it makes a difference to the \nlives of children, to the lives of the community, the cost of \nhospitals, the cost of health care, the ability to learn, the ability \nto grow up and be a full citizen, you measure those and you come to the \nconclusion hey, this is a good idea, we ought to do this for all kids. \nThen, you have an obligation to begin to weigh where the money comes \nfrom and what the choices are with respect to what you spend money on.\n  The Senator from Mississippi suggested we have to worry about the \ncost of the program and who pays for it. Yep, we do, I say to my \nfriend. And he is a good friend, the Senator from Mississippi. We do \nhave to worry about it. But let's measure what people appear to be \nworried about. Let's measure about why children's health care is a \npriority.\n  First, I want to do the ``why.'' What we do here with respect to \nchildren is not a Democratic priority or Republican priority. It ought \nto be the priority of every single Senator. I know most of the Senators \nhere have families, have children, and are deeply concerned about kids \nand understand these issues.\n  The real face of this debate does not belong to Senator Baucus or \nSenator Grassley or Senator Rockefeller or Senator Hatch or anyone else \nwho is here arguing about this. The real face of this debate belongs to \nyoung kids all across our country who suffer enormous debits on a \nlifetime basis because they do not have health care.\n  The face of this is somebody like 9-year-old Alexsiana Lewis and her \nmother, Dedra, who come from Springfield, MA. Senator Kennedy--\nincidentally, I honor Senator Kennedy's work in this, as we all ought \nto, because it was his visionary leadership that helped to create the \nS-CHIP program in 1997. He has constantly been working to build bridges \nto bring people together to try to sustain and expand the program ever \nsince.\n  Senator Kennedy and I went to the Children's Hospital in Boston, a \nfamous hospital where kids come from all over our country. And the \nstories of curing and caring that are exhibited in that hospital on a \ndaily basis are just extraordinary. Well, we met there Alexsiana Lewis \nand her mother. Alexsiana, 9 years old, was losing her vision due to a \nvery rare eye disease. Her mother, Dedra, had lost her health \ninsurance, like millions of Americans. We have about 45 to 47 million \nAmericans who have no health care at all right now; 9 million of them \nare children.\n  Dedra lost her health insurance. Why did she lose her health \ninsurance? She lost her health insurance because she cut back on the \nhours she was working in order to be able to take care of her child who \nhad this rare disease. And here is what she said at that meeting with \nSenator Kennedy and myself.\n  She said: ``If I did not have Mass Health right now''--that is the \nMassachusetts health program we have in place now funded by S-CHIP--\n``my daughter would be blind.''\n  So my question to my colleagues in the Senate is very simple: \nSomewhere in your States all across this country there is another \nAlexsiana Lewis, or there is another Dedra who is cutting back on her \njob. There are going to be about 5.7 million children who do not get \nany coverage when we finish passing this legislation.\n  Now, my question is, is that the choice of the Senate measured \nagainst\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\nthe other choices that we could make? Is it our choice that it is OK \nfor an Alexsiana to go blind? Is it OK in your State for some child to \nhave a chronic ailment who will not get the early intervention, the \nearly care, and as a result will probably wind up with a lifetime \nimpairment that will require that child to have special needs education \nfor the rest of their life?\n  I went out to the State of Washington a couple of years ago. I had \nrecently introduced my Kids First Health Care Plan. And we had about \n1,200 people show up. The chief pediatrician for the State of \nWashington came to this event in Seattle. She stood up and told the \nstory of a 12-year-old child who was disruptive in the classroom. \nUltimately, they kicked the child out of the classroom because the \nchild was disruptive. They thought the child was just acting out. \nUltimately, that child finally, for the first time, got to a doctor and \nthey found that the child was suffering, not acting out. The child had \na chronic infection which spread to the eardrum, and this chronic \ninfection was creating such pain that the child was acting out due to \nthe pain. Now, at the final moment where they diagnosed what was wrong, \nthey found out that child indeed would have a hearing impairment for \nthe rest of that child's life. No health insurance and acting out in \nclass leads to teacher responding and the child finally gets diagnosed \nas hearing impairment and will require special needs education. What is \nthe rationale? What is the rationale for saying all we can afford is \n$35 billion over five years, at a moment when people across this \ncountry are losing faith in the ability of Washington to be responsible \nand make responsible choices on their behalf?\n  I think it is important that we answer that question properly. And I \nwill tell you, when I look at some of the choices we have, it is pretty \nhard to answer how we are answering it properly. Let me give a few \nexamples to my colleagues. This is a choice the Senate is going to \nmake. If the alternative minimum tax relief is extended, as everybody \nexpects it will be, tax cuts for those earning over $1 million a year \nwill cost $43 billion in 2007 alone. Think about that.\n  We are saying we cannot afford to cover children to the tune of an \nadditional $15 billion over 5 years, but we can give $43 billion of tax \ncuts next year to people earning more than $1 million a year. That is \nobscene. It is ridiculous. It has absolutely no basis in economic \nargument, and it certainly has no basis in any kind of moral or decent \nargument.\n  If you were simply to restore the tax cut to the level before 2001, \nto only taxable income above $1 million, you would have $44 billion and \nyou could insure children. You would be affecting 0.21 percent, of all \ntaxpayers with positive tax liability in the United States. That is one \nchoice.\n  Here is another choice Congress seems to be content to make. \nCurrently, major integrated oil and gas companies are eligible for the \ndomestic manufacturing deduction, which reduces their corporate tax \nrate. In other words, we know fossil fuel is contributing to global \nwarming, but we nevertheless are willing to continue our own dependency \non it and give a tax break that encourages people to be able to do what \nthey are going to do anyway because the marketplace is showing that the \nprice of energy is such. These are some of the most profitable \ncompanies in the world.\n  But oh, boy, give them a tax break instead. There is absolutely no \nvalid reason whatsoever that the most profitable oil companies in the \nworld ought to be receiving a subsidy, a deduction, at this time when \nthey are reaping record profits. But guess what, the Finance Committee \ntried to repeal it and the rest of the Senate did not agree. This \ndeduction cost $9.4 billion over the next 10 years, but we do not have \nenough money for children.\n  We didn't close a loophole in our Tax Code for the poor fuel \neconomy--we actually reward gas-guzzling SUV manufacturers. They get \n$13 billion worth of tax breaks to produce the most gas guzzling cars \non the road, the worst fuel efficiency of any car, and we are \nsubsidizing that over children. I do not get it.\n  I think most Americans, if they had a list of the things that the \nU.S. Congress gives to big business over children, would laugh at the \nlanguage they hear when they hear people say: Oh, we have to cover \nchildren. There is a real value to covering all of these children.\n  Here is another one. Most American families do not get this one. If \nyou are a company, you can defer paying U.S. taxes on any foreign \nincome. So you can be an American company and just keep your income \ndrawing offshore, and you do not pay any tax. It can accrue year to \nyear. And repeal of this provision is about $53 billion over 10 years. \nAlso, it is a huge incentive for companies to take their, you know, \nsubsidiaries and other companies offshore and just grow their profits \noffshore at the expense of American jobs.\n  There is a long list of choices, similar choices: $12 billion a month \nin Iraq, going into the sixth year of the war in Iraq; now we are in \nthe fifth year of the war, now a policy that everyone in the world \nunderstands is not working. I believe there is a better proposal.\n  Now, again, I say $35 billion, of course, is better than nothing. But \nit is incredible to me that we are in this position where the \nadministration is talking about vetoing $35 billion, and we are not \nwilling to do what is necessary to really get the job done.\n  Let me say that I am pleased that there is a provision that I \nauthored with Senator Smith and Senators Kennedy and Domenici to ensure \nthat there is mental health parity in this State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. And parity for mental health treatment is a very \nsignificant and very much needed improvement in SCHIP.\n  Instead of discriminating against mental health, which is effectively \nwhat we are doing today, we can offer services that actually improve \nchildren's performance in school, that keeps them out of trouble in the \njuvenile justice system, and helps them lead better lives, filled with \na lot more opportunity and promise.\n  But $35 billion over 5 years, let me ask colleagues to measure that. \nWhy have we decided to spend $35 billion at all? Why do we have a \nprogram called the Children's Health Insurance Program? If it is worth \nspending $35 billion, doesn't the same rationale apply to the rest of \nthe children who do not have health insurance?\n  Where is the big hand of God coming down and saying: You all over \nhere, you get health insurance; and you over here, you do not because \nwe think it is more important that millionaires get a tax cut. We think \nit is more important that gas-guzzling vehicles get a tax break, and we \nthink it is more important that oil companies with the biggest profits \nin the country get their money. That is the choice. That is what is \nhappening.\n  We have some colleagues who just do not want to bend. That is why \nthis agreement had to be reached. I understand the Senator from Iowa--I \nam not blaming Senator Grassley from Iowa. I respect what he has tried \nto do. He held the line to get the $35 billion.\n\n  I respect what Senator Baucus had to do because we are struggling to \nget votes. If you don't get over 60 votes, you can't do something. But \nI think some of those folks who are reluctant to sort of embrace \nreality ought to step back and question this.\n  Let me come to another point. I have told my colleagues how we pay \nfor this. First of all, the $35 billion is paid for with a cigarette \ntax. The cigarette tax I am in favor of, but we know, unfortunately, it \nis also regressive in a certain way, though hopefully it deters people \nfrom smoking. But a whole bunch of poor folks and folks moving to the \nmiddle class or folks in the middle class are stuck with their habit \nand smoke, and they are going to pay a lot of that tax. We would love \nit if it stopped them from smoking, but we all know that is not going \nto happen automatically. So here we are looking at how else could you \nget more kids covered.\n  What is important about my amendment is that it covers the kids who \nare eligible for Medicaid. It has a more efficient avoidance of the \ntopic we have heard debated, the crowd-out. People are talking about \nnot encouraging people who currently have private insurance to drop the \nprivate insurance to get covered by the State insurance. We obviously \ndon't want that to happen. The fact is that my amendment targets the \ncoverage toward those at 200 percent of poverty or below. So you are \nmostly targeting Medicaid-eligible children. It is astonishing to me \nthat those are the kids most in need of it, and they are still left out \nif we don't\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\npass this amendment. We are trying to get the poorest of the poor. We \nare trying to get the kids on Medicaid. We still don't fully cover the \nkids on Medicaid with the $35 billion, even though, obviously, it is an \nimprovement. I will vote for the improvement, and I will vote for the \nbill. But I still believe we ought to be doing more.\n  I just went to Fall River, MA, the other day to visit a bunch of \nworkers. We have 900 workers there who have been laid off permanently, \nlet go from a plant, Quaker Fabric, that closed. It closed, \nincidentally, on a weekend's notice, despite the fact that we have a \nlaw about plant closings. They are supposed to let workers know ahead \nof time what is happening. I went to visit with these people. The \nbiggest single question on their minds was: What am I going to do about \nmy health care? How am I going to cover my kids? What am I going to do? \nI met people who worked there for 35 years, 27 years, 25 years, all at \nthe same place. They were loyal to the plant, and their 2-week vacation \nstarted on a Friday. On Monday, they got a call and they were told: The \nplant is closing. Sorry. That is it. What is more important--covering \ntheir children or making sure people who earn more than $1 million a \nyear get $43 billion worth of tax cuts?\n  Astonishingly, the President of the United States is threatening to \nveto new money for this program. Even at $35 billion, he is threatening \nthat. That means the choice the President wants to offer is either \nCongress can do not enough or do nothing at all. I don't think that is \nthe appropriate choice.\n  The President has also initiated a disinformation campaign--I guess \ndisinformation campaigns are not new, but it is another disinformation \ncampaign--to denounce this bill as a larger Democratic strategy or plot \nto somehow massively federalize medicine. I understand the President \noffered to veto it before he had even read it. Confronted with a \nbipartisan compromise to extend health coverage to half of the 9 \nmillion American children without insurance today, the President \napparently only sees some sort of a leftwing conspiracy to try to \nfederalize health insurance. It is almost laughable. I don't think \nanybody really believes that is what is about to go on, but it sure is \none of those scary phrases that create a knee-jerk response in certain \nsectors of the body politic.\n  The SCHIP program is, like Medicaid before it, a Federal-State \npartnership. It is not a Federal program; it is a Federal-State \npartnership. Ironically, it happens to use private providers as the \nprincipal people involved to provide the service. So it is a Federal-\nState-private sector partnership. It is very hard to understand how the \nspecter of ``federalism'' somehow can get in the way of that.\n  Another misleading statement we have heard is that SCHIP is a \nDemocratic Trojan horse for socialized medicine. I have to laugh at \nthat. I was here when we did the 1994 debate on health care. I did not \nsign on to the plan that was offered by the White House in 1994. There \nwere a number of problems. It doesn't matter what they were. I didn't \nsign on. I worked hard with Senator Bill Bradley, with Senator John \nChafee, Senator Bob Dole, and others. We had a compromise that, in \nfact, if it had been adopted, it had a back-end mandate with the \nprivate sector being tapped to provide additional health insurance to \nAmericans. I believe we could have passed it, but there wasn't the mood \nfor a compromise at that point in time. Had it passed 4 years ago, we \nwould have been at about 99 percent of Americans covered by health \ninsurance. That was the opportunity which was missed.\n  But one thing I learned, you ain't going to see socialized, \nGovernment-run health care in America probably during our lifetimes. It \nis just not in the makeup. There are plenty of ways to put health \ninsurance out there that are more affordable. I offered one of those \nways in 2004. That is as viable and as urgent today and, frankly, as \ncompelling today as an approach where you can reduce the cost of all \npremiums, take catastrophic health insurance off the backs of \nbusinesses and Americans, and lower the cost of health insurance, \nprovide unbelievable streamlining of the delivery of the system, and \nlet every American choose where they want to go. It is far more \nefficient than what we have today.\n  This red herring, phony debate, straw debate is inappropriate to the \ncause of children. It doesn't do justice to any of us.\n  It also is ironic that some of the most significant efforts to expand \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program have come from Republican \nGovernors. The President's former budget director, Mitch Daniels, the \ncurrent Governor of Indiana, has recently expanded eligibility for \nchildren's health insurance to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level \nor roughly $60,000 for a family of four. Something is seriously wrong \nwhen as good a numbers-cruncher as Mitch Daniels and as tough a budget \ncritic, as we all know, can go out to Indiana, which is a pretty \ncentrist conservative State, and wind up expanding health insurance for \nkids up to 300 percent of poverty. There is a real disconnect in this \ndebate.\n  The President likes to claim the new program is somehow going to push \nfamilies like those from private insurance to government health care. \nBut Governor Daniels and a lot of Governors like him understand that is \nnot the case. With the cost of private insurance for that same family \napproaching $12,000 a year, the real choice for most American families \ntoday is either SCHIP or no health care at all because of the current \nrise in costs. In fact, the National Governors Association this past \nweek sent yet another bipartisan letter to the President stating their \nsupport for the bipartisan reauthorization bill that provides increased \nfunding for SCHIP now moving through the Senate.\n  Finally, SCHIP is not Government run. The vast majority of SCHIP and \nof Medicaid enrollees receive their coverage through private insurance \nplans working under contract with the States to administer benefits. \nSo, far from socialized medicine, it represents the kind of commonsense \npublic-private partnership that ought to be a model for greater health \ncare reform.\n  A lot of families I have met all across the country are scared they \nwill not have adequate health care for their kids. The President's \nresponse to that was--I think about a week ago--Well, they have health \ncare. They can just go to the emergency room. I don't know how many \nSenators have been to emergency rooms lately. First, they are all \novercrowded. I know that at Mass General, which is one of the best \nhospitals in America, in Boston, sometimes it is so crowded it takes \nhours to get people processed except for the most traumatic who come \nin. You have people on gurneys in the halls of hospitals all across \nAmerica, different waiting periods. It is extraordinary what has \nhappened. The degree to which emergency rooms have become the primary \ncare facility for Americans is shocking. Hospitalized children--this is \nimportant--without health insurance are twice as likely to die from \ntheir injuries as those with coverage. Uninsured kids are only half as \nlikely to receive any medical care in a given year.\n  We all go to schools and talk to teachers, and we go into \ncommunities. We have townhalls, and we listen to voters. I can't tell \nmy colleagues how many times I have heard a teacher tell me how \ndifficult it is to teach a whole class of kids, which is usually an \novercrowded class of kids, where many of those children don't have \nhealth care. We know that kids who have health care do 68 percent \nbetter in school. Here we are, a country that is struggling with an \neducation system that is not keeping up with competitors around the \nworld. We don't graduate enough scientists or engineers, researchers, \nand so forth. One of the things it is related to, in terms of the \nchoices children have in their long-term education, is whether they get \nhealth care and screening early.\n  Someone who has health care is more likely to get an early diagnosis \nof whatever the problem is. If you are a child and you have an \nirregular heartbeat or a hole in your heart or you have some other \ndisorder, early diabetes onset or even autistic tendencies, if you \ndon't get to a doctor and the parent doesn't see those indices and \nisn't able to understand them for what they might be and get somewhere \nto get the care, the odds are that child is going to wind up costing \neverybody a lot more, not to mention what is going to happen to that \nchild's life.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a hard look at this. I hope the \nPresident will\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nreconsider his decision to veto it. I know Senator Baucus and Senator \nRockefeller have negotiated the best bipartisan package they could. \nAgain, I commend them for doing so. But here on the floor of the \nSenate, we have an opportunity to work our will as a Senate. We have an \nopportunity to make a different statement. I believe we ought to be \ninvesting at least $50 billion. The Senate passed in its budget--this \nis in the budget today--$50 billion for children's health care. The \nonly reason it has come to the floor at $35 billion is because some \npeople refuse to let it come out of committee or take any shape other \nthan that at this moment in time.\n  The best way to finance that $15 billion is to do what is fair and to \nmake one of those choices we are called on to make. There are countless \nchoices in this budget. We have 27,000 pages or so--I think more than \nthat now--of Tax Code that fill volumes. Most of those pages do not \napply to average Americans. Most of those pages apply to those who have \nbeen able to lobby Washington, to those who have been able to bring \ntheir cause to this city.\n  These are children. Children's lobbies reflect a lot of different \norganizations, but it seems to me we have an opportunity to enroll the \nlowest income of uninsured children by increasing the bonus payments \navailable to States so they meet or surpass their targets. We don't \nmandate them to do so. We leave the discretion up to the States. They \nhave wide discretion with the waivers they have today as to how they \nadminister the programs. They have proven themselves very capable and \nvery creative in doing so.\n  I hope, as a matter of priority, we make a bipartisan down payment of \nno less than $50 billion toward health care coverage for all our \nchildren. The only excuse for not spending more is saying: Oh, we \ncannot afford that. When somebody says we cannot afford that, then you \nhave to look at what we are choosing to afford. That is the real test \nof the balance of what we care about and of where we are willing to put \nour votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for two reasons: one, to give the \ncompromise that is before the Senate a defense against Senator Kerry's \namendment; and then to comment on the bill generally, and mostly to \ncomment to some of my fellow colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle in relation to what I consider unfair criticism of this \ncompromise.\n  I do not rise to find fault with the goals Senator Kerry has put \nforth. I do not even find fault with some of his arguments about \nloophole closings. I might feel compelled to argue against the marginal \ntax increases he might want to have, but right now I will concentrate \non his view of expanding this compromise, not questioning his motives, \nand not raising any question about the sincerity of his wanting to do \nmore--except reflecting on the 4 or 5 months Senator Baucus and I have \nbeen putting this bill together, we have all had some rude awakenings.\n  Those rude awakenings are that what we put together as a $50 billion \npackage, when it was first scored came back much higher than $50 \nbillion. So to get everything everybody wants in $50 billion is very \ndifficult. The other thing is a philosophy I had, that somehow with \nsomething less than $50 billion we would be able to cover every kid \nunder 200 percent of poverty, and we found out that was not possible.\n  I am sure we both--from Senator Kerry's point of view and from my \npoint of view--went into this whole discussion with a great deal of \ngood intent and finding out that it may be a little more difficult than \nwe anticipated.\n  So only with that caveat I ask Senator Kerry to consider, I now want \nto say why we ought to defend the compromise that is before the Senate.\n  I appreciate Senator Kerry's goal of covering more kids. The bill we \nhave today insures 3.2 million kids who do not have coverage today. I \nam very proud of that effort, and I am not going to warm to any \nsuggestion that we have not done enough. The Finance Committee bill \ndoes so through a new incentive fund, and it is a proposal both sides \nof the aisle support. It is a compromise.\n  The incentive fund is a product of months of work. We built on ideas \nthat were formed by another bipartisan couple--Senator Rockefeller on \none hand for Democrats, Senator Snowe on the other hand for \nRepublicans. We took those ideas that Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nSnowe had and reshaped them into what we think represents a very \nefficient and cost-effective way to increase coverage for children.\n  As Senator Kerry may recall, during the markup of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the Congressional Budget Office Director Peter Orszag \ncharacterized the incentive fund ``as efficient as you can possibly get \nper new dollar spent.''\n  Simply throwing money at States is not an effective strategy for \ncovering more kids. Cost is an object. The bill that is moving in the \nHouse does cover 1 million more kids who are not currently covered than \nthe Senate bill. But they do so while spending $12.2 billion more than \nwe do--getting back to the efficiency and effectiveness statement of \nthe CBO Director Peter Orszag. I will leave it to my colleagues to \ndecide for themselves whether they think $12.2 billion for a million \nkids is cost effective. But I can assure you, the cost will leave us \nthen--if we do that--without a bipartisan bill, and maybe not the \nchance of getting anything through, other than an extension. It has \nbeen stated, even from our Republican colleagues who do not like the \nwaiver process, that is bad policy.\n  The Finance Committee bill then--I am begging Senator Kerry to \nunderstand--is the best of the possible. The left wants more; the right \nwanted a lot less. We can make speeches or make legislation. Making \nspeeches does not get any kids covered. Making legislation does. Our \ncompromise does that.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep on the right track for making \nlegislation; that is, doing the art of the possible. I oppose this \namendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill. I start out by \nreferring to a chart that I hope we have in the Chamber that has been \nused by a lot of Republican colleagues over the last 2 or 3 days. This \nwas in relation to speeches that were given yesterday by many of my \ncolleagues who are sincere in their approach.\n  They refer to this as the ``cliff chart.'' Everything to the right of \nthe green is after this legislation expires. They want you to believe \nwe do not take into consideration anything about the future. They are \nmaking out this is an unrealistic proposal we have before you, because \nfollowing that red line up into the future, they maintain it is going \nto cost more than we can afford. I want to say how this approach is \nintellectually dishonest.\n  I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Senators who have been \ngiving these speeches, and I can identify a couple. There are probably \nmore who have been giving these speeches, but I want my colleagues to \nknow I respect Senator Gregg, the ranking Republican on the Senate \nBudget Committee. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Trent Lott, our \nassistant minority leader, I think has referred to it. I respect his \nviews. But I think everybody ought to take into consideration what we \nare going to do. I have a chart that is going to lay this out.\n  In this particular instance, we clearly are on different sides of \nthis argument. There has been a lot of talk around here about how the \nSenate Finance Committee bill is funded. This chart was used in that \ndiscussion. Taking a hard look at how bills are financed is a good \nthing. Maybe we do not do that often enough. So let me focus on the \ncriticism that has been made about how this SCHIP bill is financed. We \nneed to step back and look at the whole picture. That is what I am \nbegging my colleagues to do. The SCHIP program is a pretty small part \nof that picture.\n  The thing about SCHIP is that it is not like Medicaid or Medicare. \nHow many times have you heard the people using this chart refer to it \nas if it is an entitlement? It is not an entitlement we are discussing \ntoday. Or maybe if people do not understand the term ``entitlement''--\nit is not a permanent program, such as Medicare and Medicaid because \nthey are entitlements. SCHIP is not. So when the program expires, it \ntruly ends. The day after the authorization ends, poof, there is no \nmore SCHIP program. That is true of any program that sunsets. But \nMedicare\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\nand Medicaid do not sunset. They are entitlements. SCHIP is \nreauthorized for 5 years. That is 5 years on top of the original 10 \nyears it was authorized. So this year it is sunsetting. That is not an \nentitlement. It is an expiring program.\n\n  While I know most of us in this Chamber would no sooner let the \nDepartment of Defense expire than we would let SCHIP expire, that is a \nsimple fact. And because it is an expiring program, it is subject to a \nvery particular budget rule. That budget rule does not fit this chart. \nThat budget rule says the Congressional Budget Office must score future \nspending for the program based upon the last year of the program's \ncurrent authorization. So the baseline for SCHIP for the next year is \n$5 billion. That is under existing law. If we pass this legislation, \nthat would not be true. But for what is law right now, in the future, \nthey are going to score that at $5 billion. For the next 5 years, the \nbaseline--let me say again--is $5 billion. For the next 10 years, the \nbaseline for SCHIP is $5 billion. It is actually $5 billion a year \nforever.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber think the budget rule governing SCHIP is \nrealistic? Well, of course it is not realistic. But that is the way the \nbudget process and the Budget Office must work under existing law. So I \nam not here to kid anybody.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 1.4 million children \nwould lose coverage if we simply reauthorized SCHIP at the baseline of \n$5 billion into the future. Who among us would go home and tell our \nconstituents that we individually voted to reauthorize the SCHIP \nprogram--reauthorize it, yes. If you stopped there, they would think: \nWell, you did a good thing. What you are doing right now, you continue \nto do. But if you did that, what you would be doing, without telling \nthem--but they would soon find out; you do not fool the American \npeople--1.4 million kids would lose coverage.\n  So when the Finance Committee went to work to reauthorize this bill--\nSenator Baucus and I, with the help of Senators Hatch and Rockefeller--\nwe had this problem: The baseline only assured $5 billion a year in \nspending into the future. It was unrealistic.\n  Let me digress and point to a problem the Agriculture Committee has \nthis year exactly the same way. We did not spend all the money in the \nagriculture bill last year, so we are working on a baseline that is $15 \nbillion less than it was in 2002, the last time we wrote a farm bill. \nSo this is not just the case of health care for kids. A lot of \ncommittees get caught this way.\n  But we do have the realistic fact that costs continue to increase in \nSCHIP, even though the $5 billion was frozen in the baseline because of \nthe budget rules.\n  So what did we have to do? We had to come up with the money to keep \nthe current program afloat. That meant we had to find at least $14 \nbillion to keep the current program afloat. That is right, of the $35 \nbillion in funding in this bill, $14 billion is put into SCHIP to \nmaintain the current program. That is $14 billion to maintain coverage \nfor kids who are currently enrolled.\n  Do you know what the White House wanted us to believe all this year \nsince they submitted their budget? That you could do that $14 billion--\nmaintaining the current program--for the $5 billion they put in their \nbudget.\n  Now, those people down at OMB have to be smart enough in advising the \nPresident that you cannot do for $5 billion a policy of doing what we \nare doing now, and even expanding a little bit, for $5 billion when, in \nfact, it costs $14 billion. To a very real extent, this is the same \nkind of situation my good friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg--\nwhen he was speaking--was complaining about. The current baseline was \nnot realistic. That created a hole in the budget we had to fill. In our \ncase, it was a $14 billion hole to fill, if you want to maintain \ncurrent policy.\n\n  So what did we do? Well, we did what you have to do if you are \nresponsible and deliver on what you say you are going to do. We filled \nit. It is that simple. We had to comply with the budget rules.\n  What people forget around here is the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office is like God, and everybody who works in the Budget Office \ncan also be little Gods because what they say has to be followed, and \nif you don't follow it, you know what you have to do? You have to do \nalmost the impossible around here. You have to have 60 votes to get \naround it. Should they have that much power? Well, if you are going to \nhave any budget discipline, they have to have that kind of power. But \nit is that simple. We had to fill that hole. We had to comply with the \nbudget rules, so we did. Do those budget rules make sense? Well, I \nthink I have indicated they probably don't, but that is a question for \nthe Budget Committee to answer, Senator Gregg's committee, Senator \nConrad's committee, not the Finance Committee. We have to abide by it.\n  There is another budget rule that the Finance Committee was required \nto follow. That rule is called pay-go, which people around here know is \nshort for pay-as-you-go financing. It means the bill needs to cover its \n6-year costs and 11-year costs, and that makes sense after all. This \nbill proposes new spending, and because it proposes new spending, you \nhave to pay for it, or have 60 votes. This bill does pay for it. This \nbill complies with the budget rules. It complies with the pay-go \nrequirements.\n  Now, the SCHIP reauthorization we are debating is only a 5-year \nauthorization. That means 5 years from now it will sunset. Congress \nwill have to go through the process of reviewing it. To remind people \nit is not an entitlement, Medicare and Medicaid doesn't get a review \nevery so often forced upon them. They may get a review by Congress but \ninstituted by Congress, not forced upon Congress by a sunset.\n  As I think everyone knows, this bill is paid for with an increase in \nthe tobacco tax. This is similar to the original SCHIP bill when it was \ncreated under the Republican-controlled Congress in 1997. Now, similar \nto 1997, when the Republicans did it, we had a problem with how the \ntobacco tax works. The revenue from the cigarette tax is not growing as \nfast as health care costs, so that means the revenue-raiser is not \ngoing to grow as fast as the cost of health care, generally, and \nspecifically in this instance, the costs associated with the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  So the Finance Committee did what was required to do to comply with \nthe pay-go budget rule. The Finance Committee bill reduces SCHIP \nfunding to just below the funding that is in the current baseline. That \nmeans the Finance Committee in 5 years will have the same problem we \nface in putting this bill together today. They will have to come up \nwith the funds to keep the program running because the tobacco tax over \nthe years is not going to bring in enough revenue to keep up with the \nincreased costs of health care. That is just like the $14 billion we \nhad to keep and find to keep the current program running with no \nchanges.\n  It is true we are covering even more low-income kids in this bill. \nThat is a good thing. But it also means the Finance Committee in 5 \nyears will have a bigger job to keep the program running at that rate. \nThey will have more kids to keep covering and health care costs will be \neven higher than they are today. This is for the Finance Committee to \nface in the next 5 years. Of course, during that 5-year period of time, \nI hope we get a lot of reform of health care in the United States that \nreduces costs, gets the uninsured covered, so we are not just dealing \nwith SCHIP. Of course, what we have to face in 5 years is similar to \nthe job the Finance Committee had today to continue the SCHIP program. \nSo it is nothing new. But I think some are getting the impression from \nsome of my colleagues who use this chart that this is something new--\nsome gimmick to get around budget rules. But my good friend from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, has expressed serious concern about the bill, \nand I think we should at least take a moment and look at his concerns \nin proper perspective.\n  So I go back to one of the charts Senator Gregg has used. Here is the \nchart used to raise the issue. It shows only the funding in the Finance \nCommittee bill. I think looking at it like this paints a distorted \npicture. As we all know, the SCHIP program was created to supplement \nthe Medicaid Program. The goal of the program was to encourage States \nto provide coverage to uninsured children with incomes just above \nMedicaid eligibility. So to put my colleagues' concerns in perspective, \nwe\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\nshould look at SCHIP spending as it relates to Medicaid spending. So I \nwould like to draw my colleagues' attention to a new chart that \nrepresents figures for the future from SCHIP, as well as from Medicaid, \nso everyone can fully appreciate the consequences of our SCHIP bill in \nthe context of the Medicaid Program, which SCHIP supplements. So take a \ncloser look.\n  Let's start with this little green line at the bottom. That is \ncurrent law, the green line that goes along the very bottom of the \nchart. It is a pretty straight line across the chart. The green line \nrepresents the SCHIP baseline under current law. As I have already \ndiscussed, it is $5 billion each year for the next 10 years and as far \ninto the future as you can go. If you don't change the law, that is the \nway it is.\n  Now let's look more closely and honestly at the actual problems we \nare facing. The massive orange area, as indicated, above the green line \nis Medicaid. This is the projected Medicaid spending for the next 10 \nyears. It is a lot bigger than SCHIP. Then, on top of that, we are \nlooking to add new spending for the SCHIP bill, and that is the blue \nline above the Medicaid indicated by the orange. Again, it is not very \nbig. It is quite obvious it is not very big. As you can clearly see, \ncosts are growing at a rapid pace overall. The overwhelming driver of \nthe costs is what? It is Medicaid. We have a very big problem. \nEntitlement spending is growing, and in future years we are going to \nstruggle to keep these programs afloat. That is why I would not agree \nto do a $50 billion SCHIP bill. I thought it was too much spending. I \nam not particularly happy with spending $35 billion, but as I have \nsaid, this bill is a compromise, and it is $15 billion less than what \nthe Democratic budget approved.\n  So let's focus on the total obligations of the Federal program. This \nchart, when you look at the whole picture, puts things in perspective. \nNow, remember, all that fire and brimstone about the awful cliff that \nwas on the previous chart, the awful cliff that this bill brings before \nthe Senate, where is that cliff, you might ask, on the chart I put \nbefore my colleagues. If you look closely, right here where the blue \nline on top goes down gradually to beyond the green line, if you look \nat the blue there where it dips down a little bit, that little dip to \nthe right of the dotted vertical line is what my good friend from New \nHampshire is so exercised about. So this little blue line is what the \ndebate is all about. The little blue line is this legislation before \nus. The little blue line is creating all this rancor. But it looks a \nlittle bit different here, doesn't it, than it did on that cliff chart \nI showed you ahead of time.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues then what the Finance Committee bill--this \nlittle blue line--is not; not what it is but what it is not. Looking at \nthis dip, this is not a government takeover of health care. Looking at \nthis dip, this is not bringing the Canadian health care system to \nAmerica. Looking at this dip in the blue line, this is not the end of \nthe world as we know it.\n  While I concede that allotments under our bill in the years beyond \nthe 5-year reauthorization do not behave as described in my friend's \nchart, I don't think it warrants the heated rhetoric we are hearing \nduring this debate yesterday and today and probably tomorrow. SCHIP is \nnot the real fiscal problem we have. The problem is the big orange \narea. That is Medicaid. The ranking member and I worked together--I am \nreferring now to Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. He and I worked together last year on the Deficit Reduction \nAct to try to rein in Medicaid, and I am proud of the work we did. We \nalso found out how hard it is to dial back entitlement spending, even \nin a Republican-controlled Congress and even with special procedural \nprotections we call reconciliation. We only succeeded in shaving $26 \nbillion over a 10-year period on Medicaid spending.\n  The problem of entitlement spending is still there, and SCHIP is a \npebble next to the boulders of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. \nDo we have a funding issue? Yes. There is no denying that. We had one \ntoday that was the $14 billion hole that we had to fill if we were \ngoing to do what the President said he wanted to do with $5 billion. \nThe Republican Congress created that hole in 1997, I am sad to say, but \nthe Finance Committee filled that hole and produced a bill that \ncomplies with the budget rules. I am confident the Finance Committee in \n5 years will do the same thing.\n  I think it is also important to point out we have so many far bigger \nproblems in health care today that we need to deal with. If I am \nsupposed to infer from Senator Gregg's speech that this is supposed to \nbe the opportunity to do something about the problems of entitlement \nspending, I should point out the obvious: The substitute we expect to \nvote on does absolutely nothing about the entitlement spending but make \na big deal out of it.\n  So I appreciate Senator Gregg's remarks. They are not without some \nmerit, but you have to put them in context. I don't think they fit the \ncrime we are accused of committing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I request time from the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no controlled time limits at this \ntime.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me begin by commending Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley and their colleagues, Senator Hatch and \nSenator Rockefeller, for extraordinary work. This effort represents \ngreat legislating based upon principled compromise to achieve a noble \nobjective, which is to provide health coverage to the children of \nAmerica. I can't think of a more laudable effort than that which has \nbeen led and spearheaded by both Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. \nThey deserve our praise and our support.\n  I am here today to lend my support to the expansion of the CHIP \nprogram, the Children's Health Insurance Program, to support this \nendeavor which is so critical to the health of the country, literally \nand figuratively. It is not only a sensible policy in terms of \ninvesting in children, it is also morally compelling.\n  What more lofty objective can we have than to give children access to \nhealth care, to be able to grow up in this country knowing they can \nreceive medical attention when they need it?\n  We are in a situation now where, remarkably, the Nation's level of \npoverty is growing. It is higher now than it was in 1970. We have not \nhad a President since Lyndon Johnson try to tackle this issue head on. \nThis bill recognizes that there are families who don't have the \nresources to buy health insurance, but they have a claim as Americans \nand as citizens to at least have their children covered. I hope we can \ndo that by passing this legislation.\n  It is estimated there are 37 million Americans in poverty, 13 million \nof whom are children. These are not merely statistics; they are our \nneighbors in every State in the Union. They are youngsters who we hope \none day will grow up healthy and strong to participate not just as \nworkers in this economy but as productive citizens of this great land. \nTo do that they need access to health care.\n  We also know that children without access to health care fare very \npoorly in school and have difficulties. These difficulties become more \nand more complex, and they compound over the years. In fact, one of the \nstrongest arguments for this legislation is that it makes sense as an \ninvestment. It is better to pay now rather than later, in terms of \nsocial disruption and serious health problems. That is something I hope \neven the most hard-nosed colleague in the Senate will appreciate.\n  One of the consequences of this issue of growing poverty and the \nbifurcation of income between the rich and the rest of us in what we \nall consider to be the ``land of opportunity,'' sadly, is that \nopportunity is not as evident or as palpable as it was in the past. One \nof the great engines of opportunity for any individual, in addition to \neducation, is health and the ability to seize these opportunities--\nwork, education, and service to others.\n  Again, I think this is an incredibly important piece of legislation. \nWe have to do more. We have to recognize there are families who are \nworking two jobs--mothers and fathers working 50, 60, 70 hours a week--\nand still they don't have the resources necessary to pay for the \nincreasing cost of health care for their children or themselves. They \nare squeezed between paying the rent, providing food for the family, \nand\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\nare looking, many times, for ways to cover the cost of health care for \ntheir children.\n  I am very proud to have been one of the original cosponsors of CHIP \nin 1997. We were fortunate in Rhode Island to have on the Finance \nCommittee Senator John Chafee, who was one of the leading advocates of \nthe program. As Senator Grassley suggested, this program was crafted \nwith a bipartisan effort in 1997, and one of the great leaders in that \nwas John Chafee. In many respects, we are here today--both of us--to \nrenew his commitment to the children of America.\n  Over the past decade, this program has been an unequivocal success. \nIt has reduced the number of low-income uninsured children in this \ncountry. It has done what it said it would do, and it has done it well. \nIn Rhode Island, we have a combined Medicaid/CHIP program called \nRIteCare. Our program has been instrumental in reducing uninsured \nchildren, and it made a difference for hard-working families in my \nState. While this program made great strides, there is still much more \nwork to be done.\n  I want to take a few moments to address some of the issues raised \nabout the Senate Finance Committee agreement and talk to some of the \npoints raised in this Chamber criticizing that agreement. I believe \nthis agreement is not only sound policy, but it addresses a major \nconcern in the country. The proposal before us would achieve several \nkey objectives supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans.\n  First, it preserves coverage for all 6.6 million children presently \ncovered under the CHIP program. Second, it renews the original intent \nof the program by making a real commitment to cover an additional 3.2 \nmillion children who are eligible for coverage but not enrolled. These \ntwo important goals are achieved by allocating $35 billion over 5 \nyears. The original program was financed through the Federal cigarette \nexcise tax, and the proposal before us continues to use this mechanism.\n  The bill also addresses a problem with the formula that was beginning \nto plague a growing number of States, including my State of Rhode \nIsland. Last December, I joined a number of my colleagues in crafting \nan agreement to redistribute unexpended funds from some States and \nredirect them to States, such as Rhode Island and Georgia and New \nJersey, that were rapidly approaching budget shortfalls because they \nexceeded their CHIP allotment.\n  The Finance Committee, recognizing this issue, has made a proposal \nthat institutes needed changes in the formula used to calculate State \nCHIP allotments so Congress is not required to resort to eleventh hour \ndeals to shift money from one State that hasn't used it to other \nStates. That is an important change to the legislation. The bill sets \naside a portion of funds in case of contingencies, such as what was \nexperienced during Hurricane Katrina.\n  Lastly, the bill tackles a challenge that States have been struggling \nwith since the CHIP program began 10 years ago; that is, reaching \nchildren who are uninsured and eligible for coverage but are not \nenrolled. The bill provides incentive funds and flexibility for States \nto overcome the many economic, social, and geographic barriers that \nhinder millions of uninsured children who deserve health insurance \ncoverage.\n  My home State of Rhode Island is a perfect case in point. While Rhode \nIsland ranks 10th nationally in the lowest number of uninsured \nchildren--we are very proud of that; in fact, we would like to move up \nin the ranking from 10 to 1--a recent report by Rhode Island Kids Count \nindicates that of the estimated 18,680 uninsured children in the State, \n11,275 of them were eligible for children's health insurance coverage \nbut were not enrolled. We should enroll all eligible children; that \nshould be our goal. We have to reach these children and, frankly, this \nlegislation will help States become more proactive and successful in \nenrolling children.\n\n  There has been criticism directed at the bill. Let me take a moment \nto respond to some of the criticism. There has been concern about the \ncost of the package. I understand that alternative versions of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program reauthorization will be offered by \nothers in the Chamber during this debate. Some of these bills will have \nvery enticing names, like Kids First, but we should not be fooled by \nit. The substance of these amendments does everything but put kids \nfirst. It won't even maintain the minimum coverage that we have today. \nSome of the 6.6 million children who are enrolled today will lose out \nin these alternatives. Rather than expanding coverage, it will contract \ncoverage. We don't want to head in the other direction; we want to move \nforward.\n  Similarly, others have balked about the $35 billion price tag. I \nremind my colleagues that our Senate budget resolution allocated $50 \nmillion for children's health insurance coverage. The Senate Finance \nCommittee, the chairman and ranking member, labored mightily and came \nup with the best possible proposal they could get through the \ncommittee, and it is a principled proposal. I salute it. But I was \ndisappointed that the committee left on the table $15 billion that \ncould have been used to insure more children. I have joined Senator \nKerry in his amendment to restore it. Again, in terms of our budget \npriorities, the proposal before us today is even less than what was \nsupported in the budget resolution. For those who say it is too \nexpensive, that suggests this hasn't been very carefully considered and \nindeed it was, unfortunately, somewhat winnowed down.\n  Perhaps the most poignant reference is that, while we were talking \nabout $35 billion over 5 years for children's health, we are spending \n$10 billion a month in Iraq. That says a lot about how we have to begin \nto reshape our priorities. I don't believe we are spending too much on \nchildren when it comes to this particular legislation.\n  Some have expressed displeasure over using the Federal cigarette \nexcise tax to finance the package. The bill would gradually raise the \ntax 61 cents, up to $1, over a 5-year period. This is consistent with \nthe original financing mechanism for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in 1997. But there is something else interesting here. \nCigarette smoking has been identified for decades as one of the chief \npublic health problems in this country, particularly when children \nstart doing it. It is a threat to the health of the Nation, and I doubt \nif there is anyone in this Chamber who has not had at least one family \nmember's health affected adversely by smoking. I listened to Senator \nEnzi speak passionately in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee last week about his father's smoking, which led to \nhis demise, and it also affected his mother.\n  When you raise the price of a product, you curtail the amount of it \nthat is purchased. We are using market forces to help us do something \nthat we should do: reduce the rate of cigarette smoking. Using market \nmechanisms in this way, not only to raise resources for health \ninsurance for children, but to lower the number of people who engage in \nsmoking will save public health dollars that are being spent to care \nfor people who have lung cancer, emphysema, and other respiratory \ndiseases caused by smoking.\n  There is another concern that has been raised, which is that the \nagreement grossly expands the CHIP program to parents and childless \nadults, when in fact the bill does quite the opposite. The bipartisan \nagreement actually ends the administration's practice of providing \nStates waivers to cover parents and childless adults. To date, 14 \nStates have received waivers to cover parents and childless adults, \nincluding my State of Rhode Island. In fact, Secretary Leavitt just \napproved a 3-year extension of Wisconsin's waiver allowing adult \ncoverage. Frankly, I believe that States deserve the ability to take \nthese steps. I am disappointed that more States won't be able to do it. \nThis bill acts as a check on that administrative authority. It \ndeliberately, at this time, restricts the number of parents and \nchildless adults who can join this coverage.\n  As my colleague, Senator Menendez, mentioned earlier, research shows \na strong correlation between parental coverage and the enrollment of \neligible children. Once again, the policy behind enrolling parents is \nsound. But this bill, rather than grossly expanding parental coverage, \nbegins to restrict that coverage. Under the agreement, States with \nexisting coverage expansion waivers will be given a period of \ntransition, and no new States will be granted the opportunity to extend \ncoverage under CHIP. This seems like a reasonable response to these \nconcerns, but I hope as\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\nwe go forward we might be able to look at the logic behind parental \ncoverage policies as a way to ensure that the whole family--\nparticularly children--are covered.\n  The proposal also rightly grants States the option to cover pregnant \nwomen. Good prenatal care is essential to overall child health and \nwell-being, as well as reducing the number of low birth weight and \npremature babies. Given the fact that the United States is actually \nbehind most developed countries, and even some developing countries, in \nterms of these indicators, this step is certainly warranted and \noverdue.\n  Finally, Members seem to have great consternation over the fact that \nchildren's health coverage produces some level of crowding out of \nprivate insurance coverage, and the bill is a giant step toward \nGovernment-run health care. Again, the rhetoric seems to be at odds \nwith the reality of what is in this bill. I note that most enrollees in \npublic insurance are actually covered through private plans, where \nStates take the money and reimburse the private insurer. The Finance \nCommittee proposal takes the additional step of including something \ncalled premium support. It essentially gives States the ability to \noffer subsidies for children who are eligible for CHIP coverage but \nhave access to employer-sponsored coverage.\n  In my State, we have had this experience. We have a program called \nRIteShare. The program has enabled thousands of Rhode Island families \nwho otherwise could not afford to remain in private insurance coverage \nto do so with a little help from the State. It is a marginal \ncontribution to their private health insurance, which allows them to \nstay in the private market. This proposal, again, goes a long way \ntoward addressing the issue of potential crowding out.\n  I believe this bipartisan agreement represents a very strong step \nforward to facilitate outreach and enrollment of low-income children. \nIt is not a perfect legislative proposal, but it is an important one \nbased on principled compromise. It reinforces our commitment to \nchildren's health. I am amazed the President is already suggesting he \nmight veto it, despite overwhelming public support, and despite the \ncompelling economics that are behind investing in children's health.\n  I hope that we will by our votes demonstrate that this is a bill \nwhich should not be vetoed but should be passed quickly so children can \ncontinue to enjoy access to health care in our country.\n  We all understand that our future is really about our children. They \nwill be the leaders years from now, and we all hope and wish that they \nwill grow up strong, able to seize the opportunities of this Nation. \nBeyond hoping and wishing today, we can help make that a reality by \nvoting for this important legislation. I urge all my colleagues to join \nme in doing so.\n  Finally, I would like to take another moment. As colleagues, we come \nto the floor, we debate issues and legislation we have sponsored, but \nthe details are worked out by staff members long into the wee hours of \nthe morning. We read speeches prepared by very dedicated staff members.\n  I have the rare privilege of saluting someone who has worked with me \nfor so many years. Lisa German Foster has been with me since January \n1996 when I joined the Senate. She is leaving to pursue other \nendeavors.\n  She started in my office as an unpaid intern and has become \nrecognized here as one of the preeminent staffers with respect to \nhealth care issues and one of the most decent and humane individuals \none will ever meet. I salute her for her work on this bill, on child \nhealth and immunization, on the bone marrow registry, on tobacco \nlegislation.\n  She is a native of my home State of Rhode Island, in Narragansett, \nbut I think she is firmly ensconced in Washington, DC, with her husband \nBill and children Aidan and Brady.\n  Lisa, on behalf of all of us here, thank you for your good work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with those who assert that \nworking Americans are carrying too difficult a burden when it comes to \nhealth insurance, that the governmental supplements and assistance we \nprovide to help people get health insurance are aberrational, \nunprincipled, counterproductive, bureaucratic, and often just unfair.\n  A person's health care is more dependent on where he or she works \nthan anything else. If you happen to work for the Government, you are \nin pretty good shape. If you work for some big company, you are in good \nshape. But people live in fear that they might lose their job, and more \nthan just losing their job, they may lose their health care. They don't \nlike that. Families are worried about it. People sometimes refuse to \ntake better jobs because of fears that they will lose their health \ninsurance.\n  Prices are exceedingly high for people who are not part of big plans, \nGovernment programs and policies, and big company plans. That is just a \nfact. The same person can end up paying twice as much if they run a \nsmall business or work for a small business that doesn't provide \ninsurance, and you cannot be guaranteed you will even get it. Sometimes \nthe premiums are more than twice as much.\n  The President talked about this issue in his State of the Union \nAddress when he talked about tax credits and ending the disparity we \nnow have in health care. It is an absolute problem.\n  I was pleased to support the program offered by Senator Enzi, the \nsmall business health plans, the so-called associated health plans that \nwould help small businesses to pool their resources and get cheaper \nrates. This could add 1 million people to our insured rolls without any \nincreases in taxes.\n  We have a problem out there, we really do. So, sure, there is no \ndoubt SCHIP is helping children in need, and there is no doubt our \ncurrent system is not working fairly and something must be done to fix \nit. But just adding to this bureaucratic program without any principled \nfix in the abuses that are contained in it strikes me as very odd. I do \nnot approve of it. I just do not approve of that at all.\n  It is a system that is brutal on the self-employed, brutal on the \nperson who works for a small business that does not provide insurance. \nIt is not legitimate, it is not right, and we absolutely need to do \nsomething to fix it. This odd program that came together some years ago \nwas never, in my view, a particularly sound program. It is just maybe \nan attempt to fix something that won't work.\n\n  What we really need, if my colleagues want to know the truth, is a \nprogram to allow all Americans to have an insurance policy that is not \ndependent on where they work. We should allow them to pay tax-free \ndollars just like employers can. If they have lower income, the \nGovernment helps them make the premium payments and they keep that \npolicy whether they are working or they are not working. They take it \nwith them, and they are not being terrorized all the time by the fear \nof losing their health insurance.\n  We can do that. Senator Coburn has talked about this idea, I know, \nand Senator Corker, Senator DeMint all those who worked on this issue. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services worked on it. We ought to \nbe doing that. That is what we ought to be thinking about and talking \nabout instead of putting new wine in old wine bottles, trying to \nreinvigorate a program that has some fundamental problems and, as I am \ngoing to point out, is unprincipled and counterproductive in a number \nof ways.\n  I believe we absolutely could have a portable plan of health \ninsurance which would be something that would excite all Americans and \nmake people feel so much more comfortable with their health insurance. \nThat is what I would like to see us move to.\n  It is said that this is not an entitlement, but it is close to an \nentitlement. If we are not making needed reforms to preserve this \nbenefit for those in need, why isn't it an entitlement? Who is going to \ncut and eliminate health care for children and those in need? We are \nmissing an opportunity to have real reform now.\n\n  I know one can argue this case a lot of different ways, but I will \njust say, when we have my wonderful colleague, Senator Grassley, whom I \nadmire so much and who is personally a very frugal person, saying: \nWell, this chart which Senator Gregg, the former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, produced showing that when it is\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nscored out here, there is no money for it after the fifth year, as if \nit is going to drop to virtually zero--we know that is not going to \nhappen, and, in fact, Senator Grassley said we will have to find the \nmoney 5 years from now. But they wrote the bill in that way so it \nwouldn't score as costing as much as it is really going to cost. It is \na gimmick. It is a classic gimmick, that is exactly what it is. It is a \nbit discouraging, I have to tell my colleagues, when I have a colleague \nI admire as much as Senator Grassley taking that position on the bill.\n  Let me ask a few questions about this legislation that point out some \nof the failures in principle and good policy.\n  If this is a children's health insurance program, why does it cover \nadults? There is no ``A'' in it; it is SCHIP; it doesn't say adults. \nClearly, SCHIP has been abused by some States that have expanded the \nprogram to cover adults when the goal of the program from the beginning \nwas to cover children. That is what people talk about. In fact, there \nare 670,000 adults participating in SCHIP. Some States are spending \nover half of their SCHIP money on adults, including adults without \nchildren. One-third of covered adults are not even parents.\n  One might say: Why do you care that the State has this program? \nBecause the Federal taxpayers are paying 65, 70, 80 percent of it. It \nis a federally conceived program and substantially federally funded \nprogram.\n  Fourteen States provide health insurance through SCHIP, the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, for adults. The Government \nAccountability Office--that is our watchdog analysis group--reports \nthat nearly 10 percent of SCHIP enrollees nationwide are adults. In \nWisconsin, 66 percent of enrollees are adults. Seventy-five percent of \nthe SCHIP funds are spent on adults, and we pay the bulk of that money. \nSixty-one percent of the funds are spent on adults in Minnesota, where \n87 percent of enrollees are adults, according to the Heritage \nFoundation. Illinois spends 60 percent of their money on adults; Rhode \nIsland, 57 percent; and New Jersey, 43 percent.\n  This year, 13 percent of all SCHIP funds will go to adults who are \nnot expectant mothers. About 30 percent of these adults are not even \nparents. Of the 14 States projected to spend more than they were given, \nallocated in 2007, 5 cover children not considered low income, and 5 \ncover adults other than expectant mothers.\n  The CMS goal and HHS goal was to end the adult waivers by 2009, but \nthis bill basically blocks the ability for that to happen.\n  No. 2, I ask this question: If this program was created to help lower \nincome children, why are some States covering middle- and high-income \nchildren and adults? Isn't this an indication that the program has gone \nfar beyond what its original concept was? Isn't this typical of big \nGovernment programs, how they grow and take over more and more, and \npretty soon become a Government-dominated system?\n  I don't think that is the way for us to go. Rich States are getting \nricher under this program. States are not stupid; they have figured out \nhow to make the program work to their advantage. If they have the \nmoney, they make it work to their advantage, if they can make their \nmatch. The definition of low income, therefore, has been manipulated. \nThe SCHIP statute defines a low-income child--this is what it says:\n\n       A child whose family income is at or below 200 percent of \n     the poverty line for a family of the size involved.\n\n  So it is supposed to be for, and was created in the fundamental \nstatute to be for, those at or below 200 percent of poverty. I will \ntalk about what that means in a minute. That is a pretty decent income, \nbut we are going way above that. However, States are allowed to \ndisregard parts of a family's income. They can just disregard it. These \nincome disregards can mean, for example, that $50,000 of a family's \nincome simply doesn't count, making many more children and adults \neligible who are not low-income people.\n  New Jersey disregards all income between 200 and 350 percent of the \npoverty level. How do they do that? I am not sure. They got a waiver, \napparently. Senator Allard presented an amendment to fix the problem of \nincome disregards. It was defeated, of course. New Jersey just \ndisregards the income between 200 and 350 percent of the poverty level.\n  Ten States and the District of Columbia now cover children in \nfamilies with incomes of up to 300 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. In those States, SCHIP provides health insurance for children in \na family of four earning up to $61,950. That is a pretty good \nincome. The program, in its current form, provides health insurance for \nchildren in those families. New Jersey has extended eligibility to \n$72,000 for a family of four--350 percent of poverty level. New York \nrecently voted to extend eligibility to families of four earning up to \n$82,000--400 percent of poverty level.\n\n  This is supposed to be a program for the poor. It basically is a \nprogram for the poor in most States--it is in my State. Some \nlegislative proposals on SCHIP would allow all States to expand SCHIP. \nSome of these proposals we are floating around here would allow all \nStates to go to 400 percent of poverty level, which would make 71 \npercent of all American children eligible for public assistance through \nMedicaid or SCHIP.\n  This bill will allow New York to cover people at 400 percent of the \npoverty level. Now, the bill says 300 percent, and that is what they \nwill say here on the floor, that it is 300 percent, but the \ngrandfathered-in program covers New York, and they are at 400 percent, \nwhich means we will be subsidizing that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I would be delighted. I hope I am wrong.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Are there any States that cover 400 percent of poverty?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That do what?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That cover children at 400 percent of poverty.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand New York has passed a law that would do \nthat.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, that is not correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It hasn't taken effect yet, but I understand they have \npassed it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No. Is it true if a State wants to cover, say, above 300 \npercent of poverty, is it true the State has to get concurrence with \nthe Secretary of HHS?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Has New York received that concurrence?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My understanding is that under the current law, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services believes it may have to grant \nthat waiver, and nothing in this bill would prevent it; is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Actually, I would not say it is 100 percent incorrect, \nbut HHS has discretion, as HHS had discretion granting other waivers \nwhich the Senator is concerned with, and, frankly, this Senator is \nconcerned with. As the Senator knows, this bill is designed to crack \ndown on the effect of those waivers and prevent any future waivers with \na lot of the adults I know the Senator is concerned about.\n  I wished to make the point that no State covers at 400 percent of \npoverty today. Secondly, if New York does seek 400 percent--if any \nState seeks 400 percent, it has to get the concurrence of the Secretary \nof HHS.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I will say this without doubt, Mr. President. \nAmendments have been offered, I believe already and will be offered, to \nmake sure New York would not be able to get the 400 percent. Because \nthe Federal taxpayers in my State of Alabama, where we provide SCHIP to \nchildren under 200 percent of poverty, we are going to be subsidizing \nthat, and I don't see any reason for us to do that. But under this bill \nit can continue, if Health and Human Services is correct, and their \nlawyers tell them they can't deny this request.\n  I will agree they probably should have been more aggressive in \ndenying some of these things and litigating, if need be.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will do my best to answer the Senator's question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator to engage in \na dialogue. Is it true, first, that the match rates States are getting; \nthat is, the Federal proportion and the State proportion, are more \nfavorable to States under the CHIP program than it is under Medicaid?\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. That is correct. Is it also true \nthat, on average, the differential is about 30 percent? That is, the \nmatch rate that States get under the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is about 30 percent better, from the State's perspective, than \nthe State gets from Medicaid; is that also true?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe so.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is true.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the distinguished committee chairman probably \nknows that pretty well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is true it is about 30 percent. Is it also true that \ndifferent States have different costs of living?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And so some States--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Although as the days and years go by, less and less \nperhaps.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Different States have different costs of living. Some are \nmore expensive to live in than other States.\n  Although the Senator is correct that States have set their \neligibility rates at 300 percent of poverty, that actually, at that \npoint, States no longer receive the Children's Health Insurance Program \nmatch rate, which is 30 percent higher on average than they receive in \nMedicaid. They can go to 300 percent or above 300 percent, but if they \ndo--if they do--isn't it also true they get a much lower match rate \nthan they receive today; that is, at the CHIP rate rather than the \nMedicaid rate?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My understanding is the Senator is correct; that is, at \nleast in Medicaid those rates, as you cover certain extras, you get a \nlower percentage rate. I am unsure of the exact details about how that \nis applied in SCHIP, but I understand there is a differential.\n\n  I would suggest to my colleague, though, that what we have done is \ncreated a system that incentivizes States to spend because they are \ngetting a very substantial--65 to over 80 percent--match to cover \nthings they wouldn't otherwise cover because it is money given gratis \nfrom the Federal Government; is that not correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, if the Senator is asking me the question, that is \ntrue, as in the case of Medicaid but reminding us that we are talking \nabout very low-income kids here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, reclaiming the floor, the GAO did a study that \ncriticized this aspect of Medicaid some time ago, and it made some \nnews; that the net effect of all this is that, on a percapita basis, \npeople in higher income States are getting more out of Medicaid than \nthey are in poorer States, on a fairly substantial basis. They have \ncriticized that policy. Some of those same policies based on that \nunprincipled approach to health care are at work in this bill.\n  Again, the Federal Government would pick up a substantial percentage \nof what New York may get if they go to 400 percent. But 350 and 300 \npercent is, I think, a bit much anyway. For example, about 70,000 \nupper-middle-class-income families who pay the alternative minimum tax \nwould also qualify for SCHIP under this bill. The program, I think, as \na matter of policy, encourages irresponsible spending.\n  Think about this: States who use up all their allotment, many of \nwhich obviously are those giving out their richest benefits, profit \nfrom States such as Alabama, who are very careful with their spending \nand stay within their allotments. In years past, if Alabama didn't use \nall the allotment given to them--and they have to match a portion of it \nto get that money--that money was redistributed to States who spent \nmore. This is, I think, unfair and not good, sound policy. It has \nencouraged States to overspend while punishing States who have been \nconscientious about controlling spending.\n  Of the States which exceeded their allotment and that have asked for \nbailouts, adults accounted for 55 percent of those States' enrollees, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office. Those States that \nhave exceeded their allotment, that have reached back into the pool and \nhave gotten more money, the GAO has found that about 55 percent of what \nthey pay out goes to adults. Not to children--adults. This bill does \nnot stop that in an effective way. It had an opportunity to, and it did \nnot.\n  Of the 18 States projected to have shortfalls for 2007, 7 have SCHIP \neligibility that is above 200 percent of the poverty level. So the 18 \nStates who were projecting they were going to spend above their \neligible amount, they are the ones that have the highest eligibility \nrate. Four of those States--Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, and New \nJersey--are at or above 300 percent of the poverty level, so you are \ntalking about subsidizing health care for a family of four earning \n$60,000 per year.\n  In addition to taking leftover money from fiscally responsible States \nsuch as Alabama, some States that have expanded their programs beyond \nthe scope of the original program have asked the Government to bail \nthem out with new money. In other words, there is not enough leftover \nmoney. Not enough leftover money now that they can scoop up from frugal \nStates such as Alabama to take care of their spending, so now they are \nasking and demanding more money from the Federal Government to match \nwhatever they want to do.\n  It is a classic example of an out-of-control Federal program running \namok. I have to tell you that is not good policy.\n  Five States have taken 83 percent of Government bailout funding for \n2006 and 2007, and 14 States received part of this funding. This is the \nextra money Congress has appropriated to fill their deficits. Only 5 \nStates have gobbled up 83 percent of these funds, with 14 States \nreceiving part of this funding. But out of $720 million, Illinois \nreceived $237 million, New Jersey $164, Rhode Island--small Rhode \nIsland--$84 million--high-income State, that is--Maryland $31 million, \nand Massachusetts $77 million.\n  So it is the high-benefit, high-tax States that are sucking up money \nout of the fund, and they want more and more. This bill does not deal \nwith that.\n  The bill only worsens the problem of States who are overspending as \nit creates a contingency fund. Now, the contingency fund is \nspecifically designed to provide this additional funding to States that \nrun out of money because they have covered too much and there is not \nenough Federal matching money for them. I think we better name this \ncontingency fund the ``Federal Fund to Encourage SCHIP Overspending.'' \nMaybe that would be the right title for it.\n  As Secretary Leavitt has said, this section indicates that either the \nallocation formulas that determine how much money States get are wildly \ninaccurate or we do want States to overspend. It seems like that is our \ngoal. That is why people are suggesting this is a subtle way to have \nthe Federal Government take over a larger and larger portion of health \ncare in America.\n  A further example of bad SCHIP policy is federally subsidizing \ninfrastructure for States to develop government-sponsored universal \nhealth care. Many States, such as Pennsylvania and Vermont, have \nalready begun the process of instituting a universal health care \nprogram. I think it is unfair to tax people in the frugal States to pay \nfor rich health care plans for the wealthy in other States. That is not \na good policy.\n  About 45 percent of American children are currently enrolled in \nMedicaid or SCHIP, though only 37 percent are in families earning less \nthan 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  This is the third question I would ask. CBO estimates that about half \nof new SCHIP enrollees from this legislation now have private \ninsurance. So my question is: Why would we spend taxpayers' money to \ninsure people who are already insured? This bill would decrease private \nhealth insurance coverage. It would encourage people to leave their \nplans. It seeks to take kids away from private coverage and move them \nto government-run health care. Parents would be financially motivated \nto take their children off private, usually employer-sponsored plans, \nand put them on a taxpayer-supported plan. Those children would then \nhave to be supported by the taxpayers; whereas, before they were \ncovered by their own private insurance plan.\n  A recent report by CBO estimates that SCHIP has reduced the uninsured \nin the target population--those we wanted to reach who are uninsured, \nlow-income children--by only 25 percent. That is the CBO saying that. \nThe target group that was uninsured--low-\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\nincome children--we have reduced those uninsured by only 25 percent. I \nthink this is because a lot of children now in SCHIP, and in many \nStates adults, are people who used to be on private health \nplans. Between 50 percent and 75 percent of Medicaid expansion funds in \nthe 1990s were spent on people who would have been privately insured, \naccording to the economist Jonathan Gruber. That is a big number. I \ndon't know if it is accurate, but that is what he concluded--between 50 \npercent and 75 percent of Medicaid expansion funds--were spent on \npeople who would have been privately insured.\n\n  One study found that 60 percent of the children who became eligible \nfor SCHIP had private coverage in the year before the SCHIP plan began. \nThat is a stunning number; 60 percent of the children who became \neligible for SCHIP had private insurance the year before. CBO found \nthat among newly eligible populations--the higher income families who \nwould be covered by this bill--one child will drop private coverage for \nevery new uninsured child who is enrolled in the public program. That \nis a stunning number.\n  Overall, for every 100 children whom this bill would enroll in SCHIP, \n50 of those children would come from private insurers. So half of the \nchildren we are going to be covering would be coming from private \ninsurance plans. I don't think that is good policy, unless it is your \ngoal to diminish private insurance and further take over the private \nsector with Federal plans.\n  These are conservative estimates, since the studies failed to \ncalculate the crowd-out effect for adults who switched to Government \nplans. A recent study----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield on that point for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. A question designed for Senators to have more information \nabout the basic point the Senator was talking about, crowd-outs, which \nthe Senator understands is people on private insurance leaving private \nhealth insurance to go to the program that Congress may have enacted.\n  Does the Senator have any idea--I found this very interesting--when \nCongress passed the Medicare Modernization Act, which included Part D \ndrug benefits--I don't know whether the Senator voted for that bill. I \nassume the Senator voted for that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I did vote for that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator know at that time what the so-called \ncrowd-out was? In fact, put it this way: Does the Senator know what \npercent of people who at that time were on private health insurance who \nmight then have gone to a program the Government offered? Does the \nSenator have any idea--I am not saying the Senator should know. Does \nthe Senator have any idea what was estimated at that time when we \npassed that bill what the crowd-out would be?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Responding to the question of the Senator, I do know \nthat you, as one of the authors of that bill which I did support, did \ncreate provisions to minimize that and deliberately took steps to \nreduce the amount of crowd-out that would occur.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sure some would occur. Of course there was a \nfeeling and observation on that from the beginning that this was a \ntrend in the country.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Correct. There is no real official conclusion of what the \nactual crowd-out has been. But does the Senator know the basic \nunofficial statistic is about 66 percent; there was about a 66-percent \ncrowd-out under the Medicare Modernization Act?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not aware of that. I know my mother didn't have \nany coverage. She was glad to get the prescription drug benefits.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to ask another question. Does the Senator know \nwhat the anticipated crowd-out was when this Children's Health \nInsurance Program was originally enacted in 1997? What was the \nestimated crowd-out then, when we passed this bill in 1997?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am curious. I don't know.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is about 40 percent. And does the Senator know what \nthe actual experience has been? About between 25 and 50 percent are the \nbest numbers we can get.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is not so much--\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Between 25 and 50.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pretty close to the estimate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You are close. Does the Senator know that when we wrote \nthis bill we asked the CBO Director, Peter Orszag, to tell us in the \nFinance Committee what we have to do to minimize the phenomenon of \ncrowding out? Of course the Senator doesn't know we asked him, but does \nthe Senator know when we asked Peter Orszag during the markup--it is on \nthe public record--were we extremely efficient and minimized the crowd-\nout as much as we possibly could, does the Senator know Mr. Orszag \nsaid, Yes, we were extremely efficient and minimized crowd-out as much \nas we possibly could?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I didn't. But I will respond by asking this question: \nIf we have crowded out prescription drug coverage for seniors, if we \ncrowd out private insurance in Medicaid for low-income people, if we \ncrowd out regardless of income concerns in general Medicare, and if we \nnow crowd out more children and even adults under a children's plan, \nwho is going to be left in private coverage?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me answer that question by asking this question in \nreturn: Would the Senator want even more crowd-outs under a different \napproach? All experts say if we try to address more coverage for low-\nincome kids through private coverage that the crowd-out would be even \ngreater. Would the Senator want that greater crowd-out to occur, \ncompared with the Children's Health Insurance Program?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would respond with this question: Isn't it true, if \nyou are setting eligibility at 400 percent of poverty, or 350 percent, \nor 300 percent of poverty, you are going to crowd out more people with \ninsurance than if you are actually taking care of poor people who are \nless likely to have insurance?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I respond to the Senator, I have forgotten the exact \nstatistic, but intuitively the answer is the one the Senator is \nsuggesting, but actually the fact is, as we established earlier, no \nState has 400 percent of poverty. No State does. No State does. But for \nthose States above 300 percent, the kids who are actually covered, the \ngreatest preponderance of kids covered is still low-income kids. I say \nof all the beneficiaries to date under the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram today, 91 percent are children at or below 200 percent of \npoverty.\n\n  This program is for kids. I know all this concern about adults and I \nshare the Senator's concern about adults. I share it very strongly. We \nworked very hard on this bill to cut down adults, as the Senator knows. \nChildless adults are phased out after 2 years and parents are much \nlower--get a poorer rate. The third category of adults, pregnant women, \nthere is a State option.\n  But the biggest concern, I am sure, of the Senator from Alabama is \nchildless adults. This is supposed to be a kid's program, not an \nadult's program. We say, OK, after 2 years you are off. As the Senator \nalso knows, back in the Deficit Reduction Act, when that was passed, we \nprevented HHS from granting any waivers for childless adults in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished chairman for his insights. It \nhas been a good dialog. I would go back, fundamentally, to the remarks \nI made at the beginning. Our present health care system is not working \nwell. I believe a simpler system, if taken as part of the idea of \nequalizing tax deductions and tax credits for all Americans--and it \nwould require spending from the Government to do that--if we did that \nin an effective way, every person could then choose their own insurance \npolicy covering themselves as they wish. I think it would be a far more \npreferable way than taking a children's program and expanding it in a \nsignificant way.\n  There is no doubt. CBO has scored that for every child who is in this \nbill who would be enrolled in SCHIP, 50 percent of those children would \ncome from private insurance coverage. That is a conservative estimate. \nIt is a big deal. Fifty percent of the people who would be picked up \nunder this plan would come from families where they are already \ncovered.\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group, \nestimates the crowd-out rate for SCHIP to be as high as 60 percent. Of \n10 million children, about 50 percent of the children in families with \nincomes below 200 percent of the poverty line have insurance. This is \nthe number for the lowest\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\nincome group. We would normally expect and do expect that higher income \nlevels would have higher crowd-out effects. In fact, CBO--our own \nCongressional Budget Office--the one we have to rely on for \ninformation, estimates that 77 percent of the children in families at \n200 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level already have private \ncoverage. How about that? And 89 percent of children in families with \nincomes between 300 percent and 400 percent of poverty have private \ncoverage, as do 95 percent of children in families above 400 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level, according to our own Congressional Budget \nOffice, which I assume our distinguished chairman does not disagree \nwith. I mean he doesn't dispute those numbers.\n  Our goal should not be to take insurance away.\n  I will conclude. I know others are here prepared to speak. I have \nenjoyed the dialog.\n  I am not comfortable with the some of the ways we are proposing to \ntake care of children and the way we are taking care of adults in a \nchildren's program and the way we are dealing with a broken Federal tax \npolicy with regard to the uninsured. I was on a task force appointed by \nformer majority leader Bill Frist, Dr. Bill Frist, to deal with the \nuninsured. We wrestled with it a number of ways. One of the ways we \ncould have gotten a million people covered was through the association \nhealth plans, the small business health plans that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle managed to block.\n  Now we are moving more money, more, I guess, new wine in old wine \nbottles here. I think we need to break out of this mentality and create \na system where you own your health insurance policy and you take it \nwith you if you change jobs. I would note that the average American \nworker has had nine jobs by the time he or she is 35. Likewise, we \nought to have savings accounts that people can take with them whenever \nthey move from job to job and provide as much security and stability \nand assurance as we can possibly provide the working American families \ntoday.\n  Middle-class families are getting hit at both ends here. They are \nrequired to pay more taxes. They are not getting the benefits. They are \nworking hard. If they are not working for a big company or the \nGovernment, they are paying a very high price for their health \ninsurance.\n  We ought to work on these things, and if we did so, we might be \nsurprised how many people might come on the insured rolls.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am not going to belabor this crowd-out issue. A lot of \npeople watching are probably asking what in the world is crowd-out. For \nthose wondering what in the world crowd-out is that we are talking \nabout here, basically it is how many people of those this legislation \ncovers--how many people would be crowded out of private health care \ninsurance. That is, if they are on private health care insurance today, \nhow many would leave private health insurance to go to the Government \nprogram.\n  A couple of points here. No. 1, those who might be inclined to vote \nfor the McConnell substitute know this, but actually the so-called \ncrowd-out is greater in the McConnell-Lott proposal than it is on a \npercentage basis under my bill. On a percentage basis, under the \nMcConnell-Lott bill, more people would be leaving private health \ninsurance to go to the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Second, the figure we hear is 1 to 1. That is not accurate. That is \nselective use of the tables. If you look at the real facts, at the \nbottom line under CBO's estimates, they actually say it is more in the \nneighborhood of--it is not 50 percent that is represented here, but \nactually it is about 30 percent.\n  It also has been represented here that maybe under tax credits, which \nis a better way to go to cover health insurance, the implication is \nthere will be less crowd-outs. Well, let me just point out that there \nis a fellow named John Gruber, and he is an MIT professor, a health \neconomist. He is often quoted by the President. Professor Gruber is \noften quoted by President Bush in this general area. What does \nProfessor Gruber say? He says that the tax credit crowd-out is, in his \nestimate, 77 percent. Much higher.\n  So for those concerned about the so-called crowd-out, I would think \nthey would like the underlying bill because of all of the approaches we \nhave discussed here, there is less crowd-out in the underlying bill \nthan in the substitute or under the Kyl-Lott amendment and much less \nthan would be the case under a tax credit approach to help low-income \nkids. I think the record should show that so Senators have full \ninformation and those watching this debate, wherever they may be, also \nhave the facts before them.\n  Madam President, I suggest that the Chair recognize Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, all children should be able to see a \ndoctor when they are sick, and all children should be able to get the \nmedicine they need to make them better. When a kid gets a cut or \nrequires stitches or comes down with a fever or an earache or with any \nimaginable problem, they should be able to get help, period. \nUnfortunately, today in America, the richest and most successful \ncountry ever, that is not the case. In fact, millions of American \nchildren do not have health insurance today, which means millions of \nAmerican children cannot see a doctor when they are sick and millions \nof American children do not get the medicine they need to get better. \nAs wages remain stagnant, as the cost of living--heat, food, clothing, \ncollege tuition, doctor's visits--increases, more and more parents \ntoday are unable to afford health care, and the ranks of uninsured \nchildren are growing.\n  This tragedy can only be described as a shame. It is unquestionably \nour moral obligation as Americans to correct it. It does not matter if \nyou are Republican or Democrat, progressive or conservative--making \nsure our children get health care is the moral thing to do. Now, most \nof us in the Senate know this, and we are working now to do the moral \nthing--support reauthorizing and improving the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP, which takes massive steps forward to giving \nour kids better health insurance in this country.\n  This bill will ensure that the 6.6 million children who are enrolled \nin CHIP continue receiving care, and it provides 3.2 million uninsured \nchildren with coverage. As a result, over the next 5 years, the number \nof uninsured children in America will drop by more than a third. It \nalso strengthens the program by increasing funding for States that need \nthe most help. You know, in recent years under President Bush's watch, \nmany of our States have faced funding shortfalls, jeopardizing the \ncoverage of countless children.\n  This bill also provides an emergency fund to cover unexpected \nshortfalls arising from economic downturns or emergencies. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan group of experts, \npredicts that 800,000 children now covered by CHIP or children's health \ninsurance will lose coverage over the next 5 years unless there is an \nincrease in funding above the base amount required.\n  This legislation which is before the Senate today provides $100 \nmillion as well for outreach and enrollment efforts that increase the \nparticipation of children in the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nIt includes a national campaign to help raise awareness of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and the targeting of our children \nin rural areas with high populations of eligible but unenrolled \nchildren today. Another outreach effort will provide funds for \ntranslation and interpretation service for CHIP, so minority children, \nespecially Native Americans and Hispanics, will become more aware of \nthis program.\n  Finally, this authorization plan provides my home State of Washington \nwith the funding and flexibility we need to provide more children with \nquality health care.\n  This bill is a big win-win for Washington State and the many families \nwho struggle to provide care for their children today. One of the \nsmartest parts of this plan is that the money for these initiatives--\n$35 billion over 5 years--comes solely from a 61-cent excise tax \nincrease on cigarettes and\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\nother tobacco products. No other programs are cut; Social Security is \nnot raided; the deficit will not be increased.\n  Not only will this bill provide millions of American children with \nhealth care, but it is estimated that it will lead 1.7 million adult \nsmokers to quit smoking, and that will cause a 9.2-percent decline in \nyouth smoking and will prevent over 1.8 million kids from becoming \nsmokers. So when you provide health care to millions of children and \nlead millions of young people to stop smoking or to never pick up a \ncigarette, this bill is a win-win for our country and for our children.\n  I think it is very important that I thank my colleague, Senator Max \nBaucus, for his tireless work on this issue and for all of America's \nchildren. Without his determination, we would not be so close to \nproviding more of our kids with health care.\n  It is also important to note that this bill is bipartisan. Senator \nGrassley has worked very hard, along with Senator Baucus, in creating \nthis legislation. It was passed out of committee on a commendable \nbipartisan basis.\n  Another big supporter of this bill on the floor has been Senator \nHatch, who was a cosponsor, actually, of the original 1997 bill.\n  I listened to him as he recently said:\n\n       We are trying to do what is right by our children who are \n     currently not being helped by our health care system. If we \n     cover children properly, we will save billions of dollars in \nthe long run. Even if we did not, we should still take care of those \nchildren.\n\n  Senators Grassley and Hatch are not alone on their side of the aisle. \nMany of our colleagues realize that supporting this legislation is the \nmoral thing to do. Unfortunately, however, President Bush does not \nagree, and he has, amazingly, threatened to veto this bill. Now, he is \ngoing to be out there giving his reasons for the veto. He is going to \nmake complicated arguments and throw some numbers around. But the \nbottom line is, the moral line is that vetoing this bill will endanger \ncoverage for millions of children who are currently enrolled in our \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and a veto will deny millions of \nkids who would become covered under the bill a chance to see a doctor \nwhen they are sick. It seems, sadly, the moral light President Bush \nsays guides his decisions has dimmed.\n  I wish to share the following story with President Bush and with any \nSenators who might be thinking about voting against this bill.\n  This is Sydney. Sydney and her mom Sandi DeBord live in Yakima, WA. \nSydney has cystic fibrosis. Sydney's mom recently wrote to me. She \ntalked about her daughter and the importance of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, which allowed Sydney to get the care she needed, \nwhich extended her life and allowed her to live her short life to the \nfullest.\n  Mrs. DeBord wrote to me, and I want to read to you what she said. \nThese are her words:\n\n       My daughter has a life-shortening genetic condition called \n     Cystic Fibrosis. With quality health care I believe her life \n     has been extended and she has been able to enjoy 9 years of \n     quality life.\n       Of course, she spent many weeks in the hospital on life-\n     saving IV antibiotics during those 9 years, and not a day \n     goes by that she does not have to endure taking a bucket full \n     of medicine. But despite the obstacle in her way, she is a \n     happy child living life to the fullest.\n       She is active, she does well in school, has many friends, \n     and loves to sing and dance. However, none of that would be \n     possible if it was not for the quality health care she \n     receives as part of the CHIP health care. I know for a fact \n     that without this bit of assistance, her life would end much \n     sooner due to the inability to afford quality health care for \n     her.\n       As her parent, it frightens me to even think some day she \n     may be without health care coverage if programs like CHIP are \n     no longer available.\n\n  She said:\n\n       I write to ask you to reauthorize the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program and ensure the program is adequately \n     funded to provide high quality health care for children with \n     Cystic Fibrosis.\n\n  I hope President Bush and opponents of this bill will listen to this \nstory. I hope they take a chance to look at Sydney and the life in her \neyes and the life she has been able to live. I know Mrs. DeBord hopes \nthey are listening as well.\n  It is our moral duty as Americans to ensure our kids can see a doctor \nwhen they are sick. The bill in front of us today fulfills that duty. \nIt ensures that children covered by CHIP remain covered, and it ensures \nthat millions without insurance today are going to get it.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to do the moral thing and support the \nreauthorization of this Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as everybody knows, I have been in the \nCHIP battle since the beginning. I just want to pay a great deal of \ntribute to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Baucus; \nthe distinguished ranking member, Senator Grassley; and, of course, \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  In the beginning instance of CHIP, my good friend, Senator Kennedy, \nand also Senator Snowe, my dear friend--all of these people had a lot \nto do with the CHIP bill from the beginning. And I have to say that the \noriginal Hatch-Kennedy bill became the CHIP bill back in 1997, and, of \ncourse, it has come all of this way to today where we are looking for \nrenewal.\n  There are some facts that really ought to be put into the equation \nhere today, and I thought I would just spend a few minutes on some of \nthe facts regarding CHIP.\n  No. 1: The Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization is not \nfull of budget gimmicks. The Senate Budget Committee has certified that \nthis legislation complies with pay-go rules of both the 6- and 11-year \nbase under the pay-go rule. The Congressional Budget Office has \nreviewed its 5-year and 10-year expenditures and revenue raisers and \nbelieves they are balanced on an on-budget basis. This bill is a 5-year \nauthorization and is fully paid for with offsets. This bill is not a \n10-year reauthorization, and that is an important point to remember. \nThe CHIP program must be reauthorized in 5 years.\n  Fact two: Some have indicated that the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram reauthorization imposes up to a $10 tax on a cigar. Well, the \ntobacco tax included in our bill prorates tobacco rates or taxes on \ncigars. The tax imposed on cigars is based on the price of a cigar. In \nvery few instances will an individual cigar be taxed at $10.\n  Another fact: The Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act \ndoes not increase the crowd-out rate. There is crowd-out because there \nis always going to be crowd-out when you try to solve some of these \nvery serious problems. Although, because we are covering more children, \nsome have concern that the crowd-out rate will increase, according to \nCBO, the fact is that the crowd-out rates will not increase.\n  Another fact: The Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act \nprohibits the Federal Government from granting future State waivers to \ncover nonpregnant adults through CHIP. Our bill puts the emphasis back \non low-income, uninsured children. Simply put, our bill puts an \nimmediate stop to States being granted future waivers to cover \nnonpregnant adults.\n  Let me give you another fact: The Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act eliminates enhanced Federal matching rates for \nnonpregnant adults. At the beginning of fiscal year 2009, States will \nreceive lower Federal matching rates for childless adults, and in \nfiscal year 2010, childless adults will not be covered under CHIP. At \nthe beginning of fiscal year 2010, only States with significant \noutreach efforts for low-income uninsured children will receive \nenhanced match rates for parents; others will receive the lower \nMedicaid match rate, or FMAP, for adults.\n  Starting in fiscal year 2011, all States will receive a lower Federal \nmatch rate for parents. Those States covering more lower income kids \nwill receive REMAP--that is the mid-point between the CHIP matching \nrate and the lower Medicaid matching rate. Other States will receive \nFMAP for CHIP parents.\n  Another fact: The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization \nAct provides lower matching rates to States for those individuals 300 \npercent of the Federal poverty level and above who are covered under \nCHIP, thus penalizing States that want to cover higher income children.\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\n  Under the current CHIP bill, States receive an enhanced Federal \nmatching rate for all income levels. Our bill discourages States from \ncovering higher income individuals in the CHIP program. After enactment \nof our bill, States that have new waivers approved to cover 300 percent \nof the Federal poverty level and above would only receive a lower FMAP \npayment for higher income individuals.\n  Let me give one more fact, and then I will make some other points. \nThe Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act is an \neffective children's health program and a small part of the overall \ncost of health. CHIP is not an entitlement program. That is something a \nlot of people don't understand. We drafted it that way because I didn't \nwant it to be an entitlement program. Now some say we will never be \nable to stop it. That may be because it works. It has saved literally \nmillions of children. It is a capped block grant program, where States \nare given flexibility to cover their low-income uninsured children.\n  According to CMS, the agency that has a lot to do with health care, \nin 2005, we spent a total of $1.98 trillion on our Nation's health care \nsystem. Private expenditures were $1.08 trillion. The Federal \nGovernment's expenditures were $900 billion. Total Medicare spending \nwas $342 billion in 2005, according to CMS, and Medicaid was $177 \nbillion in Federal dollars. Our bill today funds CHIP at $60 billion \nover 5 years. That is the $25 billion base figure and an additional $35 \nbillion to cover more children. This is a fraction of the total cost of \nhealth care in our country to provide care for low-income, uninsured \nchildren. Covering these children is worth every cent. We spend almost \n$2 trillion on health care, and the equivalent of $12 billion a year is \nwhat this program will cost, out of $2 trillion in health care, $900 \nbillion of which happens to be Federal dollars. Only $12 billion goes \nto these kids, mainly children of the working poor who earn enough that \nthey don't qualify for Medicaid but don't have enough money to buy \nprivate health insurance.\n  That is what a lot of people don't seem to understand. The CHIP bill, \nup to now, has worked quite well in spite of the waivers, which I \nbelieve should not have been granted in many respects by the last two \nAdministrations. But I have to say this program has worked very well.\n  I also wish to let everybody know that I support S. 1893, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Over the past \nfew days, I have been listening to the floor debate on the bill being \nconsidered on the Senate floor this week. I have to admit, at some \npoints during the debate, the descriptions I am hearing don't even \nsound like the bill I introduced with Senators Baucus, Grassley, and \nRockefeller. Indeed, I believe there have been many allegations by \nopponents of S. 1893 that are not accurate. Therefore, I would like to \ntake a few minutes to correct the record so my Senate colleagues hear \nfrom both sides before making a final decision on how to vote on this \nbill later this week.\n  First, I take issue with the point that our legislation is full of \nbudget gimmicks. I made that point before, but I will remake some of \nthese points. The Senate Budget Committee has certified this \nlegislation does comply with pay-go rules on both the 6-year and 11-\nyear bases under the pay-go rule. In addition, the Congressional Budget \nOffice Director, Dr. Peter Orszag, told us in last week's Finance \nCommittee markup that CBO reviewed the bill's 5-year and 10-year \nexpenditures and revenue raisers, and CBO believes they are balanced on \nan onbudget basis. In addition, this bill is a 5-year authorization \nthat is fully paid with offsets. This is how our rules operate. Those \nwho talk about its 10-year impact fail to note this bill is not a 10-\nyear reauthorization. That is an important point to remember. They \nargue that it will be very expensive in 10 years. Who knows? I can't \ntell you what it is going to cost in the remaining 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years \nnot covered by this bill, but we should all be working to try and keep \ncosts down. We have to look at the CHIP program again in 5 years and \nreauthorize it.\n  I assure my colleagues that when writing this bill, we did everything \npossible to comply with the budget rules, and any assertion to the \ncontrary is plain false. Further, I wish to remind my colleagues that \nwhen CHIP was established in 1997, we had a set amount of money and, as \na result, the budget baseline did not assume any rate of growth for the \nCHIP program. Additionally, the budget rules did not consider the fact \nthat health care costs are rising by 9 percent each year. That is not \nCHIP's fault. In many respects, that is our fault in the Congress due \nthe way we run things around here.\n  Some would say that is why we shouldn't have CHIP. I guess that is \nwhy we shouldn't have any Federal programs, if that is the argument. \nThe fact is, CHIP has worked abundantly well to help the most \nvulnerable people in our society, our children. I want to see that \ncontinue.\n  The budget rules also did not consider the increasing number of \nchildren enrolling in the CHIP program. Therefore, there is only $5 \nbillion per year for the CHIP program in the budget baseline. To me, \nthis number is unrealistic, and I think anybody who looks at it would \nagree. It creates a situation which is extremely frustrating because \nhealth care costs continue to increase in the CHIP program just like \nevery other health care program is going up 9 percent a year. That is \nsomewhat of a victory because it used to go up 13 percent a year. As a \nresult, we had to come up with the money to keep the current program \nfunctioning, not to mention additional sums for providing coverage to \nuninsured, low-income children without health care. There are many \nincidents of young children who don't have health care beyond the CHIP \nprogram or that haven't been covered by the CHIP program.\n  To keep the program running as it currently exists, it will cost the \nFederal Government $14 billion. We fixed the problem by addressing the \nshortfall. Simply put, we had to comply with the budget rules in this \nbill, and we did. So in 5 years, the Congress will have to come up with \nmoney to keep the program operating, similar to the challenge we are \nfacing with our $14 billion deficit right now.\n  We need to be realistic. Since CHIP is not a permanent program and \nnot an entitlement program, we in Congress have an even bigger job to \nkeep the program running efficiently in the next 5 years. The current \nbudget rules do not include a realistic rate of growth after the \nprogram expires. I can only conclude, then, with this bill, we are \ndoing the best we can under very difficult circumstances for some of \nthe most vulnerable people in our society, our children, the ones left \nout of the Medicaid process and whose parents don't earn enough money \nto buy insurance.\n  Another issue I have heard being raised is that our legislation will \nraise tobacco taxes on cigars to $10 a cigar. Let me make one thing \nperfectly clear. The Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act does not impose a $10 tax on each cigar. In fact, \nthe tobacco tax included in our bill prorates tobacco taxes on cigars. \nThe tax imposed on cigars is based on the price of the cigar. In very \nfew instances will an individual cigar be taxed at $10, and those who \ncan afford that kind of cigar can afford the taxes.\n  I know Senators are concerned about what some term ``crowd-out.'' \nCrowd-out is having individuals who are currently covered by private \nhealth insurance drop their private health insurance to be covered by a \ngovernment program.\n  This was my concern, as it was for Senator Kennedy, when we enacted \nCHIP originally. It is a valid concern today as well. But allegations \nthat this bill increases the crowd-out rate are untrue. According to \nCBO, the fact is, the crowd-out rate will not increase for the basic \nCHIP program. While crowd-out does remain a serious problem, the crowd-\nout rate is not worsened by our bill. People will turn to whatever is \nbetter for them. If the CHIP bill is better for these kids, they are \ngoing to turn to it. I don't think we can blame them for that. Of \ncourse, the argument is that this is the camel's nose under the tent \nfor one-size-fits-all socialized medicine. No, it isn't. But some want \nto make it that type of a program. I believe the House may be well on \nits way to trying to make it that, but we don't in this bill.\n  In fact, during the Senate Finance Committee markup last week, CBO \nDirector Peter Orszag told us the crowd-out rate for this bill is the \nsame as the\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\ncrowd-out rate for the original CHIP program. In addition, the CBO \nDirector told us that in the absence of a mandate, this approach is as \nefficient as you can possibly get per dollars spent to get a reduction \nin the number of uninsured children, the goal of the CHIP program. This \nis because the incentive fund which was created in this bill to reward \nStates for lowering the number of uninsured, low-income kids is \ndesigned so it provides a payment per child only for new Medicaid \nchildren as opposed to new CHIP children. This is helpful with crowd-\nout, first, because Medicaid is for lower income kids who are less \nlikely to have the option of private coverage, so tilting toward \nMedicaid is beneficial. Second, the payments for the incentive fund \npayments are graduated. In other words, they are not based on random \nnoise. The combination of these two is an efficient outcome.\n  According to CBO, the approach we take in our bill is probably the \nmost efficient way to have new dollars spent to reduce the number of \nuninsured children.\n  Another issue that continues to be raised is adult coverage under \nCHIP. Unfortunately, the opponents of the bill have not been very clear \nabout how adults are treated under this legislation. If I were the only \none drafting the bill, which obviously I am not, I would like to see \nall adults removed from the CHIP program today, or tomorrow, to be a \nlittle more precise. I don't think they have any business receiving \nhealth care through a program created for low-income, uninsured \nchildren. In fact, I am very disappointed with our administration for \ncontinuing to grant Federal waivers to States to cover adults through \nCHIP. This has been extremely frustrating to me. Of course, our \noriginal language allowed them to do it, but we never dreamed for a \nminute they would allow some States to have more adults on this program \nthan children. Not only is that ridiculous, that was never \ncontemplated. But that is what has happened.\n  This legislation addresses this matter by phasing childless adults \noff the CHIP program and lowering the Federal matching rate for parents \nand States who currently are covered under the CHIP program. Recently, \nSenators Grassley, Roberts, and I wrote both the President and my good \nfriend, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt, urging the \nadministration to stop granting States any new adult waivers. I was \npleased to hear back from Secretary Leavitt regarding adult waivers. I \ntruly believe the letter Senators Grassley, Roberts, and I sent to the \nPresident and Secretary Leavitt, along with the CHIP reauthorization \nbill we drafted, made some impact with the administration. I am \nencouraged that the administration says it does not intend to approve \nany new adult waivers or renew any waivers for adults. I am also \nencouraged to see the administration is making progress toward removing \nadults from the CHIP program. However, these decisions should have been \nmade a long time ago. I take issue with the point that our legislation \nwill actually reverse the progress the administration is making with \nthe States. I truly believe that one of the reasons the administration \nis finally moving forward on this is due to the pressures it has \nreceived from Congress to remove adults from the program. I look \nforward to working with the administration to make this a reality.\n  To be fair, most of these waivers were granted before Secretary \nLeavitt took over at that position. I don't want to particularly blame \nhim, but some waivers have been approved afterwards as well. I think \nthe same crowd down there has been doing it and, of course, Secretary \nLeavitt has been the one who some would blame, although I think \nunjustifiably.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act prohibits \nthe Federal Government from granting future State waivers to cover \nnonpregnant adults through CHIP once and for all. Simply put, our bill \nputs an immediate stop to States being granted future waivers to cover \nnonpregnant adults. Our bill puts the emphasis back on low-income, \nuninsured children. As one of the original authors of the CHIP program, \nI am here to tell Senators we did not create CHIP for adults. I wish we \ncould do more for the working poor adults, but we do not have the \nmoney, and this program was not created for adults. We created CHIP for \nlow-income uninsured children.\n\n  On a related matter, our legislation also eliminates enhanced Federal \nmatching rates for adults, with the exception of pregnant women.\n  Today, under CHIP, States receive an enhanced Federal matching rate \nfor those covered under CHIP. The Medicaid Federal medical assistance \npercentage, known as FMAP, ranges between 50 percent and 76 percent in \nfiscal year 2006; the CHIP FMAP ranges from 65 percent to 83.2 percent.\n  At the beginning of fiscal year 2009, States will receive lower \nFederal matching rates for childless adults, and in fiscal year 2010, \nchildless adults will no longer be covered under CHIP. With regard to \nparents, at the beginning of fiscal year 2010, only States that have \ncovered more low-income uninsured children or have undertaken \nsignificant outreach efforts for low-income uninsured children will \nreceive enhanced match rates for parents; the others will receive the \nlower Medicaid match rate, or FMAP, for adults.\n  Starting in fiscal year 2011, all States will receive a lower Federal \nmatching rate for parents. Those States covering more lower income kids \nor with significant outreach efforts will receive REMAP. That is the \nmidpoint between the CHIP matching rate and the lower Medicaid matching \nrate. The other States will receive FMAP for CHIP parents.\n  Many have also raised concerns about the income eligibility level of \nthose covered by CHIP.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act provides \nlower matching rates to States for those individuals with incomes at \n300 percent of the Federal poverty level and above who are covered \nunder CHIP, thus penalizing States that want to cover higher income \nchildren.\n  I might add, the original bill had us at 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, and approximately 90 percent of the children covered by \nCHIP were 200 percent of the federal poverty rate and below.\n  Today, States receive an enhanced Federal matching rate for all \nincome levels. Our bill discourages States from covering higher income \nindividuals in the CHIP program. Once our bill is enacted, States that \nhave new waivers approved to cover individuals 300 percent of the \nFederal poverty level and above would only receive the lower FMAP \npayment for these higher income individuals.\n  To me, this is dramatic improvement over current law which allows \nhigher income individuals to receive the same Federal matching rate \nprovided to States for covering low-income children through the CHIP \nprogram.\n  Finally, I emphasize that the CHIP program is an effective children's \nhealth program and a small part of overall health care costs. I make \nthat point one more time. CHIP is not an entitlement program. It is a \ncapped, block-granted program where the States are given flexibility \nand control, to cover their low-income uninsured children. It is \ntotally voluntary on the part of a State to participate and offer CHIP \nprogram benefits to its residents.\n  According to CMS, in 2005 we spent a total of $1.98 trillion on our \nNation's health care system. Private expenditures were $1.08 trillion, \nand $900 billion in Federal dollars. Total Medicare spending was $342 \nbillion in 2005, and Medicaid was 177 billion in Federal dollars.\n  Our bill today funds CHIP--for 5 years--at $60 billion over the 5-\nyear period. It is a fraction of the overall health care costs. If you \nwant to divide it by 5, it is $12 billion a year out of a $2 trillion \nexpenditure in this country for total health care, and out of a $900 \nbillion Federal expenditure for health care. This $12 billion per year \nis a fraction of the cost, or should I say, this $60 billion over 5 \nyears is a fraction of the cost to provide care for low-income \nuninsured children.\n  Now, I think it is pathetic for people to argue that this is running \nout of control when we are trying to cover kids who have not been \ncovered, as well as those who have--when it costs, like I say, $12 \nbillion a year out of $900 billion spent by the Federal Government. I \nwish we had a better system in the sense that the private sector could \ntake care of everybody. I think part of\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\nour problem is we have too much Federal Government involvement. But the \nfact is, for the CHIP program to be reauthorized, it is a very \nminuscule amount of money compared to the $900 billion, every year, the \nFederal Government pays for health care coverage.\n  Covering these children is worth every cent. If we do not take care \nof these children, these low-income uninsured children, these kids are \ngoing to have serious health care problems in the future, and it is \ngoing to cost the federal government a lot more than what reauthorizing \nthe CHIP program is going to cost us. We have to look forward to the \nfuture and do everything in our power to help these children.\n  It is my hope that I have cleared up some of the misconceptions that \nmy colleagues may have regarding the bill the Senate is considering \nthis week.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I apologize that I have taken \nso long, but I wanted to clear up some of these misconceptions about \nthe CHIP bill that have been stated on the floor by some of my \ncolleagues. I know they are very sincere, and I know they want to be \nfiscally responsible. But to argue that $12 billion a year or $60 \nbillion over 5 years is too much money to pay for our children--when we \nare spending $2 trillion on health care--I think that makes our point, \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana and I have been trying to make, \neven more resilient and effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama).

Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will not object. I would just like to ask if I might be \nrecognized first to simply make a unanimous consent request on a \nmodification and send it to the desk. I will not speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any objections?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2602, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

I thank the Chair and thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, first of all, before the \nSenator from Utah leaves the Chamber, I want to say that I listened to \nhim, and I appreciate his leadership. This is one of the most important \nprograms. It was created back in 1997, when the Senator from Utah took \na leading role, along with the Senator from Montana. It is truly a \nbipartisan program, and it is one that has met with great success.\n  As it was created in 1997, this Senator happened to be the elected \nState treasurer and insurance commissioner of Florida, of which in that \nposition I chaired the health insurance program for children that had \nbeen set up separate from this program. This program just all the more \nenabled us in Florida to add that many more children to receive health \ncare, particularly health care at a time that is so important in their \nlives, when those little minds are beginning to learn and those little \nbodies are beginning to build.\n  So I just want the two Senators on the floor to know how much I \nappreciate it.\n  Since 1997, even as the percentage of uninsured adults has increased, \nthe rate of low-income uninsured children has decreased by over a \nthird. As a result, these insured children, in large part because of \nthis program, have been afforded better access to primary and \npreventive care, better quality of care, improved health, and even \nimproved school performance.\n  In our State, over 300,000 children received health insurance through \nMedicaid or CHIP last year, and those children were able to enjoy these \nbenefits. But over 700,000 children in Florida remain uninsured. This \nlegislation before us is the best opportunity to expand coverage to a \nsignificant portion of those 700,000 children in Florida and millions \nof low-income uninsured children throughout the country.\n  We have seen how successful this program can be, and we are aware of \nhow many more children should be allowed to participate. So 10 years \nafter the creation of the program, now we have the opportunity to pass \nthis bipartisan bill that reauthorizes and further strengthens this \nvery popular program.\n  This legislation is bipartisan. It is going to bring health care to \nmillions of children. While many of us in this Chamber have supported \nan additional $50 billion for this program, I believe the $35 billion \nallocated in this legislation is a fair compromise. With that money, we \ncan still accomplish an increase of more than 3 million children newly \ninsured under the program.\n  I also support the inclusion of legal immigrant children and pregnant \nwomen in the program, and I was disappointed to see it was not included \nin this legislation. Under current law, legal immigrants who have been \nin this country for less than 5 years are not eligible to participate \nin Medicaid or CHIP, despite the fact they pay taxes to support those \nprograms. As a result, the preventive effects of health insurance are \nnot being realized for them. I am concerned, as so many of us are, that \nwe are going to end up paying much more in the future for health \nproblems that could have been treated\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\nearly on. I understand there will be an amendment that will be offered \nto include legal--legal--immigrants in this reauthorization, and I am \ngoing to support that amendment.\n  Now, another concern I have is a portion of the tobacco tax. It is \nnot the tobacco tax. If you have to find a source of revenue, then this \nis the place to do it. But I want to emphasize the increase in the \ntobacco tax, as a whole, is quite appropriate as a funding mechanism \nfor this legislation. It is going to have significant, positive impacts \non health. It is going to save billions of dollars in health care \ncosts, and it is going to reduce the prevalence of smoking among kids, \nwhom this bill is designed to protect. But there is a portion that is \nnot fair, and that is the tax that is applied with some inequity across \nproduct lines. Unbeknownst to most people, Florida is the largest cigar \nmanufacturing State in the country and serves also as the main port of \nentry for premium handmade cigars into the United States. There are \napproximately 30 cigar manufacturers and importers based in Florida \nwhich employ 4,000 workers and thousands more in support industries. I \nhope some of these problems with the tax which cause many multiple \nthousands of a percentage increase in the tax on those cigars is going \nto be addressed in this bill, and what is not addressed in this bill \ncan be addressed in conference.\n\n  Despite some concerns, this bipartisan legislation is a strong bill \nwith much to its credit. It will institute a more streamlined funding \nprocess and it will provide for improved child health quality measures, \nand will give States such as ours important opportunities for \nexpansion.\n  We have the opportunity to do something that is morally unassailable, \nand that is to expand access to health care to a significant number of \nlow-income children. I believe this bipartisan legislation is the best \nway forward, and I look forward to casting my vote in favor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EXCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM \n                   TAX LIABILITY FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR SCHIP \n                   COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2102(b), as amended by this Act, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Exclusion of individuals with alternative minimum tax \n     liability.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, no individual whose income is subject to tax liability \n     imposed under section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     for the taxable year shall be eligible for assistance under a \n     State plan under this title for the fiscal year following \n     such taxable year.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today in support of \nthe Kids First Act, which is being referred to as the McConnell-Lott or \nLott-McConnell alternative, which will in the long run, in my view, do \nmore to lower health care costs and help the underlying expansion bill \nwe are debating here today. Let me say also it is frustrating that \ninstead of debating a reauthorization of a very popular program--the \nSCHIP program--Members on both sides of the aisle are being asked to \nsupport a new program, a brandnew program, that will cover children and \nadults at 300 percent of the poverty level--and some at even higher \nlevels.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about the makeup of the \nuninsured population in my State of South Dakota. Right now, \napproximately 2.6 percent of the children in my State are uninsured, or \napproximately 5,000 children. This percentage does not include the \napproximately 5,000 Native American children who receive their health \ncare from the Indian Health Service. It is very important to break down \nthese statistics in each State since the needs vary greatly in each \nState and from region to region.\n  For example, of the approximately 5,000 uninsured children in South \nDakota, a number of these children are currently eligible but not \nenrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP. In other words, in my State, a number of \nour uninsured children are actually at or below 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. This SCHIP expansion bill under consideration \ndoesn't focus on these children. Instead, it channels more money to \ncover children from families at higher incomes.\n  I mention these facts because I am concerned that the underlying bill \nmisses the most key problems in my State for the uninsured, and it \nmisses the basic goal to make sure that eligible low-income children \nare able to take full advantage of our safety net health care programs. \nIf our goal is to simply put all children--or even all families, for \nthat matter--in South Dakota, insured or uninsured, into Government \nhealth insurance, and make thousands more families in my State \ndependent on the Government for their health care, and limiting more \nchoices for families and parents in my State, then that is an entirely \ndifferent goal, and it is a goal I don't share.\n  Let me expand on that a little bit, if I might, to give an idea of \nwhat the uninsured problem is in its totality in South Dakota. \nCurrently, according to our State, there are approximately 61,000 \nuninsured individuals--an uninsured rate of the adult population of \nabout 9 percent. I have already discussed the statistics for children, \nso let me do so for adults. In a recent survey done by the State of \nSouth Dakota, the adult uninsured population breaks down in the \nfollowing way: Of the total number of uninsured adults--approximately \n53,390--13,401 are not employed. That amounts to about 25 percent. This \nmeans that approximately 70 percent of the uninsured adults in my State \nare actually working. If you break down that number even further, most \nof that number--31,000 out of 37,000--are employed, working 30 or more \nhours a week. They are not part-time workers.\n  About 10,500 of these employed and uninsured individuals are self-\nemployed. We happen to have a large number of self-employed farmers and \nranchers and business owners in my State who simply cannot afford \nhealth insurance.\n  But the uninsured population in my State could purchase insurance if \nit were more affordable. There are huge steps we could take to bring \ndown the cost of insurance in my State for all of those small business \nemployees and self-employed and cover even more uninsured, and without \nexpanding a government program with tax increases.\n  Also, the cost to insure a child or adult under the SCHIP program is \nthree to four times the cost of insuring a child with private \ninsurance. That is an inefficient way of covering people who are \nuninsured. Already today, about half of our country's children are on \npublic insurance. That is not sustainable, and it makes it nearly \nimpossible in the State of South Dakota--a very rural State--already \nwith more limited options than others when it comes to health care \naccess to have a vibrant health care insurance market.\n  I was in the House of Representatives when the current SCHIP bill \npassed in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I voted for that. I voted \nfor other reforms as a Member of the House of Representatives and since \ncoming to the Senate. Frankly, I think the debate over health care \nneeds to be engaged in this country, because we have way too many \npeople who are uninsured. Our\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\nhealth care costs in this country now are a couple billion dollars--we \nhave heard that repeated throughout the debate on the floor today--or \nabout 16 to 17 percent of our gross domestic product. That is an \nenormous amount of money that is spent on health care in this country.\n  I think we have to ask ourselves: What can we do to make reforms in \nthe health care system that will lower costs, make health care more \naccessible to more people in this country, and make sure that the ranks \nof the uninsured decrease rather than increase?\n  One of the things I supported as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives is small business health plans--expanding access to \ntax-advantaged accounts that allow people to own and take control of \ntheir own health care, such as health savings accounts. In fact, small \nbusinesses make up most of the employers in my State. In 2003, \naccording to the Small Business Administration, there were 20,400 \nemployer firms with fewer than 500 employees, which represented 96.9 \npercent of employer businesses in my State and employed approximately \n63 percent of the nonfarm private workforce. The alternative I referred \nto--the McConnell-Lott alternative that will be offered--will allow for \nsmall business health plans, a proposal that will do much more for my \nState in the long run and strengthen our private health insurance \nmarket in the future. Small business health plans would allow small \nbusiness associations to band their members together to purchase more \naffordable insurance, which increases their bargaining power to get \nbetter benefits at better prices such as big businesses currently get.\n  This proposal also gives small business health plans the flexibility \nto provide a variety of uniform benefit packages across State lines, \nwhich is the only way small business associations could provide new \noptions affordably. As a result, this proposal would reduce the cost of \nhealth insurance for small employers by about 12 percent, or $1,000 per \nemployee, according to a respected actuarial firm. The bill would also \ncover more than 1 million uninsured Americans and working families or 1 \nout of every 12 people who live in a family headed by someone who works \nfor a small company. The Congressional Budget Office states that three \nout of every four small business employees would pay lower premiums \nunder the McConnell-Lott alternative than under current law.\n\n  What I want for South Dakota is for more people to have control over \ntheir health care, more options for their care, and more competition in \nthe insurance market to help bring prices down. In fact, last week I \nintroduced a bill to expand access to private long-term care insurance \nby allowing individuals with IRAs or 401(k)s to withdraw funds penalty \nfree to pay for long-term care premiums. This is extremely important in \nSouth Dakota and across the country where many seniors have to spend \ndown their life savings to pay for long-term care or to qualify for \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota if I could interrupt for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. THUNE. I yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I yield a couple of minutes to Senator Baucus for the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m. the \nSenate vote in relation to Senator Dole's amendment No. 2554; that \nfollowing that vote the Senate vote in relation to Senator Bunning's \namendment No. 2547; that following that vote the Senate vote in \nrelation to Senator Lott's amendment, as modified, No. 2593; and \nfollowing that vote the Senate vote in relation to Senator Kerry's \namendment No. 2602, as modified; that there be 2 minutes for debate, \nequally divided, prior to each vote; that no other amendments be in \norder prior to these votes; that any amendment not disposed of remain \ndebatable and amendable, and that the time between now and 6 p.m. be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, I only want to speak to the \ndivision of the time between now and the proposed schedule of votes. I \nhad come to the floor hoping to gain 10 minutes, and I wonder--the \nSenator obviously who is speaking now and the other Senator who has \ntime reserved, if we could have some understanding in the allocation if \nit is possible for me to be able to speak for up to 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. First, Mr. President, I modify the unanimous consent \nrequest to say that after the first vote, there be 10 minutes between \nvotes--that they be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will do my best to allocate time from \none of the remaining speakers so that the Senator from Idaho could \nspeak as much as he can. We are trying to use the time as best we can \nbetween now and 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could interrupt, Senator Thune was \nspeaking and I would ask, how much more time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to the majority leader that I can wrap up my remarks \nspeaking to the amendment specifically, but I am sure within the next \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does Senator Craig need?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would hope to have somewhere near 10 minutes, if \npossible.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would ask whether it is understood \nthat I would have up to 15 minutes, and I don't think I will need that \nlong, but I do make that request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the order has been Senator Nelson and \nSenator Thune--excuse me, the Senator from Florida, Senator Thune, and \nSenator Lautenberg. I think given the time, if the Senators understand \nthe three remaining speakers have a total of a half hour, we can work \nthat out. The Senator would get at least 10 minutes, and depending upon \nthe length of time other Senators speak, he may get more. Senator Thune \nstill has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I \nthought we had carved out an understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the current agreement, Senator Thune has \nthe floor, and the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, will \nfollow. We are free to modify that agreement if there is no objection \nto add the Senator from Idaho for additional time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will not object. Let's get these Senators \ntalking so we don't burn up any more slack time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota may proceed.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me again pick up where I left off in \nregard to the cost of health care, both health care in the sense that \nwe all need it, and as we get into retirement age, Medicare, but I was \nalso making reference to long-term care in some legislation I \nintroduced recently with regard to that.\n  It is important that affordable, long-term care insurance allow \nindividuals to plan for their later years as well. More competition in \nthe long-term care insurance market would mean more options for South \nDakota's families and seniors, not to mention reductions in Federal \nspending. So putting the politics of Government on health care versus \nprivate insurance aside--and again, I believe that is a debate this \nSenate is going to have to join in the not too distant future, because \nI believe this is where the debate actually today is taking us. We are \ngrowing the amount of Government health care out there, pushing aside \nthe options for private health care insurance. Frankly, I believe the \nthing that differentiates our country from those around the world and \nwhy people come here for health care rather than going to other \ncountries is because we have the best health care in the world.\n  We have a robust free market-based system that allows for innovation \nand for research and comes up with literally the best therapies in the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nI want to continue to make that market work. I don't want to make it \nharder for citizens in my State to get health insurance in the private \nmarketplace. I fear that as we go down this road, we are starting to \nlook at what, in effect, will be a major debate raging; it is raging \nacross the country, but it will ultimately be dealt with here, and we \nwill decide whether we want to have a government-run, bureaucratic \nhealth care system or whether we want to preserve the market-based \nsystem that has worked so well for us in the past. I don't want to make \nit harder for citizens in my State to choose and afford the insurance \nplan that is best for them.\n  Finally, I don't want to support doubling the size of this particular \nprogram, which, after 5 years, is going to have to be paid for with \nsubstantial tax increases on all Americans, because I think as we all \nknow when you reach 2013, there is a cliff there, and at some point \nthat issue is going to have to be dealt with because there is a huge \nfunding shortfall under the proposal that is on the floor before us \ntoday.\n  I support the McConnell-Lott alternative, which reauthorizes the \ncurrent SCHIP program and also helps lower health care costs for all \nAmericans and because it allows for small business health plans and \nother types of alternatives that can be used by allowing South Dakotan \nsmall businesses to pool together to purchase more affordable health \ninsurance and make further needed improvements to the underlying SCHIP \nprogram for children, as well as providing long-term solutions for \nlowering the cost of health care for all Americans.\n  I also wish to speak on amendment No. 2579, which I offered. Under \nthis bill, the Congress will be making it possible, as my colleague \nfrom Montana pointed out earlier--it is not the case today, but there \nare some States around the country where this bill expands the \nunderlying amount, or income eligibility, up to 300 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. But there are States which have waiver requests \nthat would allow them to go to 400 percent of the poverty level. There \nis not anything in the underlying bill that prevents that from \nhappening. That would make it possible for people to be put on the \nrolls of the SCHIP program for health care who are not only low income \nbut who at the same time are subject to the alternative minimum tax, or \nthe AMT, which is a tax intended for individuals and families who are \nwealthy.\n  Let me repeat that. Under the bill, individuals eligible for SCHIP--\none of our Nation's safety net health insurance programs--may also be \nhit with the alternative minimum tax, which is meant to ensure that the \nwealthy in our society are paying their fair share of taxes. \nEffectively, the Federal Government could consider you poor under the \nSCHIP program for the purpose of providing you free health insurance, \nwhile at the same time the Internal Revenue Service considers you \nwealthy because of the level of income you make, so that you would have \nto pay higher taxes.\n  My amendment is pretty straightforward. It simply says that if a \nfamily finds out when they file their taxes that they are subject to \nthe AMT, then the State in which they reside has to remove them from \nits SCHIP program by the following fiscal year. In other words, you \ncannot be eligible for both. You cannot be both rich and poor at the \nsame time.\n  The SCHIP program should be preserved as a program for low-income \nchildren, for those who need it. This amendment is simply intended to \nensure we continue focusing on that fact.\n  I remember, as I said, this debate from 1997, when we decided to \ncreate the SCHIP program. I was in the House at that time, and I \nsupported the creation of this program to help the uninsured who have \nincomes too high to qualify for Medicaid. But I also remember the \nconcerns of my colleagues that down the road we would be faced with \npressure to expand the program. That is what has happened for decades \nwith entitlement spending in this country. We know we are facing a \nfiscal crisis already in Medicare and Medicaid that cannot be solved \nwith more Government expansion. Yet here we are today debating how much \nto expand a government safety net program for the uninsured, which \noriginally was supposed to serve only low-income children.\n  Of course, my amendment today also points out the fallacy of the \nalternative minimum tax. Under current law, if we don't enact another \n``patch'' or comprehensive AMT reform, middle-income families \neverywhere will be hit with this tax, and some people on SCHIP might \neven hit both. This amendment is not simply to point out we have a \nlooming AMT problem, which we all know must be paid for, my amendment \npoints out the mixed intentions of the underlying bill. If you want to \nmake this debate about low-income children, let's do that, but if we \nwant to expand eligibility for SCHIP for families making up to $62,000 \nor $82,000 for a family of four, if waivers are granted, then let's \nhave a debate on the uninsured. Let's not kid ourselves that this bill \ndoesn't take us closer to government-run, government-dominated \nuniversal health care for lower, middle, and upper income families.\n  I welcome the debate on the uninsured. There are so many things we \ncan do to help lower the cost of prescription drugs and increase \ncompetition and portability in the health insurance market and help our \nsmall businesses and the self-employed in our States afford their \nhealth insurance. It is these ideas we need to discuss in a debate in \nthis Chamber--an open and honest debate on the merits of a government-\nrun system or one with competition, choice, and affordability. The \nestimated 61,000 uninsured adults and children in my State and the over \n40 million uninsured around the country makes it imperative to this \nCongress to have that debate.\n  The amendment I offered, amendment No. 2579, would make it very clear \nunder this bill that if somehow someone gets to an income level where \nthey are running afoul of the alternative minimum tax or are considered \nwealthy or rich in this country, they are not also then considered poor \nin a sense that they qualify for the SCHIP program. That seems to be an \ninherent contradiction in this particular legislation.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate will support my amendment. It will \nimprove the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from New Jersey wishes \nto speak. He has a very deep interest in one of the amendments. He \nwants to speak for 15 minutes. Maybe he can speak a little less than \nthat. I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will try to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2547\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to soon be voting on an \namendment proposed by Senator Bunning. I rise to register my opposition \nto that amendment, and I hope my colleagues will follow me.\n  I come to the floor to defend the health and well-being of 3,000 \nchildren in the State of New Jersey who would have their children's \nhealth insurance stripped away from them by the Bunning amendment.\n  Our mission this week is to pass a bill to expand health coverage for \nour Nation's children. But instead of focusing on providing more \ncoverage for children, the Senator from Kentucky has targeted 3,000 \nchildren in my State to take their coverage away.\n  None of us has any asset we treasure more than our children. None of \nus enjoys anything more than the smiles of our kids when they are \nfeeling good and are in good health. That is why, when we see an \nattempt to remove health care from a modest-income family's children, \nwho care so deeply about them, I wonder what it is that we are truly \nabout.\n  This amendment is an assault on children from working families who \nrequire health care coverage. To think that while we spend $3 billion \neach and every week on the Iraq war, there is an unwillingness to \nprovide the necessary funding to keep all our kids healthy regardless \nof their income situation. This one focuses on modest-income people. It \nis amazing that while we pledge to protect our people from harm, we \nshun the opportunity to shelter our children.\n  I wish to make our request clear to my colleagues, and I want them to \nrecognize that we in New Jersey always\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\npay our way fully; we more than pay for the incredibly high cost of \nliving in New Jersey. Our health care costs are among the highest in \nthe Nation. Keeping our people healthy is a primary mission in our \nState. We have had stem cell research going back decades. Our \npharmaceutical companies constantly research for new medicines to \nbenefit the well-being of people across this country and the world.\n  The Bush administration has recognized the higher costs in New Jersey \nand explicitly granted our State the right to provide health care to \nchildren at the level it currently does. New Jersey is not trying to \nbeat the system or get health coverage for its children in a way that \nis unfair to other States--not at all. The State of New Jersey is \nlegitimately trying to provide health insurance to children, \nrecognizing the distinct economic characteristics of our State.\n  The Bunning amendment is particularly discouraging, given New \nJersey's support when it comes to helping other States in need. We know \nthat other States have different needs than we do, and we have unique \nchallenges we face as well. Time and again, New Jersey taxpayers are \nasked to shoulder the burden and help other areas of the country that \nare in need. In fact, for every dollar New Jersey gives to the Federal \nGovernment, we only get back 55 cents in Federal spending programs. \nCompare that with States such as Kentucky, for example, which for every \ndollar paid gets $1.45 back. Some States get up to $2 back for each \ndollar they pay.\n  Whether it is the universal service fund for telephones, essential \nair service in aviation or other programs, New Jersey gives far more \nthan it gets back.\n  I want to be clear. I support many of these programs for other \nStates. I recognize this occurs because New Jersey is a State with a \nhigher-than-average income and higher-than-average costs compared to \nother States.\n  But we care as much about our children as other people do across the \ncountry. More than anything, we want our kids to be healthy.\n  There are 3,000 children in New Jersey who are depending on Senators \nto oppose the Bunning amendment--3,000 children who are looking to all \nof us to let them continue to have health care.\n  The Bunning amendment is contrary to everything we are trying to \naccomplish on the floor this week. If that amendment is adopted, this \nbill will be tainted with the legacy of taking health insurance away \nfrom children who need it but whose families cannot afford to supply it \non their own.\n  I have many families who come in to see me and bring their children \nwith them. I welcome them with open arms. There is nothing I find more \nsatisfying than to see parents and their children together. They come \nin often with diseases that are difficult, such as autism, diabetes, \nand asthma. Not only do these children require a lot of love, \naffection, and attention but, unfortunately, very often it is at a cost \nthat few families can bear. I want to help those kids, those families, \nand I reach out to them in any way I can. I want stem cell research to \nbe available. I want more money spent on general health research.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment on a bipartisan \nbasis. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking \nmember for the work they did. They overwhelmingly rejected the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky on a bipartisan vote. This \namendment that has been authored by the Senator from Kentucky flies in \nthe face of the good judgment of the Finance Committee. I hope my \ncolleagues will reject this amendment, the Bunning amendment, once \nagain when it gets to the Senate floor.\n  I am pleased to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2593\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak briefly to the Republican \nalternative--the amendment that will be voted on later as a \ncomprehensive alternative to the bill. Unlike the Finance Committee \nbill, the Republican alternative achieves the following goals:\n  First, it reauthorizes SCHIP and preserves health care coverage for \nmillions of low-income children.\n  Secondly, it adds 1.3 million new children to SCHIP coverage.\n  Third, it provides $14 billion in new SCHIP allotments over the $25 \nbillion baseline over the next 5 years.\n  Fourth, the offset is with no new tax increases and, importantly, in \ncontrast in the committee bill, no gimmicks to meet the budget \nconsiderations.\n  Next, it includes funds for SCHIP coverage from fiscal year 2013 to \n2017. This is important because the Finance Committee bill, in \ncomparison, uses a budget gimmick to reduce the SCHIP funding spending \nover that critical period of time. As a result, the Republican \nalternative includes more money for SCHIP over 10 years--$85.1 billion \nas compared to the Finance Committee bill of $81.7 billion.\n  Next, it minimizes the reduction in private coverage by targeting \nSCHIP funds to low-income children. It doesn't provide the coverage for \nthe adults or children for higher income families who may have access \nto private health care insurance, as does the committee bill. In fact, \nI note that according to CBO, for the newly eligible people to be \ncovered, there is a one-for-one crowd-out effect by the committee \nproduct. That is to say, for every new family brought on for SCHIP \ncoverage, there is one that goes off private health insurance coverage. \nThat is not a goal to which we should be aspiring.\n  Next, the Republican alternative promotes market-based health \nreforms, such as small business health plans and health savings \naccounts.\n  Finally, it requires a Treasury Department study on ways to make the \ntax treatment of health care more equitable, something the President \nraised in his State of the Union speech earlier this year and which we \ndo need to study to come up with a more equitable tax system.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Republican \nalternative. I note that it is very simple in terms of the two choices \nthat confront the Senate: one, a budget buster that does not protect \nSCHIP coverage over 10 years and represents an open-ended financial \nburden on American taxpayers and takes a significant step toward \nGovernment-run health care, or a fiscally responsible SCHIP \nreauthorization that preserves coverage for millions of low-income \nchildren that is fully offset without budget gimmicks or tax increases \nand promotes market-driven health reforms.\n  To me, the choice is very clear. The Republican alternative is the \nright solution for everyone. I urge its adoption by my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2602\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I rise in support \nof the Kerry amendment. I do so for two reasons. No. 1, while I applaud \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their work on expanding health \ninsurance to 3.2 million more children, we should be aware that \nexpansion only increases coverage for one-third of children in this \ncountry who are uninsured. This is the United States of America, and we \nshould not continue to be embarrassed by the fact that we remain the \nonly country in the industrialized world that does not provide health \ninsurance for all of our children. Going forward for 3.2 million \nchildren is undoubtedly a step forward. We have, however, a long way to \ngo, and the Kerry amendment would take us closer.\n  The second point I wish to make deals with national priorities and \nthe direction in which we believe our country should go.\n  I hear that a lot of my friends are talking about the expense \ninvolved in providing health insurance to our children. This particular \nbill would cost us $35 billion over a 5-year period. Is $35 billion a \nlot of money? It is. Is it worth spending that money to cover 3.2 \nmillion children? It is. Yet I find it ironic that the President of the \nUnited States and others are telling us we cannot afford this \nexpenditure at the same time that many--the President, certainly--are \ntelling us we need to repeal completely the estate tax, which only \napplies to the wealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of our population. If \nwe were to repeal the estate tax, one family, the Walton family who \nowns Wal-Mart, would receive tax breaks worth $32.7 billion for one \nfamily. So the debate today is whether we spend $35 billion to\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\ncover, over a 5-year period, 3.2 million children or, as the President \nand others would have us do, give $32.7 billion in tax breaks to one \nfamily. This is an issue of national priorities.\n  Very briefly, because I see my friend from Iowa standing, it seems to \nme we have to move not only to provide health insurance for all our \nchildren, but, in fact, we need to move to a national health care \nprogram that guarantees health care for every man, woman, and child in \nthis country, and we can.\n  I conclude on that note. This is a moral issue. We have to cover our \nchildren. This is an issue of national priorities. For all of those who \nthink we are spending too much money, they may want to think twice \nabout the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks they have given \nto the wealthiest 1 percent and the ideas they have for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if it is OK, I yield to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this week the Senate is engaged in an \nextremely important debate about the direction we as a Congress want to \ntake in ensuring health care for all Americans.\n  I recognize that the bill we are debating this week is literally one \nthat focuses on children's health. But, I believe the design of this \nlegislation and who we are targeting tells us something about how the \nmajority in the Senate believes we should provide health care for all \nof our citizens.\n  This bill lays out one way to provide health care coverage in this \nNation. It says ``increase taxes, increase government spending, and \nhave the Government provide all health care plans.''\n  That is a failing formula. And now we are going to use that tax-and-\nspend formula to move further down the road towards socialized \nmedicine.\n  Under this bill, middle-class taxpayers in Idaho will be supporting \nhealth insurance for some families making more money than they are.\n  I strongly oppose the Finance Committee legislation. Instead, I will \nvote for the McConnell-Lott alternative bill.\n  Let me make it clear that I support reauthorizing the SCHIP program \nto ensure that low-income children have health insurance. No one should \nconclude that my vote against this bill is a vote against insuring poor \nchildren. My vote is a vote against massive tax increases and out-of-\ncontrol spending. It is against a tax-and-spend policy that more than \ndoubles the cost of a program for poor children so we can cover those \nwith higher income. And it is against a budget gimmick that leaves an \nunfunded liability of $40 billion in just 5 years.\n  A little history and few facts are in order.\n  When a Republican Congress and a Democratic President set out in 1997 \nto insure low-income children, we talked about 10 million uninsured.\n  At that time, there were about 20 million children on Medicaid. So we \nneeded to cover about 10 million kids with the SCHIP program or \nMedicaid.\n  Today, there are 36 million children enrolled in either Medicaid or \nSCHIP. Sounds like we achieved our goal and more.\n  Yet some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we are \nstill 9 million short. Somehow, we insured 16 million more kids in the \nlast 10 years and we have made no dent in the problem? Or have we moved \nthe goal post? I think we have moved them.\n  That is why I am pleased that Senators McConnell, Lott, and others \nhave offered an alternative that keeps this program focused on the \ngroup it was created to serve--low-income children.\n  The Republican alternative will reauthorize the SCHIP program for \nanother 5 years. Again, all of us favor providing health insurance to \nlow-income children. It will also correct some of the policy problems \nwith the current program and make some changes to the Finance Committee \napproach.\n  First and foremost, the Republican alternative will provide, coverage \nfor all children at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. \nThat is the goal of the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The Finance Committee bill will increase the coverage allowance to \n300 percent of the poverty level and, in some cases, allow coverage of \neven higher incomes than that.\n  In addition, the Republican alternative will stop the waivers that \nhave led to the current situation where a children's health insurance \nprogram covers about 700,000 adults.\n  Also, the Republican alternative will provide $400 million in \noutreach funding. This funding represents the key to the philosophical \ndifference between the Republican bill and the Finance Committee bill.\n  Our bill demands that Government stay focused on the population in \nneed. We shouldn't just raise the coverage ceiling. Let's go out and \nfind the one's who are already eligible and have no insurance. And then \nlet's enroll them.\n  Further, the Republican alternative would make sure that we have a \nconsistent definition of income. No longer can States simply \n``disregard'' all kinds of income in an effort to enroll higher income \npeople. Frankly, the practice of disregarding income so that nonpoor \ncitizens qualify for poverty programs is fairly offensive.\n  The other important aspect of the Republican alternative is that it \naddresses health care coverage in a larger context.\n  Let's face it, uninsured children are just the tip of the health \ninsurance problem in this Nation.\n  We are once again tinkering around the edges rather than taking on \nsystemic reform. The Democratic tinkering moves us in the direction \nthey want for the Nation--socialized medicine.\n  Republicans have a better idea.\n  The bill will provide much needed relief to small business to allow \nthem to provide health care benefits to their employees.\n  Nearly 60 percent of the 45 million uninsured Americans today are \nemployed by, or reliant on, small business. In other words, if we can \nhelp small business insure their employees, then we can make a \nsignificant dent in the total number of uninsured Americans.\n  I just do not see how we can take up the issue of health care and \nhealth insurance and not talk about one way we can truly help insure \nAmericans. Of course, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndon't want to do that because it doesn't take us further down their \nroad towards socialized medicine.\n  I don't want to go down that road. So I will vote for the Republican \nalternative. It is fiscally responsible, it focuses the SCHIP program \non those it was created to help, and it takes a larger look at the \nproblem of health insurance for all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell-Lott amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the McConnell-Lott \nalternative so we do not begin a progressive march down a road toward \nsocialized medicine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the alternative Senator Craig just spoke \nabout is the amendment I wish to speak against. I am a Republican, but \nI am part of the bipartisan effort to pass this SCHIP bill. So I will \ntell my colleagues on both sides of the aisle why the Lott amendment, \nor the Republican alternative, should not be accepted.\n  First of all, I commend the people who authored the alternative \nbecause all ideas ought to be considered. It is creative, and it is \nthoughtful. It certainly contributes to the debate. In reading through \nit, I am struck by the similarities between this proposal and the \nbipartisan bill before the Senate that I am backing. Both proposals \nincrease funding for State allotments. Both proposals largely base the \nnew allotments on State projections. Both proposals limit the \navailability of allotments to 2 years. Both proposals restrict coverage \nfor nonpregnant adults. Both proposals prohibit new waivers for adult \ncoverage. Both proposals provide funds for outreach and enrollment \nactivities. Both proposals include additional State options for premium \nassistance.\n  Lest my colleagues think I am attacking them with faint praise, I do \nacknowledge there are significant differences in the approaches between \nthe Republican alternative and our bipartisan bill that is before the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\n  The position taken by the Lott amendment is that SCHIP has been a \nsuccessful small program that covers about 6 million kids in 2007 and \nshould not cover many, if any, more. The position of the Lott amendment \nis that any increase in the enrollment of children should be limited to \nthe relatively better off SCHIP kids and not cover the poorer Medicaid \nkids. That is a perfectly reasonable position for them to take, but \nthat is the biggest difference between the Lott amendment and the \nbipartisan proposal that is referred to as Grassley-Baucus.\n  The difference is that the amendment supporters cannot claim that it \nincreases coverage for any of the 4 million uninsured children who are \neligible and entitled to Medicaid, the kids who need it most. In fact, \nnot only does the Lott amendment do virtually nothing to improve \ncoverage for the 4 million children eligible for Medicaid, but it adds \ninsult to injury by reducing the Medicaid Program by over $10 billion \nto pay for an expansion of SCHIP.\n  Let me put this another way. The Lott amendment drains billions out \nof the Medicaid Program, which is a program that covers the poorest of \nthe poor, and it redirects that funding to SCHIP, a program that covers \nkids and families who make too much to qualify for Medicaid. It is the \nold issue of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Senate Finance Committee \nbill, on the other hand, covers 1.7 million kids eligible for Medicaid \nbut not enrolled.\n  At this point, it is important to reiterate for colleagues that the \nSenate Finance Committee bill does not expand Medicaid. The bill does \nnot change eligibility for Medicaid one single bit.\n  The Senate Finance Committee bill does include the very precise and \ntargeted incentive funds that Director Peter Orszag of CBO concluded is \n``as efficient as you can possibly get per new dollar spent.'' This \nincentive fund helps increase coverage of 3.2 million uninsured \nchildren. The Lott amendment, however, does not increase coverage for \nthe lowest income children and actually causes some individuals, \nincluding children currently enrolled in SCHIP, to lose coverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nIowa desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we simply, then, have an honest \ndisagreement on whether we want to cover additional low-income kids. \nSome Members do; some Members do not. I am on the side that wants to \ncover additional low-income children who are eligible for coverage. It \nis as simple as that.\n  The other main difference is the income eligibility for children. \nRight now, 91 percent of the SCHIP funds are being spent on kids at or \nbelow 200 percent of poverty. Under current law, States have the \nflexibility to adjust their income eligibility to respond to rising \nhealth care costs and the cost of living within a particular State \nbecause it differs so much between California and Iowa, to name two \nStates.\n  The Lott amendment imposes a ``Washington knows best'' mentality \nregarding a State's ability to determine what income within that State \nis most appropriate. And then it goes one step further: It reduces the \nFederal match for covering kids above 200 percent of poverty. There are \n18 States that currently cover kids above 200 percent of poverty. Under \nthis proposal, a State currently receiving the enhanced match under \nSCHIP for coverage of eligible children would see that match reduced \nfor those very same children.\n  While I would prefer that all States focus on children at or below \n200 percent of poverty, the fact remains that $42,000 a year for a \nfamily of four is a lot harder to get by on in some States than in \nother States. By imposing this new requirement that States limit \neligibility, the Lott amendment would cause kids to lose coverage. The \ntable CBO sent us on the Lott amendment confirms that. I am sorry, but \nin a bill designed to cover kids, cutting them off is a step in the \nwrong direction.\n  The Finance Committee bill takes a different approach. The committee \nbill would lower the Federal payments to States that choose to cover \nkids over 300 percent of poverty level. States that go above that limit \nwould only get the regular Medicaid match. Those States wouldn't get \nthe enhanced Federal match under SCHIP for these higher income kids. So \nthe Finance Committee bill creates a disincentive for States to go in \nthat direction.\n  Some have alleged that the Senate Finance Committee bill would permit \nStates to cover kids and families who make over $80,000. That is false. \nWhat the Finance Committee bill does is allow States that have passed \nState laws to increase eligibility to be grandfathered at the SCHIP \nmatch as it is right now. There are no States that do that today. So it \nis incorrect to say that the Finance package expands coverage for these \nhigher income kids. That just is not accurate.\n\n  Right now, the only State that is even proposing to go as high as 400 \npercent of poverty is New York, and their State plan amendment still \nmust be approved by the Bush administration. The Bush administration, \nnot Congress, has to decide whether to approve that coverage.\n  So let me repeat. The Senate Finance bill would only permit New York \nto get an enhanced match for kids and families over 83 percent a year \nif this administration approves their plan, and it gives my colleagues \non this side of the aisle who don't want that to happen a chance to \nlobby the Secretary of HHS to make sure it doesn't happen.\n  Given the criticism they leveled against the Finance plan, I would be \nshocked if they did approve it. I will wait and see, however, if their \nactions match their rhetoric.\n  Wrapping up, let me just say again that the Lott amendment has many \nsimilarities that I have delineated for the Senate--many similarities \nto the Finance Committee package. I commend them for their work in \nputting together this proposal, and I would hope that since their \namendment has so many similarities to the Senate Finance Committee \nbill, perhaps they will take another look at the policies in our \nbipartisan package. There are key differences in the two approaches, \nhowever. I appreciate my colleagues' work in pointing out these \ndifferences. I, for one, am happy to stand on the side of covering kids \nrather than cutting them out, and I support giving States flexibility.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2540 and 2541 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Madam President, I call up for consideration two amendments by \nSenator Ensign, amendments Nos. 2541 and 2540.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Ensign, \n     proposes amendments numbered 2540 and 2541 to amendment No. \n     2530.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask that further reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2540\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit a State from using SCHIP funds to provide \ncoverage for nonpregnant adults until the State first demonstrates that \n it has adequately covered targeted low-income children who reside in \n                               the State)\n\n       On page 58, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Cover Kids First Implementation Requirement.--\n     Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this section, no \n     funds shall be available under this title for child health \n     assistance or other health benefits coverage that is provided \n     for any other adult other than a pregnant woman, and this \n     title shall be applied with respect to a State without regard \n     to such subsections, for each fiscal year quarter that begins \n     prior to the date on which the State demonstrates to the \n     Secretary that the State has enrolled in the State child \n     health plan at least 95 percent of the targeted low-income \n     children who reside in the State.''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2541\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit a State from providing child health assistance or \nhealth benefits coverage to individuals whose family income exceeds 200 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Level unless the State demonstrates that \n  it has enrolled 95 percent of the targeted low-income children who \n                          reside in the State)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 112. COVER LOW-INCOME KIDS FIRST.\n\n       Section 2105(c) (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(c)), as amended by \n     section 602, is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(12) No payments for expenditures for child health \n     assistance or health benefits coverage for individuals whose \n     gross family income exceeds 200 percent of the poverty line \n     unless at least 95 percent of eligible low-income children \n     enrolled.--\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, for fiscal \n     years beginning with fiscal year 2008, no payments shall be \n     made to a State under subsection (a)(1), or any other \n     provision of this title, for any fiscal year quarter that \n     begins prior to the date on which the State demonstrates to \n     the Secretary that the State has enrolled in the State child \n     health plan at least 95 percent of the low-income children \n     who reside in the State and are eligible for child health \n     assistance under this State child health plan with respect to \n     any expenditures for providing child health assistance or \n     health benefits coverage for any individual whose gross \n     family income exceeds 200 percent of the poverty line.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am going to proceed just for a few \nmoments on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        FISA Modification Effort\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Bond, and I, will be introducing and \nlater placing on the calendar a bill related to the FISA modification \neffort that has been underway on a bipartisan basis over the last few \nweeks.\n  Senator Bond and I will be, as I said, placing in the Record, and \nthen subsequently doing a rule XIV placing it on the calendar, a \nproposal that the administration thinks makes sense to deal with the \nmodifications that everyone seems to agree in principle need to be made \nto the FISA procedure.\n  With that, I don't know that I can yield leader time to somebody who \nisn't a leader, so let me just say that having given that notice, we \nwill be placing that on the calendar for later this evening.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, just a brief comment on the distinguished \nRepublican leader's statement.\n  As we speak, there are meetings going on to see if we can resolve \nthis matter in a manner that is acceptable to Republicans and Democrats \nin the Senate, and of course then we have to also be concerned about \nthe House. Senator McConnell and I were in a meeting early this morning \nwith individuals, including Admiral McConnell, and we hope something \ncan be worked out.\n  We waited a little longer than I wanted, waiting for Admiral \nMcConnell's papers to come here this afternoon, but they are here and \nthey are being reviewed. I spoke to Senator Levin just a few minutes \nago. There is nothing serious, but Senator Rockefeller has been with \nhis wife today on a minor problem, but it was necessary he not be here. \nSo we are trying to work our way through this.\n  Hopefully, we can resolve this. It is something important, we are \ngoing to do everything we can, and we hope all sides will be \nreasonable. At this point they have been. It is an issue we certainly \nneed to resolve, if at all possible, before we leave for our August \nrecess.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, if I may, let me just commend the \nmajority leader on his observations. I know people on both sides of the \naisle are working intensely on this issue, and I, too, hope and believe \nwe will get it resolved by the end of the week.\n  I did, however, want all Members of the Senate to be aware of a \nproposal that the administration feels very strongly would get the job \ndone in the hopes that it would enjoy bipartisan support. Senator Bond \nand I will address the details of it after the votes, and I will rule \nXIV it onto the calendar at that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2554\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided on amendment No. 2554, offered by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, increasing the tax on tobacco unfairly \nburdens low-income Americans. My amendment is simple: It creates a 60-\nvote budget point of order against any legislation that includes a \nFederal excise tax increase that would unfairly affect low-income \nindividuals, defined as taxpayers with earned income less than 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control report from 2003 to \n2005, 28.5 percent of smokers were classified as poor--below 100 \npercent of the Federal poverty level--and 25.9 percent of smokers were \nclassified as near poor--between 100 and 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. As these numbers clearly show, the tax increase proposed \nin this bill unfairly falls on the shoulders of those who can least \nafford it.\n  I am urging my colleagues to acknowledge that the proposed tax \nincrease is an irresponsible and fiscally unsound policy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the fact that this has a negative impact and is \ndisproportionately hard on the poor.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and the nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand the Senator does not like \nthe way we are paying for this bill. The more appropriate response \nwould be for the Senator to offer an amendment to strike it or to find \nsome other way to pay for it. I do not think it is wise for this body \nto enact another procedural hurdle as we consider legislation generally \nhere; that is, another hurdle that would block attempts for us to help \npeople in the States we represent. I don't think that is needed.\n  Secondly, this is the wrong time to consider changing Senate \nprocedure. The more appropriate time is during consideration of the \nbudget resolution, when the Senate has all the budget issues before it. \nI don't think it makes any sense to put another procedural obstacle \nbefore us to make it more difficult for Congress to respond to the \nneeds of the American people.\n  I encourage Senators to, therefore, not support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2547\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\nminutes equally divided on amendment No. 2547 offered by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, my amendment is simple. It strikes the \nexemption for New York and New Jersey to get Federal dollars for \ncovering families above 300 percent of poverty. No other State in the \ncountry gets that kind of an exemption. New Jersey's SCHIP program \ncovers families up to $72,000 a year, 350 percent. New York is planning \non covering families making up to $82,000 a year. It has not yet been \napproved by HHS.\n  Why should people in every other State subsidize Government health \ncare for families in New York and New Jersey at these higher incomes? \nMy amendment does not kick kids off SCHIP. The State can still cover \nthem at their Medicaid matching rate. It is the State's choice. If \npeople in these two States think this is a priority, then they should \nbe willing to pay more for this type of benefit. I am sure New York and \nNew Jersey are expensive areas to live. But those States have more \nresources and a larger tax base than others. I urge a ``yes'' vote on \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we listened to the comments from our \ncolleague from Kentucky about how much New Jersey or New York can \nafford. But I will tell you this, New Jersey, for each dollar that it \nsends down to the Federal Government, it gets barely half of it back. \nBut not in Kentucky. In Kentucky, if they send in a dollar, they get \n$1.45 back. We cannot compare things. We cannot compare costs of \nliving. The poverty level for a four-person family is $20,000. That \nmeans their income is about $5,000 a month. In New Jersey, after taxes, \nhousing, and other costs, they're left with about $865. And yet their \nhealth care costs average above $2,000.\n  As a consequence, with $2,000 a month for health care costs, every \nfamily is burdened up until almost the highest of incomes. So we ask \nfairness. Here we are trying to expand health care for children, and \nour colleague wants to take that away. This is not fair, it is not \nright, and I hope we will defeat this soundly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to table the Bunning amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2593, as modified, \noffered by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, the Baucus bill we have before us is a $35 \nbillion increase over the current $25 billion, a $60 billion bill. Our \nKids First alternative amendment targets children. SCHIP does not have \nan A in it. We should not move steadily toward more and more higher \nincome children and adults being included in the program. This one is \ntargeted to children. The cost is $9 billion above the $25 billion in \nthe baseline. It will cover an additional 1.3 million children over the \nnext 5 years. This 40-percent increase would maintain children \ncurrently enrolled and insure 2.2 million more children by 2017 than is \nin the underlying Baucus bill. It also includes the small business \nhealth plans, which I believe would lead to the coverage of an \nadditional 10 or 20 million people who work for small businesses that \nnow cannot get coverage. There is no tax increase in this provision. It \nis paid for by equalizing the State match for Medicaid administrative \nexpenses at 50 percent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram was created to target the health care needs of poor children \nwhose families made too much to be eligible for Medicaid but were still \nin danger of not being able to afford private health insurance.\n  SCHIP is in many ways successful, as last year, 6.6 million children \nhad health care coverage thanks to it, including more than 50,000 in \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1996 to 2005, the rate of children \nliving without health insurance in America dropped by 25 percent.\n  So as the Senate turned to debate the reauthorization of this \nFederal/State partnership, I had hoped that all of my colleagues would \nfocus on SCHIP's true goal: covering children. Unfortunately, that is \nnot what the Finance Committee's bill does. This bill is a dramatic \ndeparture from current SCHIP law that will significantly raise taxes, \nincrease spending, and lead to Government-run health care.\n  At a time when the people of America have made clear that they want \nus to reduce Government spending, Democrats are going to spend $112 \nbillion of the taxpayers' money. And part of this increase will go \ntoward people that SCHIP was never meant to cover, as this proposal \nwill allow more adults to piggyback onto a children's health program.\n  So Senators Lott, Kyl, Gregg, Bunning, and I have proposed an \nalternative measure I hope all of my colleagues will consider. Our Kids \nFirst Act will refocus SCHIP to help the people it was designed to \nhelp: low-income children.\n  The Kids First Act will reauthorize SCHIP for 5 years and would \nensure that children enrolled in SCHIP stay covered by adding $14 \nbillion in funding above and beyond the baseline SCHIP budget.\n  Our alternative will add 1.3 million new kids to the SCHIP program by \n2012. By contrast, the Finance Committee bill actually begins reducing \nkids' coverage in 2012 and results in fewer children having SCHIP \ncoverage in 2017.\n  Our alternative also provides $400 million over the next 5 years for \nStates to spend on outreach and enrollment for low-income children who \nare eligible but not on SCHIP, so we can enroll them. This money will \nhelp guarantee that SCHIP dollars go toward the low-income kids the \nprogram is meant to help.\n  The Kids First Act takes several measures to make health insurance \nmore affordable and cost-effective. For\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\ninstance, it encourages premium assistance to aid parents in buying \nprivate health insurance for their children.\n  It also includes the small business health plan legislation we \nconsidered in the 109th Congress. Of the 20 million working Americans \nwho do not have health insurance, nearly half work in firms of 25 or \nfewer.\n  Small business health plans would allow those firms to band together \nacross State lines, increase their bargaining power and afford better \nhealth care coverage for their employees.\n  Finally, our alternative ensures that the taxpayers' dollars are \nspent appropriately by decreasing the number of adults who can take \nadvantage of the program.\n  While considerably less expensive to the taxpayers than the Finance \nCommittee's bill, it is worth noting, that many States, including \nKentucky, would fare better next year under the Kids First Act than \nunder the committee bill.\n  Our plan is fiscally responsible and focuses Government assistance on \nthose who really need it. It reauthorizes and improves upon a program \nthat works instead of transforming it into a license for higher taxes, \nhigher spending, and another giant leap toward Government-run health \ncare.\n  It can receive a Presidential signature, and it deserves this \nSenate's support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, effectively, the Lott amendment is \nactually going to cause in some States a reduction in kids who are \ncovered. It is very nominal, a slight increase overall. It does not \nbegin to address the 6.6 million kids we need to cover under CHIP, as I \nthink most of us want to. The basic point is, this amendment has lots \nof other provisions in it which I do not think we should appropriately \nconsider at this point. The small business health plans, HSAs, is a \ndebate for another day. It has nothing to do with the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. I don't think it is wise to put those battles on the \nbacks of kids. We should get this legislation passed. It helps kids. It \ncuts back adults. It is moderate. It cuts back on some excessive \ncoverage in some States, but it is unwise to radically restructure \nhealth insurance with the health insurance provision as well as HSAs.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

I \nthink it would be appropriate to announce at this time there will be no \nmore rollcall votes tonight. However, if people have a desire to offer \namendments, the managers are willing to talk to you about those \namendments. They need some idea of who else wants to offer amendments. \nYou can hear from them.\n  My main purpose in making this statement is announcing there will be \nno more rollcall votes tonight, after this next vote, of course.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2602\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2602, as modified, \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the underlying bill, we have made a \ndecision to insure some 3.3 million kids who are among the poorest in \nthe country. But we still have about 5.7 million kids who will not get \ncovered. So you have 9 million kids without coverage, and this bill \nwill seek to insure 3.3 million.\n  What my amendment seeks to do is recognize that if you have a \nrationale that says it is worthwhile to insure all those kids, we also \nought to be insuring the additional 1 million kids who are Medicaid \neligible who will not be insured under this bill.\n  So my amendment seeks to do what we said we would do in the original \nbudget resolution, where we allocated $50 billion to insure children. \nIt pays for it by not granting to those earning more than $1 million a \nyear a continuation of their tax cut next year. That is how you pay for \nit.\n  Mr. President, .18 percent of all Americans will be affected in an \neffort to guarantee that the poorest of the poor children in America--\nMedicaid eligible--will be eligible for health care coverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to speak to the substance \nof the amendment but to the process. This bill is a bipartisan approach \nwhere a lot of different points of view were brought together to a bill \nthat can pass this Senate. We have people on the left for whom $50 \nbillion might not be enough money. We have people on the right for whom \nanything over $5 billion was too much money. We have come out at $35 \nbillion. This is a well-balanced, well-thought-out compromise.\n  Compromise is the essence of getting things done. You have to bring \npeople in the Senate to the center to get things done or nothing is \ngoing to get done. In order to get this job done, we have to defeat \nthis amendment, regardless of the merits of it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nallowing me to proceed, and I will not be too long.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed as in morning \nbusiness, to be followed by Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Measure Read the First Time--S. 1927\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that S. 1927 is at the \ndesk and I ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1267) to amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 to provide additional procedures for \n     authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence \n     information and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place \nthe bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to \nmy own request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill will receive its second reading on the next legislative day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Director of National \nIntelligence came to Capitol Hill and implored Congress once again to \nmodernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He was echoing the \nwarnings of the entire intelligence community, which has told us that \ncurrent law--current law--prevents us from collecting a significant \namount of intelligence that could be vital in protecting us from \nanother terrorist attack.\n  The latest National Intelligence Estimate makes clear that the \ngreatest terrorist threat to the United States is al-Qaida. Their \nintent to attack us is undiminished since 9/11. They have gained \nrecruits and strength in the Middle East. They continue to adapt and \nimprove their capabilities, and we must continue to adapt and improve \nour ability to swiftly detect their movements and their plots.\n  One of the most effective tools we have had in doing this over the \nlast 6 years is our electronic surveillance program. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act gives us the legal framework for \nmonitoring terrorists electronically without impinging on the civil \nliberties of Americans. But the law is badly out of date.\n  Since FISA was enacted, sweeping advances in technology have upset \nthe balance that Congress struck in 1978, and the law that was written \nto protect Americans while ensnaring terrorists must be changed as \nwell.\n  The targeting of a foreign terrorist overseas should not require a \nFISA warrant. That was never the intention of the original legislation. \nYet this is what the law, as written, currently requires. The \nintelligence community has told us they are hamstrung by the existing \nlaw, and in a significant number of cases, our intelligence \nprofessionals are in the unfortunate position of having to obtain court \norders to collect foreign intelligence concerning foreign targets \nlocated overseas.\n  The facts here are not in dispute. Our Nation faces an alarming \nintelligence gap, a situation in which the intelligence community every \nday is missing--missing--a significant portion of what we should be \ngetting in order to protect the American people here at home. We should \nnot adjourn until we have closed this gap. We must act quickly in a \nbipartisan manner and let the appropriate committees come back and \nreview FISA and other matters related to the legislation in a more \ncomprehensive manner.\n  We should not return in September knowing that we have failed in our \nduty, and we pray that we don't have cause to regret our inaction. Let \nthere be no doubt: If we had the foresight in August of 2001 to enact a \nlaw that would have exposed the plot that was being hatched against us \nthen, the vote to approve that law would have been cast unanimously and \nwithout hesitation--unanimously and without hesitation. None of us \nwould have shrunk from that duty. Six years later, the duty remains.\n  There is little we can do in the Senate from day to day that can \nimmediately and decisively improve the security of this country. But by \npassing a FISA modernization bill that the President can sign before we \ngo home for recess, we will have done just that. We need to act on this \nlegislation now. We should not adjourn until we have closed this gap, \nuntil we have fixed this outdated law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader because he has \nbrought to the attention of this body a measure of critical importance. \nRight now, we are missing a very significant portion of the signals and \nintelligence we could capture on al-Qaida and other terrorist \norganizations threatening to do harm to the United States. The reason \nis because the existing Federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \ndoesn't fit in with today's technology.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has asked us--begged us--to \nmake these changes. He submitted a proposal to the Intelligence \nCommittee in April, and then he came before our committee in May. He \ncame and briefed as many Members of the Senate who wanted to show up \nlast month, and 42 members did, and they understood the importance.\n  In my tenure as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have spent \na considerable amount of time looking at issues regarding FISA \nmodernization. Since I became vice chairman, I have worked closely with \nChairman Rockefeller to ensure that our oversight of this measure and \nthis program has been comprehensive. We have held numerous hearings. \nMost of us have gone out and watched how the protections are \nimplemented and where the information is collected at the NSA.\n  The DNI's proposal came up to us, and in April he warned that the \ncurrent text of FISA is causing significant intelligence gaps during a \nperiod of increased threat. We all know that the threat of al-Qaida is \nsevere now. We cannot afford to go home, to leave this place, and not \ntake off the artificial barriers that prevent NSA from keeping our \ncountry safe.\n  The DNI has now provided us with a bare-bones FISA modernization \nproposal. It doesn't deal with all of the problems we in the \nIntelligence Committee must deal with later on in this session. We must \ndo it.\n  Last night, we had a proposal delivered by Senator Rockefeller that \ndid not come from the members of the Intelligence Committee. It was a \ncounterproposal to provide what he argued was a temporary legislative \nfix to FISA. Unfortunately, the counterproposal will not close these \nsignificant intelligence gaps that the DNI has told us about. Instead, \nit requires the Government to get a FISA order when a foreign target \ncommunicates with a significant number of persons and calls into the \nUnited States. That, to me, is going in the wrong direction. We don't \nneed to stop and get a court order to protect the privacy of a \nterrorist who is making lots of calls into the United States. That is \nmoving in the wrong direction.\n  Our enemies are not naive. They understand our laws sometimes better \nthan we do. They would realize that all they had to do, if they wanted \nto cover their tracks while a lengthy FISA court application procedure \nwas done, is make a whole lot of calls to people in the United States \nto trigger the requirement.\n  It would be an unnecessary and enormous burden on the intelligence \nassets and operators. We don't want people who play an essential role \nin fighting terrorism to spend the bulk of their time processing stacks \nof FISA applications on foreign targets. We want them to do the \nintelligence work to keep our country safe.\n  Well, as a result of the proposal made by Senator Rockefeller, and \nothers, the DNI was able to accommodate a number of these proposals and \nadopted their proposal for FISA court review of the procedures. They \nput a 6-month sunset on it. They added the DNI, Director of National \nIntelligence, to the authorizing process for acquisition of foreign \nintelligence. This is what is before us. The minority leader has \npresented it. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The debate is about whether targeting foreigners overseas should \nrequire a FISA order. That was never the intent of the FISA \nlegislation. It was intended solely to protect the fourth amendment \nrights of persons inside the United States--not foreign targets.\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\n  FISA needs to be modernized. Technology has changed. It is now no \nlonger covered. The DNI's approach takes into account the changing \ntechnology and has adopted the reasonable suggestions made in the \nproposal made by Senator Rockefeller, and others.\n  Congress needs to act on this legislation, please, before we get out \nof town. Don't leave town leaving the NSA deaf to significant terrorist \ninformation that might save our country from attack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to move things along here and set \nan order of speakers. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski be \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes; following that, Senator Chambliss be \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes. Following him, Senator Brown be \nallowed to speak for 8 minutes; following him, Senator Coburn, for 10 \nminutes; following that, Senator Webb be allowed to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise to comment on the FISA \nsituation in which we find ourselves, because we want to be very clear \nthat patriotism, adherence to the Constitution to defend the Nation \nagainst all enemies foreign and domestic, is not a partisan issue; that \nas our distinguished colleague from Missouri has spoken to--and I know \nthe Senator from Georgia will--we are all on the Intelligence \nCommittee, and we know what the real deal is in the sense of a very \ndangerous time facing our country.\n  We on this side of the aisle want to assure both our colleagues and \nthe American people that we want to make the reforms in FISA before we \ngo out as intensely as do our colleagues who are speaking tonight. We \nwant to make those reforms so that we, too, give the intelligence \ncommunity the power to go after and catch the terrorists and to be able \nto pump for the information they need to protect us, rather than a \nbureaucracy.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I feel it is my first duty \nto make sure they have the tools they need to protect the Nation. That \nmeans not only the financial resources to hire the best people and have \nthe best technology, but it also means they have the legal framework in \nwhich to operate. But, indeed, a legal framework is what we need. We \nbelieve that in functioning within a legal framework, we are able to \nbring to bear all of the very important resources that are needed, both \nfrom the private sector as well as from the public sector.\n  I agree with my colleagues that as we come into August, we have a \ncertain level of anxiety. All of us know, as we look back on 2001, that \nif in fact we could have done something to protect or stop what \nhappened on that terrible day, September 11, we would have done it. We \nknow that right now, this minute, we have another rendezvous with \ndestiny and we will meet that. In meeting that rendezvous, we will \narrive at a legal framework that is constitutionally compliant, that \nwill enable the Intelligence Committee to be able to do what it needs, \nwithout being shackled by more bureaucratic mandates. There are many \nproposals. The details of why we would support them or raise a question \nare better discussed in a more classified forum.\n  Should the approach be bipartisan? You bet. I have worked with the \nSenator from Missouri. I know how he brings pragmatism, common sense, \nand very sound legal analysis to the discussion. This is not about \npolitics. This is about the people and protecting the people we were \nsworn to protect. So I believe we will be proceeding. I am prepared, if \nnecessary, to cancel my plans. But I believe if we work hard and are \ninclusive and approach it with common sense, we will focus on what is \nthe end game here, which is to do the right thing to protect us.\n  Mr. President, I have fought for children's health care for a very \nlong time, going back to my days as a social worker and also as a young \nHouse Member. This bill is what we hoped for and dreamed for--those of \nus who worked in social work and foster care and child abuse--to make \nsure kids had eyeglasses and hearing aids and so forth. And for all \nthose adolescents who need to discuss things with doctors, this would \nbe an open door. For all those handicapped children, this is what we \nneed.\n  I salute the chairman and ranking member on this bipartisan solution. \nWe have done this in a way that we can pay for it. At the end of the \nday, over an additional 3 million children will have health care. I \nsalute my colleagues.\n  A few months ago, we had a little boy die in Maryland because he \ndidn't have access to dental care. He had an oral infection that spread \nthrough his blood. So tomorrow when I vote, I vote for Deamonte, and \nfor all others like him. I support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Georgia to yield so \nthat I may speak for a few minutes. I am sorry I wasn't on the floor to \nlisten to the speech of the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican \nleader, dealing with FISA.\n  Let me say briefly, we got the bill and the rule XIV late this \nafternoon. Ours is almost completed. We are working on it in my office, \nand the Speaker has to sign off on some of these things. It could take \na little while before we are able to file this.\n  I so appreciate the Senator from Maryland. She is a woman who takes \ntremendously difficult jobs as a Senator. She has been a valued member \non more than one occasion on the Ethics Committee, doing some of the \nmost difficult work we have had to do on ethics in the entire history \nof the country. And then as far as her serving on the Intelligence \nCommittee, she has been exemplary. I depend on her for information on \nwhat to do. A lot of times these meetings are held, and you need \ndirection as to what we need to do on the Senate floor because what \ngoes on in the Intelligence Committee is all secret. I admire and \nrespect her so much because she helped us get to the point where we \nare.\n  We are going to come back with the proposal that we will file, a rule \nXIV, as the Republicans did theirs. It is meeting the expectations of \nthe American people. One of the things we have going for us with this \nrepair of FISA is Admiral McConnell. We trust this man. He is a man who \nspeaks in a language we understand. He is direct and concise. Because \nof that, I think we can work something out. I just spoke to the vice \nchair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Bond. We talked about the \nfact that ours will be laid down, and theirs is already laid down. \nCertainly, we should be able to work something out. We are all trying \nto obtain the same goal: to be able to protect ourselves from the evil \npeople in the world who are trying to do harm to us as a country and \nindividually and others from around the world.\n  We are going to proceed in good faith to try to get this done, and \nhopefully sometime in the next little bit, we will be able to file our \nlegislation and what we call rule XIV so we are matching what the \nRepublicans did this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2557 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I may have the indulgence of the \nSenator from Georgia, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and on behalf of Senator Specter, I call up \namendment No. 2557.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] for Mr. Specter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2557 to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reset the rate \n        of tax under the alternative minimum tax at 24 percent)\n\n       On page 217, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 61_.

I thank my friend from Georgia. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           FISA Modernization\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise tonight to support the McConnell \nlegislation that has been submitted relative to FISA modernization and \nsay, first, that I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Maryland. She has been a huge asset on the Intelligence Committee. \nShe does her homework, she works hard, she studies the issues. She is \nexactly right. This is not a partisan issue by any means. This is truly \nan American issue because it is an issue that allows us to continue to \nprotect Americans and allows us to do the best job we possibly can in \nthe intelligence community to ensure we do not suffer another attack on \nAmerican soil.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that will not happen, but the fact \nis, we need this updated, even though it is temporary, FISA modernized \nto allow our intelligence community to gather the type of information \nfrom the bad guys who are certainly out there getting up every day and \nmaking plans to attack assets of America, whether they are abroad or \nwhether they are assets in the United States.\n  It is simply necessary that we take advantage of the technology that \nis available today that was not available at the time the original FISA \nstatute was implemented and passed into law, and that we make sure we \nare giving our intelligence community all the tools they need to do \ntheir job in a very professional manner.\n  There is a threat out there. The Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security has expressed recently that a threat exists, that he \nhas a gut feeling something may happen. There are a lot of factors \ntimewise and otherwise that make us feel that might be the case. Who \nknows. We cannot step into the minds of the bad guys who are out there.\n  I will say one thing about this legislation. It does not invade the \nprivacy of any group except one, and that is the terrorists. We need to \ninvade the privacy of the terrorists. This bill is something that if it \nhad been in place, if the tools had been in place in 2001, who knows \nwhether we could have stopped the attack that took place on September \n11. But what we do know is that certain phone calls were made by some \nof the 9/11 hijackers, and if we had in place a program that we now are \noperating under, it is very likely that we might have picked up on some \nof those phone calls.\n  This legislation, again, gives our intelligence community tools which \nthey can use to gather information only from those people who are \nmaking plans to carry out a terrorist attack against the United States \nor against our allies or in some country where we have assets.\n  I appreciate the cooperative spirit that, obviously, we are seeing \nfrom folks on the other side of the aisle. This is truly one of those \ntimes we need to come together in a bipartisan way and, obviously, we \nare going to make this fix to make sure our intelligence community can \ndo their job in a very professional way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking Chairman Baucus for his \nterrific work on perhaps the most important domestic legislation this \nyear, and that is the Children's Health Insurance Program. I thank the \nSenator from Pennsylvania also, the Presiding Officer tonight, for his \nterrific work leading our freshman class on this issue. We know how \nimportant it is to the people, whether it is Montana, Pennsylvania, \nMaryland, Georgia, or any of the States represented here tonight.\n  The children's health insurance bill meets the most basic need of \nAmerican families. Nothing should stand in the way of this bill moving \nforward. Children too often suffer and some die because they do not \nhave access to health care. In a nation as wealthy as ours, that is not \njust irresponsible, it is immoral.\n  Today we have the opportunity to do the right thing for American \nfamilies, for parents, for children. Without health insurance for their \nchildren, parents too often face impossible choices--go to the doctor \nwhen their child is sick or pay the grocery bill or the electric bill \nor the rent. These are the choices that families are forced to make--\ncruel choices.\n  In 1996, when Congress created the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, with a Democratic President and a Republican Congress, there \nwere nearly 11 million uninsured children in the United States. In \nOhio, my State, there were roughly 305,000 uninsured children. Today, \nthanks in large part to the Children's Health Insurance Program, those \nnumbers have been reduced substantially--fewer than 9 million \nnationwide and roughly 236,000 in Ohio.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is directly responsible for \ncovering 6.6 million children across the country and more than 200,000 \nchildren in Ohio in Athens, in Ashtabula, in Warren and West Lake, in \nMarion and Maple Heights. That is good, but it is not good enough. Mr. \nPresident, 150,000 low-income children, most of whom have working \nparents, in Ohio, do not have health insurance. This bill does the \nright thing on mental health, requiring parity between mental and \nphysical health benefits.\n  I would like to share a story I heard yesterday that should remind us \nof the importance of this provision. In 1990, Kitty Burgitt's husband \ndied suddenly, leaving her to care for her 5-year-old daughter and 2-\nyear-old son as a single mother in Canton, OH, a city in the northeast \npart of my State. Her Social Security survivor benefits were considered \ntoo much to qualify for Medicaid. Six years later, Congress created the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Kitty immediately enrolled her \nchildren in that program.\n  Given the initial strict income eligibility provisions of the \nprogram, Kitty was forced to turn down raises and refuse the additional \nhours at work that she wanted to work to keep her children enrolled, to \nkeep them insured.\n  When her daughter was in the eighth grade, she started experiencing \nmental health problems. Then her daughter became suicidal. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program covered her treatment, which then \nwas extensive. Imagine what it would have been like for Kitty if she \nhad no way to help her daughter. No parent should ever feel that \nhelpless. No parent should ever be forced to watch powerlessly as her \nchild, or his child, suffers.\n\n  Thankfully, because of the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nKitty's daughter did receive the treatment she needed. Today her \ndaughter is healthy and happy. As Kitty herself wrote recently:\n\n       Today my daughter is 22, happily married with a beautiful \n     daughter of her own--\n\n  Kitty's granddaughter--\n\n     and has a good job as a restaurant manager.\n\n  If we do our job this week and pass this bill, we will hear more \nsuccess stories such as this one in the future.\n  Some of my colleagues raise concern over this bill's income \neligibility levels. I believe it is important, however, for each State, \nwith its own unique set of circumstances, to have the flexibility to \noffer coverage to those it deems in need. The State makes that \ndetermination.\n  In my State of Ohio, for instance, Governor Strickland and the State \nlegislature have taken it upon themselves to raise the eligibility \nlimit for the Children's Health Insurance Program to 300 percent of \npoverty level. That 300 percent is not living in the lap of luxury. It \nmeans a parent still cannot afford health insurance in a job where they \nare 300 percent of poverty without some help from the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  This means little boys, such as Marco Rodriguez, will finally have \nhealth insurance. Marco lives in Marion, 20 to 30 miles from where I \ngrew up. He is 9\\1/2\\\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nyears old. His father died last year. His mother works full time. This \nis Marco's mother. But her job does not offer health insurance. She \ncannot afford private coverage. Her income is just over 200 percent of \npoverty, roughly $24,000 a year. She works hard, is raising her child, \nshe is widowed, and she makes $24,000 a year. Of course she cannot \nafford health insurance on that income. It is not enough to pay for \nfood, rent, and clothing--barely--and private health insurance.\n  So Marco, like all too many children, has been going without health \ninsurance. What if something happens? One major medical emergency for \nMarco could mean financial catastrophe for his mother, his family--for \nboth of them.\n  If we do our job this week, Ohio will be able to cover Marco come \nJanuary 2008.\n  Others have voiced concern over the cost of this reauthorization. It \nwas a bipartisan initiative 10 years ago, with a Democratic President \nand a Republican Congress and an overwhelming number of Democrats, \nmyself included, in the House of Representatives and Senate voting for \nit. We all agree this program has been a success.\n  The investment we made in 1996 has proven to be a wise one. And still \ntoo many of my friends on the other side of the aisle hesitate. They \nhesitate about our Nation's children. They say: We like the program, \nbut it is too expensive or, We have other priorities. But this is about \npriorities. And the questions are pretty simple.\n  Should Congress provide for billionaire tax breaks or health \ninsurance for our children? Should we provide for billions, literally \nbillions in no-bid contracts in Iraq or health insurance for our \nchildren? Should we provide for Medicare privatization and oil company \nsubsidies or health insurance for our children?\n  It is time for Congress to get its priorities straight. We should \npass the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2618 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside in order that I might bring up my amendment No. \n2618 to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Webb] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2618 to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To eliminate the deferral of taxation on certain income of \n     United States shareholders attributable to controlled foreign \n                             corporations)\n\n       At the end of title VII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ELIMINATION OF DEFERRAL OF TAXATION OF CERTAIN \n                   INCOME OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 952 (relating to subpart F income \n     defined) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(e) Special Application of Subpart.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this subpart, the term `subpart F income' means, in the case \n     of any controlled foreign corporation, the income of such \n     corporation derived from any foreign country.\n       ``(2) Applicable rules.--Rules similar to the rules under \n     the last sentence of subsection (a) and subsection (d) shall \n     apply to this subsection.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years of controlled foreign \n     corporations beginning after December 31, 2007, and to \n     taxable years of United States shareholders with or within \n     which such taxable years of such corporations end.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I strongly support this bill. As an initial \nmatter, I express my thanks to Senators Baucus and Grassley for their \nhard work on this bipartisan bill which will help provide health \ninsurance to millions of children nationwide and hundreds of thousands \nof children in my home State of Virginia.\n  For too long in this country, low-income families have been unable to \nafford health insurance for their children. Reauthorizing this program \nhelps meet this urgent need. But, unfortunately, this bill does so by \nsingling out one form of conduct, tobacco smoking, and then taxing many \nof the very same people the program is intended to assist.\n  Not only are lower income workers more likely to smoke, they spend a \ngreater percentage of their income on tobacco when they do because an \nestimated half of American smokers come from the same income groups as \nthose families who are eligible for this program. In my view, this \namounts to robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Additionally, the very form of conduct that we are supposedly \nattempting to discourage has become the same form of conduct that we \nare implicitly hoping will continue to finance this program. I find \nthis logic odd. At some level, I find it counterproductive to the very \ngoals of the legislation that is before us.\n  And here is another problem. This is a targeted tax on commercial \ntransactions that are disproportionately engaged in by people with \nlower incomes. At the same time, our country is experiencing a vast \naccumulation of wealth amongst our highest income earners.\n  Income disparities in this country are at levels that we have not \nseen for at least 70 years. Moreover, corporate profits are at an all-\ntime high as a percentage of our national wealth, while wages and \nsalaries on our working people are at an all-time low.\n  There is, in my view, a better way, a fairer way to pay for this \nprogram. That is why I have offered this amendment.\n  Under the Federal Tax Code, American corporations are allowed to \ndefer payment of American taxes on the profits earned by their overseas \nsubsidiaries. Under current law, taxes on the business income of \nforeign subsidiaries are not payable until the profits are repatriated \nback to the American parent corporation and, in reality, this means \nthey are not going to be paid at all.\n  Companies can defer ever paying taxes in the United States by keeping \ntheir income overseas and making money from it indefinitely. The Tax \nCode, in other words, creates an incentive to move jobs overseas, to \nnot invest in American operations, and also provides a method to \nshelter overseas profits from fair taxation.\n  In just one recent example reported by the New York Times, a major \nbiotech corporation--Amgen--with offshore subsidiaries used American \ntax laws to escape hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, taxes that \nshould have gone into the American treasury. Although this corporation \nreported that 80 percent of its billions of dollars of sales occurred \nin the United States, it paid only 22 percent of American taxes on its \nprofits. This corporation got away with this specifically because of \nAmerican tax policies, like many other corporations do today.\n  My amendment would eliminate this deferral provision in the Tax Code. \nThis critical reform would discourage these companies from moving \nAmerican investments and jobs to foreign tax havens and raise the \nrevenue necessary to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nThis reform also would protect American workers by reversing the \nconsistent flow of American jobs that corporations are outsourcing \nabroad.\n  I have been unable at this point to receive an official estimate of \nthe revenues this amendment would raise, but I have consulted multiple \ncredible sources and have no doubt this amendment would raise the new \nfunds needed under the new policy, which are approximately $7 billion a \nyear. These sources include the Joint Committee on Taxation, which \nestimated last year that deferral would raise $6.4 billion in 2008 and \nrise to $7.5 billion by 2010. It also includes the President's own \nbudget proposal for fiscal 2008, which estimates that tax expenditures \nfor the deferral of income of this sort would be $12.8 billion in 2008 \nand rise to $16.7 billion in 2012.\n  Opponents of this amendment would argue that deferral is needed to \navoid corporate exposure to double taxation. However, in my view, that \nis a disingenuous argument. American corporations investing overseas \ncurrently receive a tax credit, a Federal tax credit, for their payment \nof foreign taxes of\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\nup to 35 percent. My amendment does not affect the availability of this \ncredit and therefore would not result in double taxation, nor does my \namendment affect in any way the current provisions regarding allocation \nof corporate expenses, which are related but separate.\n  Some opponents might contend this is a new tax. But this is not a new \ntax. This is a way to reclaim monies that already should have been paid \ninto the National Treasury by companies earning skyrocketing profits. \nThis amendment closes a loophole.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is probably the greatest \nachievement of our Congress in terms of health care insurance in the \npast decade. It has provided cost-effective health coverage to more \nthan 137,000 children in Virginia in 2006 and millions of children \nacross the country, reducing the number of uninsured children by one-\nthird. We must, however, further strengthen our investment in \nchildren's health coverage. Millions of children remain uninsured. That \nis why this legislation is important.\n  I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to help children from \nAmerica's low-income families, but I respectfully argue that we need to \ndo so not with a regressive tax on people who have little ability to \npay but, instead, by eliminating a corporate tax provision that would \nbe one small step toward restoring fairness in our society and \nreinforcing the proper notions of how our Government should operate.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2537\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is going to be \ncoming here shortly to conclude today's activities. Prior to that, let \nme comment a little bit on an amendment that has been offered on my \nbehalf by Senator Grassley, amendment No. 2537. It is an amendment \nwhich deals with the so-called crowd-out effect of the Finance \nCommittee bill.\n  The crowd-out effect has to do with the people who are covered by \nprivate insurance today who would be crowded out of private insurance \nand going onto the SCHIP program, the Government program under the \nbill. The problem is that under the bill, all of the newly eligible \npeople under the program are replaced literally one for one from \nprivate insurance to the Government program. In other words, a child or \na family who is on private insurance today, for every one of those \nchildren or families who is on private insurance, when the Government \nprogram is expanded, they will leave the private insurance market. It \nis a one-for-one transfer. We should not be offering more Government \nbenefits for insurance to cover children or anyone else when the effect \nof that is for every new person covered to have somebody leaving the \nprivate insurance market. The object here is to cover people with \ninsurance, to allow them to have access to good care through insurance. \nWe do not solve any problem at all when we take somebody who already \nhas insurance and bring them into a new program.\n  The CBO estimates that between 25 percent and 50 percent of all the \neligible SCHIP recipients are crowded out of the private insurance \nmarket. In other words, for every 100 people on private insurance \ntoday, between 25 and 50 of them will leave private insurance to go to \nthe SCHIP program as it is expanded. As I said, for the newly eligible, \nit is a one-for-one transfer. Why is that a good idea?\n  This amendment which I have offered says that if the effect is more \nthan 20 percent in the crowd-out, that is to say that through this \nprogram, more than 20 percent of the people who are covered leave \nprivate insurance to be covered by this new program, then it does not \ngo into effect. But it does go into effect if the so-called crowd-out \neffect is less than 20 percent.\n  For the life of me, I don't know why we would spend an additional $35 \nbillion to replace people who are already covered. That does not \nrepresent a sound and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me make it clear that I support the reauthorization of SCHIP. I \nhave supported the Republican alternative. But I believe the Finance \nCommittee bill represents not just a reauthorization but an expansion \nof the program which, as the chairman himself acknowledged, is another \nstep toward universal coverage.\n  We do not need to be taking people off private insurance to enroll \nthem into this program. The problem, and I will be very brief, is that \nthe people who are added are people generally of higher income, and we \nare adding a group of adults as well. Those are people who generally \nare more covered by insurance today. So it is logical that, as CBO \nsays, for every one person who is covered today, one person leaves that \ncoverage to go to the SCHIP program under the committee bill. It is \nestimated that there will be about 600,000 in this category. In fact, \nCBO shows that a one-for-one replacement means that for 600,000 newly \ninsured individuals, 600,000 individuals go off their private coverage.\n  As I said, that simply makes no sense. It seems to me what we should \nbe doing instead is providing coverage for people who do not have \nprivate insurance coverage. That would be a much better use of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  To conclude the point, there are two reasons why this is happening \nthat are not problems with the alternative, the Republican alternative \nthat was voted on that failed. But they are problems with the Finance \nCommittee bill. The first one is that the Finance Committee bill allows \nStates to enroll children from higher income families, the very ones \nwho have greater insurance coverage today. We have already talked about \nthe New Jersey experience, for example, and the New York experience, in \nthat regard--people at 350 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level, \nbetween $60,000 and $80,000 in income for a family of four. Those \npeople, by and large, are already covered by insurance. Not only is \nthere no reason to provide them SCHIP coverage, but we are simply \ncrowding people out of the private sector into this program.\n  If my colleagues want to avoid the crowding-out effect, it seems to \nme we\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\nshould be focusing on the truly needy, the low-income children, not \nchildren from higher income families.\n  Second, the Finance Committee bill allows States with existing \nwaivers to continue enrolling parents. CBO stated:\n  No studies have estimated the extent to which SCHIP reduces private \ncoverage among parents so the available estimates probably \nunderestimate the total reduction in private coverage.\n  According to CBO's own numbers, this is a big problem. It seems to me \nwe should be focused on solving that problem rather than simply adding \nto the problem as the Finance Committee does. If we are serious about \nminimizing the erosion of private coverage, then we should direct SCHIP \nfunds to low-income children and not add adults; as the Budget \nCommittee chairman said not too long ago, there is no ``A'' in SCHIP. \nOtherwise, CBO estimates that over 2 million individuals will go off \nprivate coverage under the Finance Committee bill.\n  Let me state that again: 2 million individuals who currently have \nprivate insurance will go off that private insurance onto this new \nprogram or onto the program that is added to by the Finance Committee \nbill. Why would we do that? It doesn't make sense.\n  My amendment will be dealt with tomorrow. We will have a chance to \nfurther debate it and, as I said, all it provides essentially is if \nmore than 20 percent of the people who are enrolled come from the \nprivate insurance sector already, then the program would be in abeyance \nuntil that number is reduced below 20 percent.\n  I also note there were several articles recently written that I think \ndescribe the general problem as well as this specific problem. There \nare three in particular I would like to have printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that the following pieces be printed in \nthe Record. One is a piece by John Goodman called ``Insurance Folly,'' \nin the Wall Street Journal; another is a Wall Street Journal opinion in \nthe ``Review & Outlook'' section, dated July 30, called ``The Newest \nEntitlement,'' and third is a column in my hometown newspaper, the \nArizona Republic, an editorial, August 1, by Bob Robb, which I think \ncorrectly notes the problem I have discussed and issues with the \nFinance Committee bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent these three published items be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                            Insurance Folly\n\n                          (By John C. Goodman)\n\n       The State Children's Health Insurance Program (Schip) was \n     originally a Republician program to provide health insurance \n     to children in near-poor families who did not qualify for \n     Medicaid. Democrats now want to expand Schip to children of \n     the middle class.\n       Their efforts to do so are rightly being resisted by the \n     White House, but Senate Finance Committee Republicans have \n     already caved on an unwise compromise to make more people \n     eligible for Schip.\n       On the surface, congressional Democrats appear to be \n     rescuing children from the scourge of uninsurance. The \n     reality is quite different. If they get their way, millions \n     of children will have less access to health care than they do \n     today, and the same will surprisingly be true for many low-\n     income seniors.\n       Studies by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber show that public \n     insurance substitutes for private insurance and the crowd-out \n     rates is high. In general, for every extra dollar spent on \n     Medicaid, private insurance contracts by 50 cents to 75 \n     cents. For Schip, depending on how it is implemented, private \n     insurance could contract by about 60 cents.\n       These findings make sense. Why pay for something if the \n     government offers it for free? Under congressional proposals \n     to expand Schip, the crowd out would likely be much worse. \n     The reason: Almost all the newly eligible beneficiaries \n     already have insurance.\n       The Senate bill would expand the eligibility for coverage \n     under Schip to families with incomes 300% above the federal \n     poverty level ($62,000), from its present ceiling, 200% above \n     the poverty level. House Democrats want to push coverage to \n     400% ($83,000 annual income).\n       Yet almost eight of every 10 children whose parents earn \n     from 200%-300% more than the poverty level already have \n     private health-care coverage, according to the Congressional \n     Budget office (CBO). At incomes between 300% and 400% more \n     than poverty, nine of every 10 children are already insured.\n       What about the eight to nine million children currently \n     uninsured? Nearly 75 percent of them are already eligible for \n     Medicaid or Schip, according to the CBO. So the main result \n     of the Democrats' proposal to expand Schip will be to shift \n     middle-class children from private to public plans.\n       Why is that bad? One reason is that most Schip programs pay \n     doctors at Medicaid rates--rates so low that Medicaid \n     patients are having increasing difficulty getting access to \n     health care. Anecdotal evidence suggests that U.S. Medicaid \n     patients already must wait as long for specialist care and \n     hospital surgery as in Canada.\n       Many doctors won't see Medicaid patients. Among those that \n     do, many will not accept new patients. As a result, children \n     who lose private coverage and enroll in Schip are likely to \n     get less care, not more.\n       There is also the issue of who exactly will be covered. \n     Republicans want to restrict Schip to children. The Democrats \n     want adults covered as well. Even under the current system, \n     children's health insurance is increasingly a ruse to cover \n     adults. Minnesota spends 61% of Schip funds on adults. \n     Wisconsin spends 75%.\n       Seniors will suffer from Schip expansion too. When millions \n     shift from private to public coverage, not much happens to \n     the overall rate of uninsurance. But the government's cost \n     soars. Where's the money to come from? One idea popular with \n     some House Democrats is to reduce federal payments to \n     Medicare Advantage plans. These plans provide comprehensive \n     coverage to low-income seniors who can't afford supplemental \n     insurance to fill all the gaps in Medicare. One in five \n     seniors has enrolled in these plans and one in four of those \n     is a minority. In the House of Representatives, health care \n     for this group is a great risk.\n       The proposal to expand Schip comes at a time when health-\n     care spending already poses a serious threat to the federal \n     budget. The Medicare trustees tell us that the program's \n     unfunded liability is six times that of Social Security. The \n     CBO predicts that on the current course income tax rates paid \n     by the middle class will reach 66% by midcentury and the top \n     marginal rate will reach 92%.\n       So what do congressional Democrats plan to do about this \n     problem? Ignore it.\n       A key provision of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act says \n     that when Medicare's finances deteriorate to a certain level \n     (that level is already reached), the president must propose \n     an appropriate reform and Congress must fast-track the \n     proposal. Yet one senior Democratic legislator--as yet \n     unidentified--wants the Schip bill to repeal that provision.\n       In a way, repeal makes a certain sense. If the ship is \n     going down anyway, why spoil the fun?\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2007]\n\n                         The Newest Entitlement\n\n       The State Children's Health Insurance Program sounds like \n     the epitome of good government: Who could be against health \n     care for children? The answer is anyone who worries about one \n     more middle-class taxpayer entitlement and a further slide to \n     a government takeover of health care. Yet Schip is sailing \n     toward a major expansion with almost no media scrutiny, and \n     with Republicans in Congress running for cover.\n       Schip was enacted in 1997 to help insure children from \n     working-poor families who make too much to qualify for \n     Medicaid. In the intervening years, the program reduced the \n     rate of uninsured kids by about 25% but has also grown to \n     cover the middle class and even many adults--and it gets \n     bigger every year. Schip expires in September without \n     reauthorization, and Congressional Democrats want to enlarge \n     its $35 billion budget by at least $60 billion over five \n     years.\n       State Governors from both parties are also leading the \n     charge--and for their own self-interested reasons. Schip \n     money is delivered as a block grant, which the states match \n     while designing their own insurance programs. All cost \n     overruns, however, are billed to the federal government, \n     which is on the hook for about 70% of Schip's ``matching \n     rate.'' This offers incentives for state politicians to make \n     generous promises and shift the costs to the feds, or to toy \n     around with costly universal health-care experiments. And \n     since the states only get 57 cents on the dollar for \n     Medicaid, they are working hard to transfer those recipients \n     to Schip.\n       This self-interest explains a recent letter from the \n     National Governors Association demanding ``urgent action'' on \n     Schip, which got lots of favorable play in the press. Yet \n     these are the same Governors who have been moaning for years \n     about rising entitlement burdens, which is what Schip will be \n     soon enough. Particularly egregious was the signature on the \n     letter of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who \n     regards himself a conservative health-care maven and should \n     know better.\n       This ``bipartisan'' cover is serving Democrats in Congress, \n     who want to liberalize Schip eligibility as part of their \n     march to national health care. The Senate Finance Committee \n     has voted 17-4 to increase Schip spending to at least $112 \n     billion over 10 years. Not only does it use a budget trick to \n     hide a payment hole of at least $30 billion, it proposes to \n     offset the increase by bumping up the cigarette tax by 61 \n     cents to $1 pack.\n       House Democrats are putting the finishing touches on their \n     own plan, making the cigarette tax somewhat lower to win over \n     tobacco state members. Instead, the House is proposing to \n     steal nearly $50 billion from Medicare Advantage, the \n     innovative attempt\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\n     to bring private competition to senior health care.\n       Michigan's John Dingell explains that ``these are not \n     cuts'' but ``reductions in completely unjustified \n     overpayments''--which will come as news to insurers that \n     offered coverage plans based on certain funding expectations. \n     The ``overpayments'' he's referring to were passed expressly \n     as an incentive for companies to offer Medicare Advantage in \n     rural areas with traditionally fewer insurance options--and \n     are intended to be phased out over time. Democrats apparently \n     want to starve any private option for Medicare.\n       In any case, the actual costs of Schip will overwhelm these \n     financing gimmicks. Like all government insurance, Schip is \n     ``covering'' more children by displacing private insurance. \n     According to the Congressional Budget Office, for every 100 \n     children who are enrolled in the proposed Schip expansion, \n     there will be a corresponding reduction in private insurance \n     for between 25 and 50 children. Although there is a net \n     increase in coverage, it comes by eroding the private system.\n       This crowd-out effect is magnified moving up the income \n     scale. In 2005, 77% of children between 200% and 300% of the \n     poverty level already had private insurance, which is where \n     the Senate compromise wants to move Schip participation. New \n     York State is moving to 400% of poverty, or some $82,000 in \n     annual income. All of this betrays the fact that the real \n     political objective of Schip is more government control--\n     HillaryCare on the installment plan.\n       We'd have thought Capitol Hill Republicans would understand \n     all this, especially with the White House vowing to veto any \n     big Schip expansion. But we hear the GOP lacks the Senate \n     votes for a filibuster and perhaps even to sustain a veto. \n     GOP Senators Mitch McConnell and Jon Kyl are backing an \n     alternative to account for population growth and reach the \n     remaining 689,000 uninsured children that Schip was intended \n     to help. Republicans would be wise to support this version, \n     or they'll take one more step to returning to their historic \n     minority party status as tax collectors for the welfare \n     state.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Aug. 1, 2007]\n\n                    Dem Health Plan a Burden on Poor\n\n                             (By Bob Robb)\n\n       The reauthorization of the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program illustrates the difficulty of having a \n     sensible policy discussion in the context of American \n     politics, as currently practiced.\n       According to congressional Democrats, opposition to their \n     reauthorization proposals means support for allowing low-\n     income children to go without health care.\n       According to Republicans, the Democrats are proposing \n     socialized medicine on the installment plan.\n       A sensible policy discussion begins with what the debate \n     isn't about: health insurance coverage for low-income \n     children.\n       SCHIP was intended to provide federal subsidies to insure \n     children up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or a \n     family income of about $40,000 a year. The program expires \n     this year and needs to be reauthorized.\n       No one opposes reauthorization for its intended purpose. \n     The Bush administration has proposed reauthorization for this \n     targeted population with an extra $5 billion in funding over \n     the next five years, over the current base of $25 billion.\n       The problem is that SCHIP has expanded beyond its original \n     scope, as so often happens with federal programs. In the \n     early years, many states couldn't use all their SCHIP money, \n     so the feds permitted excess funds to be used by other states \n     to extend coverage to children beyond 200 percent of the \n     poverty level and even adults.\n       In Arizona, the SCHIP plan is called KidsCare. A Government \n     Accountability Office study found, however, that 56 percent \n     of the people enrolled in ``KidsCare'' were actually adults.\n       Fifteen states now provide SCHIP coverage for children \n     above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and 14 states \n     cover adults.\n       Congressional Democrats propose not only to fund these \n     existing expanded programs but provide enough funding for \n     other states to substantially expand eligibility, as well. In \n     all, Democrats are proposing to more than double SCHIP \n     funding, allowing universal coverage up to 300 percent of the \n     federal poverty level, as Gov. Janet Napolitano has proposed \n     for Arizona.\n       That would provide coverage up to a family income of about \n     $60,000 a year. Since the median family income in the United \n     States is just over $46,000, this reaches well into the \n     middle class.\n       Here, a confusion surfaces between the issues of universal \n     access and federal subsidies. There are a lot of middle-class \n     American families that have difficulty obtaining health-\n     insurance coverage. Every state, however, can provide \n     universal access by allowing buy-ins to its Medicaid program.\n       The question SCHIP reauthorization poses is whether the \n     federal government should be subsidizing the health insurance \n     of middle-class families. There doesn't seem to be any \n     justification for it, particularly funded the way \n     congressional Democrats are proposing.\n       To pay for the SCHIP expansion, Democrats are proposing to \n     raise tobacco taxes by up to 61 cents a pack.\n       Tobacco taxes are highly regressive. So, basically, \n     Democrats are proposing to tax the poor to pay for the health \n     care of the middle class.\n       Tobacco taxes are also highly uncertain. Health-care \n     advocates like them because the evidence is that they do \n     reduce consumption. However, states and the federal \n     government have already loaded up various programs, many \n     involving health care and children, on their backs. The odds \n     are very strong that tobacco taxes will not produce the \n     revenues being obligated.\n       Now, Republicans are making these points. But they also are \n     employing a scare tactic of their own, that Democratic \n     proposals are basically socialized medicine on the \n     installment plan.\n       However, government programs to provide subsidized access \n     to what is still a private system of health-care providers \n     are very distinct from European-style national health-care \n     systems. Moreover, federal tax policy also heavily subsidizes \n     private, employer-provided health insurance. So, this is not \n     a clean choice between public and private approaches.\n       At the end of the rhetoric, however, congressional \n     Democrats aren't proposing to reauthorize a program to insure \n     low-income children. Instead, they are proposing a massive \n     expansion of subsidized health care to middle-class families, \n     funded by a large increase in heavily regressive tobacco \n     taxes.\n       That's an unwise, unfair and fiscally risky scheme.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are going to close for the night. I do \nwish to make a couple references to my friend from Arizona on this \nissue. I know he will be offering his amendment tomorrow. We will \ndiscuss and debate it more. But I have to say we have been hearing a \nlot of these arguments all week about crowd-out. I would say, \nrespectfully, a lot of Americans feel crowded out right now because \nthey have no health insurance. It is a terrible crisis in the life of \ntoo many Americans. We can debate this, and I think the numbers show \nthere is a lot more crowd-out in Medicare Part D, and that was voted \noverwhelmingly by the last Congress.\n  I think there is still a lot of debate to go on this, but I have to \nsay there are still some people on the other side of the aisle who have \nbeen debating different points of this legislation all week--but they \nhave their insurance. They are called Senators and their families. They \nhave insurance. I do, the Presiding Officer does, the Senator from \nArizona has insurance as a Member of the Senate. I am tired of some of \nthe arguments we have heard. I do not attribute them to this Senator, \nbut too often arguments have been made all during this week as a way to \nblock this legislation from going forward. I think it is about time we \ngot to a vote.\n  Too often, in the last couple days, all we have heard are ways to \nslow this down, to impede the progress. We have heard misinformation \nabout poverty level numbers, that people above 300 percent of poverty \nare getting children's health insurance right now. That is not true \nunder this program.\n  I think we will have more time to debate this, but we have seen a lot \nof crowding out already. The American people have had to suffer. I \nthink it is a question worthy of debate. But I hope when all the \ndebating is over, all the speeches and all the debates on both sides \nlead to what the American people expect from this legislation, which is \nthat we cover 3.2 million more American children. That is the question \nbefore the Senate. We are either going to do that or not.\n  Unfortunately, there are some people here who want to agree with the \nPresident. If the President's proposal on children's health insurance--\nmake no mistake; if we rubberstamp the President, 1.4 million American \nchildren will lose their health insurance. That is the choice. That is \nthe choice for people on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am pleased that in the Finance Committee we had consensus, a 17 to \n4 vote. The choice is very clear: Support the President's proposal, 1.4 \nmillion kids lose their coverage; support the bipartisan children's \nhealth insurance initiative, 3.2 million children more than the 6.6 are \ncovered. That is the way to go for America.\n  We can have a debate tomorrow about a couple of points. But this \ndebate is going to end this week, and we better leave this town having \nsupported 3.2 million American children getting their health insurance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I voted against Senate amendment 2538 to \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization because \nof the critical need to provide health insurance to 3.3 million \nadditional children\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\nunder this program. This vote should not be misconstrued as a vote \nagainst National Institutes of Health, NIH, funding but as recognizing \nthe need to provide health insurance to children.\n  This amendment would transfer the additional $35 billion for \nchildren's health insurance into a fund for NIH to increase medical \nresearch. As ranking member and chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have ardently \nsupported doubling funding for NIH. The fiscal year 2008 Senate Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill provides \n$29.9 billion for NIH.\n  While I support an increase in NIH funding, it cannot be at the \nexpense of providing much needed health care to America's children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It was also an occasion for me because Lieutenant General \nBreitweiser's assistant was Tony Langhorn Motley, who, along with me, \nsurvived the airplane crash in which my wife and four others were \nkilled in 1978.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant General \nBreitweiser's full biography be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Lieutenant General Robert Allen Breitweiser\n\n       Lt.

Robert Allen Breitweiser is commander in chief, \n     Alaskan Command, and commander, Alaskan North American Air \n     Defense Command Region.\n       General Breitweiser was born in St. Joseph, Mo., in 1916. \n     He graduated from South Denver High School in Denver, Colo., \n     in 1932 and attended the Colorado School of Mines at Golden, \n     Colo., for two years where he majored in Petroleum \n     Engineering. He obtained an appointment to the U.S. Military \n     Academy in 1934 and received a bachelor of science degree in \n     military science and engineering, ranking third in a class of \n     301.\n       The general completed primary and advanced flying schools \n     at Randolph and Kelly fields, Texas, in August 1939. He \n     remained at the Advanced Flying School as an instructor until \n     he went to Maxwell Field, Ala., as training group operations \n     officer. He was designated commandant of the Contract Primary \n     Flying School at Bennettsville, S.C. in August 1941. The \n     following February he was assigned to Headquarters, Southeast \n     Training Center, Maxwell Field, Ala.\n       Transferred to the China-Burma-India Theater in August \n     1943, General Breitweiser served with the Fourteenth Air \n     Force and the 68th Composite Wing. While with the Fourteenth \n     Air Force he served as General Chennault's personal \n     representative to General Wedemeyer, the China Theater \n     commander. During his duty tour in China, General Breitweiser \n     flew 120 combat hours on 22 combat missions, accounting for \n     numerous enemy trucks and river craft destroyed, plus one \n     6,000-ton freighter.\n       Returning to the United States in July 1945, he was \n     appointed deputy chief and later, chief of the Requirements \n     and Resources Branch, Military Personnel Division of Army Air \n     Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. In August 1947, General \n     Breitweiser was transferred to Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto \n     Rico, and served as assistant executive officer, 24th \n     Composite Wing. He was appointed commander of the base in \n     July 1948, and served in that capacity until May 1949.\n       After graduating from the Air War College at Maxwell Air \n     Force Base, Ala., in 1950, General Breitweiser became \n     executive officer to the assistant secretary of the Air Force \n     for management in Washington, D.C. He served in that position \n     until November 1951, when he was appointed vice commander of \n     the 34th Air Division (Defense), Kirtland Air Force Base, \n     N.M.\n       Transferred to Ent Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colo., \n     in May 1952, he was named assistant deputy chief of staff for \n     operations for the Air Defense Command.\n       In July 1954, the general returned to Washington, D.C., as \n     a student in the National War College. Upon his graduation in \n     June 1955, he was assigned as special assistant to the deputy \n     director for estimates, Directorate of Intelligence, \n     Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, and became chief of the policy \n     and management group the following February. In June 1956, he \n     was named deputy director of estimates, office of the \n     assistant chief of staff, intelligence, U.S. Air Force.\n       In February 1957, General Breitweiser was designated the \n     director for intelligence, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington, \n     D.C.\n       In July 1961, General Breitweiser became assistant chief of \n     staff, intelligence, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, and in \n     September 1963 he assumed command of the U.S. Air Force \n     Southern Command in Panama, Canal Zone.

Mr. President, it continues to be my hope that there \nwill be a consensus reached among Senators as to how to move forward in \nIraq. This is indispensable if there is to be an accommodation between \nthe President and Congress.\n  I had hoped to make a floor statement on Iraq during the Senate's \nconsideration of the DoD authorization bill, but the majority leader \ntook that bill off the floor after there was only consideration of the \nLevin-Reed amendment. That action deprived the Senate of an opportunity \nto consider the Warner-Lugar and Salazar-Alexander amendments and \nperhaps other amendments which might have secured the requisite 60 \nvotes to structure a new U.S. policy for Iraq.\n  When a tally is made of the Senators who have voted for or \ncosponsored legislation aimed at altering or reevaluating U.S. policy \nin Iraq, the total is 62. When Senators are added who have made public \nstatements critical of the President's policy, the number could \npossibly reach or exceed two-thirds of the Senate membership.\n  A July 2007 vote, had it been successful, would have had no binding \neffect since the President already had sufficient funding to continue \nuntil September 30 and would need additional funding only in the next \nfiscal year, 2008, beginning October 1.\n  The time for Congress to have asserted its constitutional power of \nthe purse to withhold funding was this spring during consideration of \nsupplemental funding for approximately $120 billion. On April 26, 2007, \nfollowing a vote in the House of Representatives of 218-208, the Senate \npassed the conference report to H.R. 1591, the fiscal year 2007 Troop \nReadiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability \nAppropriations Act on a vote of 51-46. However, because this bill \ncontained target dates for withdrawal, on May 1, 2007, the President \nvetoed the bill.\n  After the House failed to gather the two-thirds majority required to \noverride the President's veto, on May 24, 2007, the Congress approved a \nbill, H.R. 2206, which did not include targeted dates for withdrawal \nand which was subsequently signed into law by President Bush on May 25, \n2007, Public Law 110-28.\n  When the Levin-Reed amendment was considered, it was a forgone \nconclusion that there were not anywhere near 60 votes to invoke \ncloture, let alone the 67 votes needed to override a veto. With the \nremoval of the bill from the floor, the Senate was prevented from \nconsidering alternatives to the Levin-Reed proposal, and denied the \nopportunity to have a vote or votes to demonstrate dissatisfaction with \nthe President's policy.\n  This action deprived the Senate of an opportunity to craft a \ncompromise around Warner-Lugar or Salazar-Alexander to get the 60 votes \nand put the president squarely on notice that funding in September was \nunlikely unless the President's policy showed significant progress. \nPerhaps the Levin-Reed proponents would have rejected the other \namendments as being insufficiently forceful, but Senators never know \nfor sure how they will ultimately vote until there is floor debate, \ncareful analysis, informal discussions on the floor and corridors, and \ntalk in the cloakroom. Much of the Senate's productive work occurs \nduring quorum calls when Members hassle and jawbone on the issues. \nSince so many Senators demonstratively want a change, it was at least \nworth a try in daylight compared to the futile all-nighter.\n  Of particular interest to me were the provisions of the Warner-Lugar \nproposal on having a contingency plan and redefining the mission. For \nthree decades, Senators Lugar and Warner have served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and Armed Services Committee, respectively, with \nboth rising to chairman. Their combined tenures in the Senate are more \nthan 60 years. To say these colleagues bring a significant amount of \nthought and authority to this debate is an understatement.\n  Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to debate and vote on \ntheir proposal.\n  The Warner/Lugar amendment is an attempt to ensure that the U.S. is \nprepared to implement changes to U.S. policy following the September \nreport, to be provided by General Petaeus and Ambassador Crocker, on \nthe progress\n\n[[Page S10594]]\n\nof the President's current strategy in Iraq.\n  The Warner-Lugar amendment recognizes that conditions in Iraq have \nchanged considerably since the initial invasion to topple Saddam \nHussein's regime and States that the joint resolution passed by \nCongress in 2002 to authorize ``the use of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States against Iraq'' requires ``review and revision.''\n  In addition, the amendment calls for enhanced U.S. diplomatic efforts \nto work with the Government of Iraq to establish a consistent \ndiplomatic forum related to Iraq that is open to all parties in the \nMiddle East. Because of the potential for the Warner-Lugar amendment to \nprovide a basis for a Senate consensus, I am cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  As explained on the floor by Senator Lugar on July 13, 2007:\n\n       The purpose of the forum would be to improve transparency \n     of national interests so that neighboring states and other \n     actors avoid missteps . . . Such a forum could facilitate \n     more regular contact with Syria and Iran with less drama and \n     rhetoric. The existence of a predictable and regular forum in \n     the region would be especially important for dealing with \n     refugee problems, regulating borders, exploring development \n     initiatives, and preventing conflict between the Kurds and \n     Turks.\n\n  This type of planning and diplomatic engagement should be occurring \ntoday. I believe a vote confirming this could have led the President to \ndo that.\n  Prior to the 2002 U.S. invasion of Iraq, I publicly stated my \nconcerns about the potential fallout from such an action. On February \n13, 2002, I took to the Senate floor to express my belief that there \nshould be a comprehensive analysis of the threat posed by Saddam \nHussein and what an invasion would amount to in terms of U.S. \ncasualties:\n\n       We need to know, with some greater precision, the threat \n     posed by Saddam Hussein with respect to weapons of mass \n     destruction. There also has to be an analysis of what the \n     costs would be, some appraisal in terms of casualties. Then \n     there is the issue as to what happens after Saddam Hussein is \n     toppled.\n\n       As I stated on the Senate floor on December 6, 2006:\n\n       It has been my view that had we known Saddam Hussein did \n     not have weapons of mass destruction, we would not have gone \n     into Iraq.\n\n  Eight months after my February 13 statement, on October 7, 2002, I \nreturned to the floor to express my concerns over the lack of a \ncomprehensive plan for Iraq:\n\n       What happens after Saddam Hussein is toppled has yet to be \n     answered in real detail.\n       What was the extent of Saddam Hussein's control over \n     weapons of mass destruction? What would it cost by way of \n     casualties to topple Saddam Hussein? What would be the \n     consequence in Iraq? Who would govern after Saddam was \n     toppled? What would happen in the region, the impact on the \n     Arab world, and the impact on Israel?\n       In previous briefings, I have sought the administration \n     plan as to what will be done after Saddam Hussein is toppled, \n     and I think that is an area where a great deal more thought \n     needs to be given. The situation in Iraq would obviously be \n     contentious, with disputes between the Sunnis and the \n     Shi'ites, with the interests of the Kurds in an independent \n     state, and it means a very long-term commitment by the United \n     States.\n\n  Five years later, we are in the midst of a highly controversial troop \nsurge in Iraq.\n  Following the announcement of the President's plan to surge, I met \nwith President Bush on two occasions. Following these meetings I told \nthe President directly that I could not support a troop surge. I also \nhad extensive discussions on the President's plan with the highest \nranking members of his national security team including Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and \nDirector of National Intelligence John Negroponte.\n  I met with GEN David Petraeus on January 31, 2007, who has been \nconfirmed as the United States' top commander in Iraq. Following these \nmeetings, I was not convinced the administration possessed a \ncomprehensive plan to deal with the situation in Iraq and too many \nuncertainties persisted to warrant my support for a surge of U.S. \npersonnel.\n  On February 5, 2007, I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the surge:\n\n       On this state of the record, I cannot support an additional \n     allocation of 21,500 troops because it is my judgment that \n     would not be material or helpful in what is going on at the \n     present time. This comes against the backdrop of extensive \n     hearings in the Armed Services Committee and Foreign \n     Relations Committee, and in the context of the military \n     having given many estimates with many of those in key command \n     position saying that no more troops are necessary. This comes \n     with the Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki saying a variety of \n     things but at some times saying he doesn't want any more \n     troops.\n\n  At this time, I have not seen a plan that sufficiently addresses a \nstrategy for victory in Iraq. Various reports indicate military \nadvisers differ on the impact of an increased troop level in Iraq. It \nis not clear what the surge will ultimately accomplish and if it will \nbe successful. Nonetheless, there are indicators that mandate we create \ncontingency plans and consider other options. The Iraqi Government has \nfailed to deliver on prior pledges which makes me hesitant to think \nthey have the ability to deliver on new ones. According to many \nmeasurements, progress in Iraq has been poor and the situation is \ndeteriorating. What is clear is that any solution will necessarily \ninclude political compromises by Iraq's various sects as well as an \nemphasis on a regional dialogue--something for which the Iraq Study \nGroup advocated.\n  Another proposal offered by Senators Salazar and Alexander would have \nused the work of the Iraq Study Group, which was led by former \nSecretary of State James Baker and former Representative Lee Hamilton, \nas a guide for our policy in Iraq. This legislation garnered bipartisan \nsupport including five Republicans and seven Democrats.\n  The amendment states that U.S. support should be conditioned on the \nGovernment of Iraq's political will and substantial progress towards \nnational reconciliation, revision of de baathification laws, equitable \nsharing of Iraqi oil revenues, free and fair provincial elections and \nmechanisms to ensure the rights of woman and minorities.\n  Like the Warner-Lugar proposal, this amendment calls for enhanced \ndiplomatic efforts. Specifically, the measure calls for a new \n``Diplomatic Offensive'' to deal with the problems in Iraq and the \nregion; energize other countries to support reconciliation in Iraq; \nengage directly with the Governments of Iran and Syria to obtain their \ncommitment to constructive policies towards Iraq and the region, \nencourage the holding of a conference in Baghdad of neighboring \ncountries and convey to the Iraqi Government that continued American \nsupport is contingent upon substantial progress toward and assist in \nthe achievement of the milestones.\n  Because of the potential for the Salazar-Alexander amendment to \nprovide a basis for a Senate consensus, I am cosponsoring this \namendment. There is no inconsistency in cosponsoring both Warner-Lugar \nand Salazar-Alexander. They complement each other.\n  Both the Warner-Lugar and Salazar-Alexander proposals address the \nissue of diplomacy in the region. I have consistently urged the \nadministration to work with Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria, \nin order to develop cooperative stabilization efforts. To that end, I \nhave met with President Bashar Assad of Syria. I have met with Iran's \nAmbassadors to the United Nations, Seyed Muhammed Hadi Nejad Hosseinian \nand Muhammad Javad Zarif, on four occasions in New York and Washington, \nDC. Additionally, I was the only Member of Congress to attend the \nSeptember 2006 address by former President Khatami at the National \nCathedral.\n  During my meetings with Iranian officials, I developed a proposal for \nan exchange of visits by Members of Congress to Iran and Iranian \nparliamentarians to the United States to try to open dialogue between \nour two countries. In January 2004, my efforts to foster such a \ndialogue were successful. There was a tentative agreement for U.S. \nMembers of Congress to meet with Iranian parliamentarians in Geneva. \nRegrettably, this parliamentary exchange never came to fruition.\n  In an effort to jumpstart this exchange, on May 3, 2007, I sent a \nletter, with support from Senators Biden, Hagel and Dodd and \nRepresentatives Lantos, English, Moran, Gilchrest and Meeks, to the \nSpeaker of Iran's Parliament suggesting we convene a meeting of U.S. \nand Iranian parliamentarians.\n  I have amplified my strong belief that dialogue with nations such as \nIran and Syria is necessary in an extensive Senate speech on June 16, \n2006 and most recently in an essay ``Dialogue\n\n[[Page S10595]]\n\nWith Adversaries'' published in the winter edition of The Washington \nQuarterly. While we can't be sure that dialogue will succeed, we can be \nsure that without dialogue there will be failure.\n  I am not alone in calling for enhanced dialogue with U.S. \nadversaries. Of the many suggestions gleaned from the Baker-Hamilton \ncommission, one passage crystallizes their conclusion:\n\n       Our most important recommendations call for new and \n     enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the \n     region, and a change in the primary mission of U.S. forces in \n     Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move its \n     combat forces out of Iraq responsibly. We believe that these \n     two recommendations are equally important and reinforce one \n     another.\n\n  However, the President's plan places a disproportionate emphasis on \nmilitary force while neglecting the needed diplomacy and political \nefforts.\n  Having served in the Senate for 26 years, holding the chairmanship of \nthe Intelligence Committee and senior positions on the Appropriations \nsubcommittees on Defense and Foreign Operations, I am aware of what \nchallenges nations like Iran and Syria pose to the United States. A \nworld in which Iran seeks nuclear weapons and supports terrorist groups \nsuch as Hezbollah is not a safe world. A world in which Syria provides \nrefuge for Hamas and Hezbollah and permits its territory to be used as \na conduit for terrorism is counterproductive to peace and stability. I \nexpressed my views on the danger the connectivity between Iran, Syria \nand Hezbollah poses to peace and security in an August 2, 2006, floor \nstatement.\n  Today, however, Americans are not dying from nuclear weapons or from \ndirect attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah. Many are dying policing a civil \nconflict.\n  President Assad, during our December 2006 meeting in Damascus, \nsuggested that a conference with regional players and the United States \nwould be beneficial to addressing the issues confronting Iraq. On \nJanuary 22, 2007, I conveyed this proposal and my support for it to \nSecretary Rice in a meeting in her office at the State Department. One \nmonth later, on February 27, 2007, during her testimony before the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, Secretary Rice announced such a \nproposal:\n\n       Before I discuss our specific request for Iraq, I would \n     like to take this opportunity to announce a new diplomatic \n     initiative relating to Iraq's future. I am pleased to tell \n     Members of Congress that there is now being formed a \n     neighbors' conference to support Iraq. Invitees will include \n     Iraq's immediate neighbors, as well as representatives \n     from other regional states, multilateral organizations, \n     and the UN Permanent Five (the U.S., France, Britain, \n     Russia and China). I would note that both Syria and Iran \n     are among Iraq's neighbors invited to attend.\n       The violence occurring within Iraq has a decided impact on \n     Iraq's neighbors. Iraq's neighbors have a clear role to play \n     in helping Iraq to move forward, and this conference will \n     provide a needed forum in order to do just that.\n\n  Very little has happened to effectuate that ``new diplomatic \ninitiative.'' The Iraq Study Group clearly states:\n\n       Given the ability of Iran and Syria to influence events \n     within Iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in Iraq, the \n     United States should try to engage them constructively.\n\n  It would have been my hope that these types of meetings would have \noccurred frequently in the intervening months. However, I am pleased \nthat the President has recently indicated a commitment to ramp up \ndiplomatic efforts in the region.\n  Had there been Senate consideration and debate on the Warner-Lugar \nand Salazar-Alexander proposals, there would have been an opportunity \nfor more senators to explicitly put the President on notice that \nfunding beyond September was in jeopardy without significant \nimprovement.\n  I think this time would have also allowed Members to share concerns \nabout the overall struggle to combat terrorism. While considering U.S. \npolicy in Iraq, it is important we do not neglect other threats to U.S. \nsecurity.\n  Waziristan is a semi-autonomous tribal region in Pakistan's \nmountainous Northwest Frontier province that shares a porous border \nwith Afghanistan. It is populated primarily by ethnic Pashtuns who do \nnot recognize the authority of President Musharrafs government in \nIslamabad. Many of the Taliban who fled Afghanistan in 2001 found safe \nhaven in Waziristan with their Pashtun brethren.\n  Some accounts, including the 9/11 Commission report, indicate \nPakistan's willingness to assist the United States. Following direct \nU.S. engagement with Pakistan after the September 11 attacks, the 9/11 \nCommission report stated that, ``Secretary of State Powell announced at \nthe beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had \nagreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism.''\n  However, that was 6 years ago. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, CRS, ``Despite clear successes in disrupting al-Qaida \nand affiliated networks in Pakistan since 2001, there are increasing \nsigns that anti-U.S. terrorists are now benefiting from what some \nanalysts call a Pakistani policy of appeasement in western tribal areas \nnear the Afghan border.''\n  GEN Pervez Musharraf took a largely hands-off approach to the region \nafter signing a truce with tribal leaders in September 2006. The truce \ncame after 4 years of unsuccessful army operations into the region in \nwhich the government forces suffered heavy casualties and achieved \nlittle. Some accounts indicate this policy has enhanced al-Qaida's \nabilities: ``By seeking accommodation with pro-Taliban leaders in these \nareas, the Musharraf government appears to have inadvertently allowed \nforeign (largely Arab) militants to obtain safe haven from which they \ncan plot and train for terrorist attacks against U.S. and other Western \ntargets.''\n  Assistant Secretary of State Richard A. Boucher confirmed that al-\nQaida thrived under the truce between the tribal leaders and General \nMusharraf: ``they were able to operate, meet, plan, recruit, and obtain \nfinancing in more comfort in the tribal areas than previously.''\n  Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who \nserved for 29 years with the CIA and held various positions such as \nSpecial Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Near East \nAffairs at the National Security Council, 1997-2002, stated in his May/\nJune 2007 essay in Foreign Affairs:\n\n       Al Qaeda is a more dangerous enemy today than it has ever \n     been before and the organization now has a solid base of \n     operations in the badlands of Pakistan and an effective \n     franchise in western Iraq.\n\n  Riedel further suggests that:\n\n       The United States and its partners, including NATO, also \n     need to take a firmer position with the Pakistani government \n     to enlist its help in tracking down al-Qaeda leaders. \n     President Pervez Musharraf has taken some important steps \n     against al-Qaeda, especially after its attempts to \n     assassinate him, and he has promised more than once a full \n     crackdown on extremism. But mostly he has sought to tame \n     jihadists--without much success--and his government has \n     tolerated those who harbor bin Laden and his lieutenants, \n     Taliban fighters and their Afghan fellow travelers, and \n     Kashmiri terrorists. Many senior Pakistani politicians say \n     privately that they believe Pakistan's Inter-Services \n     Intelligence (ISI) still has extensive links to bin Laden; \n     some even claim it harbors him. Apprehending a few al-Qaeda \n     officers would not be enough, and so a systematic crackdown \n     on all terrorists--Arab, Afghan, and Kashmiri--is critical. \n     Hence, Pakistan should no longer be rewarded for its \n     selective counterterrorism efforts.\n\n  Since September 11, 2001, the United States has provided Pakistan \nwith roughly $9 billion in aid. According to the Congressional Research \nService, CRS:\n\n       The outcomes of U.S. policies toward Pakistan since 9/11, \n     while not devoid of meaningful successes, have neither \n     neutralized anti-Western militants and reduced religious \n     extremism in that country, nor have they tributed \n     sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring Afghanistan.\n\n  As Congress considers administration's request for an additional $785 \nmillion for fiscal year 2008, it is incumbent upon us to evaluate our \nrelationship with them and their performance in the war on terror.\n  Waziristan provides al-Qaida with much of what it lost in Afghanistan \nafter September 11, 2001: safe haven; territory to train and base \noperations in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and beyond; and a populace \nsympathetic to their aims. Failing to recognize and address the \nsituation in Waziristan risks negating the costly advances made in \nAfghanistan over the past 6 years and jeopardizes U.S. security.\n  As the Senate continues to deliberate, it is my hope that we will \nreturn to the proposals offered by Senators Warner, Lugar, Salazar and \nAlexander. These should have been debated in great length as they make \nmore\n\n[[Page S10596]]\n\nsense in the context of not infringing on the President's authority as \nCommander in Chief. Rather, these bipartisan efforts would allow the \nPresident to fulfill a congressional requirement that he ought to be \nconsidering and planning for the next steps.\n  The Senate is known as the most deliberative body in the world. \nRegrettably, the Senate was not permitted the opportunity to \ndemonstrate this as we did not debate the various options before us.\n  As I stated on the Senate floor on March 14, 2007, during a similar \ndebate on whether to continue with the status quo in Iraq or to \nlegislate a date certain for withdraw:\n\n       It is equally undesirable, however, to view the current \n     situation in Iraq, which looks like an endless tunnel--a \n     tunnel without a light at the end. We are faced with very \n     considerable discomfort in this body. I think it is very \n     important that we debate this matter, that we exchange our \n     views, that we stimulate discussion that will go beyond this \n     Chamber and will resound throughout the country, resound \n     throughout the editorial pages and the television and radio \n     talk shows, and by our colleagues in the corridors and in the \n     cloakroom so that we can try to work our way through an \n     extraordinarily difficult situation where, as I see it, there \n     is no good answer between the two intractable alternatives to \n     set a timetable where our opponents simply have to wait us \n     out or to keep proceeding down a tunnel which, at least at \n     this juncture, appears to be endless and has no light. We \n     don't know where the end is, let alone to have a light at the \n     end of the tunnel.\n\n  In a democracy, the voters ultimately decide U.S. policy. As detailed \nin Federalist No. 57, elected representatives must be responsive to the \npeople:\n\n       Duty gratitude, interest, ambition itself, are the chords \n     by which [representatives] will be bound to fidelity and \n     sympathy with the great mass of the people. Hence, the House \n     of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the \n     members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the \n     people. Before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the \n     mode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of \n     power, they will be compelled to anticipate the moment \n     when their power is to cease, when their exercise of it is \n     to be reviewed, and when they must descend to the level \n     from which they were raised; there forever to remain \n     unless a faithful discharge of their trust shall have \n     established their title to a renewal of it.\n\n  If this is not understood and reflected by elected representatives, \nthe framers placed elections into the system to remind them. Federalist \nNo. 57 further states:\n\n       The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteristic \n     policy of republican government . . . The means relied on in \n     this form of government for preventing their degeneracy are \n     numerous and various. The most effectual one, is such a \n     limitation of the term of appointments as will maintain a \n     proper responsibility to the people.\n\n  This was the case last November when the electorate spoke loudly \ndisagreeing with United States policy in Iraq. As I stated on March 14, \n2007:\n\n       Last November, the American people spoke in a resounding \n     manner, in a way that could only rationally be interpreted as \n     rejecting the conduct of the war in Iraq.\n\n  I am making this extensive floor statement at this time to put the \nadministration on notice of my reservations on supporting open-ended \nappropriations for the Iraq war in September. This statement further \nurges the majority leader to structure the Senate debate in September \nto consider the Warner-Lugar amendment, the Salazar-Alexander \namendment, and other possible amendments, as well as the Levin-Reed \namendment, to give the Senate the full range of alternatives to provide \nthe basis for 60 or more votes to change U.S. policy in Iraq.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the recent debate of the Defense \nauthorization bill, we saw attempt after attempt to declare the new \nstrategy, General Petraeus' strategy, in Iraq a failure. The other side \nof the aisle wanted to declare that the strategy, which had been in \nfull force only a couple of weeks, had failed and direct the President \nto begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, which is today the central front \nin the war against terrorists. Indeed, after the other side lost a vote \nto withdraw the troops, the majority leader pulled the bill from the \nfloor, thus leaving important business for our military unfinished.\n  The Democratic majority's insistence that the General Petraeus' \nstrategy has failed makes it easy to overlook what the strategy has \naccomplished and what the strategy seeks to accomplish.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent to have an article by Michael \nGordon from New York Times of July 24 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From nytimes.com, July 24, 2007]\n\n                U.S. Is Seen in Iraq Until at Least '09\n\n                         (By Michael R. Gordon)\n\n       Baghdad, July 23.--While Washington is mired in political \n     debate over the future of Iraq, the American command here has \n     prepared a detailed plan that foresees a significant American \n     role for the next two years.\n       The classified plan, which represents the coordinated \n     strategy of the top American commander and the American \n     ambassador, calls for restoring security in local areas, \n     including Baghdad, by the summer of 2008. ``Sustainable \n     security'' is to be established on a nationwide basis by the \n     summer of 2009, according to American officials familiar with \n     the document.\n       The detailed document, known as the Joint Campaign Plan, is \n     an elaboration of the new strategy President Bush signaled in \n     January when he decided to send five additional American \n     combat brigades and other units to Iraq. That signaled a \n     shift from the previous strategy, which emphasized \n     transferring to Iraqis the responsibility for safeguarding \n     their security.\n       That new approach put a premium on protecting the Iraqi \n     population in Baghdad, on the theory that improved security \n     would provide Iraqi political leaders with the breathing \n     space they needed to try political reconciliation.\n       The latest plan, which covers a two-year period, does not \n     explicitly address troop levels or withdrawal schedules. It \n     anticipates a decline in American forces as the ``surge'' in \n     troops runs its course later this year or in early 2008. But \n     it nonetheless assumes continued American involvement to \n     train soldiers, act as partners with Iraqi forces and fight \n     terrorist groups in Iraq, American officials said.\n       The goals in the document appear ambitious, given the \n     immensity of the challenge of dealing with die-hard Sunni \n     insurgents, renegade Shiite militias, Iraqi leaders who have \n     made only fitful progress toward political reconciliation, as \n     well as Iranian and Syrian neighbors who have not hesitated \n     to interfere in Iraq's affairs. And the White House's interim \n     assessment of progress, issued on July 12, is mixed.\n       But at a time when critics at home are defining patience in \n     terms of weeks, the strategy may run into the expectations of \n     many lawmakers for an early end to the American mission here.\n       The plan, developed by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior \n     American commander, and Ryan C. Crocker, the American \n     ambassador, has been briefed to Defense Secretary Robert M. \n     Gates and Adm. William J. Fallon, the head of the Central \n     Command. It is expected to be formally issued to officials \n     here this week.\n       The plan envisions two phases. The ``near-term'' goal is to \n     achieve ``localized security'' in Baghdad and other areas no \n     later than June 2008. It envisions encouraging political \n     accommodations at the local level, including with former \n     insurgents, while pressing Iraq's leaders to make headway on \n     their program of national reconciliation.\n       The ``intermediate'' goal is to stitch together such local \n     arrangements to establish a broader sense of security on a \n     nationwide basis no later than June 2009.\n       ``The coalition, in partnership with the government of \n     Iraq, employs integrated political, security, economic and \n     diplomatic means, to help the people of Iraq achieve \n     sustainable security by the summer of 2009,'' a summary of \n     the campaign plan states.\n       Military officials here have been careful not to guarantee \n     success, and recognized they may need to revise the plan if \n     some assumptions were not met.\n       ``The idea behind the surge was to bring stability and \n     security to the Iraqi people, primarily in Baghdad because it \n     is the political heart of the country, and by so doing give \n     the Iraqis the time and space needed to come to grips with \n     the tough issues they face and enable reconciliation to take \n     place,'' said Col. Peter Mansoor, the executive officer to \n     General Petraeus.\n       ``If eventually the Iraqi government and the various sects \n     and groups do not come to some sort of agreement on how to \n     share power, on how to divide resources and on how to \n     reconcile and stop the violence, then the assumption on which \n     the surge strategy was based is invalid, and we would have to \n     re-look the strategy,'' Colonel Mansoor added.\n       General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will provide an \n     assessment in September on trends in Iraq and whether the \n     strategy is viable or needs to be changed.\n       The previous plan, developed by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., \n     who served as General Petraeus's predecessor before being \n     appointed as chief of staff of the Army, was aimed at \n     prompting the Iraqis to take more responsibility for security \n     by reducing American forces.\n       That approach faltered when the Iraqi security forces \n     showed themselves unprepared to carry out their expanded \n     duties, and sectarian killings soared.\n       In contrast, the new approach reflects the \n     counterinsurgency precept that protection of the population \n     is the best way to isolate insurgents, encourage political \n     accommodations and gain intelligence on numerous\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\n     threats. A core assumption of the plan is that American \n     troops cannot impose a military solution, but that the United \n     States can use force to create the conditions in which \n     political reconciliation is possible.\n       To develop the plan, General Petraeus and Ambassador \n     Crocker assembled a Joint Strategic Assessment Team, which \n     sought to define the conflict and outline the elements of a \n     new strategy. It included officers like Col. H. R. McMaster, \n     the field commander who carried out the successful ``clear, \n     hold and build'' operation in Tal Afar and who wrote a \n     critical account of the Joint Chiefs of Staff role during the \n     Vietnam War; Col. John R. Martin, who teaches at the Army War \n     College and was a West Point classmate of General Petraeus; \n     and David Kilcullen, an Australian counterinsurgency expert \n     who has a degree in anthropology.\n       State Department officials, including Robert Ford, an Arab \n     expert and the American ambassador to Algeria, were also \n     involved. So were a British officer and experts outside \n     government like Stephen D. Biddle, a military expert at the \n     Council on Foreign Relations.\n       The team determined that Iraq was in a ``communal struggle \n     for power,'' in the words of one senior officer who \n     participated in the effort. Adding to the problem, the new \n     Iraqi government was struggling to unite its disparate \n     factions and to develop the capability to deliver basic \n     services and provide security.\n       Extremists were fueling the violence, as were nations like \n     Iran, which they concluded was arming and equipping Shiite \n     militant groups, and Syria, which was allowing suicide \n     bombers to cross into Iraq.\n       Like the Baker-Hamilton commission, which issued its report \n     last year, the team believed that political, military and \n     economic efforts were needed, including diplomatic \n     discussions with Iran, officials said. There were different \n     views about how aggressive to be in pressing for the removal \n     of overtly sectarian officials, and several officials said \n     that theme was toned down somewhat in the final plan.\n       The plan itself was written by the Joint Campaign Redesign \n     Team, an allusion to the fact that the plan inherited from \n     General Casey was being reworked. Much of the redesign has \n     already been put into effect, including the decision to \n     move troops out of large bases and to act as partners more \n     fully with the Iraqi security forces.\n       The overarching goal, an American official said, is to \n     advance political accommodation and avoid undercutting the \n     authority of the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. \n     While the plan seeks to achieve stability, several officials \n     said it anticipates that less will be accomplished in terms \n     of national reconciliation by the end of 2009 than did the \n     plan developed by General Casey.\n       The plan also emphasizes encouraging political \n     accommodation at the local level. The command has established \n     a team to oversee efforts to reach out to former insurgents \n     and tribal leaders. It is dubbed the Force Strategic \n     Engagement Cell, and is overseen by a British general. In the \n     terminology of the plan, the aim is to identify potentially \n     ``reconcilable'' groups and encourage them to move away from \n     violence.\n       However, groups like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni Arab \n     extremist group that American intelligence officials say has \n     foreign leadership, and cells backed by Iran are seen as \n     implacable foes.\n       ``You are not out there trying to defeat your enemies \n     wholesale,'' said one military official who is knowledgable \n     about the plan. ``You are out there trying to draw them into \n     a negotiated power-sharing agreement where they decide to \n     quit fighting you. They don't decide that their conflict is \n     over. The reasons for conflict remain, but they quit trying \n     to address it through violence. In the end, we hope that that \n     alliance of convenience to fight with Al Qaeda becomes a \n     connection to the central government as well.''\n       The hope is that sufficient progress might be made at the \n     local level to encourage accommodation at the national level, \n     and vice versa. The plan also calls for efforts to encourage \n     the rule of law, such as the establishment of secure zones in \n     Baghdad and other cities to promote criminal trials and \n     process detainee cases.\n       To help measure progress in tamping down civil strife, Col. \n     William Rapp, a senior aide to General Petraeus, oversaw an \n     effort to develop a standardized measure of sectarian \n     violence. One result was a method that went beyond the \n     attacks noted in American military reports and which \n     incorporated Iraqi data.\n       ``We are going to try a dozen different things,'' said one \n     senior officer. ``Maybe one of them will flatline. One of \n     them will do this much. One of them will do this much more. \n     After a while, we believe there is chance you will head into \n     success. I am not saying that we are absolutely headed for \n     success.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to insert this article in the Record \nbecause it provides an objective description of the Petraeus plan and \nhow it came to be. The goals of the strategy are ``ambitious,'' as the \narticle notes, but that is all the more reason to support the plan and \nnot undermine it in the Senate.\n  Those who have criticized the surge at this early stage have offered \nfew options for dealing with the aftermath. One option is to follow the \nrecommendation of the Baker-Hamilton Commission.\n  At this point, I request unanimous consent to print in the Record a \ncolumn by Steven Biddle that appeared in the July 11 Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                   [From washingtonpost.com, July 11]\n\n                        Iraq: Go Deep or Get Out\n\n                          (By Stephen Biddle)\n\n       The president's shaky political consensus for the surge in \n     Iraq is in danger of collapsing after the recent defections \n     of prominent Senate Republicans such as Richard Lugar (Ind.), \n     Pete Domenici (N.M.) and George Voinovich (Ohio). But this \n     growing opposition to the surge has not yet translated into \n     support for outright withdrawal--few lawmakers are \n     comfortable with abandoning Iraq or admitting defeat. The \n     result has been a search for some kind of politically \n     moderate ``Plan B'' that would split the difference between \n     surge and withdrawal.\n       The problem is that these politics do not fit the military \n     reality of Iraq. Many would like to reduce the U.S. \n     commitment to something like half of today's troop presence \n     there. But it is much harder to find a mission for the \n     remaining 60,000 to 80,000 soldiers that makes any sense \n     militarily.\n       Perhaps the most popular centrist option today is drawn \n     from the Baker-Hamilton commission recommendations of last \n     December. This would withdraw U.S. combat brigades, shift the \n     American mission to one of training and supporting the Iraqi \n     security forces, and cut total U.S. troop levels in the \n     country by about half. This idea is at the heart of the \n     proposed legislative effort that Domenici threw his support \n     behind last week, and support is growing on both sides of the \n     aisle on Capitol Hill.\n       The politics make sense, but the compromise leaves us with \n     an untenable military mission. Without a major U.S. combat \n     effort to keep the violence down, the American training \n     effort would face challenges even bigger than those our \n     troops are confronting today. An ineffective training effort \n     would leave tens of thousands of American trainers, advisers \n     and supporting troops exposed to that violence in the \n     meantime. The net result is likely to be continued U.S. \n     casualties with little positive effect on Iraq's ongoing \n     civil war.\n       The American combat presence in Iraq is insufficient to end \n     the violence but does cap its intensity. If we draw down that \n     combat presence, violence will rise accordingly. To be \n     effective, embedded trainers and advisers must live and \n     operate with the Iraqi soldiers they mentor--they are not \n     lecturers sequestered in some safe classroom. The greater the \n     violence, the riskier their jobs and the heavier their \n     losses.\n       That violence reduces their ability to succeed as trainers. \n     There are many barriers to an effective Iraqi security force. \n     But the toughest is sectarian factionalism. Iraq is in the \n     midst of a civil war in which all Iraqis are increasingly \n     forced to take sides for their own survival. Iraq's security \n     forces are necessarily drawn from the same populations that \n     are being pulled apart into factions. No military can be \n     hermetically sealed off from its society--the more severe the \n     sectarian violence, the deeper the divisions in Iraqi society \n     become and the harder it is for Americans to create the kind \n     of disinterested nationalist security force that could \n     stabilize Iraq. Under the best conditions, it is unrealistic \n     to expect a satisfactory Iraqi security force anytime soon, \n     and the more severe the violence, the worse the prospects.\n       The result is a vicious cycle. The more we shift out of \n     combat missions and into training, the harder we make the \n     trainers' job and the more exposed they become. It is \n     unrealistic to expect that we can pull back to some safe yet \n     productive mission of training but not fighting--this would \n     be neither safe nor productive.\n       If the surge is unacceptable, the better option is to cut \n     our losses and withdraw altogether. In fact, the substantive \n     case for either extreme--surge or outright withdrawal--is \n     stronger than for any policy between. The surge is a long-\n     shot gamble. But middle-ground options leave us with the \n     worst of both worlds: continuing casualties but even less \n     chance of stability in exchange. Moderation and centrism are \n     normally the right instincts in American politics, and many \n     lawmakers in both parties desperately want to find a workable \n     middle ground on Iraq. But while the politics are right, the \n     military logic is not.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. Biddle provides a need evaluation of the flaws in the \nBaker-Hamilton. Among those flaws, as he explains, our combat forces \nare restraining the intensity of the violence in Iraq, and removing \nthem would cause the violence to rise. This rise in violence would put \nthe safety of Americans who remain to train Iraqis in even greater \njeopardy.\n  Of course, prematurely withdrawing our troops would have many other \nconsequences. Indeed, a sobering assessment of the risks of withdrawal \nis too often missing from debates about the U.S. mission in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S10598]]\n\n  In this regard, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the July \n17 Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 17, 2007]\n\n Exit Strategy: Would Iran Take Over Iraq, Would Al-Qaeda? The Debate \nAbout How and When to Leave Centers on What Might Happen After the U.S. \n                                  Goes\n\n                 (By Karen DeYoung and Thomas E. Ricks)\n\n       If U.S. combat forces withdraw from Iraq in the near \n     future, three developments would be likely to unfold. \n     Majority Shiites would drive Sunnis out of ethnically \n     mixed areas west to Anbar province. Southern Iraq would \n     erupt in civil war between Shiite groups. And the Kurdish \n     north would solidify its borders and invite a U.S. troop \n     presence there. In short, Iraq would effectively become \n     three separate nations.\n       That was the conclusion reached in recent ``war games'' \n     exercises conducted for the U.S. military by retired Marine \n     Col. Gary Anderson. ``I honestly don't think it will be \n     apocalyptic,'' said Anderson, who has served in Iraq and now \n     works for a major defense contractor. But ``it will be \n     ugly.''\n       In making the case for a continued U.S. troop presence, \n     President Bush has offered far more dire forecasts, arguing \n     that al-Qaeda or Iran--or both--would take over Iraq after a \n     ``precipitous withdrawal'' of U.S. forces. Al-Qaeda, he said \n     recently, would ``be able to recruit better and raise more \n     money from which to launch their objectives'' of attacking \n     the U.S. homeland. War opponents in Congress counter that \n     Bush's talk about al-Qaeda is overblown fear-mongering and \n     that nothing could be worse than the present situation.\n       Increasingly, the Washington debate over when U.S. forces \n     should leave is centering on what would happen once they do. \n     The U.S. military, aware of this political battlefield, has \n     been quietly exploring scenarios of a reduced troop presence, \n     performing role-playing exercises and studying historical \n     parallels. Would the Iraqi government find its way, or would \n     the country divide along sectarian lines? Would al-Qaeda take \n     over? Would Iran? Would U.S. security improve or deteriorate? \n     Does the answer depend on when, how and how many U.S. troops \n     depart?\n       Some military officers contend that, regardless of whether \n     Iraq breaks apart or outside actors seek to take over after a \n     U.S. pullout, ever greater carnage is inevitable. ``The \n     water-cooler chat I hear most often . . . is that there is \n     going to be an outbreak of violence when we leave that makes \n     the [current] instability look like a church picnic,'' said \n     an officer who has served in Iraq.\n       However, just as few envisioned the long Iraq war, now in \n     its fifth year, or the many setbacks along the way, there are \n     no firm conclusions regarding the consequences of a reduction \n     in U.S. troops. A senior administration official closely \n     involved in Iraq policy imagines a vast internecine slaughter \n     as Iraq descends into chaos but cautions that it is \n     impossible to know the outcome. ``We've got to be very modest \n     about our predictive capabilities,'' the official said.\n\n\n                          Mistakes of the Past\n\n       In April of last year, the Army and Joint Forces Command \n     sponsored a war game called Unified Quest 2007 at the Army \n     War College in Pennsylvania. It assumed the partition of an \n     ``Iraq-like'' country, said one player, retired Army Col. \n     Richard Sinnreich, with U.S. troops moving quickly out of the \n     capital to redeploy in the far north and south. ``We have \n     obligations to the Kurds and the Kuwaitis, and they also \n     offer the most stable and secure locations from which to \n     continue,'' he said.\n       ``Even then, the end-of-game assessment wasn't very \n     favorable'' to the United States, he said.\n       Anderson, the retired Marine, has conducted nearly a dozen \n     Iraq-related war games for the military over the past two \n     years, many premised on a U.S. combat pullout by a set date--\n     leaving only advisers and support units--and concluded that \n     partition would result. The games also predicted that Iran \n     would intervene on one side of a Shiite civil war and would \n     become bogged down in southern Iraq.\n       T.X. Hammes, another retired Marine colonel, said that an \n     extended Iranian presence in Iraq could lead to increased \n     intervention by Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states on the \n     other side. ``If that happens,'' Hammes said, ``I worry that \n     the Iranians come to the conclusion they have to do something \n     to undercut . . . the Saudis.'' Their best strategy, he said, \n     ``would be to stimulate insurgency among the Shiites in Saudi \n     Arabia.''\n       In a secret war game conducted in December at an office \n     building near the Pentagon, more than 20 participants from \n     the military, the CIA, the State Department and the private \n     sector spent three days examining what might unfold if the \n     recommendations of the Iraq Study Group were implemented.\n       One question involved how Syria and Iran might respond to \n     the U.S. diplomatic outreach proposed by the bipartisan \n     group, headed by former secretary of state James A. Baker III \n     and former congressman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.). The gamers \n     concluded that Iran would be difficult to engage because its \n     divided government is incapable of delivering on its \n     promises. Role-players representing Syria did engage with the \n     U.S. diplomats, but linked helping out in Baghdad to a \n     lessening of U.S. pressure in Lebanon.\n       The bottom line, one participant said, was ``pretty much \n     what we are seeing'' since the Bush administration began \n     intermittent talks with Damascus and Tehran: not much \n     progress or tangible results.\n       Amid political arguments in Washington over troop \n     departures, U.S. military commanders on the ground stress the \n     importance of developing a careful and thorough withdrawal \n     plan. Whatever the politicians decide, ``it needs to be well-\n     thought-out and it cannot be a strategy that is based on \n     `Well, we need to leave,' '' Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, a \n     top U.S. commander in Iraq, said Friday from his base near \n     Tikrit.\n       History is replete with bad withdrawal outcomes. Among the \n     most horrific was the British departure from Afghanistan in \n     1842, when 16,500 active troops and civilians left Kabul \n     thinking they had safe passage to India. Two weeks later, \n     only one European arrived alive in Jalalabad, near the \n     Afghan-Indian border.\n       The Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan, which began \n     in May 1988 after a decade of occupation, reveals other \n     mistakes to avoid. Like the U.S. troops who arrived in Iraq \n     in 2003, the Soviet force in Afghanistan was overwhelmingly \n     conventional, heavy with tanks and other armored vehicles. \n     Once Moscow made public its plans to leave, the political and \n     security situations unraveled much faster than anticipated. \n     ``The Soviet Army actually had to fight out of certain \n     areas,'' said Army Maj. Daniel Morgan, a two-tour veteran of \n     the Iraq war who has been studying the Soviet pullout at Fort \n     Leavenworth, Kan., with an eye toward gleaning lessons for \n     Iraq. ``As a matter of fact, they had to airlift out of \n     Kandahar, the fighting was so bad.''\n       War supporters and opponents in Washington disagree on the \n     lessons of the departure most deeply imprinted on the \n     American psyche: the U.S. exit from Vietnam. ``I saw it once \n     before, a long time ago,'' Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a \n     Vietnam veteran and presidential candidate, said last week of \n     an early Iraq withdrawal. ``I saw a defeated military, and I \n     saw how long it took a military that was defeated to \n     recover.''\n       Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), also a White House \n     hopeful, finds a different message in the Vietnam retreat. \n     Saying that Baghdad would become ``Saigon revisited,'' he \n     warned that ``we will be lifting American personnel off the \n     roofs of buildings in the Green Zone if we do not change \n     policy, and pretty drastically.''\n\n\n                          The Al-Qaeda Threat\n\n       What is perhaps most striking about the military's \n     simulations is that its post-drawdown scenarios focus on \n     civil war and regional intervention and upheaval rather than \n     the establishment of an al-Qaeda sanctuary in Iraq.\n       For Bush, however, that is the primary risk of withdrawal. \n     ``It would mean surrendering the future of Iraq to al-\n     Qaeda,'' he said in a news conference last week. ``It would \n     mean that we'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. \n     It would mean we'd allow the terrorists to establish a safe \n     haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan.'' \n     If U.S. troops leave too soon, Bush said, they would probably \n     ``have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that \n     is even more dangerous.''\n       Withdrawal would also ``confuse and frighten friends and \n     allies in the region and embolden Syria and especially Iran, \n     which would then exert its influence throughout the Middle \n     East,'' the president said.\n       Bush is not alone in his description of the al-Qaeda threat \n     should the United States leave Iraq too soon. ``There's not a \n     doubt in my mind that Osama bin Laden's one goal is to take \n     over the Kingdom of the Two Mosques [Saudi Arabia] and \n     reestablish the caliphate'' that ended with the Ottoman \n     Empire, said a former senior military official now at a \n     Washington think tank. ``It would be very easy for them to \n     set up camps and run them in Anbar and Najaf'' provinces in \n     Iraq.\n       U.S. intelligence analysts, however, have a somewhat \n     different view of al-Qaeda's presence in Iraq, noting that \n     the local branch takes its inspiration but not its orders \n     from bin Laden. Its enemies--the overwhelming majority of \n     whom are Iraqis--reside in Baghdad and Shiite-majority areas \n     of Iraq, not in Saudi Arabia or the United States. While \n     intelligence officials have described the Sunni insurgent \n     group calling itself al-Qaeda in Iraq as an ``accelerant'' \n     for violence, they have cited domestic sectarian divisions \n     as the main impediment to peace.\n       In a report released yesterday, Anthony H. Cordesman of the \n     Center for Strategic and International Studies warned that \n     al-Qaeda is ``only one part'' of a spectrum of Sunni \n     extremist groups and is far from the largest or most active. \n     Military officials have said in background briefings that al-\n     Qaeda is responsible for about 15 percent of the attacks, \n     Cordesman said, although the group is ``highly effective'' \n     and probably does ``the most damage in pushing Iraq towards \n     civil war.'' But its activities ``must be kept in careful \n     perspective, and it does not dominate the Sunni insurgency,'' \n     he said.\n\n\n                         `Serious Consequences'\n\n       Moderate lawmakers such as Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) \n     have concluded that a unified Iraqi government is not on the \n     near horizon and have called for redeployment, change of \n     mission and a phased drawdown of\n\n[[Page S10599]]\n\n     U.S. forces. Far from protecting U.S. interests, Lugar said \n     in a recent speech, the continuation of Bush's policy poses \n     ``extreme risks for U.S. national security.''\n       Critics of complete withdrawal often charge that ``those \n     advocating [it] just don't understand the serious \n     consequences of doing so,'' said Wayne White, a former deputy \n     director of Near East division of the State Department's \n     Intelligence and Research Bureau. ``Unfortunately, most of us \n     old Middle East hands understand all too well some of the \n     consequences.''\n       White is among many Middle East experts who think that the \n     United States should leave Iraq sooner rather than later, but \n     differ on when, how and what would happen next. Most agree \n     that either an al-Qaeda or Iranian takeover would be \n     unlikely, and say that Washington should step up its regional \n     diplomacy, putting more pressure on regional actors such as \n     Saudi Arabia to take responsibility for what is happening in \n     their back yards.\n       Many regional experts within and outside the administration \n     note that while there is a range of truly awful \n     possibilities, it is impossible to predict what will happen \n     in Iraq--with or without U.S. troops.\n       ``Say the Shiites drive the Sunnis into Anbar,'' one expert \n     said of Anderson's war-game scenario. ``Well, what does that \n     really mean? How many tens of thousands of people are going \n     to get killed before all the surviving Sunnis are in Anbar?'' \n     He questioned whether that result would prove acceptable to a \n     pro-withdrawal U.S. public.\n       White, speaking at a recent symposium on Iraq, addressed \n     the possibility of unpalatable withdrawal consequences by \n     paraphrasing Winston Churchill's famous statement about \n     democracy. ``I posit that withdrawal from Iraq is the worst \n     possible option, except for all the others.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a premature withdrawal would have severe \nconsequences, all of which would pose severe risks. Clearly, we should \nallow General Petraeus's plan time to succeed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as I noted previously, by setting the aside \nthe Defense authorization bill because he lost a vote to withdraw our \ntroops, the Majority Leader left important business for our military \nundone. Recently, the Senate passed parts of the bill--a pay raise and \n``wounded warriors'' provisions--but more needs to be done.\n  For instance, the Defense authorization bill should be the vehicle \nfor setting our national security priorities, one of which is how we \nshould deal with antisatellite weapons the Chinese could use against \nus.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that an article on China's space \nweapons that appeared in the July 23 Wall Street Journal be inserted \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 23, 2007]\n\n                         China's Space Weapons\n\n                         (By Ashley J. Tellis)\n\n       On Jan. 11, 2007, a Chinese medium-range ballistic missile \n     slammed into an aging weather satellite in space. The \n     resulting collision not only marked Beijing's first \n     successful anti-satellite (ASAT) test but, in the eyes of \n     many, also a head-on collision with the Bush administration's \n     space policies.\n       As one analyst phrased it, U.S. policy has compelled \n     China's leaders to conclude ``that only a display of \n     Beijing's power to launch . . . an arms race would bring \n     Washington to the table to hear their concerns.'' This view, \n     which is widespread in the U.S. and elsewhere, misses the \n     point: China's ASAT demonstration was not a protest against \n     the Bush administration, but rather part of a maturing \n     strategy designed to counter the overall military superiority \n     of the U.S.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, Chinese strategists have \n     been cognizant of the fact that the U.S. is the only country \n     in the world with the capacity--and possibly the intention--\n     to thwart China's rise to great power status. They also \n     recognize that Beijing will be weak militarily for some time \n     to come, yet must be prepared for a possible war with America \n     over Taiwan or, in the longer term, over what Aaron Friedberg \n     once called ``the struggle for mastery in Asia.'' How the \n     weaker can defeat the stronger, therefore, becomes the \n     central problem facing China's military strategy.\n       Chinese strategists have struggled to find ways of solving \n     this conundrum ever since the dramatic demonstration of \n     American prowess in Operation Desert Storm. And after \n     carefully analyzing U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf, \n     Kosovo and Afghanistan, they believe they have uncovered a \n     significant weakness.\n       The advanced military might of the U.S. is inordinately \n     dependent on a complex network of space-based command, \n     control, communications, and computer-driven intelligence, \n     surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities that enables \n     American forces to detect different kinds of targets and \n     exchange militarily relevant information. This network is key \n     to the success of American combat operations. These assets, \n     however, are soft and defenseless; while they bestow on the \n     American military definite asymmetric advantages, they are \n     also the source of deep vulnerability. Consequently, Chinese \n     strategists concluded that any effort to defeat the U.S. \n     should aim not at its fundamental strength--its capacity to \n     deliver overwhelming conventional firepower precisely from \n     long distances--but rather at its Achilles' heel, namely, its \n     satellites and their related ground installations.\n       Consistent with this calculus, China has pursued, for over \n     a decade now, a variety of space warfare programs, which \n     include direct attack and directed-energy weapons, electronic \n     attack, and computer-network and ground-attack systems. These \n     efforts are aimed at giving China the capacity to attack U.S. \n     space systems comprehensively because, in Chinese \n     calculations, this represents the best way of ``leveling the \n     playing field'' in the event of a future conflict.\n       The importance of space denial for China's operational \n     success implies that its counterspace investments, far from \n     being bargaining chips aimed at creating a peaceful space \n     regime, in fact represent its best hope for prevailing \n     against superior American military power. Because having this \n     capacity is critical to Chinese security, Beijing will not \n     entertain any arms-control regime that requires it to trade \n     away its space-denial capabilities. This would only further \n     accentuate the military advantages of its competitors. For \n     China to do otherwise would be to condemn its armed forces to \n     inevitable defeat in any encounter with American power.\n       This is why arms-control advocates are wrong even when they \n     are right. Any ``weaponization'' of space will indeed be \n     costly and especially dangerous to the U.S., which relies \n     heavily on space for military superiority, economic growth \n     and strategic stability. Space arms-control advocates are \n     correct when they emphasize that advanced powers stand to \n     gain disproportionately from any global regime that protects \n     their space assets. Yet they are wrong when they insist that \n     such a regime is attainable and, therefore, ought to be \n     pursued.\n       Weaker but significant challengers, like China, simply \n     cannot permit the creation of such a space sanctuary because \n     of its deleterious consequences for their particular \n     interests. Consequently, even though a treaty protecting \n     space assets would be beneficial to Washington, its specific \n     costs to Beijing--in the context of executing China's \n     national military strategy--would be remarkably high.\n       Beijing's attitude toward space arms control will change \n     only given a few particular developments. China might acquire \n     the capacity to defeat the U.S. despite America's privileged \n     access to space. Or China's investments in counterspace \n     technology might begin to yield diminishing returns because \n     the U.S. consistently nullifies these capabilities through \n     superior technology and operational practices. Or China's own \n     dependence on space for strategic and economic reasons might \n     intensify to the point where the threat posed by any American \n     offensive counterspace programs exceed the benefits accruing \n     to Beijing's own comparable efforts. Or the risk of conflict \n     between a weaker China and any other superior military power, \n     such as the U.S., disappears entirely.\n       Since these conditions will not be realized anytime soon, \n     Washington should certainly discuss space security with \n     Beijing, but, for now, it should not expect that negotiation \n     will yield any successful agreements. Instead, the U.S. \n     should accelerate investments in solutions that enhance the \n     security of its space assets, in addition to developing its \n     own offensive counterspace capabilities. These avenues--as \n     the Bush administration has correctly recognized--offer the \n     promise of protecting American interests in space and \n     averting more serious threats to its global primacy.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I asked that this article be printed in the Record because \nit is a wake-up call to a new threat we need to take seriously. By \nsetting aside the Defense authorization bill, we missed an opportunity \nto deal with this threat from China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10599-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10599-S10600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nproposed legislation to revise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978 to facilitate the electronic surveillance of targets \nreasonably believed to be outside the United States in order to obtain \nforeign intelligence information relating to international terrorism. \nWhen the act was passed in 1978, communications outside the United \nStates were characteristically transmitted via satellite and were not \ncovered by the act which applied to wires. In the intervening 29 years, \nsuch communications now travel by wire and are covered by the act.\n  The civil and constitutional rights of U.S. persons would ordinarily \nnot be involved in electronic surveillance of targets outside the \nUnited States. If persons inside the United States were surveilled \nwhile targeting outside the United States, then the minimization \nprocedures would reasonably protect\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\ncivil and constitutional rights of persons inside the United States.\n  As the Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell, outlined \nthe current threat, there is an urgent need to enact this legislation \npromptly, certainly before the Congress adjourns for the August recess. \nSuch modifications to FISA should have been enacted long ago and \nlegislation has been pending for months as proposed by Senator Dianne \nFeinstein and myself.\n  I am concerned by provisions of the proposed legislation which would \ngive extensive authority to the Attorney General. Regrettably, Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales does not enjoy the confidence of many, if not most, \nMembers of Congress. There is in the Congress generally considerable \nskepticism about the administration's Terrorist Surveillance Program \nbecause it was kept secret for so long and concerns continue to be \nexpressed that some portions have still not been adequately explained \nto the public, even where that might be done consistent with national \nsecurity.\n  There has been considerable discussion among Members of the Senate \nraising at a minimum serious concerns and, beyond that, objections to \ngiving Attorney General Gonzales any additional, even if temporary, \nauthority.\n  Discussions have been undertaken with the Director of National \nIntelligence to substitute his position for that of the Attorney \nGeneral; or, in the alternative, to substitute the Secretary of \nHomeland Security or some other official outside of the Department of \nJustice who has been confirmed by the Senate.\n  I am putting these concerns on the record now so that they may be \nconsidered and resolved at the earliest time so that legislation can be \nconcluded before Congress adjourns for the August recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10600-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               REMEMBERING GEORGE EDWARD ``SKIP'' PROSSER\n\n Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of George \nEdward ``Skip'' Prosser, head coach of the Wake Forest University \nbasketball team.\n  As a Demon Deacon alumni myself, I join the entire Wake Forest \nUniversity community in mourning his untimely passing.\n  I knew Skip personally. Skip was a friend of mine. And before I \nmention many of his accomplishments as a basketball coach, perhaps \nSkip's most admirable achievement in life was that he was a good \nhusband and good dad.\n  When I first heard the news of Skip's passing, my first thoughts were \nnot of basketball but of his wife Nancy and his sons, Scott and Mark. \nMy heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to Skip's family and to the \nWake Forest community that adored him.\n  Coach Prosser had countless basketball accomplishments, and as I \nstand here today, I can only scratch the surface of what he has \nachieved.\n  When he joined Wake Forest University for the 2001 to 2002 season, \nafter successful coaching at Loyola, Maryland, and Xavier, he added a \nmuch needed spark to our basketball program that yielded immediate \nsuccess.\n  Coach Prosser is the only coach in NCAA history to take three \ndifferent schools to the NCAA Tournament in his first season at each of \nthose schools.\n  In his first four seasons coaching at Wake Forest, Coach Prosser led \nthe Demon Deacons to the NCAA tournament, and in 2003 he led the team \nto its first outright regular season ACC title in over 40 years.\n  In the 2004 to 2005 season, Coach Prosser's Demon Deacons rose to No. \n1 in the national rankings for the first time in school history.\n  One of his most impressive statistics was his career wins percentage \nof .666 that is among the highest winning percentages of active \ncoaches.\n  More impressive, however, is the statement Coach Prosser often made \nabout his personal coaching record. It personified the kind of man Skip \nwas. When his record was applauded, he often responded by saying, ``I \ndon't have a career record. The players won those games.''\n  In addition to the honor and praise Coach Prosser got for his \nachievements on the court, his work off the court also deserved high \nmarks.\n  Coach Prosser always emphasized that academic success was the first \npriority for his athletes. In fact, every senior on Coach Prosser's \nteam graduated with a diploma in 4 years.\n  The Wake Forest student body embraced him as one of their own because \nhe took every opportunity to spend time with them--frequently walking \nthrough the Wake Forest Quad, talking with students, and game after \ngame filling our home basketball coliseum with Demon Deacon pride.\n  Skip Prosser will be missed. He was an outstanding man who brought a \ncommunity together through the game he so loved.\n  Again, I send my deepest condolences to Skip's family, his athletes, \nhis fans, and his friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10600-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING WEYERHAEUSER CORPORATION\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nWeyerhaeuser Corporation for its assistance in the relief efforts and \nthe rebuilding of the gulf coast that was devastated by Hurricane \nKatrina in August of 2005. This outstanding company has gone well \nbeyond the call of duty, truly exemplifying community service.\n  Weyerhaeuser was incorporated in 1900 and is one of the world's \nlargest integrated forest product companies. Headquartered in Federal \nWay, WA, Weyerhaeuser employs over 49,000 people in 18 countries. In \n2005, Weyerhaeuser recorded sales of $22.6 billion and managed more \nthan 6.5 million acres of timberland in nine States.\n  On November 29, 2006, Weyerhaeuser received the Ron Brown Award, the \nonly Presidential award to honor companies ``for their exemplary \nquality of their relationships with employees and communities.'' The \nRon Brown Award, originally established by President Bill Clinton, is \nnamed after the late Secretary of Commerce who believed that \n``businesses do well by doing good.''\n  I am honored to have such a dedicated company operating in \nMississippi in places such as Magnolia, Philadelphia, Richland, \nColumbus and Bruce. Weyerhaeuser has been operating in Mississippi \nsince 1956 with approximately 1,700 employees at 14 locations, as well \nas 776,000 acres of timberland.\n  To date, over 300 employees and retirees from across the United \nStates have volunteered more than 42,000 hours of their time, helped \nrebuild more than 50 homes, and contributed more than $2.8 million for \ndisaster relief. Weyerhaeuser has a generous policy of allowing \nemployees 2 to 4 weeks of paid leave to help volunteer in the \nrebuilding efforts of the gulf coast.\n  The people touched by Weyerhaeuser's response say it best. As one \nfamily wrote in response to help from Weyerhaeuser volunteers, \n``Because of all your efforts, we are home! Words cannot truly express \nthe outpouring of love we have received. We are eternally grateful to \nour Weyerhaeuser family.''\n  The high caliber of Weyerhaeuser employees can be seen in their \ncomments after volunteering on the gulf coast. One man noted, ``The \ndays were long and hot, the work was intense, but the rewards were \nimmeasurable. This has been an experience I won't soon forget.'' \nAnother volunteer employee commented, ``This experience was such a \nblessing. I got so much more from it than I felt I gave.'' One \nWeyerhaeuser retiree said, ``Having once more the opportunity to work \nside by side with other Weyerhaeuser employees and retirees made me \nrealize anew why I enjoyed working for Weyerhaeuser so much. It's all \nabout the people and the values the company ascribes to. Thanks \nagain.'' Testimonies such as these speak volumes about Weyerhaeuser's \ndedication to its employees and others.\n  I cannot thank the company enough for the work they have done and \ncontinue to do. It is truly deserving of such a prestigious award, and \nI am delighted to see Weyerhaeuser's efforts have been \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10600-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10600-S10601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL NIGHT OUT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the statewide \neffort my great State of New Mexico will put forth for the National \nNight Out. National Night Out is a community event\n\n[[Page S10601]]\n\ndesigned to bring awareness to preventing crime while building \npartnerships between communities and local law enforcement agencies. \nCrime is not limited to urban areas anymore; it affects every person in \nevery town, big and small. Communities need to be proactive in fighting \nit. National Night Out is a great step locals can take to curb violence \nand crime in their areas.\n  Activities for the night out include barbeques, block parties, \ndowntown rallies and townhall meetings and vary by community; each \nevent in an attempt to gain support for local law enforcement and \ncreate camaraderie amongst citizens. When communities come together, \nthey can do great things, even fight crime. Some New Mexico communities \nparticipating in National Night Out are Albuquerque, Belen, Bernalillo, \nBosque Farms, Carlsbad, Gallup, Isleta, Jal, Las Cruces, Los Lunas, all \nof Sandoval County, Santa Fe, and Truth or Consequences. Each town will \ncelebrate with its own flair, and each night out will succeed in bring \nawareness to crime in their area.\n  I applaud these neighborhoods for being proactive in their local \nfight on crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10601-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   15TH ANNUAL NAVAJO FAIR AND RODEO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, almost 40 years ago, the Ramah \nNavajo School Board was incorporated in New Mexico as a means to \nprovide education, health, job training, and social services to the \nRamah Navajo people. This private, not-for-profit group was created in \n1970 and has since strengthened the community through its involvement. \nAs they have done for the past 15 years, the School Board organizes a \nfair and rodeo as a celebration of Ramah Navajo culture and the culture \nof New Mexico.\n  To name a few of the events this year, there is a Pow Wow, kid's \ncarnival, traditional dance performances, and roping competitions. I \nwant to recognize the Ramah Navajo School Board, Inc., and their \nefforts to promote these public events, specifically the landmark of \nthe 15th annual Ramah Navajo Fair and Rodeo. These events strengthen \nbonds in the community with the people and their traditions.\n  Because of their location and separation from the contiguous Navajo \nNation, the Ramah Navajo community stands on a mission of self-\ndetermination and self-reliance, setting up programs like the School \nBoard to deal with all their people's needs. The Ramah Navajo School \nBoard helped create the first Indian-controlled contract school in the \nUnited States, currently educating 600 students.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of the country how the Ramah \nNavajo people have kept their cultural identity strong while building \non their community through events like this fair and rodeo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10601-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DELORES TOLLEFSON\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, most of us look back on our high \nschool years as a wonderful time of learning, growing and maturing.\n  And also, most of us remember fondly one special teacher that gave us \na nudge or an encouraging pat on the back or maybe even some discipline \nat the right moment.\n  For me, that teacher was Delores Tollefson. She was a big presence in \na small school. She was the English teacher who virtually did it all in \nmy small school of 40 students in all four high school grades. She put \non all the class plays; she helped run the school newspaper and \nspearheaded the school annual; and she taught speech and English, and \nmuch more.\n  But most important to me was that she had the patience to see \npotential in her students. At just the right time she would offer \neither encouragement or disapproval and say, ``You can do that, you've \ngot a lot of talent,'' or ``You're better than that. Come on--get busy \nand work up to your potential,'' or ``Great job!''\n  Most of us who were fortunate enough to have a teacher that saw \npotential and pushed us to reach it seldom took the time to say thank \nyou.\n  This year marks the 90th birthday of Delores Tollefson and I want to \npay tribute to a wonderful teacher who affected my life in a very \npositive way. It is time to say a very special ``Thank you.''\n  Happy Birthday, Delores Tollefson! And thank you for dedicating your \nlife to teaching young people. It made a big difference in the life of \nthis former student.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10601-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING SUPERLATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize an outstanding \nsmall business from my home State of Maine that has established itself \nas one of New England's leading information technology engineering \nfirms. Headquartered in East Machias, Superlative Technologies Inc., \nSuprTEK, provides effective information technology solutions and \nengineering services to the diverse clientele it has established during \nits 11 years in operation.\n  As an 8(a) and HUBZone certified small business, SuprTEK supplies \nprivate industries, as well as local, State, and Federal Government, \nwith support solutions in a wide variety of areas, including \ninformation assurance, network management, systems development, \noperation management, wireless solutions, and enterprise architecture. \nThe 8(a) and HUBZone programs often allow small businesses, such as \nSuprTEK, greater access to Federal Government opportunities. The \nHUBZone program, in particular, benefits rural communities by ensuring \nthe business itself, and a portion of its employees, reside in the \nHUBZone. By enabling each client to utilize its support solutions \neffectively and efficiently, SuprTEK demonstrates its strong commitment \nto improving its clients' businesses. Employing highly qualified \nbusiness and technical specialists averaging almost 10 years of \nexperience, SuprTEK demands high standards for themselves and their \nclients.\n  SuprTEK has consistently fought to bring jobs and economic vitality \nto the Machias region and all of downeast Maine. With the closing of \nthe Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station in Cutler, and fears \nof the loss's effect on the local economy, SuprTEK was awarded a \ncontract to build a first-of-its-kind Navy Human Resources Benefits \nCall Center in July of 2001. The employees at SuprTEK provided health, \ninsurance, and retirement assistance to nearly 40,000 U.S. Navy \ncivilian employees throughout the Northeast in 2001. Currently, 30 \nemployees aid the full 186,000 member Navy civilian workforce \nworldwide. In May 2005, SuprTEK completed the construction of a new and \nimproved facility in East Machias to house its call center. And in \nOctober of 2006, the U.S. Navy announced a new contract for SuprTEK's \ncall center to continue providing these vital resources to the Navy \nthrough 2011.\n  In 2005, the Army Surface Deployment and Distribution Command \npresented SuprTEK with its Small Disadvantaged Business Outstanding \nAchievement Award. This award is emblematic of the U.S. military's \nappreciation for the work that SuprTEK has done and continues to do. \nHaving visited SuprTEK myself, I have seen firsthand the dedication and \ncommitment of the employees at SuprTEK and the tremendous impact that \nthey are having on the lives of the Navy's civilian employees. \nFurthermore, SuprTEK plans to expand its operation by creating a \nbusiness park that would also include low-cost office space for light \nindustry, such as manufacturers of clothing and household items. This \nis a welcome and reassuring sign for a region whose prosperity has \nsuffered. I thank everyone at SuprTEK for the magnificent job they have \ndone so far, and wish them luck in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10601-4", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10601-S10602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DECLARATION OF A NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELATIVE TO THE THREAT IN LEBANON \n    POSED BY THE ACTIONS OF CERTAIN PERSONS TO UNDERMINE LEBANON'S \n               LEGITIMATE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS--PM 23\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n\n[[Page S10602]]\n\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as \namended (50 U.S.C. 1701 et. seq.)

A bill to require a comprehensive nuclear posture review, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Collins, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Casey to \nintroduce legislation to authorize a comprehensive review of our \nnuclear weapons policy and posture.\n  Before we ramp up funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead \nprogram as the administration has requested, we should have a clear, \nbipartisan consensus on the role nuclear weapons will play in our \nnational security strategy and the impact they will have on our nuclear \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  The Nuclear Policy and Posture Review Act of 2007 does three things.\n  First, it authorizes the President to conduct a nuclear policy review \nto consider a range of possible roles of nuclear weapons in U.S. \nsecurity policy. The administration may reach out to outside experts \nand conduct public hearings to get a wide range of views. The policy \nreview will provide options and recommendations for a nuclear posture \nreview.\n  This report is due on September 1, 2009.\n  Second, following the completion of the nuclear policy review, it \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive review \nof the nuclear posture of the U.S. to clarify U.S. nuclear deterrence \npolicy and strategy. This report is due March 1, 2010.\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\n  Finally, it zeros out funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead \nprogram until the policy review and posture review reports have been \nsubmitted to Congress.\n  In his testimony on March 29, 2007, before the House Energy & Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee, former Senator Sam Nunn, Chairman of \nNuclear Threat Initiative, noted that:\n\n       On the [Reliable Replacement Warhead] itself, if Congress \n     gives a green light to this program in our current world \n     environment, I believe that this will be: misunderstood by \n     our allies; exploited by our adversaries; complicate our work \n     to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons and . . . \n     make resolution of the Iran and North Korea challenges all \n     the more difficult.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  Indeed, I remain deeply concerned about this administration's nuclear \nweapons policy.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have worked with colleagues in the House and \nSenate to stop the re-opening of the nuclear door and the development \nof new nuclear weapons.\n  Together, we have eliminated funding for the Advanced Concepts \nInitiative, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, and the Modern Pit \nFacility.\n  These were consequential victories but the fight is far from over.\n  For fiscal year 2008, the administration requested $118 million for \nthe Reliable Replacement Warhead program; $88 million in the National \nNuclear Security administration's budget and $30 million in the \nDepartment of Defense's budget.\n  These funds would be used for Phase 2A activities: design definition \nand cost study.\n  This would represent approximately a four-fold increase over fiscal \nyear 2007 funding of $24.7 million.\n  The House, however, rejected the administration's request and zeroed \nout funding for RRW in its fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations bill. In its report accompanying the \nlegislation, the House cited the lack of a definitive nuclear weapons \npolicy review as a key reason for withholding funding for what will be \na costly new nuclear warhead program. It stated:\n\n       The lack of any definitive analysis or strategic assessment \n     defining the objectives of a future nuclear stockpile makes \n     it impossible to weigh the relative merits of investing \n     billions of taxpayer dollars in new nuclear weapon production \n     activities when the United States is facing the problem of \n     having too large a stockpile as a Cold War legacy. Currently, \n     there exists no convincing rationale for maintaining the \n     large number of existing Cold War nuclear weapons, much less \n     producing additional warheads, or for the DoD requirements \n     that drive the management of the DOE nuclear weapons complex.\n\n  While the Senate bill did not follow suit, it did cut $22 million \nfrom the administration's request, for a total of $66 million, and \nrestricted activities to Phase 2A.\n  I believe we can match the House's action and this bill would do just \nthat.\n  The administration is clearly getting nervous about the prospects for \nfunding for RRW.\n  On Wednesday, the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and State released \na 4-page white paper on nuclear weapons strategy: ``National Security \nand Nuclear Weapons: Maintaining Deterrence in the 21st Century''. It \naffirmed the importance of maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent and \nsought to justify funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. \nAmong other things, it stated that the Reliable Replacement Warhead \nprogram is critical to sustaining long-term confidence in the nuclear \nstockpile and will help reduce the stockpile and move us away from \nnuclear testing; and any delay to the program will force the U.S. to \nmaintain a larger stockpile, invest in costly and risky Life Extension \nPrograms, and increase the likelihood that we will have to resume \nnuclear testing.\n  These arguments simply do not stand up to scrutiny.\n  Indeed the evidence clearly shows that there is no need to rush \nforward with increased funding for RRW. Let us take a close look at the \nstatus of our nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  Are there currently problems with the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear arsenal?\n  No, for each of the past 11 years the Secretary of Energy and \nSecretary of Defense have certified that the nuclear stockpile is safe \nand reliable.\n  Has the Pentagon asked for a new warhead for new missions?\n  No, there is no new military requirement to replace existing, well-\ntested warheads.\n  What about the plutonium pit, the ``trigger'' of a nuclear weapon? In \npast years, the administration requested funding for a Modern Pit \nFacility that could build up to 450 pits a year arguing that the pits \nin our current stockpile were reaching the end of their life-span.\n\n  Is our stockpile at risk due to aging pits?\n  No, a December 2006 report by the National Laboratories showed that \nplutonium pits have a life-span of at least 85 years, and possibly up \nto 100 years.\n  That report validated Congressional action to eliminate funding for \nthe Modern Pit Facility. I am pleased that the administration listened \nand did not request funding for the facility in fiscal year 2007 and \nfiscal year 2008.\n  Are we at risk for resuming nuclear testing?\n  No, as I have argued our stockpile is safe and secure and will \nclearly remain so for the foreseeable future.\n  If the likelihood of resuming nuclear testing is increasing it is due \nto the fact that the administration has, in past years, requested \nfunding to lower the time to test readiness at the Nevada test site \nfrom 24-36 months to 18 months and, above all, refused to support \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT.\n  What about costs? I find it interesting that the administration would \ncite the costs of successful Life Extension Programs as a reason to \nramp up funding for the RRW.\n  Has the administration shared with us what it will cost to replace \nthe warhead on our deployed nuclear arsenal with a new Reliable \nReplacement Warhead?\n  The answer is no. The administration has remained silent about when \nthe supposed cost savings from RRW will ultimately kick in.\n  In fact, the development of a new nuclear warhead will likely add \nbillions of dollars to the American taxpayer's bill at a time when, as \nnoted above, the stockpile is safe and reliable. As the House Energy \nand Water Appropriations report argued:\n\n       Under any realistic future U.S. nuclear defense scenario, \n     the existing legacy stockpile will continue to provide the \n     nation's nuclear deterrent for well over the next two to \n     three decades. The effort by the NNSA to apply urgency to \n     developing a significant production capacity for the RRW \n     while lacking any urgency to rationalize an oversized complex \n     appears to mean simply more costs to the American taxpayer.\n\n  Before we move any further with this program which would add a new \nwarhead to the stockpile, we should have a better understanding of the \nrole nuclear weapons will play in our security policy in a post-Cold \nWar and post 9/11 world.\n  If we as a country are going to move away from massive stockpiles of \nnuclear weapons and explore more conventional alternatives, does it \nmake sense to add a new warhead to the stockpile?\n  If we are committed to strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, what impact \nwould a Reliable Replacement Warhead have on those efforts?\n  If the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the Life Extension Program \ncan certify the safety and the reliability of our existing nuclear \nstockpile, should we shift resources from RRW to more pressing \nconcerns?\n  It is common sense to ask these questions and engage in comprehensive \nreview and debate about these options before we make the decision on \nmanufacturing new warheads.\n  As it stands now, we are addressing this issue backwards and behind \nclosed doors.\n  That is, we are rushing to develop a new warhead without an \nunderstanding of the role it will play in our nuclear weapons policy \nand national security strategy and without public input that will lead \nto a bipartisan policy.\n  Let us be clear: a rushed, four page white paper is simply not \nsufficient to answer these questions and make decisions about \ndeveloping new nuclear warheads.\n  The administration has promised a more detailed report but its haste \nto put out this paper suggests that it is more intent on rushing the \ndevelopment of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program than in taking \na sober,\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\nunbiased look at our nuclear weapons policy and posture.\n  A lack of a substantive debate and review means we are not paying \nsufficient attention to the potential negative consequences of RRW.\n  Speeding up the development of a new nuclear warhead may send the \nwrong message to Iran; North Korea; and other would-be nuclear weapon \nstates and encourage the very proliferation we are trying to prevent.\n  What to us may appear to be a safer, more reliable weapon could \nappear to others to be a new weapon with new missions and a violation \nof the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n  The American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a \nreport last month acknowledging that a Reliable Replacement Warhead \n``could lead to a final selected design that is certifiable without a \nnuclear test.''\n  Yet, the report also concluded that absent a comprehensive review of \nnuclear policy and stockpile needs, the purpose and intention of RRW \ncould be widely misinterpreted abroad.\n  Pointing out that there has been no high level statement about \nnuclear weapons policy since the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, it called \non the administration to develop a bipartisan policy on the future of \nnuclear weapons and nuclear weapons policy before moving ahead with \nRRW. It stated:\n\n       In the absence of a clear nuclear posture, many \n     interpretations are possible [about U.S. nuclear weapons \n     policy] and the lack of a national understanding and \n     consensus on the role of U.S. nuclear weapons puts any new \n     approach at considerable risk at home and abroad. For \n     example, an RRW plan that emphasizes the goal of sustaining \n     the deterrent without nuclear testing could be perceived \n     quite differently from one that focuses on future flexibility \n     to develop and deploy nuclear weapons for new military \n     mission.\n\n  It goes on to state:\n\n       . . . nuclear weapons are ultimately an instrument of \n     policy and strategy rather than of war fighting, and only \n     with the leadership of the president can there be major \n     changes in that instrument.\n\n  Unfortunately we have not seen such leadership from this \nadministration.\n  Because it pursued the development of low-yield nuclear weapons and a \nRobust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, because it sought to lower the time-\nto-test readiness at the Nevada test site from 24-26 months to 18 \nmonths, because it sought to build a Modern Pit Facility that could \nproduce up to 450 pits a year, this administration has lost the \ncredibility to take a fresh and open look at nuclear weapons policy and \nposture.\n  Only a new administration, free from the constraints of the heated \ndebates of the past, will have the authority to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of our nuclear weapons policy and posture.\n  A bipartisan consensus on this policy is essential. It will let the \nworld know exactly where we stand on these important issues and help \nclear up any confusion about our intentions.\n  Friend and foe alike will know that regardless of who holds power in \nCongress or the White House, the role of nuclear weapons in our \nsecurity strategy will not change.\n  It will strengthen our efforts to convince other states to forego the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons and make the world safer from the threat \nof nuclear war.\n  I believe that bipartisan policy is beginning to emerge.\n  In a January 4, 2007 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, ``A World Free \nof Nuclear Weapons'', George Schultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, \nand Sam Nunn laid out a compelling vision for a world free of the \nthreat of nuclear war.\n  They laid a set of common sense steps the U.S. and other nuclear \nweapon states can take to make this happen including: taking nuclear \nweapons off high-alert status; substantially reducing the size of \nnuclear stockpiles; eliminating short-ranged nuclear weapons; ratifying \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; securing all stocks of weapons, \nweapons-usable plutonium, and highly enriched uranium around the world; \ngetting control of the uranium enrichment process; stopping production \nof fissile material for nuclear weapons globally; resolving regional \nconfrontations that encourage the development of nuclear weapons.\n  They conclude:\n\n       Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear \n     weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal \n     would be, and would be perceived as, a bold initiative \n     consistent with America's moral heritage. The effort could \n     have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future \n     generations. Without that bold vision, the actions will not \n     be perceived as fair or urgent. Without the actions, the \n     vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible.\n\n  We should pay close attention to these words.\n  In conclusion, let me say that there is a big difference between an \nRRW program that increases the reliability of the existing stockpile \nand one that leads to a resumption of nuclear testing.\n  Congress should ask the tough questions to ensure that this is not a \nback door to new nuclear weapons with new missions and new rounds of \ntesting.\n  I firmly believe we should zero out for the Reliable Replacement \nWarhead program until the next administration takes a serious look at \nour nuclear weapons programs and issues a bipartisan policy on the size \nof the future stockpile, testing, and nuclear nonproliferation efforts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto craft that sensible, bipartisan nuclear weapons policy that will \nmake Americans safe and allow us to reclaim a leadership role in the \nfight against nuclear proliferation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to expand the definition of firefighter to include \napprentices and trainees, regardless of age or duty limitations; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nChristopher Kangas Fallen Firefighter Apprentice Act, a bill designed \nto correct a flaw in the current definition of ``firefighter'' under \nthe Public Safety Officer Benefits Act.\n  On May 4, 2002, 14-year-old Christopher Kangas was struck by a car \nand killed while he was riding his bicycle in Brookhaven, PA. The local \nauthorities later confirmed that Christopher was out on his bike that \nday for an important reason: Chris Kangas was a junior firefighter, and \nhe was responding to a fire emergency.\n  Under Pennsylvania law, 14- and 15-year-olds such as Christopher are \npermitted to serve as volunteer junior firefighters. While they are not \nallowed to operate heavy machinery or enter burning buildings, the law \npermits them to fill a number of important support roles, such as \nproviding first aid. In addition, the junior firefighter program is an \nimportant recruitment tool for fire stations throughout the \nCommonwealth. In fact, prior to his death Christopher had received 58 \nhours of training that would have served him well when he graduated \nfrom the junior program.\n  It is clear to me that Christopher Kangas was a firefighter killed in \nthe line of duty. Were it not for his status as a junior firefighter \nand his prompt response to a fire alarm, Christopher would still be \nalive today. Indeed, the Brookhaven Fire Department, Brookhaven \nBorough, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have all recognized \nChristopher as a fallen public safety officer and provided the \nappropriate death benefits to his family.\n  Yet, while those closest to the tragedy have recognized Christopher \nas a fallen firefighter, the Federal Government has not. The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, DOJ, determined that Christopher Kangas was not \neligible for benefits because he was not acting within a narrow range \nof duties at the time of his death that are the measured criteria to be \nconsidered a ``firefighter,'' and therefore, was not a ``public safety \nofficer'' for purposes of the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act. In \norder to be eligible for benefits under the Public Safety Officer \nBenefits Act, an officer's death must be considered the ``direct and \nproximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.'' \nAlthough the United States Code includes firefighters in the definition \nof ``public safety officer'' and specifies a firefighter as ``an \nindividual serving as an officially-recognized or designated member of \na legally-organized volunteer fire department;'' it offers no \ndefinition of ``line of duty''. DOJ had to defer to an arbitrarily \nnarrow definition of ``line of duty,'' as described in the Code of \nFederal Regulations that restricts activities to the ``suppression of \nfires.'' DOJ decided that the only people who qualify as firefighters \nare those who play the starring role of operating a hose on a ladder or \nentering a burning building. According to this interpretation, those, \nsuch as junior firefighters, who play the essential supporting roles of \ndirecting traffic, performing first aid, or dispatching fire vehicles \ndo not contribute to the act of suppressing the fire.\n  Furthermore, Christopher's family has been pursuing this benefit \nthrough our court system. The U.S. Federal Claims Court ruled in favor \nof the Kangas family ordering the Department of Justice to pay \n$250,000. However, the Department appealed the decision which the \nAppeals Court for the Federal Circuit upheld by concluding the Court of \nFederal Claims' decision failed to defer to DOJ's interpretation of \n``firefighter.''\n  Any firefighter will tell you that there are many important roles to \nplay in fighting a fire beyond operating the hoses and ladders. \nFirefighting is a team effort, and everyone in the Brookhaven Fire \nDepartment viewed young Christopher as a full member of their team.\n  As a result of this DOJ determination, Christopher's family cannot \nreceive a $267,000 Federal line-of-duty benefit. In addition, \nChristopher is barred from taking his rightful place on the National \nFallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. For a young man who \ndreamed of being a firefighter and gave his life rushing to a fire, \nkeeping him off of the memorial is a grave injustice.\n  The bill I introduce today will ensure that the Federal Government \nwill recognize Christopher Kangas and others like him as firefighters. \nThe bill clarifies that all firefighters will be recognized as such \n``regardless of age, status as an apprentice or trainee, or duty \nrestrictions imposed because of age or status as an apprentice or \ntrainee.'' The bill applies retroactively back to May 4, 2002, the date \nof Christopher Kangas' death.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and I \nyield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, by Mr. Hatch, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1919. A bill to establish trade enforcement priorities for the \nUnited States, to strengthen the provisions relating to trade remedies, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Hatch to \nintroduce the Trade Enforcement Act of 2007. This bill will provide the \nadministration additional tools, resources, and accountability to \nenforce international trade agreements abroad and domestic trade remedy \nlaws here at home.\n  Over 400 years ago, William Shakespeare wrote ``The law hath not been \ndead, though it hath slept.'' The same could be said of our trade \nenforcement laws today.\n  The administration has many tools at its disposal to enforce \ninternational trade agreements. It can file dispute settlement cases in \nthe World Trade Organization, WTO. It has Section 301 to fight market \naccess barriers. It has Special 301 to address intellectual property \nviolations abroad. It has Section 421 to remedy Chinese import surges \nthat cause injury here at home.\n  But having these rules on the books is not enough. We need to enforce \nthem.\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\n  There is a very real sense among Americans that our trading partners \ndo not play by the rules. And there is a very real sense that the U.S. \nGovernment is allowing them to get away with it.\n  That is why I am introducing the Trade Enforcement Act of 2007--to \nensure that the administration has the resources to enforce our \nexisting trade laws, to provide political accountability when it does \nnot, and to create new tools that address the enforcement priorities of \nAmerican farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service suppliers.\n  This legislation bolsters enforcement of U.S. trade agreements in \nthree important ways.\n  First, it requires the U.S. Trade Representative, USTR, to dedicate \nmore time to enforcement. The bill requires USTR to provide an annual \nreport to Congress identifying the most significant barriers to U.S. \ncompanies abroad and to take enforcement action to resolve them. It \nalso makes trade enforcement more accountable to Congress. The bill \nallows the Senate Finance Committee or the House Ways and Means \nCommittee to require USTR to identify a specific barrier in its annual \nreport. And, significantly, the bill creates a Senate-confirmed Chief \nEnforcement Officer at USTR to investigate and prosecute trade \nenforcement cases.\n  Second, the bill addresses serious concerns that have been raised \nabout the quality of recent World Trade Organization dispute settlement \ndecisions. It does so by establishing a commission of retired judges \nand international trade law experts to review the decisions and \ndetermine whether they impose obligations on the U.S. that are not \nfound in the text of the WTO agreements. The bill also prevents the \nadministration from changing a regulation to comply with an adverse WTO \ndecision until Congress receives the commission's report.\n  Third, the bill ensures that other U.S. government agencies do not \nuse foreign policy and other noneconomic rationales to block USTR from \ntaking tough enforcement actions. It clarifies that while USTR must \ncarefully consider any advice provided by the interagency trade \norganization established under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, it need \nnot, and shall not, seek approval of its actions from the organization.\n  The bill also bolsters enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws in four \nimportant ways.\n  First, the bill limits the President's discretion to deny relief in \nSection 421 cases to address Chinese import surges. This administration \nhas utterly failed to use this trade remedy as Congress intended. It \nhas denied relief in every case where the International Trade \nCommission, ITC, determined that relief was warranted. Our bill \nremedies this deficiency by requiring the President to proclaim any \nimport relief that the ITC recommends unless the President finds, in \nextraordinary cases, that the relief would seriously harm our national \nsecurity or would have an adverse impact on our economy that clearly \nand significantly outweighs the benefits. Congress may override the \neconomic determination and reinstate the ITC's decision if it enacts a \njoint resolution of disapproval.\n  Second, the bill makes it easier for U.S. companies to obtain relief \nfrom subsidized imports from certain countries. It clarifies that the \nCommerce Department may apply countervailing duties to nonmarket \neconomies like China. The Commerce Department has long taken the \nposition that our countervailing duty laws do not apply to nonmarket \neconomies, and it has refused to do so until very recently. The bill \ncloses this loophole and eliminates any remaining uncertainty.\n  Third, the bill makes it easier for U.S. companies to obtain relief \nfrom subsidized and dumped imports from all countries by overriding the \nFederal Circuit's recent Bratsk decision. The bill provides that the \nITC must make its injury determinations in antidumping and \ncountervailing duty cases without regard to whether imports from other \ncountries are likely to replace imports from the country under \ninvestigation.\n  Fourth, the bill increases intellectual property expertise at the \nITC. It authorizes the ITC to appoint hearing officers, rather than \nadministrative law judges, ALJs, to take evidence and make initial \ndecisions in intellectual property investigations under Section 337 of \nthe Tariff Act of 1930. Unlike the current ALJs, the hearing officers \nwould be required to have technical expertise and experience in \nintellectual property law.\n  The overarching goal of this bill is, as Shakespeare might say, to \n``wake up'' our trade laws from their current slumber and ensure that \nthe administration enforces them to the fullest extent. Our farmers, \nranchers, and companies deserve nothing less.\n  I therefore hope that my colleagues will support the Trade \nEnforcement Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1920. A bill to award competitive grants to eligible partnerships \nto enable the partnerships to implement innovative strategies at the \nsecondary school level to improve student achievement and prepare at-\nrisk students for postsecondary education and the workforce; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Getting Retention and \n     Diplomas Up Among Today's Enrolled Students Act'' or the \n     ``GRADUATES Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since almost 90 percent of the fastest growing and best \n     paying jobs now require some postsecondary education, a \n     secondary school diploma and the skills to succeed in higher \n     education and the modern workplace are essential.\n       (2) Only \\1/3\\ of all high school students in the United \n     States graduate in 4 years prepared for a 4-year institution \n     of higher education. Another \\1/3\\ graduate, but without the \n     skills and qualifications necessary for success in higher \n     education or the workplace, and the rest will not graduate \n     from high school in 4 years, if at all.\n       (3) Dropouts from the class of 2006 will cost the United \n     States more that $309,000,000,000 in reduced earnings.\n       (4) The Nation's failure to meet the increasing demand for \n     skilled workers means that American companies cannot fill a \n     large number of jobs. 81 percent of American manufacturing \n     companies report experiencing a moderate to severe shortage \n     of qualified workers.\n       (5) International competition has made education a national \n     security issue. For example, the United States currently runs \n     a $30,000,000,000 advanced technology trade deficit with \n     China. Many other countries are developing the technology, \n     infrastructure, and knowledge base to export quality products \n     with inexpensive labor. The education system of the United \n     States should support critical thinking, creativity, and \n     innovative approaches to new opportunities, which are \n     commodities that cannot be outsourced.\n       (6) As the bar for success continues to be raised, the \n     responsibility to engender these attributes with progressive \n     programs and original models lies squarely with the education \n     system. It is imperative that the United States develop and \n     implement new, innovative approaches to fully prepare every \n     student for the 21st century.\n       (7) Realigning the education system to meet new, demanding \n     requirements and face intensifying competition requires \n     effective, systemic reform. Identifying effective, replicable \n     models that achieve this goal is a critical step towards \n     enhancing the prospects of all students entering the modern \n     workforce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the American Battlefield Protection Act of \n1996 to extend the authorization for that Act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nSenator Jeff Sessions and 14 of our Senate colleagues to introduce the \nCivil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2007. This bipartisan \nlegislation was recently introduced in the House by Congressmen Gary \nMiller of California and Bart Gordon of Tennessee and presently enjoys \nthe support of 26 Members of Congress.\n  Our bill is a straightforward, 5 year extension of the 2002 Civil War \nBattlefield Preservation Act. The purpose of this legislation remains \nthe same as when Congress first passed it: to preserve and protect \nnationally significant Civil War battlefields through conservation \neasements and fee-simple purchases of battlefield sites. In addition, \nthe legislation fosters partnerships among State and local governments, \nregional entities, and the private sector to preserve, conserve, and \nenhance nationally significant Civil War battlefields.\n  The legislation continues to protect private property rights by \nlimiting land acquisitions to willing sellers only. It also requires a \n50-50 match in order for projects to be eligible to receive Federal \nfunds. Finally, the program limits the effect on the burgeoning \nNational Park Service's maintenance backlog because non-Federal \nentities are responsible for the long-term maintenance of sites not \nwithin National Park Service boundaries.\n  In 1990, Congress established the Civil War Sites Advisory \ncommission, a blue-ribbon panel empowered to investigate the status of \nAmerica's remaining Civil War battlefields. Congress tasked the \ncommission with the mission of prioritizing these battlefields \naccording to their historic importance and the threats to their \nsurvival. The commission ultimately looked at the 10,000-plus battles \nand skirmishes of the Civil War and determined that 384 priority sites \nshould be preserved. The results of the report were released in 1993 \nand they were not encouraging.\n  The 1993 commission report recommended that Congress create an \nemergency program to save threatened Civil War battlefield land. The \nresult was the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program, which was \nfirst funded\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\nin fiscal year 1999 and originally authorized in 2002. To date, the \npreservation program has saved over 14,000 acres of land in 15 States.\n  The key to the success of the preservation program is that it \nachieves battlefield preservation through collaborative partnerships \nbetween State and local governments, the private sector and nonprofit \norganizations, such as the Civil War Preservation Trust.\n  But for the preservation program and its non-Federal partners, we \nwould have lost key sites from national shrines at Antietam. \nChancellorsville. Fredericksburg. Manassas. Harpers Ferry. Bentonville. \nMansfield. Champion Hill. Their names of these legendary battlegrounds \ncontinue to haunt us to this day. Had the Civil War Battlefield \nPreservation Program not been available as a tool to preserve \nthreatened battlefield land, these sites and others like them would \nhave surely been lost forever to commercial and residential \ndevelopment.\n  It is not every day you can visit battlefield sites and have an \nimmediate, direct connection with your ancestors. We must preserve \nthese sites so that future generations might see and touch the very \nplaces where so many sacrifices were made, by soldiers and civilians \nalike. We are a stronger, more diverse and free Nation because of these \nsacrifices.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the preservation program has \nenjoyed bipartisan, bicameral support since its inception. In 2002, \nprogram funding was authorized through the Civil War Battlefield \nPreservation Act at the level recommended by the Civil War Sites \nAdvisory Commission, $10 million a year. These Federal funds have, and \nwill continue to, leverage millions more in private and other \ncharitable donations; thereby increasing our ability to preserve more \nthreatened battlefield sites.\n  The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act has become an essential \ntool for protecting our nation's Civil War battlefields. I would urge \nmy colleagues in the Senate to reauthorize this important federal \nprogram. The clock is ticking against these threatened historical sites \nand we must keep the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program as a \nvaluable tool to preserve them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil War Battlefield \n     Preservation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Civil War battlefields provide a means for the people \n     of the United States to understand a tragic period in the \n     history of the United States.\n       (2) According to the Report on the Nation's Civil War \n     Battlefields, prepared by the Civil War Sites Advisory \n     Commission, and dated July 1993, of the 384 principal Civil \n     War battlefields--\n       (A) almost 20 percent are lost or fragmented;\n       (B) 17 percent are in poor condition; and\n       (C) 60 percent have been lost or are in imminent danger of \n     being fragmented by development and lost as coherent historic \n     sites.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to act quickly and proactively to preserve and protect \n     nationally significant Civil War battlefields through \n     conservation easements and fee-simple purchases of those \n     battlefields from willing sellers at fair market value;\n       (2) to create partnerships among State and local \n     governments, regional entities, and the private sector to \n     preserve, conserve, and enhance nationally significant Civil \n     War battlefields; and\n       (3) to prepare our Nation for the upcoming sesquicentennial \n     commemoration of the Civil War, 2011 through 2015, which is \n     expected to stimulate renewed interest in the conflict and \n     generate unprecedented visitation to preserved Civil War \n     battlegrounds.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION EXTENDED.\n\n       The American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 (16 U.S.C. \n     469k) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (d)(7)(A), by striking ``fiscal years \n     2004 through 2008'' and inserting ``fiscal years 2009 through \n     2013''; and\n       (2) in subsection (e), by striking ``September 30, 2008'' \n     and inserting ``September 30, 2013''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1922. A bill to apply basic contracting laws to the Transportation \nSecurity Administration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Snowe and I are introducing \nthe TSA Acquisition Reform Act of 2007 to repeal exemptions from \nFederal contracting laws that were granted to the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, TSA, after 9/11 in the rush to secure \nairports. Representative Carney has introduced identical legislation in \nthe House and I look forward to working with him to improve contracting \nat TSA.\n  TSA is one of the few Federal agencies and the only agency within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that is not subject to the same \nprocurement rules that every other Federal agency, including the \nDepartment of Defense, must abide.\n  Specifically, it is exempt from the Federal Acquisition Regulation, \nFAR, which covers every major procurement law and requires Federal \nagencies to provide for an open and competitive bidding process and \nsubmit contract information to the Federal Procurement Data System. \nTSA's exemption from the FAR was never meant to be permanent, and this \namendment would bring the agency in line with normal Federal \ncontracting rules.\n  TSA has a record of mismanaging contracts and wasting taxpayer \ndollars, and has been the subject of several DOT and DHS Inspector \nGeneral reports. For instance, in 2002, TSA, despite using FAR \nguidelines, issued a federally prohibited cost-plus-a-percentage \ncontract to Boeing to install explosive detection systems in airports. \nIn September 2004, the IG found that the initial $508 million contract \nballooned to $1.2 billion, that Boeing was paid $49 million in excess \nprofit, received $82 million to cover $39 million in costs, and \nultimately received a 210 percent return on its investment.\n  In 2005, the Washington Post reported on an audit by the Defense \nContract Audit Agency which showed that a contract issued to the \nPearson government solutions firm to recruit Federal passenger \nscreeners increased in cost from $104 million to $741 million in 9 \nmonths in part because TSA changed the scope of the contract to require \nPearson to use posh hotels, including the Waldorf Astoria, as \nrecruitment centers. TSA disputes this account, but cannot provide any \npaperwork to back it up. The article quoted Deputy DHS Secretary \nMichael Jackson as saying, ``Honestly, I have no memory of it.''\n  In 2004, the when the GAO wanted to review 21 TSA contracts, it \nliterally had to send staff to rummage through boxes of files to \nretrieve information that would otherwise have been in the Federal \nProcurement Data System.\n  As Chairman of the Small Business Committee, I am particular \nconcerned about TSA's inability to meet its small business contracting \ngoals. I am pleased that the 2007 DHS Appropriations bill applied the \nSmall Business Act to TSA, but small business owners won't truly \nbenefit because TSA is still exempt from basic contracting rules under \nthe FAR that helps them compete for Federal contracts. Although TSA's \nsmall business contracting goal is 23 percent annually, only 10.7 \npercent of its contracts went to small businesses in 2005. Analysis \nconducted by my staff suggest that the true figure is closer to 6 \npercent because many of the large corporations that contract with TSA \nset up subsidiaries that technically qualify as small businesses but \nare in fact part of a larger corporation. I am concerned about this and \nI know that my colleague, Senator Snowe, the ranking member of the \nSmall Business Committee, is concerned as well.\n\n  There is another important reason to require TSA to follow the FAR. \nDHS, which encompasses 22 different agencies, is trying to create a \nunified procurement system and a common culture within the department. \nThe Comptroller General noted last year before the House Homeland \nSecurity Committee that ``the various acquisition organizations within \nDHS are still operating in a disparate manner, with oversight of \nacquisition activities left primarily up to each individual \ncomponent.'' How can DHS create a common contracting system when the \nagency that spends the most money on contracts within the department is \nexempt from the department's own rules?\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\n  It would be wrong to suggest that exemption from FAR is the main \nreason that TSA has mismanaged contracts. Its acquisition office was \nunderstaffed after 9/11, and there was a rush to meet Congressional \ndeadlines that led to sloppy oversight. I understand that TSA has spent \nmillions to improve its contracting office and I commend it for doing \nso. However, it is far from clear that TSA has a functional procurement \nsystem. A 2006 GAO review of the ongoing Boeing contract suggests that \npoor contracting oversight continues to plague TSA. The report states \nthat ``TSA officials provided no evidence that they are reviewing \nrequired contractor submitted performance data,'' and that they ``do \nnot document their activities because there are no TSA policies and \nprocedures requiring them to do so. I know all Members would agree that \nthis is a problem.\n  Unfortunately, lack of transparency and accountability are common \nthemes in TSA's procurement history. Former DHS IG Kent Ervin has said \nthat ``TSA is rapidly becoming the poster child for contracting \ndysfunction.'' Citizens Against Government Waste, which has endorsed \nthis amendment, said in a letter to my office that ``TSA has a record \nof wasteful spending and mismanagement in its acquisition process and a \ncontinued exemption will only lead to more abuse.'' I think we would be \nremiss in our oversight responsibilities if we did not repeal these \nexemptions. TSA should not be policing itself.\n  I am not alone with these concerns. Just ask the Professional \nServices Council, the Nation's largest trade association representing \nGovernment contractors. In a letter to sent to my office yesterday, the \nPSC stated that my amendment will ``increase competition, expand \nopportunities for small businesses, provide greater accountability and \ntransparency in their procurement process.'' This judgment comes from \nthe association representing the contractors that do business with TSA.\n  Last year, TSA sent a letter to my office saying that it follows the \nFAR as a general rule but that its exemption ``benefits taxpayers.'' \nAmazingly, TSA criticized the FAR's requirement that Federal agencies \nconsider all interested companies in the bidding process, saying that \n``negatively impacts the limited resources of the government.'' It is \nhard to see how taxpayers benefit when an agency has the ability to opt \nout of the competitive bidding process at its choosing. The Army, \nMarines, Navy, Air Force, none of these agencies can simply decide to \nopt out of the FAR unless they meet the criteria for an exemption which \nis already provided for under the law.\n  This legislation is simple: apply the same rules to TSA that every \nother agency has to follow. There is no legitimate reason to maintain \nthese exemptions--not for efficiency, not for national security. If it \nis good enough for the Department of Defense, it is good enough for \nTSA.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Snowe and Representative \nCarney to pass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1925. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act, to prevent credit \ncard issuers from taking unfair advantage of college students and their \nparents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Student Credit \nCard Protection Act of 2007 with my colleagues Senators Smith, \nMcCaskill, Sanders, and Durbin. This legislation will help prevent \ncollege students from compiling massive credit card debt while in \nschool.\n  College students have become the target of credit card companies \nadvertising campaigns over the past 15 years. Many universities allow \ncredit card companies to set up tables on campus and offer students \nfree gifts in exchange for filling out a credit card application. \nAdditionally, students receive card solicitations through mail to their \non-campus mailbox or at their home address even before they arrive at \nthe university in the fall. These aggressive marketing strategies have \nworked and now close to 96 percent of college graduates hold a credit \ncard, compared to 1994, when only half had one. The average college \nstudent graduates with close to $3,000 in credit card debt, double the \namount in 1994. In some very extreme cases, students are leaving school \nwith multiple credit cards and debts amounting upwards of $10,000.\n  Credit card debt can make it harder for graduates to rent an \napartment, receive a car loan, or obtain a job after college. Due to \nthe lack of financial education and complicated terms and conditions, \nmany students find themselves in over their heads. The Student Credit \nCard Protection Act will help students avoid large credit card debt \nwhile forcing issuers to make more responsible loans. The bill requires \ncredit card issuers to verify annual income of a full-time student and \nthen extends a line of credit based on the income. For a student \nwithout a verifiable income, a parent, legal guardian or spouse must \nco-sign the credit card and approve any increase in the credit limit. \nThese simple underwriting requirements will make it more difficult for \ncredit card companies to approve loans that are beyond a students' \nability to repay and return to a more responsible lending policy.\n  It is imperative that we help minimize the amount of debt young \nconsumers incur before entering into the workforce. On average, a \nstudent with a bachelors degree will leave school with $18,000 in \nstudent loan debt. Paying for housing, healthcare, and student loans \nalready place a financial strain on a recent college graduate. A huge \ncredit card payment on top of all card of the other bills can lead to \nfinancial ruin before young people even have a chance to get on their \nfeet. This bill gives students the protection they deserve from \nirresponsible lending that can trap them in years of crushing debt \nrepayment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1926. A bill to establish the National Infrastructure Bank to \nprovide funding for qualified infrastructure projects, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce bipartisan legislation \nwith my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel. The bill addresses an \nissue of paramount importance to our country and its quality of life: \nthe deteriorating condition of our infrastructure systems.\n  I do not believe there is one person present in this chamber, funding \nmyself, who has not taken our Nation's infrastructure systems for \ngranted at some point. Indeed, our roads, bridges, mass transit \nsystems, drinking water systems, wastewater systems, and public housing \nproperties, collectively comprise the overlooked but critically \nimportant adhesive that holds our society together. These systems allow \nfor the continuous passage of people and goods across the country; they \nallow people to communicate with each other here and around the world; \nthey allow business and Government to function; and they allow goods to \nbe consumed and services to be rendered. All in all, our infrastructure \nsystems are directly responsible for providing the high quality of life \nthat we Americans have come to enjoy in a free society.\n  Yet, it is precisely because we have taken our infrastructure systems \nfor granted that we find ourselves in a precarious position today \nconcerning their future viability. One does not have to look far to \ncomprehend the extensive problems plaguing many of our infrastructure \nsystems and facilities.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers in their seminal \n2005 Infrastructure Report Card, the current condition of our Nation's \nmajor infrastructure systems earns a grade point average of D and \njeopardizes the prosperity and quality of life of all Americans.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration, 33 percent of all \nurban and rural roads are in poor, mediocre or fair condition. 27.1 \npercent of all bridges are structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete. Data from the Federal Transit Administration shows our mass \ntransit systems are becoming increasingly unable to handle the growing \ndemands passengers in a safe and efficient manner. According to the \nTexas Transportation Institute, the average traveler is delayed 51.5 \nhours annually due to traffic and infrastructure-related congestion in \nthe Nation's\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\n20 largest metropolitan areas. The delays range from 93 hours in Los \nAngeles to 14 hours in Pittsburgh. Combined, these delays waste 1.78 \nbillion gallons of fuel each year and waste almost $50.3 billion in \ncongestion costs. Furthermore, the average delay in these metropolitan \nareas has increased by almost 35.3 hours since 1982.\n  A significant percentage of our Nation's drinking water and \nwastewater systems are obsolete; the average age of these systems range \nin age from 50 years in smaller cities to 100 years in larger cities. \nFinally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development reports there \nare 1.2 million units of public housing with critical capital needs \ntotaling $18 billion. Clearly, these statistics are alarming and they \nare not getting any better.\n  In their Infrastructure Report Card, the American Society of Civil \nEngineers estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a 5-year period \nto bring our Nation's infrastructure systems to a good condition.\n  Regrettably, our current infrastructure financing mechanisms, such as \nformula grants and earmarks, are not equipped by themselves to absorb \nthis cost or meet fully these growing needs. They largely do not \naddress capacity-building infrastructure projects of regional or \nnational significance; they largely do not encourage an appropriate \npooling of Federal, State, local and private resources; and they \nlargely do not provide transparency to ensure the optimal return on \npublic resources.\n  This is why I rise with my colleague from Nebraska today. We are \nintroducing the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007, a bipartisan \nmeasure that addresses the critical needs of our Nation's major \ninfrastructure systems. Our legislation establishes a new method \nthrough which the Federal Government can finance infrastructure \nprojects of substantial regional or national significance more \neffectively with public and private capital.\n  Our legislation establishes the National Infrastructure Bank, which, \nas an independent entity of the Government, is tasked with evaluating \nand financing capacity-building infrastructure projects of substantial \nregional and national significance. Infrastructure projects that come \nunder the bank's consideration are publicly-owned mass transit systems, \nhousing properties, roads, bridges, drinking water systems, and \nwastewater systems.\n  Modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank is \nled by a 5 member Board of Directors, each whom are appointed by the \nPrsident and confirmed by the Senate. The bank's board has flexibility \nto develop an organization of professional civil service staff to carry \nout the bank's authorized activities. An Inspector General oversees the \nbank's daily operations and reports on those operations to Congress.\n  Infrastructure projects with a potential Federal investment of at \nleast $75 million are brought to the bank's attention by a project \nsponsor, State, locality, tribe, infrastructure agency, e.g. transit \nagency, a consortium of these entities. To determine a level of Federal \ninvestment, the bank uses a sliding-scale method that incorporates \nconditions such as the type of infrastructure system or systems, \nproject location, project cost, current and projected usage, non-\nFederal revenue, regional or national significance, promotion of \neconomic growth and community development, reduction in traffic \ncongestion, environmental benefits, land use policies that promote \nsmart growth, and mobility improvements.\n  Once a level of investment is determined for a project, the bank \ndevelops a financing package with full faith and credit from the \ngovernment. The financing package could include direct subsidies, \ndirect loan guarantees, long-term tax-credit general purpose bonds, and \nlong-term tax-credit infrastructure project specific bonds. The initial \nceiling to issue bonds is $60 billion.\n  The bank is tasked to report annually to Congress on the projects it \nreviews and finances. A public database is created to catalog what \nprojects were funded and what financing packages were provided. The \nbank is also tasked to report every 3 years on the economic efficacy \nand transparency of all current Federal infrastructure financing \nmethods, and how those methods could be improved. After 5 years, the \nGovernment Accountability Office would be tasked with evaluating the \nbank's operations and efficacy.\n  It is important to note that our legislation does not displace or \nsupplant any existing infrastructure finance mechanisms, such as \nformula grants and earmarks. Instead, the bank targets large-scale \nprojects that are currently underserved by these existing financing \nmechanisms.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank the Centers for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, CSIS, and the work undertaken by Dr. John Hamre \nin infrastucture finance. CSIS, Ambassador Felix Rohatyn, and former \nSenator Warren Rudman have provided valuable assistance and support in \nthe development of our legislation.\n  I would also like to thank the American Society of Civil Engineers \nand the National Construction Alliance for their support of our bill.\n  It is my intent to take up this legislation in the Banking Committee \nafter the August recess. This is an issue that cannot be neglected or \ndeferred any further. Restoring our Nation's infrastructure demands our \nimmediate attention and commitment in the Senate. The quality of life \nin our country hangs in the balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd and Senator Hagel: I am writing to \n     commend you for your leadership in helping to restore \n     America's deteriorating physical infrastructure. You both \n     have demonstrated great foresight and vision in leading on \n     this important issue.\n       Three years ago, the Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies launched a study effort under the leadership of \n     former Ambassador Felix Rohatyn and former Senator Warren \n     Rudman. The CSIS Commission on Public Infrastructure issued a \n     declaration of guiding principles for the revitalization of \n     our infrastructure. We were proud that you joined in that \n     declaration. Signatories included senators, governors, and \n     business leaders, all recognizing the need for action.\n       You have acted. While CSIS cannot endorse specific \n     legislation, we can congratulate you as leaders. From the \n     very first days of our republic, our national leaders saw the \n     need for public investment in productive infrastructure. \n     Public investment produced wealth-generating private sector \n     activity, paying back the public investment many times over.\n       The commission also called for infrastructure investments \n     made through a rigorous cost-benefit process. Too much public \n     investment in recent years has been earmarked for projects \n     that have not gone through an analytic justification. Your \n     leadership here is also most welcome.\n       I travel extensively and see how infrastructure investments \n     are transforming the developing world. Faced by this \n     competition, America needs to make public infrastructure a \n     comparable priority as a national re-investment to ensure our \n     future prosperity.\n       Thank you for your leadership. This is the kind of vision \n     that built America to greatness in the past and will be our \n     path to prosperity in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John J. Hamre,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 1, 2007.\n       As co-chairmen of the CSIS Commission on Public \n     Infrastructure, we strongly support the National \n     Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007.\n       Introduced by Senators Chris Dodd and Chuck Hagel, this \n     bipartisan legislation will reverse decades of shortchanging \n     our infrastructure and help restructure the federal role by \n     allocating costs and financing more fairly and rationally. \n     The legislation also will help ensure that infrastructure \n     spending is unencumbered by political interference that \n     neglects regional and national priorities. The Act will \n     establish a policy structure for making infrastructure \n     investments that meet our country's critical needs.\n       The Infrastructure Bank Act will stimulate new, long-term \n     investments in infrastructure that will increase national \n     productivity and improve our standard of living. The proposed \n     Infrastructure Bank Act also will increase the ability of the \n     private sector to play a central role in infrastructure \n     provision and will report on the economic efficacy and \n     transparency of all current federal financing methods. We \n     urge that it be passed into law.\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                             ASCE,\n\n\n                          American Society of Civil Engineers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd, Senator Hagel: I am writing on behalf of \n     the more than 140,000 members of the American Society of \n     Civil Engineers (ASCE) to applaud your joint sponsorship of \n     the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007. This \n     legislation is a major step forward in providing meaningful \n     financial assistance to the nation's failing infrastructure.\n       As you know, ASCE concluded in our 2005 Report Card for \n     America's Infrastructure that the nation's infrastructure \n     deserved an overall grade of ``D.'' We said then that \n     America's aging and overburdened infrastructure threatens the \n     economy and quality of life in every state, city, and town in \n     the nation. In addition, we estimated that it will take an \n     investment of $1.6 trillion over a five-year period to bring \n     the nation's existing infrastructure into good working order. \n     Little of significance has changed in the two years since we \n     issued that dismal grade, and establishing a long-term \n     development and maintenance plan remains a pressing national \n     priority.\n       In creating the National Infrastructure Bank to evaluate \n     and finance ``capacity-building'' infrastructure projects of \n     substantial regional and national significance, the bill \n     would prime the pump to begin meeting the staggering \n     investment needs for our infrastructure. We believe the \n     National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007 will begin the \n     process of replacing and maintaining economically vital \n     infrastructure systems across the nation. This nation cannot \n     afford to wait much longer to invest significant sums in its \n     infrastructure, and your bill will lead the way.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact Brian Pallasch, ASCE \n     Director of Government Relations, or Michael Charles, Senior \n     Manager of Government Relations, of our Washington office if \n     we can be of any assistance in passing this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                  Patrick J.

Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Hagel: The National Construction \n     Alliance represents three of the largest construction unions, \n     the Laborers' International Union of North America, the \n     International Union of Operating Engineers, and the United \n     Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, \n     representing over 1.7 million members.\n       We want to go on record in support of your National \n     Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007.\n       We fully understand the need and responsibility we have to \n     our nation and to our members to find a way to fund \n     substantial regional and significant national infrastructure \n     projects.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues in \n     making the Dodd/Hagel National Infrastructure Bank Act of \n     2007 a permanent part of the solution to funding our nation's \n     most important infrastructure projects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Raymond J.

Goldman Sachs shares your concern about our \n     nation's aging infrastructure and its negative effects on our \n     economy and our environment, and we strongly agree with you \n     about the need to encourage additional infrastructure \n     investment. We believe enactment of your legislation would \n     help spur significant new investment in this area and thereby \n     help address this urgent national problem.\n       We support the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007 and \n     thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tracy R. Wolstencroft.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Public Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington DC, August 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Hagel: On behalf of the more than \n     1,500 member organizations of the American Public \n     Transportation Association (APTA), I want to applaud your \n     proposal to create a National Infrastructure Bank. As we look \n     to the future, high-quality public transportation service \n     must be available to more Americans and in more communities. \n     Public transportation helps to reduce congestion and \n     increases mobility. Transit also significantly reduces energy \n     consumption, saving more than 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline \n     every year. Americans are choosing to ride transit in record \n     numbers, taking more than 10.1 billion trips in 2006. \n     Unfortunately, only 54 percent of households have access to \n     transit of any kind as they plan their daily travel.\n       Much of the success of public transportation is due to \n     federal investment in public transportation infrastructure, \n     and the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank would \n     extend valuable new federal resources to transit investment. \n     The innovative financing and investment tools of a National \n     Infrastructure Bank would aid the development and expansion \n     of fixed guideway systems. These major projects require \n     significant investments, but they are crucial to attracting \n     new riders. Federal support for new starts has helped to \n     finance 127 new fixed guideway systems and system extensions \n     which have gone into service since 1995. Looking ahead, such \n     systems are more necessary than ever to address rapidly \n     growing levels of congestion and to meet additional demands \n     for travel. According to an APTA survey, new capital funds \n     are needed for some 280 projects that will add 4,044 system \n     miles of fixed guideway transit.\n       If we expect our surface transportation infrastructure \n     system to continue to provide a competitive edge for the \n     United States, federal, state and local investment in public \n     transportation is necessary, and new financing mechanisms \n     like the National Infrastructure Bank must be investigated. \n     APTA thanks you for your commitment to the further expansion \n     of public transportation, and we look forward to working with \n     you to advance your proposal.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W.

A bill to amend section 1977A of the Revised Statutes to \nequalize the remedies available under that section; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Equal Remedies Act of 2007 to repeal the caps on the \namount of damages available in employment discrimination cases under \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  This legislation will end the glaring inequality in the current \nFederal antidiscrimination laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 gave \nwomen, religious minorities, and disabled workers the right to recover \ncompensatory and punitive damages for intentional employment \ndiscrimination, but only up to certain specified monetary limits. By \ncontrast, victims of such discrimination on the basis of race or \nnational origin can recover damages without such limitations, because \nthey can bring their cases under another statute. The Equal Remedies \nAct will remove this inequity by eliminating the caps on such damages \nunder current law.\n  The caps were included in the 1991 act as part of a compromise that \nthe first President Bush would sign. That legislation also reversed a \nseries of Supreme Court decisions that had rolled back other basic \ncivil rights protections and made it more difficult for working \nAmericans to challenge discrimination. The 1991 Act as a whole \nrepresented a significant advance in the ongoing battle to eliminate \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  But, it's long past time to end the double standard that consigns \nwomen, religious minorities, and the disabled to second-class remedies \nunder the civil rights laws.\n  The caps are especially unfair, because they deny adequate remedies \nto the most severely injured victims of discrimination. For example, a \nwoman who needs extensive medical treatment as a result of severe \nsexual harassment, such as an assault, she will be limited to receiving \nonly partial compensation for her injury.\n  The goal of providing damages is to hold employers accountable and to \nmake victims whole to the greatest extent possible for the \ndiscrimination they suffered. The current limit prevents accountability \nand keeps the victim from obtaining full relief.\n  The caps serve no justifiable purpose. They shield the worst \nemployers from the full consequences of the most outrageous acts of \ndiscrimination. The deterrent purpose of damages fails when employers \nknow that their liability is limited.\n  Take, for example, Sharon Deters and her case against Equifax Credit \nInformation Services. Sharon suffered constant sexual taunts and \ninsults from her coworkers. Her supervisor praised her harassers' \nbehavior and allowed it to continue. The jury in her case was so \noutraged by her employer's conduct that it awarded her $1 million in \npunitive damages, finding that such an award was necessary to get her \nemployer's attention and make it change its ways. The caps on damages, \nhowever, reduced Sharon's award to $300,000.\n  Results like that are not fair. They fail to fulfill the statutory \npurpose of such damages provision, which is to deter further \nviolations. By passing the Equal Remedies Act of 2007, Congress will be \naffirming the basic principle of equal justice for all Americans. I \nurge my colleagues to join in supporting this important change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1929. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Commissioner of Reclamation, to conduct a feasibility study \nof water augmentation alternatives in the Sierra Vista Subwatershed; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed Feasibility Study \nAct. This important piece of legislation is designed to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to study alternatives to augment the water \nsupplies in a critical area of southern Arizona in the Sierra Vista \nSub-watershed, which is home to a congressionally protected riparian \narea known as the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, \nSPRNCA, the U.S. Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, and nearly \n76,000 residents.\n  SPRNCA, which protects nearly 43 miles of the San Pedro River, serves \nas a principal passage for the migration of approximately 4 million \nbirds. It also provides crucial habitat for 100 species of birds, 81 \nspecies of mammals, 43 species of reptiles and amphibians, and two \nthreatened species of native fish. The Nature Conservancy has called \nthe area one of the ``last great places on earth.''\n  Fort Huachuca, which is adjacent to SPRNCA, plays a critical role in \nthis country's national security by, among other things, training \nsoldiers in military intelligence. It also is the largest employer in \nthe area, contributing greatly to the economy of Cochise County and the \nState of Arizona.\n  In recent years, the Fort has done an exemplary job of implementing \nwater conservation and recharge measures as part of its \nresponsibilities under the Endangered Species Act. Indeed, since 1995, \nit has reduced its groundwater pumping by more than 50 percent.\n  Nevertheless, water levels in certain areas of the regional aquifer \nin the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed are still declining due to natural \ncauses and development near Sierra Vista. Because SPRNCA and the fort \ncould be negatively impacted by these declining water levels, a 2007 \nU.S. Bureau of Reclamation Appraisal level study concluded that \naugmenting the local water supply is necessary. To that end, \nReclamation's study recommended several augmentation alternatives for \nfurther study, all of which are supported by the Upper San Pedro \nPartnership, a congressionally recognized consortium of 21 local, \nstate, and Federal agencies and private organizations.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would authorize the Secretary \nto conduct a feasibility study of the alternatives recommended by \nReclamation for further study. The legislation would also authorize \nappropriations for the Federal share of the study's costs. Importantly, \nthe non-Federal cost share would be at least 55 percent, indicating the \nnon-Federal parties' strong commitment to the study.\n  The feasibility study authorized under this legislation is the next \nstep in the process of determining how to best address the water \nchallenges facing the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed. Consequently, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1930. A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to prevent \nillegal logging practices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, about a year ago, a group of hardwood \nplywood\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\nmanufacturers came to me with a problem, Chinese hardwood plywood \nimports were threatening their businesses. They raised a whole host of \nissues, from tariff misclassification to subsidies to fraudulent \nlabeling to illegal logging. These unfair and illegal practices were \nlowering the costs of the Chinese hardwood plywood imports, giving them \nan unfair advantage over U.S. hardwood plywood and putting American \ncompanies in jeopardy of going out of business and the folks that they \nemploy out of work.\n  Since that time, I have been working to level the playing field for \nOregon hardwood plywood manufacturers and protect the jobs of the \nworkers that they employ. I have met with the Department of Commerce, \nthe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Customs and Border Patrol, \nand the International Trade Commission and urged them to investigate \nthese issues and, where appropriate, act to address them. They have, \nraising these troubling practices in diplomatic negotiations, opening \ninvestigations, and even filing a case before the World Trade \nOrganization targeting Chinese subsidies that benefit the hardwood \nplywood industry, among others.\n  Today, with the support of industry, labor, and the environmental \ncommunity, I am proud to introduce the Combat Illegal Logging Act of \n2007 to halt the trade in illegal timber and timber products. This act \nwill help to level the playing field, not just for Oregon hardwood \nplywood manufacturers affected by Chinese imports, but for all American \nmanufacturers across the country struggling to compete against \nimported, low-priced wood and wood products harvested from illegal \nsources.\n  Equally important, the act helps address an illegal logging crisis. \nFrom the Amazon to the Congo Basin, from Sulawesi to Siberia, illegal \nlogging is destroying ecosystems. It is gutting local economies. It is \nannihilating ways of life. Because of the speed and violence with which \nillegal logging is occurring, failing to curb its effects now may \nresult in irreversible damage.\n  The bill that I am introducing today can help curb illegal logging \nand thwart its devastating consequences.\n  The Lacey Act currently regulates trade in fish, wildlife, and a \nlimited subset of plants by making it unlawful to ``import, export, \ntransport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase'' any that are taken, \npossessed, transported or sold in violation of any State law or, with \nrespect to fish and wildlife only, any foreign law. The Combat Illegal \nLogging Act of 2007 would expand the Lacey Act so that violations of \nforeign law that apply to plants and plant products fall within its \nprotections. It would also specify the types of foreign law violations \nthat trigger Lacey Act liability, laws intended to prevent theft or \nensure the legal right to harvest the plants. Finally, the act would \ncreate a declaration requirement to facilitate the Lacey Act's \nenforcement for timber without placing an undue burden upon law-abiding \nbusinesses.\n  The declaration requirements provide basic transparency for wood \nshipments. The declaration will have critical value for combating \nillegal logging by 1. encouraging importers to ask basic questions \nregarding the origin of their timber and timber products; 2. providing \ninformation at the point of import that will allow authorities with \nlimited resources to do efficient, targeted inspections and \nenforcement; and 3. helping enforcement agents to immediately identify \n``low-hanging fruit,'' such as timber expressly prohibited to be \nexported.\n  The act will definitely change the way that folks who are importing \nillegally harvested timber and wood products do business, this is its \nintended purpose. But for the many companies who already play by the \nrules, the act's requirements should result in minimal changes to the \nway they operate. Moreover, when the act's impact from a \ncompetitiveness standpoint is factored in, the effect is a net positive \nfor these companies. This act changes the incentives to reward due \ndiligence, a sound long-term business strategy from any perspective.\n  This bill is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work by \nstakeholders that many might view as strange bedfellows. The principal \nnegotiators of the compromise, the American Forest & Paper Association, \nthe Hardwood Federation, and the Environmental Investigation Agency, \ndeserve a tremendous amount of credit for sticking with this and \nfinding a solution that everyone could support. I applaud them for \ntheir hard work, the maturity with which they approached the issue, and \nthe respect that they showed each other throughout the process. Their \nconduct is a model for how things should work in Washington.\n  I would also like to applaud the work of several of my colleagues in \nthe House, Congressman Blumenauer, Congressman Wexler, and Congressman \nWeller, who introduced their own illegal logging bill, the Legal Timber \nProtection Act, earlier this year. I understand that their bill may be \ntaken up by the House Natural Resources Committee this fall and I am \nhopeful that they will substitute the broadly supported text of the \nCombat Illegal Logging Act for their bill, paving the way for the \nenactment of this important piece of legislation.\n  I would like to thank Senator Alexander, Senator Kerry, Senator \nSnowe, and Senator Feingold for agreeing to be original cosponsors of \nthe bill. I would also like to thank the following organizations, in \naddition to the American Forest & Paper Association, the Hardwood \nFederation, and the Environmental Investigation Agency for endorsing \nthe bill: Center for International Environmental Law, Conservation \nInternational, Defenders of Wildlife, Dogwood Alliance, ForestEthics, \nFriends of the Earth, Global Witness, Greenpeace, International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, National Hardwood Lumber Association, Natural \nResources Defense Council, Rainforest Action Network, Rainforest \nAlliance, Sierra Club, Society of American Foresters, Sustainable \nFurniture Council, The Nature Conservancy, Tropical Forest Trust, \nUnited Steelworkers, Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wildlife \nFund.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1930\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to ensure that \ndevelopment of certain Federal oil and gas resources will occur in a \nmanner that protects water resources and respects the rights of surface \nowners, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Surface \nOwner Protection Act to help protect private property on split estates.\n  The Western U.S. is experiencing a boom in oil and gas exploration \nthat will contribute to the domestic supply of energy in this country, \nimprove our National security and help control energy costs for \nAmerican consumers. But if it is not done right oil and gas leasing can \nbe damaging to wildlife, pollute our water, and scar the land. \nFurthermore, in many areas of the West the land is in split estates \nwhere mineral rights are owned by the Federal Government, but the \nsurface is owned by a private land owner. Oftentimes the process of oil \nand gas leasing and drilling does not adequately involve surface owners \nor protect their agricultural livelihoods that are disrupted during \nenergy development. Split estates cover 58 million acres in the U.S., \nand 11.7 million acres in Montana alone. That is just slightly smaller \nthan the size of New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware combined.\n  In states like Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado there has been a rapid \nincrease in the number of leases and the amount of acreage that the \nBureau of Land Management is approving for oil and gas exploration. It \nis expected that coal-bed methane development will bring tens of \nthousands of wells in coming decades. The rapid growth is causing \ngeneral unease in some areas because surface owners have few rights \nwhen it comes to oil and gas exploration on their land.\n  Too often surface owners have no idea that their minerals are owned \nby someone else or when they are going to be leased. The legislation I \nam introducing today is meant to better involve surface owners in the \nprocess of oil and gas exploration by requiring notification to surface \nowners when their land is going to be leased, require operators to \nreplace any water that disrupts other users, and requires bonding for \nthe reclamation of surface land. Surface owners should have a clear \nrole in each step of the process from the day a lease sale is announced \nto the time when the rigs are gone and reclamation work is completed.\n  Critics of this measure will argue that it gets in the way of \ndrilling. I would say that oil and gas drilling should not get in the \nway of farmers and ranchers going about their business without clear \nlegal guidelines. The protection of private property rights is \ncrucially important as a personal freedom in the U.S. and we must take \nsteps to protect them.\n  I encourage members of this body to support this measure as we move \nforward because I believe that we can improve the way we conduct oil \nand gas leases on split estates. A better balance between oil and gas \ninterests and surface owners is possible, but we need to make sure that \nwe develop our energy resources in an appropriate manner with respect \nto private property owners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1933. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide \ngrants to small public drinking water systems; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, small rural water systems are facing \ncompliance deadlines, and need assistance without burdensome matching \nfunding requirements. The Small Community Drinking Water Funding Act \nthat I am introducing today with Senators Ensign, Boxer, Murray, \nClinton, Baucus, Sanders, and Conrad, amends the Safe Drinking Water \nAct to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nto establish a Small Public Water System Assistance Program. This \nprogram is to support small water systems in complying with national \nprimary drinking water regulations, and includes a program for Indian \ntribes.\n  The smallest public water systems, which serve fewer than 3,300 \npeople, represent 85 percent of all public water systems. Small public \nwater systems serving fewer than 10,000 people represent 94 percent of \nall public water systems. Small communities throughout Nevada would \nbenefit from a grant program designed to provide funding for water \nquality projects without a difficult matching requirement; and Federal \nprograms in effect as of the date of enactment of this act do not \nadequately meet the needs of small communities in Nevada with respect \nto public water systems. The Small Community Drinking Water Funding Act \nwill authorize $750,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through \n2014. Nevada should be able to secure a substantial portion of this \nfunding because of the State's rural water systems needs.\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\n  The purpose of this bill is to establish a program to provide grants \nto small public water systems to meet applicable national primary \ndrinking water regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Second, \nmaintain water costs at a reasonable level for the communities served \nby small public water systems. Third, obtain technical assistance to \ndevelop the capacity to sustain operations over the long term.\n  This legislation is intended to ensure that our Nation's small, \ndisadvantaged communities have access to the financial help they need \nto provide safe, reliable, and affordable drinking water with the \nauthorization of $750 million annually for 7 years starting next year. \nThe Small Community Safe Drinking Water Act provides substantial \nflexibility to States.\n  Nevada's small communities are facing a drinking water infrastructure \ncrisis. These communities, and other small communities nationwide, \nconfront increasing demand for clean, reliable, and affordable drinking \nwater. But it is simply too costly for small communities, alone, to \naddress this water infrastructure crisis.\n  They need a financial helping hand from the Federal Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Community Drinking \n     Water Funding Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in some cases, drinking water standards in effect and \n     proposed as of the date of enactment of this Act can place \n     large financial burdens on public water systems, especially \n     systems that serve fewer than a few thousand people;\n       (2) some small public water systems have experienced water \n     contamination problems that may pose a significant risk to \n     the health of water consumers;\n       (3) small communities are concerned about improving \n     drinking water quality;\n       (4) the limited scientific, technical, and professional \n     resources of many small communities make understanding and \n     implementing regulatory requirements very difficult;\n       (5) small communities often struggle to meet water quality \n     standards because of difficulty in securing funding;\n       (6) small communities often lack a tax base or \n     opportunities to benefit from economics of scale and \n     therefore face very high per capita costs in improving \n     drinking water quality;\n       (7) the smallest public water systems, which serve fewer \n     than 3,300 people, represent 85 percent of all public water \n     systems;\n       (8) small public water systems serving fewer than 10,000 \n     people represent 94 percent of all public water systems;\n       (9) small communities would benefit from a grant program \n     designed to provide funding for water quality projects \n     without a substantial matching requirement; and\n       (10) Federal programs in effect as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act do not adequately meet the needs of small \n     communities with respect to public water systems.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     program to provide grants to small public water systems to--\n       (1) meet applicable national primary drinking water \n     regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f \n     et seq.);\n       (2) maintain water costs at a reasonable level for the \n     communities served by small public water systems; and\n       (3) obtain technical assistance to develop the capacity to \n     sustain operations over the long term.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 288\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States live with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with prostate cancer in his lifetime;\n       Whereas over the past decade, prostate cancer has been the \n     most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the second most \n     common cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, in 2007, according to estimates from the American \n     Cancer Society, over 218,890 men in the United States will be \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer and 27,050 men in the United \n     States will die of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 30 percent of new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of developing cancer, \n     including prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African-American males suffer a prostate cancer \n     incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than White males and \n     double the mortality rates;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the probability that the disease will \n     lead to death;\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has double the risk of \n     prostate cancer, if he has 2 family members with such \n     diagnoses, he has 5 times the risk, and if he has 3 family \n     members with such diagnoses, he then has a 97 percent risk of \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination \n     (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) can \n     diagnose the disease in earlier and more treatable stages and \n     reduce prostate cancer mortality;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2007 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods for, and treatment of, prostate cancer;\n       (B) to increase research funding that is commensurate with \n     the burden of the disease so that the screening and treatment \n     of prostate cancer may be improved, and so that the causes \n     of, and a cure for, prostate cancer may be discovered; and\n       (C) to continue to consider ways for improving access to, \n     and the quality of, health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States, interested groups, and \n     affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their \n     families, and the economy; and\n       (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/01/senate-section/article/S10627-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 289--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT A \n      ``WELCOME HOME VIETNAM VETERANS DAY'' SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED\n\n  Mrs. BOXER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be \n     construed to include the approval of State proposals that \n     involve waivers or modifications in applicable Federal law.\n       (5) Program or project period.--A State program or project \n     may be approved for a period of 5 years and may be extended \n     for subsequent 5-year periods upon approval by the Commission \n     and the Secretary, based upon achievement of targets, except \n     that a shorter period may be requested by a State and granted \n     by the Secretary.\n       (e) Expedited Congressional Consideration.--\n       (1) Introduction and committee consideration.--\n       (A) Introduction.--The legislative proposal submitted \n     pursuant to subsection (d)(4)(B) shall be in the form of a \n     joint resolution (in this subsection referred to as the \n     ``resolution''). Such resolution shall be introduced in the \n     House of Representatives by the Speaker, and in the Senate, \n     by the majority leader, immediately upon receipt of the \n     language and shall be referred to the appropriate committee \n     of Congress. If the resolution is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, the resolution may be \n     introduced in either House of Congress by any member thereof.\n       (B) Committee consideration.--A resolution introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. \n     A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate. Not later than 15 \n     calendar days after the introduction of the resolution, the \n     committee of Congress to which the resolution was referred \n     shall report the resolution or a committee amendment thereto. \n     If the committee has not reported such resolution (or an \n     identical resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days after \n     its introduction or at the end of the first day after there \n     has been reported to the House involved a resolution, \n     whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n     discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and \n     such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (2) Expedited procedure.--\n       (A) Consideration.--Not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a \n     resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, or the majority leader of the Senate, \n     or the leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the committee amendment to the resolution, \n     and if there is no such amendment, to the resolution. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 5-day period. All points of \n     order against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     the resolution) are waived. A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution is highly privileged in the \n     House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and \n     is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to \n     a motion to postpone consideration of the resolution, or to a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed \n     is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the \n     motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately proceed \n     to consideration of the resolution without intervening \n     motion, order, or other business, and the resolution shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (B) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by one House of the resolution that was introduced in such \n     House, such\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\n     House receives from the other House a resolution as passed by \n     such other House--\n       (i) the resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee and may only be considered for final passage \n     in the House that receives it under clause (iii);\n       (ii) the procedure in the House in receipt of the \n     resolution of the other House, with respect to the resolution \n     that was introduced in the House in receipt of the resolution \n     of the other House, shall be the same as if no resolution had \n     been received from the other House; and\n       (iii) notwithstanding clause (ii), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the reform bill of the other House.\n     Upon disposition of a resolution that is received by one \n     House from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n     consider the resolution bill that was introduced in the \n     receiving House.\n       (C) Consideration in conference.--Immediately upon a final \n     passage of the resolution that results in a disagreement \n     between the two Houses of Congress with respect to the \n     resolution, conferees shall be appointed and a conference \n     convened. Not later than 10 days after the date on which \n     conferees are appointed, the conferees shall file a report \n     with the House of Representatives and the Senate resolving \n     the differences between the Houses on the resolution. \n     Notwithstanding any other rule of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, it shall be in order to \n     immediately consider a report of a committee of conference on \n     the resolution filed in accordance with this subclause. \n     Debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate on the \n     conference report shall be limited to 10 hours, equally \n     divided and controlled by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the minority leader of the House of \n     Representatives or their designees and the majority and \n     minority leaders of the Senate or their designees. A vote on \n     final passage of the conference report shall occur \n     immediately at the conclusion or yielding back of all time \n     for debate on the conference report.\n       (3) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to \n     be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution, and it supersedes \n     other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with \n     such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (4) Limitation.--The amount of Federal funds provided with \n     respect to any State proposal that is deemed approved under \n     subsection (d)(3) shall not exceed the cost provided for such \n     proposals within the concurrent resolution on the budget as \n     enacted by Congress for the fiscal year involved.\n       (f) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide a grant to a \n     State that has an application approved under subsection (b) \n     to enable such State to carry out an innovative State health \n     program in the State.\n       (2) Amount of grant.--The amount of a grant provided to a \n     State under paragraph (1) shall be determined based upon the \n     recommendations of the Commission, subject to the amount \n     appropriated under subsection (k).\n       (3) Performance-based funding allocation and \n     prioritization.--In awarding grants under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (A) fund a diversity of approaches as provided for by the \n     Commission in subsection (c)(1)(B);\n       (B) give priority to those State programs that the \n     Commission determines have the greatest opportunity to \n     succeed in providing expanded health insurance coverage and \n     in providing children, youth, and other vulnerable \n     populations with improved access to health care items and \n     services; and\n       (C) link allocations to the State to the meeting of the \n     goals and performance measures relating to health care \n     coverage, quality, and health care costs established under \n     this Act through the State project application process.\n       (4) Maintenance of effort.--A State, in utilizing the \n     proceeds of a grant received under paragraph (1), shall \n     maintain the expenditures of the State for health care \n     coverage purposes for the support of direct health care \n     delivery at a level equal to not less than the level of such \n     expenditures maintained by the State for the fiscal year \n     preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is received.\n       (5) Report.--At the end of the 5-year period beginning on \n     the date on which the Secretary awards the first grant under \n     paragraph (1), the State Health Innovation Advisory \n     Commission established under subsection (c) shall prepare and \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, a report on \n     the progress made by States receiving grants under paragraph \n     (1) in meeting the goals of expanded coverage, improved \n     quality, and cost containment through performance measures \n     established during the 5-year period of the grant. Such \n     report shall contain the recommendation of the Commission \n     concerning any future action that Congress should take \n     concerning health care reform, including whether or not to \n     extend the program established under this subsection.\n       (g) Monitoring and Evaluation.--\n       (1) Annual reports and participation by states.--Each State \n     that has received a program approval shall--\n       (A) submit to the Commission an annual report based on the \n     period representing the respective State's fiscal year, \n     detailing compliance with the requirements established by the \n     Commission and the Secretary in the approval and in this \n     section; and\n       (B) participate in the annual meeting under subsection \n     (c)(4)(B).\n       (2) Evaluations by commission.--The Commission, in \n     consultation with a qualified and independent organization \n     such as the Institute of Medicine, shall prepare and submit \n     to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Education \n     and Labor, and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House \n     of Representatives annual reports that shall contain--\n       (A) a description of the effects of the reforms undertaken \n     in States receiving approvals under this section;\n       (B) a description of the recommendations of the Commission \n     and actions taken based on these recommendations;\n       (C) an evaluation of the effectiveness of such reforms in--\n       (i) expanding health care coverage for State residents;\n       (ii) improving the quality of health care provided in the \n     States; and\n       (iii) reducing or containing health care costs in the \n     States;\n       (D) recommendations regarding the advisability of \n     increasing Federal financial assistance for State ongoing or \n     future health program initiatives, including the amount and \n     source of such assistance; and\n       (E) as required by the Commission or the Secretary under \n     subsection (f)(5), a periodic, independent evaluation of the \n     program.\n       (h) Noncompliance.--\n       (1) Corrective action plans.--If a State is not in \n     compliance with a requirement of this section, the Secretary \n     shall develop a corrective action plan for such State.\n       (2) Termination.--For good cause and in consultation with \n     the Commission, the Secretary may revoke any program granted \n     under this section.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NOMINATION OF \n                   JUDGE LESLIE SOUTHWICK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Judge Leslie Southwick served on the Mississippi Court \n     of Appeals from January 1995 to December 2006, during which \n     time he was honored by his peers for his outstanding service \n     on the bench.\n       (2) The Mississippi State Bar honored Judge Southwick in \n     2004 with its judicial excellence award, which is awarded \n     annually to a judge who is ``an example of judicial \n     excellence; a leader in advancing the quality and integrity \n     of justice; and a person of high ideals, character and \n     integrity''.\n       (3) The American Bar Association has twice rated Judge \n     Southwick well-qualified for Federal judicial service, its \n     highest rating. As part of its evaluation, the American Bar \n     Association considers a nominee's ``compassion,'' ``open-\n     mindedness,'' ``freedom from bias and commitment to equal \n     justice under law''.\n       (4) In 2006, the President nominated Judge Southwick to the \n     United States District Court for the Southern District of \n     Mississippi.\n       (5) Last fall, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously \n     reported Judge Southwick's nomination to the full Senate for \n     its favorable consideration.\n       (6) In 2007, the President nominated Judge Southwick to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       (7) The Administrative Office of the Courts has declared \n     the Fifth Circuit vacancy to which Judge Southwick has been \n     nominated a ``judicial emergency'' with one of the highest \n     case filing rates in the country.\n       (8) Judge Southwick is the third consecutive Mississippian \n     whom the President has nominated to address this judicial \n     emergency.\n       (9) Both Senators from Mississippi strongly support Judge \n     Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit, and they \n     strongly supported his 2 predecessor nominees to that \n     vacancy.\n       (10) The only material change in Judge Southwick's \n     qualifications between last fall when the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee unanimously reported his district court nomination \n     to the floor, and this year when the Committee is considering \n     his nomination to the Fifth Circuit is that the American Bar \n     Association has increased its rating of him from well-\n     qualified to unanimously well-qualified.\n       (11) While on the State appellate bench, Judge Southwick \n     has continued to serve his country admirably in her armed \n     forces.\n       (12) In 1992, Judge Southwick sought an age waiver to join \n     the Army Reserves, and in 2003, he volunteered to serve in a \n     line combat unit, the 155th Separate Armor Brigade. In 2004, \n     he took a leave of absence from the bench to serve in Iraq \n     with the 155th Brigade Combat Team of the Mississippi \n     National Guard. There he distinguished himself at Forward \n     Operating Base Duke near Najaf and at Forward Operating Base \n     Kalsu.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit should receive an up \n     or down vote by the full Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2600.

Sense of Senate on Immigration.--(a) Findings.--\n     The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 28th, 2007, the Senate, by a vote of 46 to 53, \n     rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a bill to provide for \n     comprehensive immigration reform.\n       (2) Illegal immigration remains the top domestic issue in \n     the United States.\n       (3) The people of the United States continue to feel the \n     effects of a failed immigration system on a daily basis, and \n     they have not forgotten that Congress and the President have \n     a duty to address the issue of illegal immigration and the \n     security of the international borders of the United States.\n       (4) People from across the United States have shared with \n     members of the Senate their wide ranging and passionate \n     opinions on how best to reform the immigration system.\n       (5) There is no consensus on an approach to comprehensive \n     immigration reform that does not first secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (6) There is unanimity that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to, and immediately should, secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (7) Border security is an integral part of national \n     security.\n       (8) The greatest obstacle the Federal Government faces with \n     respect to the people of the United States is a lack of trust \n     that the Federal Government will secure the international \n     borders of the United States.\n       (9) This lack of trust is rooted in the past failures of \n     the Federal Government to uphold and enforce immigration laws \n     and the failure of the Federal Government to secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (10) Failure to uphold and enforce immigration laws has \n     eroded respect for those laws and eliminated the faith of the \n     people of the United States in the ability of their elected \n     officials to responsibly administer immigration programs.\n       (11) It is necessary to regain the trust of the people of \n     the United States in the competency of the Federal Government \n     to enforce immigration laws and manage the immigration \n     system.\n       (12) Securing the borders of the United States would serve \n     as a starting point to begin to address other issues \n     surrounding immigration reform on which there is not \n     consensus.\n       (13) Congress has not fully funded some interior and border \n     security activities that it has authorized.\n       (14) The President of the United States can initiate \n     emergency spending by designating certain spending as \n     ``emergency spending'' in a request to the Congress.\n       (15) The lack of security on the international borders of \n     the United States rises to the level of an emergency.\n       (16) The Border Patrol are apprehending some, but not all, \n     individuals from countries that the Secretary of State has \n     determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism who cross or attempt to cross \n     illegally into the United States.\n       (17) The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a \n     human smuggling ring that has been bringing Iraqis and other \n     Middle Eastern individuals across the international borders \n     of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should work to regain the trust \n     of the people of the United States in its ability of the \n     Federal Government to secure the international borders of the \n     United States;\n       (2) in order to restore the credibility of the Federal \n     Government on this critical issue, the Federal Government \n     should prove its ability to enforce immigration laws by \n     taking actions such as securing the border, stopping the flow \n     of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States, and \n     creating a tamper-proof biometric identification card for \n     foreign workers; and\n       (3) the President should request emergency spending that \n     fully funds--\n       (A) existing interior and border security authorizations \n     that have not been funded by Congress; and\n       (B) the border and interior security initiatives contained \n     in the bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform \n     and for other purposes (S. 1639) introduced in the Senate on \n     June 18, 2007.\n       Sec. 562.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 290, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Honoring the life and career of former San Francisco 49ers \n     Head Coach Bill Walsh.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday we lost a man who was the \nheart and soul of the great San Francisco 49er teams of the 1980s. Bill \nWalsh was a great coach and a fine friend.\n  I rise today with Senator Boxer to introduce a resolution to honor \nthe life and career of a pioneer in the field of football, a true \nleader and teacher, and a dedicated husband, father and friend.\n  He touched so many in the bay area. He led the 49ers to three Super \nBowls. And he gave this city a shot in the arm in some of its darkest \nhours.\n  I became mayor in 1978. Bill Walsh became head coach in 1979, after \nhoning his skills at Stanford.\n  Many forget that the 49ers before Bill Walsh were an unremarkable \nteam. They hadn't made the playoffs in years. The team was filled with \njourneymen.\n  San Francisco was a baseball town, and football played second fiddle.\n  But just 2 years later in the 1981 season Bill Walsh led the 49ers on \nan improbable run to a Super Bowl victory.\n  Led by a quarterback named Montana, these 49ers played an exciting \nnew brand of football.\n  Only later would we discover that Bill Walsh had revolutionized the \ngame--he transformed smash-mouth football into the elegant ``West Coast \nOffense.''\n  And this team became the stuff of legends. The players became \nhousehold names. Montana. Rice. Lott. Clark. Young.\n  Even the plays became mythical. Who can forget ``The Catch''?\n  And Cinderella became a powerhouse and a powerhouse became a dynasty.\n  I look back on that time with great fondness.\n  One of the photos that I treasure most is in my home in Washington.\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\n  It was the parade after the first Super Bowl victory. Bill and Eddie \nDeBartolo and I were sitting on the rim of a car. We were worried that \nno one would show up. Some said that San Francisco doesn't do parades.\n  And then we turned down Market Street. And there were a million plus \nSan Franciscans lining the streets.\n  I will never forget that moment.\n  Bill Walsh meant so much to this city.\n  He made the 49ers great at a point when the city needed it most.\n  The city was fragmented and divided in the early 1980s. Mayor George \nMoscone had been assassinated a few years earlier. There were riots. \nAnd there was little to bring us together.\n  But on Sundays, the differences melted away. The tensions diminished. \nThe anxieties subsided.\n  There was nothing like Montana to Rice for an 80-yard touchdown. \nNothing like a victory over the Los Angeles Rams. Nothing like a Super \nBowl championship.\n  And on Mondays, after a victory, you would see a changed city. A \nlittle bit nicer, a little less mean.\n  So Bill Walsh brought this city together in ways that he, nor I, \nwould ever really understand.\n  Football became the glue to bind this city together.\n  And during the 10 years I came to know Bill, I came to admire him, \nrespect him, and love him.\n  And he made me, like so many others, a 49ers fan for life.\n  Bill Walsh, though, was more than a coach.\n  He was a leader. A mentor. A friend.\n  He didn't just revolutionize how football is played, but how it is \ncoached and taught.\n  He believed, as I do, that the devil is in the details. And that you \nhave to practice right to play right. He was the first to script the \nfirst 15 plays in a game.\n  And he didn't just coach men. He shaped them into good football \nplayers and good citizens.\n  His greatest skill may have been as a scout, identifying raw talent \nand sculpting it into masterpieces.\n  They said that Joe Montana didn't have a strong enough arm, that \nJerry Rice wasn't fast enough, that Steve Young wasn't disciplined \nenough.\n  But Bill saw what other people missed. He saw the intangibles. He saw \nleadership. And work ethic. And character.\n  And there is no one who wouldn't want a Bill Walsh-coached player on \ntheir team.\n  Bill was a mentor as well. He wanted his players and coaches to \nfulfill their potential more than anyone. He encouraged them to spread \ntheir wings and go out on their own.\n  And you can see the results, more than half the coaches in the league \nhave been in some way touched by Bill Walsh--either directly like \nSeattle Seahawk's Coach Mike Holmgren or Indianopolis Colts' Coach Tony \nDungy or indirectly, by the second and third generation coaches who may \nnot have coached or played under Bill, but are teaching his offense \nnonetheless.\n  But I think what we will miss most is not Bill Walsh the coach, but \nBill Walsh the person.\n  He was decent, and good, and kind.\n  Sure, he was tough. In football, just as in public life, you have to \nbe.\n  But he was fair. He expected his players and coaches to spend the \ntime and effort it takes to be great. But he did not expect anything \nfrom them that he was not prepared to give himself.\n  Bill once said, ``Playing to one's full potential is the only purpose \nof playing at all.''\n  The good news is that Bill fulfilled his purpose. He played to his \nfull potential in everything he did.\n  I know I speak for all San Francisco when I say that this is a sad \nday. He will truly be missed.\n  Bill Walsh may have been called a ``Genius'' when it comes to \nfootball, but his legacy goes well beyond the Xs and Os.\n  He touched this city, and we owe him a debt that can never be repaid.\n  Mr. CASEY.
