Mr. President, as we gather in the Senate for this \nsession today, there will be no recorded votes, but an important vote \nis scheduled to take place across the Rotunda. We know what that vote \nis about. It is about a war that is now in its fourth year, a war that \nhas lasted longer than World War II.\n  We were told recently that advisers to the President told him that at \nthis stage of the war, there would be as few as 5,000 American troops \nin Iraq maintaining the limited interests that will remain for the \nUnited States. The reality is so much different. Over 130,000 Americans \ntroops are still there for the fourth year of this war. We are \nactivating Guard units, Reserve units, and redeploying those in active \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nwith a frequency we have not seen since the great wars we faced in our \npast. We are asking sacrifices from these men and women in uniform and \ntheir families far beyond what was anticipated when the President 4 \nyears ago convinced a majority of the House and Senate to vote to go to \nwar.\n  The cost of this war, in human terms, is devastating: 3,132 of \nAmerica's best and bravest soldiers have died. Over 23,000 have \nreturned seriously injured. Many will come back and need help in \nreconstructing their lives, their families, their homes, their \nbusinesses. They have paid a sacrifice, all of them, and we owe them \nall a great debt of gratitude for their service to our country.\n  The President has decided the next stage of the war is to increase \nthe number of American troops who will be cast into the midst of this \ncivil war. It has been characterized as a civil war now by our national \nintelligence agencies. In fact, they say it is far worse than civil \nwar. The report they have given to Congress, the National Intelligence \nEstimate called the situation:\n\n       Worse than a civil war because it is compounded by a \n     domestic insurgency, foreign terrorism, and rampant crime.\n\n  Through hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have \nlearned that the fundamentals of a civil society do not exist in Iraq \ntoday. The basics--police protection, enforcement of the law, \nprosecution of criminals, incarceration of those who have been found \nguilty--all of these things are at issue in this country. Yet the \nPresident believes we should invest more and more American lives in \nthat war. I believe that is a tragic error. That is my opinion. It is \nbeing debated in the House of Representatives, and they will reach a \nconclusion this afternoon, likely the same conclusion I have, that this \nis a wrong strategy.\n  It has been an interesting and historic debate in the House. Members \nhave been allowed the time to stand and speak their minds and speak \nfrom the heart about this grave challenge we face in America. What we \nare asking for on the floor of the Senate is the same opportunity as \nthe House of Representatives. We believe that this, characterized as \nAmerica's greatest deliberative body, should not avoid the \nresponsibility of debate. We believe this policy of the President, \nwhich is being discussed and debated across America in towns large and \nsmall, should be discussed and debated on the floor of the Senate.\n  The press made note this morning that the Senate is going to meet in \na rare Saturday session. Well, we may be coming together on Saturday to \ndo our job, but people across America are coming together on Saturdays \nto do their jobs, and our soldiers are going to war on Saturday to do \ntheir job. We will have a chance tomorrow, early in the afternoon, to \ndecide whether the Senate will take up this same debate; whether the \nAmerican people will have a chance, through their elected Senators, to \nspeak on this issue, this life and death issue.\n  I am hoping we will have a better result than we did 2 weeks ago. We \nbrought this matter up before the Senate. We asked to have a debate. In \nfact, we said: We will take--on the Democratic majority side, we will \nallow two Republican amendments to be offered, one from Senator Warner \nof Virginia, which questions the President's policies; the other from \nSenator McCain of Arizona, who believes that the escalation is a good \npolicy--a sharp contrast, a real choice, an honest, straightforward \ndebate leading to a yes or no--and that was rejected because, you see, \nthe other side does not want us to come down to that basic, fundamental \nquestion. They want us to go into a debate about so many other issues, \nalbeit important issues but not directly related to this policy.\n  Yesterday, the majority leader in the Senate, Harry Reid of the State \nof Nevada, offered again to the Republican side the basic choice, a \nstraightforward choice. We will bring to the floor the resolution that \nis presently being debated in the House of Representatives which \nobjects to the escalation of forces, and we will allow Senator McCain, \nwho has an opposite view, who wants to send more troops into Iraq, we \nwill allow those two to be considered and Members to make a choice. I \ndon't think you could ask for anything fairer. But unfortunately, the \nminority, the Republican minority insisted they wanted to add two or \nthree more amendments into the mix.\n  Well, clearly, that takes the focus off the most important issue; \nthat is, should we send more American soldiers into this wretched civil \nwar in Iraq today. I think we need to face that responsibility and face \nthat vote. Now, some will step back and say: Wait. If the Democrats are \nin the majority, why don't they debate this issue?\n  Well, the rules of the Senate are interesting. They are designed to \nprotect a minority. They give the minority in America and the minority \nin the Senate a voice which it may not have in other places. So under \nthe rules of the Senate, it takes 60 Members to vote to move forward to \ndebate an issue--60. We have 50, with Senator Johnson recuperating; \nthey have 49. So in order to move to a debate, we need 10 Senators to \ncross this aisle and join us, cooperate with us, on a bipartisan basis, \nso we can move forward on this debate. Tomorrow will be the test.\n  Now, I have heard some Senators on the other side say: We are not \neven going to show up tomorrow. We are not going to be here. I hope \nthat is idle chatter and doesn't reflect their intentions.\n  I believe the vote tomorrow is critically important. We are summoning \nDemocratic Senators from all across the United States, literally. Some \nare making personal sacrifices, having flown home, believing we had \nended the session, and flying back, many of them all-night flights, to \nbe here. They understand the importance and gravity of this vote. I \ncertainly hope the Members on the other side feel the same way. This is \nan important vote. It is not just another procedural vote. America will \nnotice who is here tomorrow and who votes, and America will notice, \nafter this historic debate in the House of Representatives, whether we \nmeet our important constitutional responsibility.\n\n  A lot of people argue they have given up on Government. Government \ndoesn't mean much to them anymore, and they don't have a great high \nregard for the people who are in Government. Some of these folks have \nstopped voting. They don't get involved. They go about their normal \nlives and say: Those politicians, you know, they talk a lot and they \ndon't do much.\n  Well, this is a time when I think we can dispel some of this feeling \nacross America that we are irrelevant and not part of things. If we \ncan't take the time to spend on the floor of the Senate, as people are \nacross America, debating this war, then we have lost our way. We have \nto bring this matter before the American people in the right way. We \nare fighting for a democracy in the Middle East. We are fighting for a \ndemocracy in Iraq. Democracy is the open debate of public issues. Will \nwe have that same debate on the Senate floor? That question is in the \nhands of the Republican minority. They will decide tomorrow whether we \nmove forward on this debate.\n  Now, there is one group in this town who does not want this debate to \nmove forward; let's be very honest about it: the President and the \nWhite House. It is an embarrassment to have your policy rejected and \nrepudiated by bipartisan votes in the House and Senate, and it is rare. \nIt hardly ever happens. So to spare the embarrassment to the White \nHouse--the political embarrassment--some are trying to stop this debate \nin the Senate. But I have to say I think this issue goes far beyond \nwhich politician ends up with bragging rights. That has nothing to do \nwith it. This has to do with the lives and fortunes of our servicemen \nand their families and this great Nation and our foreign policy.\n\n  At a time when we need to gather allies around the world to fight \nthis war on terrorism, when we need to bring nations together to join \nus as they did after September 11 to stop the spread of terrorism, we \nneed to understand this debate on Iraq is right on point. It is a \ndebate which affects hundreds of thousands of soldiers and their \nfamilies, and it affects all of us as Americans.\n  I sincerely hope the Republican minority will have a change of heart, \nwill join us in supporting this debate tomorrow. I believe we will find \ntomorrow, with this vote, that a bipartisan majority of the Senate \nwants to move forward with a debate. If it doesn't\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\nreach the number of 60, then technically this debate cannot move \nforward. I use the word ``technically'' because in honesty, that will \nnot be the end if we do not muster 60 votes. This matter is going to \ncome before the Senate again and again and again.\n  For 4 years in this war, Congress, controlled by the other party, has \nbeen virtually silent on the issue of this war and the wisdom of our \npolicy. Those days are over. In the last few weeks we have been in \nsession, we have had over 30 hearings by committees that have asked the \nhard questions about this policy, about protecting our troops, and \nabout where we are going to go forward in the future. Those questions \nwill continue to be asked by committees. They will continue to be \naddressed in the Senate. When we move to the next item of legislation, \nwe will undoubtedly have amendments relative to this war in Iraq. This \ndebate will not end.\n  I sincerely hope those on the other side of the aisle will join us. I \nhope they understand what is at stake. It is not just 21,000 more \nsoldiers putting their lives on the line for America; it is a question \nof our foreign policy and protecting this Nation and making sure we \nkeep our commitment to our country to keep it safe.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the war in Iraq is the most important \nissue of our time. The American people know that our soldiers are \nserving nobly under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and that \nfar too many of them are making the ultimate sacrifice for our country. \nCitizens are calling on us--begging us--to address this issue with the \nseriousness and the urgency it deserves.\n  The House of Representatives will vote later today on a major \nresolution supporting our troops and opposing the escalation of the \nwar. It will be a historic vote and a clear response to the American \npeople's clarion call for change. The Senate will have a chance to do \nso soon as well. The voices of the American people are growing louder \nand louder, and the need for us to act could not be clearer.\n  Under the President's current policy, the war continues to impose an \nenormous human toll on our soldiers, their families, and their loved \nones. Our men and women in uniform have served with great courage and \nhonor for nearly 4 years--longer than it took to win World War II. More \nthan 3,000 of our forces have been killed and more than 23,000 wounded. \nThe casualties keep mounting. Last fall was the deadliest period since \nthe war began. Mr. President, 287 American soldiers were killed in \nOctober, November, and December. Already, 118 have been killed since \nthe President announced the surge, and the numbers keep rising.\n  The toll in Massachusetts has been heavy. Just last week, CPT \nJennifer Harris of Swampscott, MA, was killed when her helicopter went \ndown north of Baghdad. She was the first woman from our State to make \nthe ultimate sacrifice in Iraq, and our hearts and prayers go out to \nher family and loved ones.\n  So far, 65 Massachusetts members of our forces have given the last \nfull measure of devotion to our country. The youngest was 19, the \noldest was 46. They died far from their homes in Bedford and Bristol, \nLawrence and Lowell, Plymouth and Pittsfield, Weymouth and Woburn, and \nother towns and cities across the State. They were fathers, sons, a \ndaughter, brothers, and friends. Each of them represents a life cut \nshort in service to our country.\n  More than 3,000 families across America share in such heartbreak. \nTheir loved ones have died in Iraq, and we mourn their loss. We honor \ntheir service, and we pray that God's grace and mercy may ease the \nanguish of those they have left behind.\n  Citizens of Massachusetts have answered their country's call from the \nfirst days of the Republic, and those we honor today are members of \nthat noble company. Each knew they were going into harm's way. They \nfaced dangers in Iraq that vast numbers of our troops had never seen \nbefore, such as suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices.\n  We mourn the loss of these heroes. We honor their sacrifice and \nextend our deepest condolences to their families. Words cannot ease the \ngrief of losing a loved one, but I hope the families may find comfort \nin the words of Abraham Lincoln in the famous letter he sent to a \nbereaved mother during the Civil War. He wrote:\n\n       Dear Madam, I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words \n     of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of \n     a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering \n     to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the \n     Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father \n     may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you \n     only the cherished memory of the loved and the lost, and the \n     solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a \n     sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\n  The consequences of the decisions we make here in Congress profoundly \naffect our military, their families, and the communities they have \nleft. We have an obligation to our soldiers to make sensible decisions \nthat will not place them needlessly in harm's way.\n  We in Massachusetts feel especially deeply the loss of the 65 \nsoldiers who have died in Iraq: SGT Justin W.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2122-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2122-S2125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his moving and sobering words but even more \nimportantly for his leadership and tremendous clarity on this issue \nover these last few critical years.\n  Mr. President, we are approaching the 4-year anniversary of one of \nthe greatest foreign policy mistakes in our country's history. In March \n2003, with the prior authorization of Congress, the President took this \ncountry to war in Iraq. Almost 4 years later, virtually every objective \nobserver and, more importantly, the American people as a whole agree \nthat the President's policy has failed. Even the President acknowledges \nthat his plan has not worked, though his solution is not a new plan but \na troop escalation. Of course, sending more troops to implement what is \nessentially the same flawed strategy makes no sense. The American \npeople agree that it makes no sense, and most of my colleagues agree \nthat it makes no sense.\n  So the question becomes, with a President unable or unwilling to fix \na flawed policy that is jeopardizing our national security and our \nmilitary readiness, what should we in Congress do about our country's \ninvolvement in this disastrous war? Do we do nothing and hope the \nPresident will put things right, when he has shown time and time again \nthat he is incapable of doing so? Do we simply tell the President that \nwe are unhappy with the way the war is going and that we hope he will \nchange course or do we take strong, decisive action to fix the \nPresident's mistaken, self-defeating policies?\n  It is pretty clear which course of action I support. I think it is a \ncourse of action the American people called for in the November \nelections. It is the course of action our national security needs, so \nwe do not continue to neglect global threats and challenges while we \nfocus so much of our resources and our efforts on Iraq. It is the \ncourse of action that will support--that will actually support--our \nbrave troops and their families.\n  We must end our involvement in this tragic and misguided war. The \nPresident will not do so; therefore, Congress must act. So far, \nCongress has not lived up to that responsibility. Instead of taking \nstrong action in the Senate, instead of considering binding legislation \nthat fixes the President's flawed Iraq strategy, we tied ourselves into \nknots last week in a convoluted and misguided effort to achieve a \nconsensus that would have essentially reaffirmed congressional \nauthorization for continuing our military involvement in Iraq. Of \ncourse, here I am referring to the resolution proposed by the senior \nSenator from Virginia. This resolution was portrayed, at least at \nfirst, by members of both parties as an important symbolic rebuke of \nthe President's Iraq policy. In fact, it really was not a rebuke at \nall. In parts, it reads like a reauthorization of the war, rejecting \ntroop redeployment and specifically authorizing ``vigorous operations'' \nin a critical region in Iraq.\n  Now, when debate on the Warner resolution was blocked, we had a \nchance\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nto get things right. And I am glad our majority leader, Senator Reid, \nhas chosen to bring up the resolution being debated in the House today \nexpressing support for the troops and, simply, opposition to the so-\ncalled surge. Now, this body--the Senate--should go on record in \nopposition to, or support of, the President's plan.\n  I will vote to allow the debate on the resolution to take place. And \nI hope I will have the opportunity to actually vote for the resolution.\n  I have yet to hear any convincing argument that sending 21,500 more \ntroops to Iraq will bring about the political solution that is needed \nto end violence in that country.\n  The President's decision to send more troops is based on two flawed \nassumptions. It assumes, first, that the presence of even more of our \nservicemembers will help Iraqi troops improve security in Baghdad and, \nsecond, that with improved security, Iraqi politicians can then achieve \nnational reconciliation. The recent declassified NIE, or National \nIntelligence Estimate, shot holes in both of those assumptions. It said \nthat Iraqi security forces ``will be hard pressed in the next 12-18 \nmonths to execute significantly increased security responsibilities'' \nand ``even if violence is diminished, given the current winner-take-all \nattitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene, Iraqi \nleaders will be hard pressed to achieve sustained political \nreconciliation in the time frame of this Estimate.''\n  Obviously, those were direct quotes, not me characterizing the NIE. \nIn other words, in the best case scenario, U.S. forces provide a little \nsecurity that Iraqi forces can't sustain on their own and that Iraqi \npoliticians won't use to settle their entrenched differences. That \ndoesn't sound to me like a plan for success.\n  Some of my colleagues, even those who don't support sending more \ntroops to Baghdad, have spoken in favor of continued and even increased \nU.S. military operations in Al Anbar Province. Some of them even \nsuggest that our troops should be directly combating an insurgency \nthere. This, apart from everything else, is a recipe for disaster. Al \nAnbar Province is where a majority of U.S. troops have been killed in \nIraq. The insurgency there, as well as general opposition to the U.S. \npresence and to the Shiite-dominated Government in Baghdad, is fueled \nby the Sunnis' political and economic grievances. Conducting targeted \nmissions to take out terrorists makes sense, but using U.S. troops to \nput down an insurgency doesn't. Maintaining or, worse yet, increasing a \nsubstantial U.S. presence in a primarily Sunni area without a political \nsolution means nothing less than a continuation of unending and self-\ndefeating policies in Iraq. Clearly, the President's decision to send \nmore troops makes no sense. But I have to say that simply passing a \nnonbinding resolution criticizing it makes no sense, either, if we just \nstop there. So we need to go further, and we need to do it soon.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, when the voters rejected the President's \nIraq policy in November, they weren't rejecting an escalation. That \noption wasn't even on the table then. Who was talking about an \nescalation during that campaign? Certainly, the Presiding Officer knows \nwell what was being discussed. They were rejecting the President's \npolicy of trying to achieve a political solution in Iraq with a massive \nand unlimited military presence. After delaying action for a couple of \nmonths, the President just plain ignored overwhelming public sentiment, \nthe advice of Members of both parties, and the views of the military \nand foreign policy experts when he proposed an escalation. The \nadministration turned its back on the American people.\n  We in Congress should not follow suit. We have a responsibility to \nour constituents and to our men and women in uniform. If no one will \nlisten to and act on the will of the American people, then there is \nsomething seriously wrong with our political system. After almost 4 \nyears of a disastrous policy, we must bring our troops out of Iraq. To \ndo otherwise is to ignore public outrage over the war and to ignore the \nmany other pressing national security priorities we are neglecting in \nfavor of a myopic focus on Iraq. The American people recognize there is \nno U.S. military solution to Iraq's civil war. And as long as we focus \ndisproportionate attention and resources on Iraq, we will not be able \nto counter the full range of threats we face in places such as \nAfghanistan and Somalia and many other places around the world. So \nCongress must use its power. It must use its power of the purse to \nsafely redeploy our troops from Iraq.\n  Let's not be intimidated by the intentionally misleading rhetoric of \nthe White House and its allies when they try to prevent any discussion \nat all of real action by the Congress to end the war. This isn't about \ncutting off funds for troops; it is about cutting off funds for the \nwar. Every Member of Congress agrees that we must continue to support \nour troops and give them the resources and the support they need. By \nsetting a date after which funding for the war will be terminated, as I \nhave proposed, Congress can safely bring our troops out of harm's way. \nThat is how you get them out of harm's way, by getting them out of \nthere.\n  There is plenty of precedent for Congress exercising its \nconstitutional authority to stop U.S. involvement in armed conflict. \nLast month, I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing entitled \n``Exercising Congress's Constitutional Power to End the War.'' Without \nexception, every witness, those called by the majority and the \nminority, those who have had a career more focused on the executive \nbranch than the legislative branch--all of them did not challenge the \nconstitutionality of Congress's authority to end the war.\n\n  Lou Fisher of the Library of Congress is acclaimed as one of the \nforemost experts on the President's war powers. In fact, he literally \nwrote the book on this topic. He testified that Congress does not \nsimply have the power, he said it has the responsibility to exercise \nit, when needed.\n  He said:\n\n       . . . is the continued use of military force and a military \n     commitment in the Nation's interest? That is the core \n     question. Once you decide that, if you decide it is not in \n     the national interest, you certainly do not want to continue \n     putting U.S. troops in harm's way.\n\n  The argument that cutting off funding for a flawed policy would hurt \nthe troops and that continuing to put U.S. troops in harm's way \nsupports the troops makes no sense. By ending funding for the war, we \ncan bring our troops safely out of Iraq.\n  Walter Dellinger of Duke Law School made this point when he testified \nabout my proposal. He said:\n\n       There would not be one penny less for the salary of the \n     troops. There would not be one penny less for the benefit of \n     the troops. There would not be one penny less for weapons or \n     ammunition. There would not be one penny less for supplies or \n     support. Those troops would simply be redeployed to other \n     areas where the armed forces are utilized.\n\n  Instead of allowing the President's failed policy to continue, \nCongress can and should use its power of the purse to end our \ninvolvement in the Iraq war, safely redeploying the troops while \nensuring, as do I in my bill, that important counterterrorism and \ntraining missions are still carried out. We should be coming up with a \nstrategy for a postredeployment Iraq and the region that is squarely \nwithin the context of the global fight against al-Qaida. That means \nreplacing a massive and unsustainable and unlimited military mission \nwith a long-term strategy for mitigating the mess left behind by this \nwar. With such a strategy, we can redirect substantially more resources \nand attention to the fight against al-Qaida and other affiliated or \nsympathetic international terrorist organizations.\n  As long as this President goes unchecked by Congress, our troops will \nremain needlessly at risk and our national security will be \ncompromised.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, regardless of what happens with this \nresolution, this is just a first step--worthwhile but just a first \nstep. And the first step must be followed by stronger steps, and it \nmust be done quickly. I intend to keep pushing until the Senate votes \nto end our involvement in the Iraq war, and eventually this will happen \nbecause this is what a strong majority of the American people want. \nCongress may be able to put off its day of reckoning temporarily, the \nadministration can continue down the same failed path a while longer, \nbut all of us ignore the will of the American people at our peril. So \nlet's have this debate. Let's do it openly and honestly. Let's not \npretend anyone wants to deny our troops\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nthe equipment and resources they need. Let's not suggest that opposing \nthe President's strategy is unpatriotic and that it would give aid and \ncomfort to the enemy, that it would somehow weaken the resolve of our \ntroops. Those claims are outrageous. They are offensive, and they are \nuntrue. Do my colleagues believe the American people gave aid and \ncomfort to the enemy when they rejected the President's Iraq policy in \nNovember? Are the overwhelming majority of our constituents who oppose \nthis war trying to undermine our troops? Of course not. So how could \nanyone suggest that Congress actually acting on the will of the \nAmerican people undermines the troops or emboldens the enemy?\n  Our troops are undermined by a policy that places them in harm's way \nunnecessarily. And our enemy, our true enemy, al-Qaida and its allies, \nis emboldened by a U.S. strategy that neglects global challenges and \ninstead focuses on a single country. It is unfortunate that those who \nwish to defend this strategy would resort to these kinds of charges.\n  Let's do the job of the Senate and have full, open debate and votes \non fixing our Iraq policy. Let's not pretend that such a debate would \nharm our national security. Let's not tell ourselves that it is up to \njust the President to fix the horrible situation his failed policies \nhave created. It is our responsibility to act, too. Congress made the \ntragic mistake of authorizing this war over 4 years ago. Now Congress \nalso has the job of bringing it to a close so we can refocus on the \nterrorists and other global threats that have been neglected way too \nmuch over the past 4 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, when the roll is called tomorrow on the \nmotion for cloture with regard to the resolution the House is expected \nto pass tonight on Iraq, I will vote no. I will vote against cloture. I \nwill do so not because I wish to stifle debate. The fact is that debate \nhas occurred, it is occurring now, and it will continue to occur on our \npolicy in Iraq.\n  I will vote against cloture because I feel so strongly against the \nresolution. It condemns the new plan for success in Iraq. I support \nthat plan. It does something that, from all of the research my staff \nand I have done, including asking the Library of Congress, we have \nfound no case in American history where Congress has done what this \nresolution does, which is, in a nonbinding resolution, oppose a plan \nour military is implementing right now. Congress has expressed \nnonbinding resolutions of disapproval before a plan of military action \nhas been carried out.\n  Congress has obviously taken much more direct steps, authorized to do \nso by the Constitution, to cut off funds for a military action or a war \nin progress. But never before has the Congress of the United States \npassed a nonbinding resolution of disapproval of a military plan that \nis already being carried out by American military personnel. I believe \nit is a bad precedent, and that is why I will do everything I can to \noppose it. In the immediate context, that means I will vote against \ncloture.\n  Mr. President, more broadly, we are approaching an important moment \nin the history of this institution and of our Republic, a moment I fear \nfuture historians will look back to and see the beginning of a cycle \nthat not only damaged the remaining possibilities for success America \nhas in Iraq but, more broadly, established political precedents that \nweaken the power of the Presidency to protect the American people over \nthe long term.\n  The nonbinding resolution before us today, we all know, is only a \nprologue. That is why the fight over it, procedural and substantive, \nover these past weeks has been so intense. It is the first skirmish in \nan escalating battle that threatens to consume our Government over many \nmonths ahead, a battle that will neither solve the sprawling challenges \nwe face in Iraq nor strengthen our Nation to defeat the challenges to \nour security throughout the world from Islamist extremists--that is to \nsay, in our war against the terrorists who attacked us.\n  We still have a choice not to go down this path. It is a choice that \ngoes beyond the immediate resolution that will be before the Senate, a \nchance to step back from the brink and find better ways to express and \narbitrate our differences of opinion. I hope we will seize the moment \nand take those steps.\n  Mr. President, as we meet in this Chamber today, the battle for \nBaghdad has already begun. One of our most decorated generals, David \nPetraeus, whom this Senate confirmed 81 to 0 a few weeks ago, has now \ntaken command in Baghdad.\n  Thousands of American soldiers have moved out across the Iraqi \ncapital putting their lives on the line as they put a new strategy into \neffect. We can now see for ourselves on the ground in Iraq, in Baghdad, \nwhere it matters what this new strategy looks like. And we can see why \nit is different from all that preceded it.\n  For the first time in Baghdad, our primary focus is no longer on \ntraining Iraqi forces or chasing down insurgents or providing for our \nown force protection, though those remain objectives. Our primary focus \nis on ensuring basic security for the Iraqi people working side by side \nwith Iraqi security forces, exactly what classic counterinsurgency \ndoctrine tells us must be our first goal now.\n  Where previously there were not enough troops to hold the \nneighborhoods cleared of insurgents, now more troops are either in \nplace or on the way. Where previously American soldiers were based on \nthe outskirts of Baghdad unable to secure the city, now they are living \nand working side by side with their Iraqi counterparts on small bases \nthat are being set up right now throughout the Iraqi capital.\n  At least six of these new joint bases have already been established \nin the Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad, the same neighborhoods \nwhere a few weeks ago jihadists and death squads held sway. In the \nShiite neighborhoods of east Baghdad, American troops are also moving \nin with their Iraqi counterparts, and Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi \nArmy are moving out.\n  We do not know if this new strategy for success in Iraq will work \nover the long term, and we probably will not know for some time. The \nMahdi Army may be in retreat for the moment, but they are not defeated. \nThey have gone to ground, and they are watching. Our hope, of course, \nis that our determination and that of the Iraqi Government will lead \nthem now to devote themselves to politics instead of death squads, but \nonly time will tell.\n  The fact is any realistic assessment of the situation in Iraq tells \nus we must expect there will be more attacks and there will be more \ncasualties in the months ahead as the enemies of a free and independent \nIraq see the progress we are making and adapt to try to destroy it with \nmore violence.\n  The question they will pose to us, which is the question that is \nposed every time a fanatic suicide bomb goes off and that person \nexpresses their hatred of everyone else more than love of their own \nlife by ending their own life, is: Will we yield Baghdad, Iraq, the \nMiddle East, our own future to those fanatical suicide bombers?\n  We must also recognize we are in a different place in Iraq from where \nwe were a month ago because of the implementation of this new strategy. \nWe are in a stronger position today to provide basic security in \nBaghdad, and with that, we are in a stronger position to marginalize \nthe extremists and strengthen the moderates, a stronger position to \nfoster the economic activity that will drain the insurgency and the \nmilitias of their public support, a stronger position to press the \nIraqi leaders to make the political compromises that everyone \nacknowledges are necessary.\n  John Maynard Keynes famously said:\n\n       When the facts change, I change my mind.\n\n  In the real world, in the past month, the facts in Iraq have changed, \nand they are changing still. I ask my colleagues to allow themselves to \nwait and consider changing their minds as further facts unfold in Iraq. \nThe nonbinding resolution before us is not about stopping a \nhypothetical plan. It is about disapproving a plan that is being \ncarried out now by our fellow\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\nAmericans in uniform in the field. In that sense, as I have said, it is \nunprecedented in congressional history, in American history.\n  This resolution is about shouting into the wind. It is about ignoring \nthe realities of what is happening on the ground in Baghdad. It \nproposes nothing. It contains no plan for victory or retreat. It is a \nstrategy of ``no,'' while our soldiers are saying ``yes, sir,'' to \ntheir commanding officers as they go forward into battle. And that is \nwhy I will vote against the resolution by voting against cloture.\n  I understand the frustration, the anger, and the exhaustion that so \nmany Americans, so many Members of this Congress feel about Iraq, the \ndesire to throw up one's hands and simply say ``enough.'' And I am \npainfully aware of the enormous toll of this war in human life and of \nthe mistakes that have been made in the war's conduct. But let us now \nnot make another mistake. In the midst of a fluid and uncertain \nsituation in Iraq, we should not be so bound up in our own arguments \nand disagreements, so committed to the positions we have staked out \nthat the political battle over here takes precedence over the real \nbattle over there.\n  Whatever the passions of the moment, the point of reference for our \ndecisionmaking should be military movements on the battlefields of \nIraq, not political maneuverings in the Halls of Congress.\n  Even as our troops have begun to take Baghdad back step by step, \nthere are many in this Congress who have, nevertheless, already reached \na conclusion about the futility of America's cause there and declared \ntheir intention to put an end to this mission, not with one direct \nattempt to cut off funds but step by political step.\n  No matter what the rhetoric of this resolution, that is the reality \nof this moment. This nonbinding measure before us is a first step \ntoward a constitutional crisis that we can and must avoid. Let me \nexplain what I mean by ``a constitutional crisis.'' Let us be clear \nabout the likely consequences if we go down this path beyond this \nnonbinding resolution.\n  Congress has been given constitutional responsibilities, but the \nmicromanagement of wars is not one of them. The appropriation of funds \nfor war is. I appreciate that each of us has our own ideas about the \nbest way forward in Iraq. I respect those who take a different position \nthan I. I understand many feel strongly that the President's strategy \nis the wrong one, but the Constitution, which has served us now for \nmore than two great centuries of our history, creates not 535 \nCommanders in Chief but 1, the President of the United States, who is \nauthorized to lead the day-to-day conduct of war.\n  Whatever our preponderance of this war or its conduct, it is in no \none's interest to stumble into a debilitating confrontation between our \ntwo great branches of Government over war powers. The potential for a \nconstitutional crisis here and now is real, with congressional \ninterventions, Presidential vetoes, and Supreme Court decisions.\n  If there was ever a moment for nonpartisan cooperation to agree on a \nprocess that will respect both our personal opinions about this war and \nour Nation's interests over the long term, this is it.\n  We need to step back from the brink and reason together, as Scripture \nurges us to do, about how we will proceed to express our disagreements \nabout this war. We must recognize that while the decisions we are \nmaking today and we are about to make seem irretrievably bound up in \nthe immediacy of this moment, and the particular people now holding \npositions of power in our Government, these decisions will set \nconstitutional precedents that will go far beyond the moment and these \npeople.\n  President Bush has less than 2 years left in office, and a Democrat \nmay well succeed him. If we do not act thoughtfully in the weeks and \nmonths ahead, we will establish precedents that future Congresses, \nfuture Presidents, and future generations of Americans will regret.\n  Right now, as the battle for Baghdad begins, this institution is \nobviously deeply divided. However, we should not allow our divisions to \nlead us to a constitutional crisis in which no one wins and our \nnational security is greatly damaged.\n  We are engaged, as all my colleagues know, in a larger war against a \ntotalitarian enemy, Islamist extremism, and terrorism that seeks to \nvanquish all the democratic values that is our national purpose to \nprotect and defend.\n  Whatever our differences in this Chamber about this war, let us never \nforget those great values of freedom and democracy that unite us and \nfor which our troops have given, and today give, the last full measure \nof their devotion.\n  Yes, we should vigorously debate and deliberate. That is not only our \nright, it is our responsibility. But at this difficult junction, at \nthis moment when a real battle, a critical battle is being waged in \nBaghdad, as we face a brutal enemy who attacked us on 9/11 and wants to \ndo it again, let us not shout at one another but let us reach out to \none another to find that measure of unity that can look beyond today's \ndisagreements and secure the Nation's future and the future of all who \nwill follow us as Americans.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am so honored to be on the floor with \nSenator Joe Lieberman today and to listen to his remarks, frankly, to \nstand in the shadow of his leadership on this issue because he has been \nthat, a bipartisan leader, recognizing, as he so appropriately has \nspoken, the leadership role that a Congress should take at this time in \nour Nation's history. And he has said it well. It is not one of \nmicromanagement. It is not one of 535 generals all thinking we can act \nand think strategically about the engagement currently underway in \nBaghdad.\n  It is our job, I would hope, to stand united in behalf of the men and \nwomen we send there in uniform to accomplish what we so hope and wish \nthey will be able to accomplish, and that is the stability of Iraq, the \nallowing of the Iraqi people to once again lead their country and to \ntake from it the kind of radical Islamic fascism that is well underway \nand dominating the region.\n  Let me make a few comments this afternoon that clearly coincide with \nwhat Senator Lieberman has spoken to. This is not, nor should it ever \nbecome, a partisan issue. I think his presence on the floor this \nafternoon speaks volumes to that. This is not a partisan issue. This is \na phenomenally important national and international issue for our \ncountry to be engaged in that, frankly, few countries can engage in the \nway we have and with the kind of energy and strength we have brought to \nit.\n  The majority leader has put us in a very precarious situation, one \nthat is clearly divisive. Frankly, I can say things as a Republican \nthat maybe my colleague cannot say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2125-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2125-S2126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

I want to try to \naccommodate my colleague.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be relatively brief. I was instructed to be here at \n1:15, but I think we have had a runover of time; is that not correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. I was not here.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, if I could impose and ask for 2 minutes, so \nthat Senator Craig and myself will consume a total of 5 minutes on this \nside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am so honored to be on the floor with \nSenator Joe Lieberman today and listen to his remarks, and frankly, to \nstand in the shadow of his leadership on this issue. Because he has \nbeen that, a bipartisan leader recognizing, as he so appropriately has \nspoke, the leadership role that a Congress should take at this time in \nour Nation's history. And he has said it well, it is not one of \nmicromanagement, it is not 1 of 535 generals all thinking we can act \nstrategically and tactically about the engagement currently underway in \nBaghdad and elsewhere across Iraq.\n  It is our job, I would hope, to stand united in behalf of the men and \nwomen we send there in uniform to accomplish what we so hope and wish \nthey will be able to accomplish and that is the stability of Iraq and \nthe greater Middle East and allowing the Iraqi people to lead their \ncountry and remove from it the kind of radical Islamic fascism that is \nwell underway and dominating the region.\n  Let me make a few comments this afternoon that clearly coincide with \nwhat Senator Lieberman spoke to. This is not, nor should it ever \nbecome, a partisan issue and I think Senator Lieberman's presence on \nthe floor this afternoon speaks volumes to just that, that this is not \na partisan issue. This is a phenomenally important national and \ninternational issue for our country to be engaged in. Frankly, few \ncountries can engage in this struggle in that way we have, and with the \nkind of energy and strength that we have brought to it.\n  The majority leader has put us in a very precarious situation, one \nthat is clearly divisive. Frankly, I can say things as a Republican \nthat maybe my colleague cannot say. I believe that the majority leader \nis playing politics on the issue of calling up a nonbinding resolution, \nwhile blocking the minority from calling up a different resolution. My \ngood friend Senator Gregg has introduced a bill, a bill that I have \ncosponsored, that would express our full support for our soldiers in \nharms way and give them a much needed guarantee that they will continue \nto receive the funding they need to continue to function in their \ncritical mission. As I said, the majority leader refuses to allow us a \nvote on this bill, and I think that is plain wrong.\n  Let me make it very clear, it is not the Republicans stalling or \nshutting down debate on the issue of Iraq. In fact, it is just the \nopposite. I have spoken twice in the last 2 weeks about this issue \nbecause I believe it is very critical, both to my constituency in \nIdaho, but also to our great Nation and the world. The majority claims \nthat they want full and fair debate on this issue, yet they refuse to \nallow us to bring our own voice to this issue, and our own resolutions. \nHow can we have a full and fair debate and vote on the floor of the \nSenate if we are being held hostage by the majority leader?\n  No State goes untouched by what we do here today and no man or woman \nin uniform goes untouched. Twenty Idahoans have given their lives in \nIraq, and each of their sacrifices is sacred and honored, not just by \ntheir families and friend but by all. Most recently, SPC Ross Clevenger \nand PVT Raymond Werner of Boise, and SGT James Holtom of Rexberg were \nkilled in Iraq in an IED attack. They, like all those who have fallen \nto enemy hands, served in a heroic and gallant way for a cause they \nbelieved in and a cause that we believe in. That is the cause of \nfreedom.\n  Senator Lieberman said it well, for us to send one of our top \ngenerals and top military minds in GEN David Petraeus to Iraq and say \nby a unanimous vote that we support him and believe in his abilities, \nbut at the same time we do not support his mission, what are we saying \nas a Congress? What kind of message are we sending to our men and women \nin uniform when we speak in that manner? I think it is wrong to send \nthis message and I will vigorously oppose that message.\n  If the majority leader and his Democratic colleagues believe so \nstrongly that our mission in Iraq is so flawed, then why do we not see \nthem bringing to the floor a bill to cut off funding for our troops on \nthe ground in Iraq? As I mentioned earlier, the answer to that is a \npolitical answer, not a substance issue. Many Democrats have already \ncalled for cutting off funding and demanding an immediate withdrawal \nfrom Iraq, yet we have not seen those bills being taken up on the floor \nof either chamber. However, there are rumors that Members will choose \nto use the upcoming Iraq supplemental funding bill to force the \nPresident to take the advice of these congressional generals, rather \nthan using the advice of our military experts and commanders to execute \nour mission and secure Iraq.\n  The reason I do not support such an immediate withdrawal of our \ntroops, or cutting funding off for our troops in gun fights right now \nin the streets of Baghdad, is simple. I believe in our mission and I \nbelieve that our soldiers are the most capable in the world. The only \nenemy that can defeat American soldiers on the battlefield is the low \nmorale of the American people. A resolution condemning their actions \nand their mission in Iraq is just the kind of defeat that could \nembolden our enemies and harm our soldiers.\n  As every one of my colleagues knows, the reinforcements we are \ndebating are already in motion. In fact, the President's plan to \nstabilize Baghdad and Anbar Province are already showing signs of \nsuccess. The Iraqi government is closing down their borders with Syria \nand Iran, a critical decision that will limit the number of foreign \nfighters and enemy weapons from entering Iraq, weapons that are being \nused to kill American soldiers.\n  Lastly, I would say that our presence in Iraq does not just affect \nIraq. The greater Middle East and the security of world are at stake. \nAre we going to turn a blind eye to Iraq and allow it to become a safe \nhaven for terrorists the way that Afghanistan was under the Taliban \nregime? I certainly will do all that I can as a U.S. Senator to prevent \nthat from happening because it is in our national interests to defeat \nour enemies abroad before they can strike us again here at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2126-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RURAL SCHOOL FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me speak to you briefly regarding \nanother critical issue and that is the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunities Self-Determination Reauthorization Act.\n  When we return after our Presidents Day recess, it is vital we re-\nengage in a critical issue for timber dependent school districts in \nIdaho and across our country. This bill once referred to as Craig/\nWyden, helped many rural school districts move through a difficult time \nin their history and school children now find themselves in a very \ndifficult situation. As you may know, many rural schools in this \ncountry have funding tied directly to timber harvest from our public \nlands. For several reasons, we haven't harvested timber at our \nhistorical rate and our rural schools in those particular counties have \nsuffered.\n  I am working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues from Montana, \nOregon, Washington, California, New Mexico and of course Idaho. We all \nsee the importance of continuing this funding to some extent. I am \ncommitted, as is Senator Wyden, to ensuring the success of the bill \nthat bears our name.\n  It is my intent, as well as others, to redefine the formula. Our key \ndates to shape this critical issue are the Energy and Natural Resources \nhearing scheduled for March 1; as well as the emergency appropriations \nsupplemental debate tentatively scheduled for the middle of March.\n  The timing is at a critical point. Our timber-dependent county \nofficials and school districts are wrestling with budgets that are tied \nto this funding. I say today, clearly, failure is not an option.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2126-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2126-S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IRANIAN WEAPONS AND IRAQ RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia, truly a \nVirginia gentlemen and a good friend and a leader. I am most grateful.\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n  I join with my colleague from Idaho in saying Senator Lieberman's \nstatement is one of a true statesman, one we all ought to take to \nheart. I commend it and I will make that required reading for anybody \nwho asks about this issue.\n  Three quick points. I was asked yesterday by the media why the \ndrumbeat on Iran. Simple answer: Iran is providing the EFPs, the \nexplosively formed penetrators that are killing more and more \nAmericans. We have tried, by diplomatic pressure, to get Iran to stop. \nNow we have even caught a leader of the Quds Force, the Iranian elite \nspecial forces unit, that reports directly to the ayatollah. They are \nthere. The Iranians' special forces are there.\n  Some say, well, maybe the top leaders don't know. But how many folks \nbelieve your special forces are going to go someplace, have the devices \nthat only Iran can make, and the top leaders not know anything about \nit? That is why the drumbeat on Iran. We ought to take out the Iranian \nfighters and stop the weapons coming in.\n  Secondly, on this resolution, it not only downgrades General Petraeus \nand says that although we confirmed you unanimously, we don't believe \nin your mission, but it also says to our allies, the neighboring \ncountries that have been brought in on this new strategy--a new \nstrategy that General Petraeus is implementing--that they shouldn't \nbother to come in and help us stop the deterioration in Iraq, which \ncould lead to chaos and a takeover, and it also says to the enemy we \nare not going to be there.\n  I am taking an intel trip and will not be here for the vote. I am \nstrongly opposed to cloture on this. So by being absent, I will deny \nthose seeking the 60 votes my vote, and I strongly urge my colleagues \nwho are here to vote no.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2127-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2127-S2131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of the Iraq \nresolutions.\n  Tomorrow at 1:45, I will vote for cloture, and I do that for reasons \nthat I will set forth. I, like many of us, have to leave early this \nafternoon. I have consolidated all my State obligations and speeches \nbetween now and late tonight so I may return for the vote.\n  I want to go back and retrace the history of this debate. When I \nreturned from Iraq, with several other Senators, and Senator Levin with \nme, at that time I was chairman of the Armed Services Committee and he \nwas ranking. I indicated to the Nation by way of a press conference \nthat I felt the situation was going sideways; that our strategy was not \nworking.\n  Initially, in the days following that, I was highly criticized for \nthose remarks. Eventually, however, others began to recognize the \nsituation as I had, and, indeed, the President, when he was asked \npublicly if he supported the observations that I had made, said yes. I \ncommend the President for immediately swinging into full gear his whole \nadministration to study intensively the matters with regard to the \ncurrent strategy. It included work by the Baker-Hamilton group, which I \nthink played a very constructive role.\n  In the resolution which I prepared, with the assistance of Senator \nBen Nelson and Senator Collins, we make direct reference to that. I \nbring up that background because the President then, on January 10, \nannounced his intention to go forward with a changed strategy. The \nPresident, in that speech, specifically said:\n\n       If Members have improvements that can be made--I repeat--if \n     Members have improvements that can be made, we will make \n     them. If circumstances change, we will adjust.\n\n  Now, that was an open invitation to Members of Congress and others to \naddress this very important plan laid down by the President. Our group, \nmy 2 colleagues who worked with me, Senator Levin joining us later, and \na half dozen others, some 8 or 10, up almost to 12, joined in an honest \nforthright way in accepting the President's offer. That is how this \nstarted. In drawing up our resolution, we were careful to say, yes, we \nhad different views, but we urged the President to consider all \noptions--I repeat all options--other than the utilization of 21,500 \nindividuals to go into that situation.\n  Specifically, our resolution charges the Iraqi military with taking \nthe lead, with taking the brunt. I reiterate, the Iraqis should be \ntaking the full measure of responsibility for this Baghdad campaign. \nTherein rests this Senator's primary concern with the President's plan. \nI say that because our American GIs have fought bravely, courageously, \nand we have had sacrifice and loss of life and limb, and in no way have \nthey failed in the attempt to try to help the Iraqi people achieve \ntheir freedom, achieve their Government through elections, and to \nbecome a sovereign Nation. Now it should fall upon the over 300,000 \nIraqi troops, police, and other security officials to bring about the \ncessation of this violence in Baghdad.\n  The Iraqis are far better qualified by virtue of their understanding \nof the language. They have a far better understanding of what is it \nthat is bringing about this sectarian violence. These are the very \npeople we liberated and gave them back their sovereign land and who are \nnow fighting themselves, Sunni upon Shia, Shia upon Sunni, with wanton \nmurder and criminal activity. Our forces do not understand the \nlanguage. It is hard for those here in this Chamber to go back and look \nat the origins of the difference between the Sunni and Shia, which go \nback some 1,400 years. Our troops shouldn't be in there trying to \ndecide do we shoot at a Sunni or do we shoot at a Shia. That should be \nthe responsibility of the Iraqi forces. That is the principal reason I \nfound differences with the President.\n\n  Our leaders, the Record will reflect, have tried to reconcile the \ndifferences between our two sides. The last time I didn't support \ncloture. I did that to support the institution of the Senate, because \nthis Senate stands apart from the House, and stands apart from \nlegislatures all over the world because of the right and the freedom to \ndebate and for all to bring forth their ideas. We are behind that now. \nSo far as I know, the leaders have done their best and we were not able \nto achieve agreement, and now, procedurally, we are faced with the \nsituation of a House resolution, which will be voted on in an hour or \nmore, and will then be considered by the Senate. For that purpose, I \nwill vote cloture.\n  We supported the President in our resolution. As I read the House \nresolution, it does not reject the President's initiative to have a \ndiplomatic component to his plan. The House resolution does not reject \nthe economic aspect of what the President puts in his plan. So I say to \nmy colleagues that what comes before us does not reject outright the \nPresident's program. It directs itself to that military operation, much \nas we did in S. Con. Res. 7, and says respectfully that we urge the \nPresident to consider all options, options that were set forth in \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee by General Abizaid, when \nhe said we don't need any more troops; by General Casey, when he was up \nfor confirmation and he said he thought we only needed two brigades, \nnot five brigades.\n  So it is against that background that I think our group has come \nforth in response to the President's invitation and stated our case in \na very respectful way. This matter we will address, the House \nresolution, I do not believe rejects the entire plan of the President. \nThe components of diplomacy and the components of economics are there. \nIt is only the question of how we employ our forces. I say the burden \nfalls on the Iraqi security forces.\n  I will submit for the Record a New York Times story which appeared \nthis week outlining an operation in which we had 2,500 Americans and \nless than 100 Iraqi forces turned up to participate. I asked about this \nyesterday when questioning the Chief of Staff of the United States Army \nand the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as to what their idea of the \nplan had been, and it was represented to us that there were to be joint \nforces, a joint command.\n  Certainly this is an early report, and I cannot speak to the \nauthenticity of the article, but I have invited the Department of \nDefense to comment on it. It indicates to me that the Americans are \nbearing the brunt, not the Iraqi forces.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\n                 [From the Daily Press, Feb. 16, 2007]\n\n               Warner Questions Credibility of Bush Plan\n\n                           (By David Lerman)\n\n       The Democratic chairman and former Republican chairman of \n     the Senate Armed Services Committee questioned the \n     credibility of President Bush's new security plan for Baghdad \n     Thursday, citing news reports of an overwhelmingly American-\n     led operation despite administration promises to let Iraqi \n     forces take the lead.\n       Virginia Sen. John Warner, a senior Republican, used a \n     committee hearing to call attention to a New York Times \n     report that the first major sweep of the Iraqi capital under \n     the new security plan used only 200 Iraqi police and \n     soldiers, but 2,500 Americans.\n       Warner, who has warned against sending more Americans to \n     combat a low-grade civil war, expressed surprise that the \n     first major security sweep of Baghdad under the new plan \n     would be conducted by so few Iraqi forces. Defense officials \n     had stressed in recent weeks that U.S. troops would be \n     deployed in phases over coming months--with time allowed to \n     measure the commitment of the Iraqi government to beef up its \n     own security.\n       ``I was led to believe that as we moved out in phases, that \n     things would be in place,'' Warner said. ``This is \n     astonishing.''\n       Warner, who sponsored a resolution opposing Bush's planned \n     surge of 21,500 more American troops, added, ``That falls far \n     short of the public representation made by the administration \n     that this would be a joint operation and that Iraqis would \n     take the lead and we would be in a support role.''\n       Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the committee chairman, said he \n     was dismayed at the reported reliance on U.S. forces, saying \n     it ``runs counter to what we were told the surge would be and \n     how it would be handled.''\n       Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     described the new security plan as an Iraqi-led operation \n     during an appearance before Levin's committee earlier this \n     month.\n       ``We will not be out front by plan,'' Pace said of U.S. \n     forces. ``The Iraqis would be the ones going door-to-door, \n     knocking on doors, doing the census work, doing the kinds of \n     work that would put them out in front for the first part of \n     the--if it develops--firefight. Our troops would be available \n     to backstop them and to bring in the kind of fire support we \n     bring in. But it would not be one Iraqi and one U.S. \n     soldier.''\n       Instead, the security sweep that unfolded Wednesday in \n     three mostly Shiite neighborhoods of northeastern Baghdad was \n     largely an American operation, the New York Times reported \n     from the Iraqi capital.\n       Gen. Peter Schoomaker, chief of staff of the Army, and Gen. \n     James T. Conway, the Marine Corps commandant, told Warner \n     Thursday they were not familiar with the details of the \n     described security sweep. But Conway added, ``It is counter \n     to what I understand to be the plan as well.''\n       The public criticism of White House war strategy by two of \n     the Senate's leading voices on defense policy came as the \n     House prepared to vote today on a non-binding resolution \n     opposing Bush's troop surge. Senate Democratic leaders, \n     meanwhile, announced plans to hold a rare Saturday session to \n     vote on whether to consider the same measure after weeks of \n     procedural wrangling.\n       While the largely symbolic resolution is virtually \n     guaranteed to pass the Democrat-controlled House, the surge \n     in troops is already under way.\n       Whether it succeeds in quelling the mix of sectarian and \n     insurgent violence in Baghdad as promised could shape public \n     attitudes on Iraq far more profoundly than any vote in \n     Congress.\n       At the Pentagon late Thursday, Pace defended the progress \n     of Iraqi forces in providing more security. He cited an \n     operation about three weeks ago on Baghdad's Haifa Street, in \n     which the Iraqi army faced down Sunni insurgents, and another \n     in Najaf in which Iraqi forces battled against a Shia \n     stronghold.\n       ``To date, in the operations that have taken place since \n     the prime minister has announced that he wants to have a very \n     balanced approach to the problem, his armed forces have done \n     just that,'' Pace said.\n       Of the three Iraqi brigades scheduled to be moving into \n     Baghdad, he said, two have moved in and the third is moving \n     this month.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ntime between now and 2:05 be divided equally between myself and the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask that I be given sort of a 2-minute notice before the \ndivision.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia whom I \nthink has been unbelievably thoughtful, unbelievably patient and \ncourageous in this effort. I had the privilege of traveling with him to \nIraq, together with Senator Stevens. I could see the thought that he \nwas giving then to the ways in which he was visually perceiving that it \nwasn't working the way it was promised. There is no stronger advocate \nfor our Armed Forces. There is nobody who understands the military \nbetter, having just finished a tour as the chair of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I really think the administration should bend over backwards \nto listen to this Senator who speaks with a voice of great \nreasonableness. He is greatly respected in the Senate. I thank him for \nhis courage, for being willing to stand up on this issue.\n  The Congress, all of us, come here with a new responsibility in a \nsense. The last election could not have been more clear. People all \nacross the country registered their disapproval of the policy that was \nbeing executed in Iraq. In fact, the Iraq Study Group report was \nawaited with enormous anticipation by everybody as an opportunity to \nbring everybody together and think this through anew and find a way to \nget a legitimate, across-the-aisle, Republican/Democrat, joint effort \nin the best interests of our country. I regret to say that the best \nefforts of former Secretary of State Jim Baker; the former Attorney \nGeneral, Chief of Staff of the President, Ed Meese; another former \nSecretary of State, Larry Eagleburger; a former leader in the United \nStates Senate and moderate from the State of Wyoming, Al Simpson; and a \nformer Secretary of Defense, Bill Perry--just to name a group of those \nwho were on the Iraq Study Group--that their efforts were just cast \naside. Every recommendation they made was left on the sidelines.\n  Today we find the President adopting a policy which runs counter even \nto the advice of his own generals. Rather than listen to the advice, \nthey change the generals and they put people in who would pursue a \ndifferent policy. General Casey comes back, General Abizaid departs, \nand the policy goes on.\n  This institution has a solemn obligation to vote on this issue. It \nshould not be procedurally delayed, and it should not be played around \nwith. The fact is, the American people asked us to accept \nresponsibility for something for which we already have some \nresponsibility because we voted as an institution to empower the \nPresident to be able to send troops to Iraq, though many of us who \nvoted for that resolution never voted for the President to abuse the \npower he was given by ignoring diplomacy, rushing to war, and \nforgetting to do the planning that they had promised they would do.\n  Our troops have done their duty. Our troops have served with \nremarkable courage under the most difficult circumstances. They have a \nright, together with the American people, to expect that this Congress \ndoes its duty. That does not mean avoiding a simple vote. If you are in \nfavor of sending the troops, you have an opportunity tomorrow to \nregister that vote, say you are in favor, stand up and be counted; if \nyou are opposed you should vote no--as the House will do in a short \nperiod of time.\n  Whatever procedural games are played on the floor of the Senate will \nnever erase the perception by the American people of the responsibility \nthat we ought to be exercising. They understand that this is the time \nand this is the place and they expect us now to execute our \nresponsibility. We owe it to the troops. For all those who come to the \nSenate floor and talk about supporting the troops, responsibility for \nthe troops, what would be fair for the troops, don't demoralize the \ntroops--there is nothing more demoralizing, I will tell you, as a \nformer troop myself, than having a policy that doesn't work; sending \nyou out on missions which don't have the kind of purpose that you \nbelieve can succeed. You send these guys out in these vehicles, waiting \nto be blown up by an IED, knowing as they hold their breath that they \ndon't have an adequately armored vehicle to be able to withstand it, \nand they go out and come back and turn to each other and say: What did \nwe accomplish? What did we do? Did we secure a territory? Did we change \nminds? Did we actually hold onto some advantage gained by driving \nthrough a city in that kind of a dangerous situation?\n  Sending an additional 20,000 of our troops in the middle of a raging \ncivil war is not a sensible policy on any\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\nnumber of levels. I believe, as a matter of larger strategy, raising \nthe stakes by sending 20,000 additional troops and saying at the same \ntime, publicly, ``This is it, this is our big move, if this doesn't \nwork we don't know what,'' is an unbelievable invitation to those who \nmake mischief to make more mischief. And what's more, the very people \nwho keep saying, ``Don't set a date, don't set a timeline,'' set a \ntimeline on this very deployment because they have come to us and said \nthis is only going to be for a few months. So they announce a timeline \non the very escalation that they say is supposed to make the difference \nand advertise: If you are one of the bad guys, just wait those 3 \nmonths. That is what they can do, knowing it is only 3 months.\n\n  I think there is a smarter strategy. I think there is a better way to \nbe successful in Iraq, and it involves holding Iraqis accountable and \nsetting legitimate benchmarks for what they ought to be doing. It is \nincredible to me that some people on the other side would obstruct a \ndebate on the most fundamental issue confronting our country today. We \nare sent here to be a great deliberative body, and they don't want to \ndeliberate. They don't want to make a decision. They think somehow they \ncan just walk away and avoid responsibility for voting on the question \nof this escalation.\n  The majority leader has said they will have every opportunity to vote \non that in a short period of time. Every amendment they want to bring \nthey will have an opportunity to bring. We can have, in the meantime, a \nreal vote on Iraq.\n  Since the end of last month when we started talking about talking \nabout Iraq, 60 American troops have died in Iraq. There is a fellow by \nthe name of Kevin Landeck, whom I just learned yesterday was killed on \nFebruary 2 by an IED. Kevin Landeck comes from Wheaton, IL. He was a \nmember of a Ranger unit over there. I have a wonderful photograph, a \ndigital photograph on my computer of Kevin and a bunch of his other \ntroops standing on a stairwell celebrating Christmas. The Christmas \nstockings are all hanging from the stairwell. I am proud that our \noffice--Mary Tarr in our office particularly--has led an effort to help \nsend packages to those troops regularly. Our office sends them boxes \nfull of goodies, at Christmastime particularly--the stockings.\n  Sadly, Kevin has given his life in the ultimate act of patriotism, a \ncourageous young man, admired by his fellow soldiers. That happened \nduring the time that we couldn't even debate this issue on the floor of \nthe Senate, during a time that the Senate avoided its responsibility.\n  We have every right to expect that the people who were elected to \nprotect Kevin Landeck and the rest of those troops get this policy \nright--for their parents, for them, and for all of us.\n  I believe the only way we are going to do that is, ultimately, to be \nable to set a target date which gives the President the discretion to \nkeep troops there to complete the training. What other purpose is there \nto be there? We give the President that discretion. We give him the \ndiscretion to leave troops necessary to chase al-Qaida. We give him the \ndiscretion to be able to leave troops necessary to protect American \nforces and facilities. What other purpose would there be, after 4 \nyears, to have us there but to finish the training of the Iraqis and to \nprovide an emergency buffer against Iran and others?\n  But you don't need to be on patrol in Baghdad, carrying the brunt of \na civil war on a daily basis in order to provide that. You can be over \nthe horizon. You can be deployed in garrison. You can be rear deployed. \nThere are any number of ways to protect American interests in the \nregion, and I am tired of our colleagues on the other side suggesting \nthat a policy that clearly advantages America's position in the region, \nchanges the dynamics, shifts responsibility to the Iraqis, and \nultimately protects our troops is somehow a policy of abandonment. It \nis not. It is a policy for success. And it is to be measured against \nthe current policy, which is an invitation to more jihadists.\n  Our own intelligence agencies are telling us we are building the \nnumbers of jihadists. We are inviting more terror. The world is more \ndangerous. Iraq is less united. Iran is stronger. Hezbollah is \nstronger. Hamas is stronger. This is a failed policy, and when a policy \nis failing, day after day, leaders have an obligation to stop and get \nit right.\n  I believe that requires us to have a summit, bring the nations \ntogether to solve the issues between the stakeholders and ultimately \nresolve what our troops are powerless to resolve. A civil war is a \nstruggle for power. We have to resolve that at the diplomatic and \nnegotiating table.\n  So I strongly believe it is not enough for Congress simply to go on \nrecord opposing the President's reckless plan. Congress has an \nobligation to provide a responsible exit strategy that preserves our \ninterests in the region, retains our ability to protect the security of \nthe United States, and honors the sacrifice our troops have made.\n  Eight months ago in the Senate, 13 of us stood up against appeals to \npolitics and pride and demanded a date to bring our troops home, to \nmake Iraqis stand up for Iraq and fight a more effective war on terror. \nBut while we lost that roll call, I still believe it was the right \npolicy to put in place, to demand accountability, and to leverage \naction.\n  Now, I am more convinced than ever that a combination of serious, \nsustained diplomacy and the enforcement of benchmarks for progress by \nthe Iraqi government, leveraged by a 1-year deadline for redeployment \nof U.S. troops, is the best way to achieve our goal of stability in \nIraq and security in the region.\n  That is why I will again introduce legislation that offers a \ncomprehensive strategy for achieving a political solution and bringing \nour troops home within 1 year. We have to find a way to end this \nmisguided war, and I believe this legislation is the best and most \nresponsible way forward.\n  Let me emphasize that this strategy does not mean abandoning Iraq in \n1 year: in fact, it gives the President the discretion to leave the \nminimum number of U.S. troops necessary to complete the training of \nIraqi security forces, go after terrorists, and protect U.S. facilities \nand personnel.\n  This 1-year deadline is not arbitrary. It is consistent with the Iraq \nStudy Group's goal of withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq by the \nfirst quarter of 2008--it's consistent with the timeframe for \ntransferring control to the Iraqis set forth by General Casey, and the \nschedule agreed upon by the Iraqi government itself. Even the President \nhas said that, under his new strategy, responsibility for security \nwould be transferred to Iraqis before the end of this year. It is the \nopposite of arbitrary. The President has said it, our generals have \nsaid it, the Iraq Study Group has said it.\n  Some say those of us who oppose the President's failed policy in Iraq \ndo not offer an alternative--nothing could be further from the truth. \nThis legislation offers a comprehensive military and diplomatic \nstrategy that incorporates key recommendations of the Iraq Study \nGroup--including many that some of us here have long been advocating--\nto provide us with the best chance to succeed: holding a summit with \nall of Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria--creating an \ninternational contact group--enforcing a series of benchmarks for \nmeeting key political objectives--shifting the military mission to \ntraining Iraqi security forces and conducting targeted counterterrorism \noperations--and maintaining an over-the-horizon presence to protect our \ninterests throughout the region.\n  It is time for Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country. We \nneed a timetable which forces Iraqi politicians to confront reality and \nstart making the hard compromises they have resisted thus far. Instead, \nthey are using America's presence as a security blanket. Americans \nshould not be dying to buy time for Iraqi politicians hoping to cut a \nbetter deal. We should be working to bring about the compromise that is \nultimately the only solution to what is happening today in Iraq. And \nIraqi politicians have repeatedly shown they only respond to \ndeadlines--a deadline to transfer authority, deadlines to hold two \nelections and a referendum, and a deadline to form a government.\n\n  Without hard deadlines, our best hopes for progress in Iraq have been \nrepeatedly dashed. When Prime Minister Maliki took power in May, \nGeneral Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad said the new government had 6 \nmonths to make the political compromises necessary to win public \nconfidence and\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\nunify the country. They were right, but with no real deadline to force \nthe new government's hand, that period passed without meaningful \naction--and we are now seeing the disastrous results.\n  In fact, for 4 years now, we have been hearing from this \nadministration that progress is right around the corner. We have been \nhearing the Iraqis are near a deal on oil revenues, that they are \nmaking progress towards reconciliation--but we still haven't seen any \nresults.\n  That is why we must give teeth to the benchmarks agreed upon by the \nIraqi government for national reconciliation, security and governance. \nMeeting these benchmarks is crucial, but without any enforcement \nmechanism, they are little more than a wish list. That is why this \nlegislation supports the Iraq Study Group proposal to make U.S. \npolitical, military, or economic assistance conditional on Iraqis's \nmeeting these benchmarks.\n  A deadline is also essential to getting Iraq's neighbors to face up \nto the realities of the security needs of the region. None of them want \nto see Iraq fall apart. That should be the basis for cooperation in \nstabilizing Iraq, and yet a sense of urgency has been lacking. This \ndeadline will make clear the stakes and hopefully focus their minds on \nhelping the Iraqis reach a political solution.\n  We cannot turn back the clock and reverse the decisions that brought \nus to this pass in Iraq and the Middle East. We cannot achieve the kind \nof clear and simple victory the administration promised the American \npeople again and again even as Iraq went up in flames. But we can avoid \nan outright defeat. We can avoid creating the chaos we all say we want \nto avoid. We can avoid a victory for our adversaries by taking a clear-\neyed approach to identifying specifically what we can and cannot \naccomplish in Iraq.\n  With a new Congress comes a new responsibility: to get this policy \nright. That starts with preventing the President from going forward \nwith this senseless escalation. And it has to end with an exit strategy \nthat preserves our core interests in Iraq, in the region, and \nthroughout the world. Only then will we have honored the sacrifices of \nour troops and the wishes of those who sent us here. Only then will we \nhave done our duty.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is clear that the American \npeople want the Senate to have a debate on this issue. There is no \ndoubt about that. I very much hope that enough Senators, when we vote \ntomorrow, will vote to invoke cloture so we can do just that, have a \ndebate. I think for the Senate to not vote to invoke cloture would be \nvery irresponsible. I cannot for the life of me imagine why the Senate \nwould not conduct that vote. I very much hope when we have that vote \ntomorrow that 60 Senators, more than 60 Senators vote in favor of \ncloture so the Senate can address one of the most fundamental issues \nthat I think is on Americans' minds.\n  I was going to go to Iraq tonight because I wanted to see firsthand \nwhat is going on. I wanted to talk to troops, talk to commanders. I \nwanted to talk to not only the American personnel but also the Iraqis. \nI wanted to determine, the best I could, the degree to which Prime \nMinister Maliki and the Iraqis are able to stand on their own two feet \nand do what they are supposed to do; that is, govern and run their own \ncountry. I am not going to go over tonight, obviously. I want to be \nhere tomorrow and cast my vote so we can start debating. That is the \nright thing to do.\n  Based upon what I see in the newspapers, what I see on television, \nbased upon the comments of my colleagues who have recently been to \nIraq, I am very disturbed. To put it simply, Iraq is a mess. It is a \nmess because the United States, to some degree, started it by invading \nthe country and opened up Pandora's box and got the Shias and the \nSunnis and the Kurds all stirred up. Now they are fighting each other.\n  We did a good thing by toppling Saddam Hussein. That was the right \nthing to do. But we did not think through the consequences. We did not \nunderstand what we were doing as a country. We did not have an exit \nstrategy. We did not know what the consequences of occupation would be.\n  Certainly, the United States, with its very superior Armed Forces, \ncan very easily occupy Iraq--Baghdad. In fact, the occupation was \nprobably a little easier than many people anticipated. But when you go \nback and talk to generals, talk to defense personnel, talk to analysts, \nthey all--many of them, many of them are very clear in saying that they \nadvised the Pentagon not to go ahead and do this until we knew what we \nwere doing once we got there. It would be a big mistake, many said, to \nproceed unless we knew what we were doing.\n  Put simply, there was just no exit strategy. There was none \nwhatsoever. I have read so many reports and quotes of so many generals \nadvising us to not go into Iraq until we knew what we were doing that I \nam appalled, frankly, at how unprepared the United States was when it \nwent in.\n  All Americans, if they have any second thoughts about that statement \nI just made, they, too, would be appalled if they would read those same \nstatements. They are all in the record. They are all in the public \ndomain. I strongly urge people to read them and look at them.\n  The key here, as has been stated by the Senator from Virginia, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia, is: Can the Iraqis stand up on their own \ntwo feet? It is my belief that they are not standing up on their own \ntwo feet. Clearly, the continued civil war's death toll indicates that \nIraq is not taking control of the situation. There are so many reports \nthat the Iraqi Army is unfit and that they are not doing the job. There \nare questions about how well it is trained or is being trained. Clearly \nthe answer is, it is not being trained. They are not doing a good job.\n\n  My view is it doesn't make much sense to throw more troops, a modest \nnumber of more troops, at a failed policy. That is what it comes down \nto. The Iraqis aren't taking care of themselves, and if they aren't \ntaking care of themselves, why should we take care of them? We have \nlost so many American lives, so many Montanans, young men and women who \nhave been killed over there, and it makes no sense, in my judgment, to \nkeep doing this.\n  That is why I think we should vote on this resolution on Monday and, \nsecondly, why I think the resolution should pass. We should not \ncontinue a failed policy. I don't know very many people who think the \npolicy is working. Most think it has failed. So let's, as the U.S. \nSenate, make that statement.\n  What do we do now? If it has failed, what do we do? I don't think \nanybody has a simple answer. There is no real silver bullet here. But I \ndo think we need to give the Iraqis a set date and say to them: We are \ngoing to get out of here on this set date, and you need to know that. \nMy fear is, if we don't do that, they are just going to keep thinking \nthe United States is going to keep sending more troops and keep taking \ncare of them. It is human nature for them to do so, to think that. That \nis why I believe we should give them a definite date we will start \nbringing our troops home.\n  I also think we have to engage other countries in the region. We are \nnot doing a good job of doing that. This administration says: Well, we \ncan't talk to Iran; we shouldn't do that. We can't talk to Syria; we \nshouldn't do that. I don't understand that. It seems to me, if you want \na solution, you have to talk to people. You have to talk to people who \nare involved. We are talking to the Saudis, we are talking to the \nJordanians, the Israelis, and others in the region. That is good. But \ntwo very key players are Iran and Syria.\n  In life, we talk to our friends, but we should also talk to our \nenemies. We don't have to agree with our enemies, but we should talk to \nthem. When you start talking to people with whom you have \ndisagreements, after a while you learn there may be a common assumption \nor two. After a while you might learn something that indicates there is \nprogress. There might be a little bit of daylight once you start \ntalking to somebody. You certainly aren't going to learn anything \nunless you talk to them. The stakes are so high and the consequences \nare so great, I strongly urge the administration to start talking to \npeople. So what if the public policy was that we were not going to do \nthat in the past. Don't be stubborn. Don't be too proud. Do what is \nright.\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\nJust try to talk to the people in the region so we can find some common \nsolutions.\n  I know it is not going to be easy. It will be very difficult. But I \nknow of no other alternative--no other alternative--but to give them a \ndate and say: we are out of here; by this certain date we are going to \nstart repositioning troops elsewhere in the region. We should tell them \nthat so they sober up more--not just Prime Minister Maliki but the \nother principals in the country--and realize they have to start getting \ntheir act together. As I said, we need to have some very serious \nnegotiations with groups in the region and also with countries in the \nregion so we can manage the situation as best we possibly can.\n  This is one of the most serious issues I have confronted since I have \nbeen in the Senate in the last several years, and I commend my \ncolleagues for addressing it so seriously. It is the right thing to do. \nBut it is also the right thing to do to start debating this issue in \nthe Senate. I think we will be doing the country a great service if we \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb).

Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the resolution, \nS. 574, the Senate will vote in relation to tomorrow. This resolution \nstates simply that:\n\n       No. 1, Congress and the American people will continue to \n     support and protect the members of the United States Armed \n     Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and \n     honorably in Iraq; and No. 2, Congress disapproves of the \n     decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10, \n     2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional U.S. combat \n     troops to Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, the first paragraph of that resolution is a \ncommendable one and one every Member of this body should support, and \nwill. However, the second paragraph is simply inconsistent with a vote \nevery Member has already made and should be opposed by every Member of \nthis body. Therefore, the resolution as a whole should be opposed.\n  Exactly 3 weeks ago, on January 26, the Senate unanimously approved \nGEN David Petraeus for his fourth star and to be commander of \nmultinational forces in Iraq. No Senator opposed his nomination. In my \n12 years in the Congress, I do not think I have seen Members of \nCongress express any higher confidence or support for a nominee for any \nposition than they have for GEN David Petraeus. I have not heard anyone \ncriticize him, and rightly so.\n  In his nomination hearing, when asked about his opinion of the \nPresident's plan for Iraq that he now has the responsibility of \nexecuting, General Petraeus said:\n\n       I believe this plan can succeed if, in fact, all of those \n     enablers and all the rest of the assistance is in fact \n     provided.\n\n  General Petraeus supports this plan. Now, the same Senate that voted \nunanimously to confirm General Petraeus is going to vote on whether \nthey agree with the plan he supports and that they confirmed him \nto execute. That vote has not been taken yet, so obviously we don't \nknow the outcome.\n\n  Some people would like to mislead the American people into thinking \nthat Republicans are opposed to debating Iraq and the various \nresolutions in Iraq. In fact, Republicans welcome that debate, and that \nis why many of us are here today. However, Republicans rightfully \noppose the Democrats' dictating what resolutions can be considered.\n  If Senators truly disapprove of this decision, they should be willing \nto vote for or against a resolution that clearly expresses their \nconvictions, and that is exactly what Senator Gregg's resolution does. \nHowever, Democrats are not willing to do that. Senator Gregg's \nresolution expresses the sense of the Congress that:\n\n       No funds should be cut off or reduced from American troops \n     in the field which would result in undermining their safety \n     or ability to complete their assigned missions.\n\n  If Senators truly do not support the mission we are sending General \nPetraeus and our men and women in uniform to carry out, then they \nshould be willing to have an up-or-down vote on the Gregg resolution.\n  For the record, let me restate my position on the proposed troop \nincrease. Several weeks ago, President Bush addressed the situation in \nIraq before the American people, and everyone was anxious to hear his \nplans for a new strategy. It is clear that Americans want a victory in \nIraq; however, they do not want our presence there to be open-ended. I \nagree, and most importantly, I believe it is time for the Iraqi \nGovernment to step up and take responsibility. They need to take \ncontrol of their country, both militarily and politically. I believe \nthe Iraqis must deliver on their promises.\n  I come from a strong and proud military State, home to 13 military \ninstallations, and our service men and women have answered the call of \nduty and performed courageously. No one questions our troops' \nperformance and unwavering commitment, and we will continue to support \nthem. Many of our troops, including the 3rd Infantry Division based at \nFort Stewart, GA, and Fort Benning, GA, are preparing to head overseas, \nsome for their third tour of duty in Iraq, as we speak today.\n  The President's decision to send additional combat brigades to \nBaghdad and Anbar Province in western Iraq is aimed at defeating the \ninsurgency in those areas and increasing stability for the Iraqi \npeople. However, we must also see an increased commitment from the \nIraqis. This is also part of the new strategy, and I am committed to \nholding the administration and the Iraqis accountable in this area. \nThose of us in Congress have a responsibility to ask questions and seek \nanswers on behalf of the American people when our strategy and tactics \nare not getting the job done.\n  I have expressed my concern and frustration with progress on the part \nof the Iraqis not only to the President and the White House advisers \nbut to our military leadership testifying before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee as well. In my conversations with the White House \nand with the Department of Defense leadership, I have made it clear \nthat my support of any increase in troops is conditioned upon those \ntroops being sent on a specific mission and upon the completion of that \nmission that they should be redeployed.\n  I firmly believe that just a large increase in troops without having \na specific mission will only increase insurgent opposition and that a \nwithdrawal of U.S. forces at this time would be detrimental to Iraq's \nsecurity and extremely dangerous for American soldiers. That particular \nissue has been affirmed by every single individual in the U.S. military \ntestifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Failure in Iraq \nwill result in expanded and intensified conflict in the Middle East, \nand that kind of instability is clearly not in the best interests of \nAmerica or the international community.\n  Now that the President has taken serious steps to admit his mistakes, \ntake responsibility, and revise the strategy, Americans do seek \npositive results. It has been said by many of my colleagues, as well as \nmany of my own constituents, that the situation in Iraq requires a \npolitical and not a military solution. I strongly agree with that \nposition. However, it is not possible, in my opinion, to have a \npolitical solution or to make political progress if citizens are afraid \nto leave their homes for fear of being shot or kidnaped or if they are \nafraid to let their children go to school because it is unsafe to do \nso. Some level of order and stability must be in place before a \npolitical solution can take hold.\n  In America, we take order and stability for granted because we are \nblessed to live in a country that is extremely safe, secure, and \nstable. However, Iraq is not the same as the United States. They do not \nlive in a secure and stable society, and order and stability must be in \nplace before there can be\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\nany hope for a long-term political solution. The additional troops we \nare sending are meant to create that order and stability, particularly \nin Baghdad. Unfortunately, the Iraqi military and Government is not yet \nmature enough to do that job themselves, so we are partnering with them \nto help them succeed.\n  There is nothing easy or pretty about war, and this war is no \nexception. This war has not gone as well as any of us had hoped. \nAdditionally, the President's new plan, which is already being carried \nout in Iraq, is not guaranteed to work. However, it is my firm \nconviction that the President's plan deserves a chance to succeed, and \nwe in the Congress should do all we can to help it succeed. The Reid \nresolution does not do that. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst cloture on the motion to proceed to the Reid resolution \ntomorrow. The resolution opposes the President's plan without offering \nany alternative. It opposes the mission which the Senate has \nunanimously confirmed General Petraeus to carry out.\n\n  I urge a vote against the implementation of cloture tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, speaking to this resolution, I wish to be \nclear that it had been my intention to cast a ``no'' vote to proceeding \nto this nonbinding resolution. The majority, of course, has to muster \n60 votes in order to proceed on that particular resolution.\n  I believe my time will be more productive fulfilling a commitment I \nhave made to lead a trip to Iraq. Without disclosing when or precisely \nwhere we will be in the Middle East, I will tell my colleagues that I \nwill be able to personally deliver a message not only to our troops of \nsupport of the American people for their mission but also hopefully to \ndeliver a message directly to the Prime Minister of Iraq that we expect \nhim to continue to fulfill the commitments he has made to carry out \nthis new strategy, which has signs of success already, and to learn \ndirectly, firsthand from our commanders and troops on the ground, their \nassessment of how this new mission is proceeding. What the Congress \nneeds to do is to provide assistance and to be able to bring home a \nreport unfiltered through the media of precisely where the conditions \nstand right now.\n\n  While I would have voted no, in effect, I will be voting no by my \npresence in Iraq.\n  There are three reasons I oppose the resolution to move forward with \nthis particular nonbinding resolution. First of all, we have been \ndebating almost nonstop this subject of Iraq, now, for several weeks--\nboth in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. So there has \nbeen no lack of debate.\n  Rest assured that Republicans are committed to continuing this debate \nfor as long as the American people believe it is productive. We welcome \ndebate. We also welcome something else: The opportunity to express \nourselves in a meaningful way, not simply on a nonbinding resolution. \nWe have no objection to voting on this nonbinding resolution as long as \nwe can also vote on something that is actually more meaningful than \nthat, and that is a resolution that demonstrates we will not withdraw \nsupport for our troops. We aim to support them in their mission.\n  Having been precluded, blocked, for being able to have a vote on that \nresolution, what we are saying is that we should move forward with the \ndebate, but until the majority leader is willing to provide Members a \nvote on the resolution for support of the troops, we should not be \nvoting on other resolutions.\n  I think this is time for Democrats to take a stand. Either you \nsupport the troops in the battlefield or you don't, none of this sort \nof slow bleed and nonbinding resolution debate. The nonbinding \nresolution obscures your true position. It seems to me, if you merely \nseem to tell the President you don't like what he is doing, you have \nplenty of opportunities to do that, but a resolution can have a very \ndeleterious effect on the morale of our troops, on our enemies who see \nit as a sign of weakness, and perhaps on our allies who wonder if we \nsee the mission through.\n  If you are serious about stopping this effort because you believe it \nhas failed or cannot succeed, obviously you need to do what Congress \nhas the ability to do and that is vote no on the funding of the troops.\n  Instead, what we have been told is that in the House of \nRepresentatives, after this first step of the nonbinding resolution, \nthere will be a second step, this slow-bleed strategy, a concept that \nsays Congress will begin to micromanage how troops are deployed in the \nfield and around the world and equipment provided to them, and that \nwill determine whether any will receive Congress's continued support.\n  We cannot condition our support for the troops. They need to know \nthat when we send them into harm's way, they will have everything they \nneed from reinforcements to equipment. This sort of slow-bleed strategy \nthat has been announced over in the House of Representatives is \nextraordinarily dangerous and deleterious to our mission.\n  First of all, it seems to me there are some signs of success. This is \nthe first reason I would have voted no on the resolution. We do need to \ngive the new strategy the President has announced a chance to succeed.\n  There are plenty of stories, and I will have them printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks, about some initial successes--\nthe Shiite militia leaders appearing to leave their strongholds in \nBaghdad in anticipation of our plan to increase our activities there.\n  The powerful Shiite cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr has left Iraq, spending \nhis time in Iran away from the danger that might await him if he stayed \nin Baghdad.\n  In Al Anbar Province in the west, the tribal sheiks have now \nsignificantly begun to align themselves with the United States, as a \nresult of which we have been able to recruit hundreds more police \nofficers who were not possible to recruit in the past.\n  A real sign is the fact that Sunni and Shiite Arab lawmakers have \nannounced plans to form two new political blocs in Iraq. The Iraqi \nmilitary is taking a significantly, more robust role, now ordering tens \nof thousands of residents to leave homes--these are the so-called \nsquatters--that they are occupying illegally, and, instead, saying they \nwill have the original owners of those homes come back. This is \nimportant because the people who have been displaced or dispossessed \nprimarily are Sunnis. The Shiite militias came in and kicked them out \nand allowed squatters in their home.\n  It is highly significant the Iraqi Government has said, through a LTG \nAboud Qanbar, who is leading this new crackdown, that they are going to \nclose the borders with Iran and Syria, they are going to extend the \ncurfew in Baghdad, set up new checkpoints and reoccupy the houses that \nhave been occupied by the illegal Shiites.\n  Another significant change, they actually raided a Shiite mosque \nwhich was a center of illegally armed militias, kidnapping, torture and \nmurder activities and a place where a good deal of weapons had been \nstored. This, in the past, had not been done. But it is now being done, \nall as a part of Maliki's commitment to change the rules of engagement \nand to commit himself to support politically the victories that had \nbeen occurring on the ground militarily but which were fleeting because \nwhen you capture people and put them in jail, if the politicians get \nthem out of jail the next day, you have gained nothing. We need to give \nit a chance.\n\n  I referred to former Representative Hamilton of the Hamilton-Baker \nCommission, who said in testimony:\n\n       So I guess my bottom line on the surge is, look, the \n     president's plan ought to be given a chance. Give it a \n     chance, because we heard all of this. This that you confirmed \n     . . . the day before yesterday, this is his idea. He's the \n     supporter of it. Give it a chance.\n\n  Second, we need to support this mission and oppose the nonbinding \nresolution opposed to it because it would send a horrible message not \nonly to our troops and military leaders but to our allies and to our \nenemies.\n  General Petraeus, whom I mentioned a moment ago, at his confirmation \nhearing got this question from Senator Lieberman.\n\n       Senator Lieberman: You also said in response to a question \n     from Senator McCain that adoption of a resolution of \n     disapproval . . . would not . . . have a beneficial effect on \n     our troops in Iraq. But I want to ask you, what effect would \n     Senate passage of a resolution of disapproval of this new way \n     ahead\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\n     that you embrace--what effect would it have on our enemies in \n     Iraq?\n       Lieutenant General Petraeus: Sir, as I said in the opening \n     statement, this is a test of wills, at the end of the day. \n     And in that regard . . . a commander of such an endeavor \n     would obviously like the enemy to feel that there's no hope.\n       Senator Lieberman: And a resolution--a Senate passed \n     resolution of disapproval for this new strategy in Iraq would \n     give the enemy some encouragement, some feeling that--well, \n     some clear expression that the American people are divided.\n       Lieutenant General Petraeus: That's correct, sir.\n\n  Soldiers believe the same thing. From ABC News, on February 13, they \nasked Army 1SG Louis Barnum what they thought of the resolution. They \nhad strong words. Here is what one said:\n\n       Makes me sick. I'm a born and raised Democrat--it makes me \n     sad.\n\n  On the NBC nightly news, January 26, interview of three of our \nsoldiers.\n  SPC Tyler Johnson said:\n\n       Those people are dying. You know what I am saying? You may \n     support--'oh, we support the troops' but you're not \n     supporting what they do, what they share and sweat for, what \n     they believe for, what we die for. It just don't make sense \n     to me.\n\n  SSG Manuel Sahagun:\n\n       One thing I don't like is when people back home say they \n     support the troops but they don't support the war. If they're \n     going to support us, support us all the way.\n\n  There was in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, February 15, a poignant \ncommunication from an Army sergeant whose name is Daniel Dobson. He \nsaid:\n\n       The question has been posed to me recently what \n     congressional resolution hurts troops morale the most. No \n     doubt we would be happy to come home tomorrow. But the \n     thought is bittersweet. Most servicemembers will tell you the \n     same thing: There is no honor in retreat . . . and there is \n     no honor in what the Democrats have proposed. It stings me to \n     the core to think that Americans would rather sell their \n     honor than fight for a cause. Those of us who fight [for \n     peace] know all too well that peace has a very bloody price \n     tag.\n\n  The American people believe this as well. FOX News, according to an \nopinion dynamics poll in the last couple of days, 47 percent of the \nAmerican people say it is more likely to encourage the enemy and hurt \ntroop morale compared with 24 percent who think it would make a \npositive difference to the policy of the United States toward Iraq.\n  So we better be careful what kind of message is sent through a so-\ncalled nonbinding resolution. It would not change the course of what we \nare doing on the ground in Iraq, but it can certainly affect our enemy \nand the morale of our troops and our allies.\n  I conclude by saying it seems to me it would be a huge mistake to \nproceed to vote only on a resolution which is acknowledged by its \nproponents as being merely a first step toward a second step of \nreducing and ultimately removing support for the troops whom we have \nsent into harm's way. Far better it would be for us to continue this \ndebate at the conclusion of which we would vote on another resolution \nwhich would explicitly express our support for our troops and their \nmission.\n  To expound in further detail, I oppose this resolution and would vote \n``no'' on taking it up without considering other resolutions first, \nbecause it would put a halt to the progress which has begun to occur in \nIraq since the President announced new strategy. Some examples:\n\n\n                    shiite militias leave sadr city\n\n       Shiite militia leaders already appear to be leaving their \n     strongholds in Baghdad in anticipation of the U.S. and Iraqi \n     plan to increase the troop presence in the Iraqi capital, \n     according to the top U.S. commander in the country. ``We have \n     seen numerous indications Shia militia leaders will leave, or \n     already have left, Sadr City to avoid capture by Iraqi and \n     coalition security forces,'' Army Gen. George W. Casey, Jr. \n     said in a written statement submitted to the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee as part of his confirmation hearing today \n     to be Army chief of staff.\n\n\n                     moqtada al-sadr living in iran\n\n       The powerful Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has left Iraq \n     and has been living in Iran for the past several weeks . . . \n     With fresh American forces arriving in Baghdad as part of the \n     White House plan to stabilize the capital, officials in \n     Washington suggested that Mr. Sadr might have fled Iraq to \n     avoid being captured or killed during the crackdown.\n\n\n                   sunnis battle al qaeda in al anbar\n\n       Before tribal sheiks aligned themselves with U.S. forces in \n     the violent deserts of western Iraq, the number of people \n     willing to become police officers in the city of Ramadi--the \n     epicenter of the fight against the insurgent group known as \n     al-Qaeda in Iraq--might not have filled a single police \n     pickup. ``Last March was zero,'' said Maj. Gen. Richard C. \n     Zilmer, the Marine commander in western Iraq, referring to \n     the number of men recruited that month. With the help of a \n     confederation of about 50 Sunni Muslim tribal sheiks, the \n     U.S. military recruited more than 800 police officers in \n     December and is on track to do the same this month. Officers \n     credit the sheiks' cooperation for the diminishing violence \n     in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province.\n\n\n            sunnis and shiites move away from sect-arianism\n\n       Sunni and Shiite Arab lawmakers announced plans [January \n     31] to form two new blocs in Iraq's parliament they hope will \n     break away from the ethnic and religious mold of current \n     alliances and ease sectarian strife. But though both blocs \n     said they hoped to eventually draw in members of all ethnic \n     and religious groups, one initially will be made up entirely \n     of Shiite Muslim politicians and the other of Sunni Muslims.\n\n\n                  iraq military taking a leading role\n\n       The Iraqi government on Tuesday ordered tens of thousands \n     of Baghdad residents to leave homes they are occupying \n     illegally, in a surprising and highly challenging effort to \n     reverse the tide of sectarian cleansing that has left the \n     capital bloodied and balkanized. In a televised speech, Lt. \n     Gen. Aboud Qanbar, who is leading the new crackdown, also \n     announced the closing of Iraq's borders with Iran and Syria, \n     an extension of the curfew in Baghdad by an hour, and the \n     setup of new checkpoints run by the Defense and Interior \n     Ministries, both of which General Qanbar said he now \n     controlled.\n\n\n                iraqi security forces raid shiite mosque\n\n       A U.S. military spokesman on Thursday hailed a joint \n     American-Iraqi raid on Baghdad's leading Shiite Muslim mosque \n     as proof that the Baghdad security plan is being applied \n     evenly against all sides of the country's sectarian divide. \n     In a statement released Thursday, the U.S. military said the \n     mosque was raided ``during operations targeting illegally \n     armed militia kidnapping, torture and murder activities.'' It \n     said the mosque had been used ``to conduct sectarian violence \n     against Iraqi civilians as well as a safe haven and weapons \n     storage area for illegal militia groups.'' Sunni Muslims have \n     reported being held and beaten in the mosque, but little had \n     been done about it before. The Supreme Council's armed wing, \n     the Badr Organization, has been accused of kidnapping and \n     torturing Sunnis. The statement said U.S. forces guarded the \n     area around the mosque while Iraqi soldiers entered it with \n     the cooperation of its security guards.\n\n\nbaker and hamilton have urged the senate to capitalize on this progress\n\n       Hamilton: So I guess my bottom line on the surge is, look, \n     the president's plan ought to be given a chance. Give it a \n     chance, because we heard all of this. The general that you \n     confirmed 80-to-nothing the day before yesterday, this is his \n     idea. He's the supporter of it. Give it a chance.\n       Baker: And let me . . . read from the report with respect \n     to this issue of the surge, because there are only two \n     conditions upon our support for a surge. One is that it be \n     short-term and the other is that it be called for by the \n     commander in Iraq. President Bush said this is not an open-\n     ended commitment. Secretary Gates said this is a temporary \n     surge and . . . General Petraeus is the guy that's to carry \n     it out and he was the person that originally recommended it.\n  I also oppose this resolution because I believe it would send a \nhorrible message to our troops and our military leaders, our allies and \nour enemies.\n  The majority leader has said that he doesn't think the resolution \n``matters'' substantively, and that the politics are all that is \nimportant. He said:\n\n       Well, it doesn't matter what resolution we move forward to. \n     You know, I can count. I don't know if we'll get 60 votes. \n     But I'll tell you one thing: There are 21 Republicans up for \n     reelection this time.\n\n  I believe, contrary to the opinion of the Majority Leader, that the \nnon-binding words in this resolution do matter. Here's why.\n  General Petraeus Believes the resolution hurts his Mission.\n  This is from Petraeus' confirmation hearing:\n\n       Senator Lieberman. You also said in response to a question \n     from Senator McCain that adoption of a resolution of \n     disapproval, . . . would not . . . have a beneficial effect \n     on our troops in Iraq. But I want to ask you, what effect \n     would Senate passage of a resolution of disapproval of this \n     new way ahead that you embrace--what effect would it have on \n     our enemies in Iraq?\n       Lieutenant General Petraeus. Sir, as I stated in the \n     opening statement, this is a test of wills, at the end of the \n     day. And in that regard . . . a commander in such an endeavor \n     would obviously like the enemy to feel that there's no hope.\n       Senator Lieberman. And a resolution--a Senate-passed \n     resolution of disapproval for this new strategy in Iraq would \n     give the enemy some encouragement, some feeling that--well, \n     some clear expression that the American people were divided.\n       Lieutenant General Petraeus: That's correct, sir. Soldiers \n     believe the resolution undermines them.\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\n  ABC News, Feb. 13:\n       ABC News recently asked Army sergeants in Ramadi what they \n     thought of the resolution, and they had strong words.\n       ``Makes me sick,'' said First Sgt. Louis Barnum. [I'm] born \n     and raised a Democrat--it makes me sad.''\n       ``I don't want to bad mouth the president at all. To me[,] \n     that is treason,'' said SGT.

Those of us who fight for \n     [peace] know all too well that peace has a very bloody price \n     tag.\n\n\n The American Public Believes That The Resolution Undermines The Troops\n\n  From FOX NEWS quoting an opinion dynamics poll:\n\n       47 percent say it is more likely to encourage the enemy and \n     hurt troop morale, compared with 24 percent who think it \n     would make a positive difference to U.S. policy toward Iraq.\n\n  Finally, this resolution is but the first step in a ``slow bleed'' \nstrategy, and should be rejected for that reason as well.\n  Democrats claim that they just want an up or down vote on this \nresolution to send a message to the President, but I fear that the real \nplan is much more expansive. If this resolution passes, votes to cut \noff support for our troops and micromanaging the war won't be far \nbehind.\n  In the other Chamber, Representative Murtha has made it clear that he \nintends to bleed our troops of support for their mission in Iraq. \nSpeaking about his resolution, Murtha said: ``They won't be able to \ncontinue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the \nequipment, they don't have the training and they won't be able to do \nthe work. There's no question in my mind.''\n  Speaker Pelosi essentially endorsed this slow-bleed strategy, \naccording to reports in The Poltico this morning.\n  Those who believe that this vote is a simple gesture, and that it \nwill be the last word on the ``surge'' from this body, then why did \nSenator Feingold say on the floor just this morning that the Warner \nresolution is a ``first step''? Please listen to these additional \nquotes from some of my Democratic colleagues:\n  This is from the Foreign Relations Committee, January 24, 2007:\n\n       Senator Biden: But there's also one other thing, and I \n     commit to everyone today, and I will end with this: that \n     unless the President demonstrates very quickly that he is \n     unlikely to continue down the road he's on, this will be only \n     the first step in this committee. I will be introducing--I \n     know Senator Dodd may today introduce and another may--I know \n     Senator Obama, Senator Kerry, probably all of you have \n     binding, constitutionally legitimate, binding pieces of \n     legislation. We will bring them up.\n\n  On ``Meet The Press,'' January 28, 2007:\n\n       Mr. Russert: Do you believe that it's inevitable Democrats \n     will cut funding for the war off?\n       Senator Schumer: Well, we'll certainly ratchet up the \n     pressure against President Bush. The bottom line is that this \n     escalation, for instance, is so poorly received, not just by \n     Democrats, but by all of the American people. Our first step \n     will be this sense of the Senate resolution. But it's only \n     the first step.\n\n  From Speaker Pelosi, February 13, 2007:\n       A vote of disapproval will set the stage for additional \n     Iraq legislation which will be coming to the House floor.\n\n  If our Democratic colleagues don't intend to make this resolution the \n``first step'' in a campaign to cut off funding for our operations in \nIraq, then why won't they allow a vote on the Gregg resolution?\n  In summary, debate? Yes. But votes that are meaningful--not just on a \ncritical non-binding resolution but on a commitment of support for our \ntroops and their mission as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his remarks. I \ncertainly agree it would be a mistake to send any message that we are \nnot in support of our troops and, indeed, that is what voting on one \nmessage would do. Certainly, there are different views in the Senate \nand legitimately so. We recognize that. That is the way it is in \nCongress.\n  I resist a little bit the idea that has come up on the other side of \nthe aisle that we have not talked about this, we have not debated it. I \nsay we have talked about it, we have talked about it for several \nmonths. We have debated it. There is clearly a difference of view. Most \neveryone has the same idea that the situation must be changed and must \nbe improved there. No one argues with that.\n  The issue is that we can back off and deny the support we have for \nwhat we have accomplished or we can move forward with the President, \nwho has a change in plan. That is something we need to remember. We are \nnot talking about simply continuing to do the same thing. We have new \nleadership there, we have some new strategies there, we have some ideas \nas to what might be done.\n  Our troops continue to do an incredible job, but it has not gone as \nwell as we would like. Therefore, it is appropriate that we make some \nchanges. In order to make some changes, it is probably necessary to \nchange the arrangement we have, change the numbers so we can do \nsomething and to begin again to devise a movement that will get us out \nof there in a relatively short time.\n  Our military leaders know that. They accept that. Their plans embrace \nthat idea that we have to do something different, that we have to start \ncoming to some transition and conclusion. The President also has \nacknowledged this.\n  It is not simple. None of us like war. None of us like to have our \ntroops at risk, there is no question about that. But the fact is there \nexists a terrorism threat to the United States, somewhat centered in \nthis area. The fact is, we need to complete the task and to be able to \nturn some stability over to a government in Iraq that can move forward.\n  The United States cannot complete this mission alone. And the Iraqis, \nof course, must keep their commitment to do more than they have. \nFortunately, we are seeing some movement in that direction. We are \nseeing the support building, and we need to continue to press for that \nwith the surrounding countries.\n  The President has made it very clear to the Iraqi President that our \nsupport is not open-ended. I hope we continue to do that.\n  The administration has installed new leadership. We have had good \nperformance there, but we need to be moving in a somewhat different \ndirection, a change from what we are doing. That is the plan. That is \nwhat it is all about.\n  I am a little discouraged that we act as if we have not talked about \nit, we act as if we have not made a move upon it, and now we have a \nnonbinding resolution. But as the previous speaker said, we also need \nto offer more than one amendment. There are different options. We have \nto recognize the Senate is close in numbers, and we have some \ndifferences. We have to have an opportunity to talk about different \nthings. Hopefully, that is what this is all about.\n  It is peculiar political posturing to sound off with sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions on the heels of having unanimously confirmed the \ngeneral who is going over there to take over. He has a plan. It would \nbe discouraging to him, I am sure, to learn we are sending him over \nthere, but we are not going to do the things he needs to do. It is \nimportant for folks to understand this plan does not involve just \nsending troops and put a bandaid on the problem. We have commitments \nfrom the Iraqi Government to step up security and reconciliation \nefforts. We need to make\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\ndecisions from where we are now at this point in the fight to move in a \nsomewhat different direction.\n  One thing is for sure. We are not moving the ball by just talking \nfrom the sidelines. Here we have an opportunity to do that--not a \nnever-ending commitment but one to make some changes, complete this \ntask. However, of course, it is a little premature to be debating a \nnonbinding resolution but, nevertheless, we have different views and \nthat is where we are, and that is fine. But I think, in fairness, \npolitically, we do need to have the opportunity to act on more than \njust a single amendment so we can have some chance to talk about other \nitems that have an impact on Iraq.\n  The resolution will only serve to score political points and \nundermines our efforts to achieve a positive result in what we are \nseeking to do. So I am concerned today with respect to this process, \nbut we can make it work. And we need to make it work. Here we are. \nLet's make sure we have an opportunity to make it balanced, we have an \nopportunity to talk about both sides, we have an opportunity to talk \nabout some of the other kinds of opportunities.\n  The majority will not let the minority offer amendments, and they \nshould. This is not a one-sided debate, and there are certain items we \nneed to discuss.\n  Leader McConnell has made more than one good-faith effort to meet the \nmajority in the middle of the aisle, and we, I hope, will continue to \ndo that. We must do that. We have proposed to give the majority the \nvotes they want if they will simply give us the votes we would like to \nhave. That seems to make a great deal of sense.\n  So we are in sort of a procedural tie-up on something for which we \nknow there are differences on the policy, clearly, and we will simply \nhave to work on that. And we have to recognize the responsibility and \nthe commitment the President has made and the plan he has to change \nthings there so we can go forward. So we need to give the troops and \nthe Iraqis the opportunity to work more to change the situation there.\n  So the purpose of this whole exercise, of course, is to put a \ngovernment in place in Iraq so they can take care of themselves, for us \nto be able to remove our being there and our commitment there. I think \nwe have a chance to do this. So I hope if we are going to move, we have \na chance to move on more than one opportunity and one resolution. And I \nthink that will be the case.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come before the body today to let my \ncolleagues know I intend to vote for cloture on the single and simple \nresolution that will be before this body tomorrow afternoon.\n  When one looks at the content of what is included in this resolution, \nit is very simple. In its simplest terms, it says, firsts and foremost, \nwe support our troops. We support our troops. Who in this body would \ndisagree with that statement?\n  Secondly, it makes another statement, another important but very \nsimple statement, and that is that we disagree with the President's \nplan to add an additional 21,500 troops into Iraq. We disagree with the \nPresident's plan.\n  That is a simple resolution. We should be able to bring that \nresolution to this floor. We should be able to have it debated. And we \nshould be able to have an up-or-down vote on that resolution.\n  I wish it were otherwise. I wish that, in fact, we were debating the \nvarious resolutions that have been suggested that we debate on this \nfloor by the majority leader in the last week, where he has offered the \nminority leader on the Republican side the opportunity to come in and \ndebate the Warner resolution, the McCain-Lieberman resolution, as well \nas this resolution, and a number of different configurations which have \nbeen offered to the minority party.\n  But the reality today is this Chamber, through the minority party, \nwants to stop a vote on any resolution relating to Iraq. They simply \nwant to stop a vote. What we need to do as a Chamber, in my view, is to \nmove forward with the deliberation of the great Senators who are a part \nof this Senate and have a robust debate on Iraq that sets forth the \ndifferent alternatives that have been presented and come to some kind \nof conclusion that gives direction to America and to this country on \nhow we ought to move forward in Iraq.\n  I wish we were here in part debating the Warner-Levin resolution \nbecause when you think about the content of the Warner-Levin \nresolution, in that resolution you also find what I believe is the best \nof what we have to offer. You have a thoughtful proposal that says, \nyes, we disagree with the President, but we also have a new direction \nin which we believe we ought to march forward in Iraq. That bipartisan \nresolution, that was largely drafted by Senator Warner and Senator \nNelson and Senator Collins, of which I am a cosponsor, is a way \nforward. It is a way to describe a new direction for us as we move \nforward in Iraq.\n  I also wish we were here today and tomorrow, and even into next week, \ndebating the resolution which has been brought forward by my dear \nfriends, Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain. They have a different \npoint of view than other Members of this body. They have a different \npoint of view than Senator Warner and I do with respect to how we ought \nto move forward in Iraq. But, nonetheless, they are people of good \nfaith who have a point of view that ought to be debated in this body, \nand we ought to have a vote on it.\n  Unfortunately, the procedural mechanisms which have been put forward \nby the minority party will keep us from actually debating that \nparticular resolution and having a debate and a vote on that \nresolution.\n  I believe the ultimate goal we all have in this Chamber is we want to \nhave peace in Iraq, and we want to have a peaceful Middle East. But I \nalso believe that unless we are able to find some way of working \ntogether in a bipartisan manner, that key ingredient of how we find a \npeaceful avenue in Iraq and in the Middle East is going to elude us.\n\n  For sure, today is simply one of the opening chapters of the great \ndebate we will have in this Chamber in the weeks and months, perhaps \neven in the years, ahead with respect to how we move forward in Iraq \nand how we move forward in the Middle East. Without a sense of \nbipartisanship, we will not be able to find that unity which is an \nessential ingredient for us to be able to move forward.\n  It dismays me we have not been able to find the bipartisanship to get \nus to the 60-vote threshold so we can move forward and have a robust \ndebate on this issue that will be before the body tomorrow, as well as \nother issues and resolutions that would be brought forward by my \ncolleagues.\n  As I speak at this time, the House of Representatives--just right \ndown the hallway from where I stand right now--is about ready to begin \na vote--a vote--on this very simple resolution. And again, its \nsimplicity defies any logic as to why we would not want to vote on it \nin the Senate. It is very simple: We support our troops, and we \ndisagree with the President's proposed escalation of troops by 21,500.\n  It is right that we are here this afternoon and into Saturday \ndebating the vote on that simple resolution. That resolution addresses \nthe most critical and important issue before our Nation today. I deeply \nregret the Senate has been prevented from voting on a similar \nresolution, and that is why I will vote for cloture on this resolution \ntomorrow. I believe the Senate has an obligation--it has an \nobligation--to debate and to vote on the issue that is most important \nto America today.\n  For me, my constituents in Colorado know where I stand. I am a \ncosponsor of the bipartisan resolution which Senator Warner and Senator \nNelson and Senator Collins and others have worked on for some time. \nThat resolution states in clear terms that the Senate disagrees with \nthe President's plan to send more troops to Iraq. And, at the same \ntime, that resolution truly offers a new way for us to move forward \nwith this seemingly intractable problem we face in that part of the \nworld.\n  I have referred to the Warner resolution as a new way forward, a new \nplan, a plan C, if you will, because it finds a middle ground between \nthe President's plan A, which is to escalate the military effort in \nIraq, and plan B, which is pushed by some American citizens in\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\neach one of our offices every day who say we should immediately leave \nIraq--we should immediately leave Iraq. From my point of view, the \nbipartisan resolution we came up with offers a new direction forward.\n  Our bipartisan group believes what we need to do is to have a new \nstrategy in Iraq, one based on demanding long-overdue compromises from \nthe Iraqi Government, vigorous counterterrorism activity, continued \nsupport of our troops in the field, protecting the territorial \nintegrity of Iraq, and a very robust and enhanced diplomatic effort in \nthat region and in Iraq itself.\n  The new way forward reflected in the Warner resolution is based on a \nnumber of key principles, as follows:\n  First, the central goal of the American mission in Iraq should be to \nencourage the Iraqi Government to make the political compromises that \nare necessary to foster reconciliation and to improve the deteriorating \nsecurity situation in Iraq.\n  Second, the American military strategy should be focused on \nmaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying terrorists a \nsafe haven, promoting regional stability, bringing security to Baghdad, \nand training--and training--and equipping the Iraqi forces.\n  These are important principles, and they continue.\n  Third, we say what we would like to see happen in Iraq is that the \nUnited States should engage the nations in that region to develop a \nregional peace and reconciliation process.\n  Fourth, we believe the United States should continue to engage in a \nstrong counterterrorism activity, chasing down al-Qaida wherever al-\nQaida might be.\n  Fifth, the American mission in Iraq should be conditioned upon the \nIraqi Government meeting certain benchmarks, including ensuring an \nequitable distribution of oil revenues in that country.\n  And sixth, Congress should not eliminate or reduce funds for troops \nin the field because the brave men and women fighting this war need our \nsupport while they are in harm's way.\n  I believe plan C offers us the right way forward. It is my hope that \nresolution ultimately would be adopted by a large bipartisan group of \nSenators in this body.\n  I would like to discuss in further detail a couple of the key \nelements, at least in terms of how I see it, on how we move forward, on \nhow we improve the security situation along Iraq's borders, and the \nneed for an enhanced and much more robust diplomatic effort.\n  I believe the territorial integrity of Iraq, security along Iraq's \nborders, and, for that matter, security in the region is linked with \nthe need for a renewed and vigorous diplomatic push.\n  The bipartisan Iraq Study Group stated in very simple terms:\n\n       The United States must build a new international consensus \n     for stability in Iraq and the region. In order to foster such \n     a consensus, the United States should embark on a robust \n     diplomatic effort to establish an international support \n     structure intended to stabilize Iraq and ease tensions in \n     other countries in the region.\n\n  In addition, the public portion of the National Intelligence \nEstimate--which was a consensus document produced by the 16 agencies \ncomprising the national intelligence community--mentioned three things \nwhich could ``help to reverse the negative trends driving Iraq's \ncurrent trajectory.'' It is important to note that each of these three \nstrategies proposed by the NIE are fundamentally diplomatic and \npolitical, as opposed to military.\n  They are, first of all, a recommendation that the broader Sunni \nacceptance of the current political structure and federalism be brought \nabout; secondly, that significant concessions by Shia and Kurds are \nrequired to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism; and, \nthird, a bottom-up approach is needed to help mend the frayed \nrelationships between the tribal and religious groups.\n  The two most important documents produced on the Iraq war over the \npast 6 months, the Iraq Study Group report and the public portions of \nthe NIE, recommend a renewed diplomatic and political effort as a \nkeystone for security inside Iraq and in the region.\n  This is no surprise when you consider the situation along the borders \nof Iraq. To the east, we know of the damage Iran can potentially cause \nby crossing the relatively porous border in order to promote the Shia \ncause. Not only that, but Iran has steadfastly ignored the U.N.'s \ndemand to halt their nuclear activities. To the south and west, Saudi \nArabia might eventually decide to intervene on the side of the Sunnis, \nshould the situation further deteriorate. To the north and west, of \ncourse, is Syria, which has a largely uncontrolled border with Iraq, \nacross which foreign fighters and arms and terrorists cross even today \nas I speak. To the north is Turkey, which is watching the situation in \nIraq and might decide to intervene in order to prevent an independent \nKurdistan. Finally, Jordan, to the west, is feeling the strain of the \nmassive influx of Iraqi refugees into their country, which could have a \ndestabilizing effect on a country which is such an important ally of \nthe United States.\n  Given the potential crisis on Iraq's east, west, north, and south \nborders, given the complex and conflicting interests the parties in the \nregion face, and given the difficulty of imposing a military solution \non this expanding, deteriorating puzzle, it is imperative to embark on \na renewed and robust diplomatic and political effort in the manner \noutlined in the Warner resolution. That effort, in my view, must \ninclude the following:\n  First, it must include talks with each of the key players in the \nregion. I agree with the Iraq Study Group report which stated that:\n\n       The United States should engage directly with Iran and \n     Syria in order to try to obtain the commitment to \n     constructive policies toward Iraq and other regional issues. \n     In engaging Syria and Iran, the United States should consider \n     incentives, as well as disincentives, in seeking constructive \n     results.\n\n  This does not mean direct talks will necessarily succeed quickly or \neven succeed at all. But it does mean the United States should use \nevery available carrot and stick, every diplomatic tool we have to try \nto stabilize the region.\n  Second, the United States and those who share a vision of a peaceful \nMiddle East should organize an international conference to help the \nIraqis promote national reconciliation and stronger relations with \ntheir neighbors.\n  Third, we should heed the advice of the Iraq Study Group and promote \nthe creation of an Iraq international support group which would include \neach country that borders Iraq and other key countries in the region. \nThat support group would work to strengthen Iraq's territorial and \nsovereign integrity and would provide a diplomatic forum for Iraq's \nneighbors, many of whom have competing and conflicting interests to \nnegotiate.\n  We may very well engage Iraq's neighbors and find we cannot achieve \ncommon ground. But I believe that refusing to talk to our adversaries \non principle simply because they are our adversaries has done us no \ngood. Indeed, in our history, Presidents from both parties and of \ndifferent ideological stripes, from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald \nReagan, have actively engaged countries and leaders with whom they \nstrongly disagreed, and they did so because it was in the American \nnational interest. In fact, even this administration diplomatically \nengaged a member of the so-called ``axis of evil,'' North Korea. And \nwhile this process was long and laborious, it appears to have borne \nfruit. I believe we are at a similar moment in Iraq, when a strong and \ntough diplomatic effort may offer our last best chance to achieve a \nmeasure of peace and stability for Iraq and for the region.\n  For that reason, I believe we should follow the advice of the Iraq \nStudy Group, the authors of the National Intelligence Estimate, and the \nadvice of Senators from both sides of the aisle in pursuing a new \ndirection in Iraq. There are no guarantees of success, but we must make \nevery effort to succeed before it is too late.\n  I want to make a statement relative to why I think it is such an \nimportant time for us to be involved in this debate. It was not that \nlong ago when I went with two of the most distinguished Senators in \nthis body to Iraq and Afghanistan and spent time in both countries with \nboth Senator Warner and Senator Levin. For all of us who are Members of \nthis body, there are no two Senators whom we hold in higher esteem. \nThey truly are Senators whom I would call ``a Senator's Senator'' \nbecause they have the respect of\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\ntheir colleagues. They have the wisdom they have accumulated through \ntheir service to our country over decades, and they are always \nattempting to do what is best for the American interest. I remember in \nBaghdad having conversations with both Senator Warner and Senator Levin \nand how they described how things had changed from the initial invasion \nto the time we were there in the heavily fortified Green Zone in \nBaghdad and as we traveled around the country.\n\n  Since that time, Senator Warner and others have been back there. As \nwe have heard in this Chamber, the distinguished Senator from Virginia \ntalked about how 3 or 4 months ago, he described the situation in Iraq \nas drifting sideways. Today that situation is not only drifting \nsideways but it continues to deteriorate. So no matter how much our \ntroops have done, the sacrifice they have made, the sacrifices their \nfamilies have made, things have not only drifted sideways, they \ncontinue to deteriorate. The President's proposal, which is at the \nheart of this debate, has to do with whether we should send 21,500 more \ntroops into harm's way. We should all ask the question whether that is \nsomething we shouldn't support, and we should have an opportunity to \nvote on that concept in this Chamber. We should have an opportunity to \nvote on that concept in this Chamber before the President moves forward \nwith the escalation effort.\n  In my view, and part of the reason I joined Senator Warner and \nSenator Nelson and others in their resolution, I don't believe it will \nwork. I believe when we look at Operation Going Forward Together in \nJune and Operation Going Forward Together 2 in August, they demonstrate \nthat a surge of this kind will, in fact, not work. Indeed, the Iraq \nStudy Group found that between the months of June and the time they \nissued their report, violence had escalated in Baghdad by 43 percent. \nSo we have tried a surge twice, and it has failed. Now the President is \nsaying we ought to go ahead and do yet another surge. I believe a \nsimple resolution we can vote on that makes a simple statement that we \nsupport our troops and we oppose the escalation of the military effort \nin Iraq in the way the President has proposed is the right thing for us \nto vote on. It is the most important question of our time. It is \nappropriate for us to be spending this Friday and Saturday, and, if it \nso takes, all of next week, instead of going back to our respective \nStates and working during the Presidents holiday to debate this issue, \nwhich is such a defining issue of our time. This is a defining issue \nfor the 21st century, not only for Iraq but for the Middle East, for \nthe war on terror which we wage around the globe; this is the defining \nissue, and it is appropriate for us to be having this discussion on the \nfloor today. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity to move forward \ninto the debate on this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the cloture vote on \nthe motion to proceed to S. 574. I will vote in opposition to moving \nforward on that resolution because I don't believe it offers me the \nopportunity to express what I believe this body should be doing on the \nwar on terror and the war in Iraq and for our men and women in harm's \nway. I want to take a minute to explain as well as I can why I believe \nso strongly and so passionately in that regard.\n  Ironically, 30 minutes before I came to the Chamber, I got a press \nrelease from the Department of Defense announcing that deployment of \nover 1,000 members of the 3rd ID stationed at Fort Stewart, GA has been \naccelerated from June to March of 2007. Those soldiers will shortly be \nleaving our great State on their way to be deployed in Baghdad, \nspecifically as a part of the President's mission to secure and hold \nand to build.\n  I can't be certain of this, but I imagine some of those soldiers are \nprobably watching television today in Hinesville, GA. They might even \nbe watching C-SPAN. They might even hear these remarks. So I make them \nin the belief and with the hope that they are listening, as well as \nthose soldiers in Baghdad and Balad and Tallil who are watching their \nmonitors in the mess hall or the command post, as well as those who are \nour enemies, those who would do us harm, those who are the reason we \nare in Iraq and Afghanistan today.\n  It is not right to send a mixed message in a nonbinding resolution \nwhile our men and women are deploying in defense of this country and at \nthe order of the President, our Commander in Chief. The result of that \nis to send a message of doubt to our men and women and a message of \nhope to our enemy. We can have our differences--and anybody who watches \nthe debate on this floor knows, we certainly have our differences--but \nthere should be no difference or equivocation in the support of our men \nand women in harm's way and our men and women now on the ground in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  For a minute I want to talk about how deeply I believe in our \noptions, because we only have two. The first is an opportunity for \nsuccess. That is what the President has chosen. This surge, criticized \nby some, is even a part of the Hamilton-Baker report where they \naddressed a potential surge in their report. The President, after \nlistening to many of us and to his commanders and, certainly to General \nPetraeus, has decided to deploy these troops to go into Baghdad, to go \ninto Anbar, to secure it; and then, with the help of the Iraqi \nsoldiers, to hold; and then, with the help of USAID, the State \nDepartment, and the world community, to build and to have a platform \nand a foundation upon which political reconciliation will take place. \nEvery one of us knows that, ultimately, reconciliation will make the \ndifference in whether our hopes and dreams for the Iraqi people and the \nhopes and dreams they have for themselves will, in fact, take place.\n  I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. I sat through 28 hours of \ntestimony from countless experts, one after another. Most of them had \nmixed feelings on the surge. Some were unalterably opposed. Some said \nit may work. Some said it would work. They had differences of opinion, \nas we do. But in 28 hours of testimony, from expert after expert, from \nMadeleine Albright to Henry Kissinger, from think tank after think \ntank, from Jack Murtha and Newt Gingrich--Newt a former Speaker of the \nHouse; Jack certainly outspoken on this issue in the House--every one \nof them agreed on one fact: A redeployment of our troops or a \nwithdrawal would lead, at the very least, to thousands of deaths and \nmore likely the slaughter of tens of thousands and maybe even millions \nof people in Iraq and possibly beyond in the Middle East.\n  Withdrawing, repositioning, turning our back is a recipe for \ndisaster. And the world knows how important our success is. I spent \nlast weekend in Munich, Germany, at the World Security Conference, \nwhere Vladimir Putin and the Iranian Foreign Secretary and Prime \nMinister spoke. We met with Chancellor Merkel of Germany and \nrepresentatives from Bulgaria, Estonia, and Japan. Do you know what is \nso eye opening to me? With rare exception, each one expressed their \nappreciation for what the United States of America and our allies are \ndoing, and their hope and prayer is we will succeed. They know what we \nknow: We are in the ultimate war between good and evil. Iraq is but a \nbattle in the war on terror that will move to other places. If we ever \ngive comfort or hope to our enemy that we may turn and come home, leave \nthe battlefield, leave them to their own volition, then we know it is \nthe beginning of the end for the peaceful societies and the democracies \nof this world.\n  Chancellor Merkel of Germany--a country where popular opinion is very \nmuch against the war--announced her commitment of more Tornadoes to be \ndeployed to Afghanistan. We have 46,000 troops there--23,000 Americans \nand 23,000 from countries around the world--pursuing to keep that \nfledgling democracy secure as the Taliban makes one last effort.\n  The enthusiasm of the world is in support of the United States and \nour men and women in harm's way. I think that enthusiasm should take \nplace on the Senate floor in the United States of America as well. My \nvote tomorrow of ``no'' on the motion to proceed will not be a desire \nto cut off debate. It will, in fact, be a desire to elevate the debate. \nI think every side that is represented on this Senate floor ought to be \na side that is spoken. I personally prefer the Gregg amendment and do \nnot prefer and would not vote for the resolution\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nof the Senator from Nevada, which is the same resolution now being \ndebated on the floor of the Senate. I think I ought to have an \nopportunity to express to the thousand members of 3rd ID leaving to go \nto Iraq, to the men and women in Iraq who are listening, and to the \nconstituents I have in the State, regardless of which side of the issue \nthey are on--the Senate deserves a right to debate all of the valid \npoints of the questions that confront us in Iraq.\n  I know earlier in a speech given on the floor the content was \nprimarily a recitation of the names of those who have died in uniform \nin Iraq from the United States of America. I don't take the position I \ntake lightly, nor do I not think for a moment about the sacrifice that \nhas already been made by men and women from my State--from PFC Diego \nRincon, the first Georgian to lose his life fighting in Iraq--Diego, by \nthe way, was not a United States citizen when he died, and we gave him \ncitizenship posthumously because of the commitment he made to this \ncountry--to LT Noah Harris, from Elijay, GA, who was a cheerleader at \nthe University of Georgia on 9/11. He was so moved by what happened \nthat he jumped into ROTC in his junior year and pursued a commission in \nthe United States Army, received it, and went to Iraq. He died fighting \nfor what he believed this country was all about: to stand up to the \nagents of terror and those who would use it to pursue their cause. \nAlso, there was SGT Mike Stokely, a brave American who died in pursuit \nof freedom and peace in Iraq, and the hundreds of other Georgians who \nhave been wounded or sacrificed their lives. They should not die in \nvain. They went for the reason that they believed volunteers are \nimportant to them and their country. They volunteered and made that \ncommitment knowingly and willingly. They deserve the chance to pursue \nthis effort for success in Baghdad and Anbar with enthusiasm from our \nSenate and our Government. From me, they have that.\n  When we read a list of those who lost their lives, we have to \nremember how long the list is of those who live today because our men \nand women in the Armed Forces, in wars past and in war today, fight for \nsecurity and peace and fight for us to live.\n  We saw on 9/11 the manifest horror tyranny and terror can bring, and \nwe will see it again if we lose our resolve to pursue it wherever it \ntakes us--Afghanistan, Iraq, or places yet known to us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, with the confidence and pride in \nthe men and women who serve in the Armed Forces and my willingness to \nfully support an opportunity for success rather than a recipe for \ndisaster.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand I \nhave 15 minutes within which to make my remarks; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 8 minutes remaining at this \ntime. It would take consent to extend that time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed and make my remarks in 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, some weeks ago--and I mentioned this in my remarks \nduring the debate we were having on the resolutions with regard to Iraq \nand the war--I said several weeks ago I had the privilege of attending \nand speaking at a farewell dinner in honor of LTG David Petraeus and \nhis wife Holly at the Command and General Staff College of the United \nStates Army at Fort Leavenworth, KS. And, of course, now General \nPetraeus is in Iraq and involved in the new mission as prescribed by \nthe President and the subject of great debate not only here but in the \nHouse of Representatives, which is voting as I speak on their \nresolution in regard to this matter.\n  It was quite an evening of tribute in behalf of the general who has \nbecome admired and beloved serving as commanding general of the Army's \nIntellectual Center in Leavenworth, KS. Throughout the evening I had \nthe opportunity to again visit with David Petraeus, his feelings about \nhis new mission, his impressive knowledge with regard to this most \ndifficult war in Iraq, the history of the region, his understanding \nwith regard to the nature of past wars, his understanding of insurgency \nin past wars and the insurgency we now face in Iraq.\n  While at the Command and General Staff College, he wrote the Army's \nnew manual on counterterrorism. Let me say, as a former marine, as the \nPresiding Officer is as well, I helped write a similar manual years ago \nfor the U.S. Marine Corps. So I find this man unique in his knowledge \nand his command ability. But when I was asked to make remarks after the \ndinner--they would always invite a Senator to make some remarks and, \nunfortunately, sometimes that turns into a speech--I was glad I said \nwhat I said, and virtually everybody in that room told me I had said \nwhat they cannot say. Those who wear their officer rank on their \nshoulders or their enlisted stripes on their sleeves in most cases do \nnot comment on policy decisions or politics, no matter how strongly \nthey feel. They follow orders, and they serve their country. But I \nbelieve my remarks to the general and his officer corps and the \nveterans of many previous wars are pertinent to the issue we face in \nthis debate.\n  Before I express my views, I want to stress that I regret we are at a \nstalemate in this body. Obviously, they are not in the other body, in \nterms of a vote at least, on this issue of vital national security. I \nthink most in the Senate wish we could debate this issue with comity, \nwith cooperation, and, yes, in a bipartisan fashion. And I think the \nAmerican people who are concerned, obviously frustrated and angry about \nthe war, would certainly appreciate that, but that is not the case. \nThis issue, very unfortunately, is wrapped around a partisan and \npolitical axle.\n  Our good friends across the aisle insist that we debate and vote on \none of three nonbinding resolutions--there may have been an agreement \non maybe one more vote--in regard to the war in Iraq, and that is all. \nThey wish to debate and vote on the House resolution which is now being \ndebated in the other body and about to come to a conclusion, or the \nWarner resolution, which I think are very similar, and then call it a \nday because both resolutions support the troops but not the mission.\n  This is the rub for many of my colleagues and myself, and it is about \nas far as the majority wishes to wade in the waters of withdrawal at \nthis time. I realize if we were to consider other votes, it would be \nmore pertinent to the issue, especially the amendment by Senator \nFeingold, and that would be wading in the water a little deeper than \nthey would want to at this particular time.\n  Others of us wish to debate and vote on the McCain resolution--I hope \nwe can do that--and the Gregg resolution and, as far as I am concerned, \nthe Feingold resolution. I oppose the Feingold resolution, but I admire \nhis forthrightness and his courage. But we are being denied that \nopportunity.\n  Most perplexing to me is that those who are covering this debate \nwithin the media--and it is never a good idea to say anything that \ncould be possibly defined as critical of the media. I note there are \nnone or there may be two, but, obviously, everybody is watching the \nvote on the House side.\n  Having said that, how on Earth can we describe this situation by \nwriting headlines and 15-second news sound bites saying Republicans, \nlike myself, have voted to stifle debate? I want to debate. Let's have \na debate. Let's have a full debate and vote on the House resolution \nand/or the Warner resolution--vote on both of them--but let us also \ndebate and vote on resolutions offered by Senators McCain, Gregg, and \nFeingold. I will vote for Senator McCain's resolution. I will vote \nalong with Senator Gregg. I would not vote for Senator Feingold's \nresolution but, again, I think his resolution is probably the most \ndetermining in terms of effect, and he should get a vote.\n  We are not stifling or shutting down debate; our colleagues in the \nmajority\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nare. Either we are not capable of explaining what I believe is a very \nsimple proposition or some in the media cannot discern what is obvious. \nThis is like playing baseball, although it isn't like playing \nbaseball--that is a poor allegory, but it is the one I have chosen--\nplaying baseball with one strike and then you are out. You say: Wait a \nminute, usually in a baseball game you get three strikes. What happened \nto the three strikes? Where are my other two strikes? Where are my \nother resolutions that I want to debate, that I want to support because \nthey are pertinent to this, certainly as much as the others? They are \nnonbinding as well. And the umpire--in this particular case the \ndistinguished majority leader--says: Back to the dugout, Senator \nRoberts, I am sorry. We run this ball game. You don't have any further \nstrikes.\n\n  I have information that the House has just passed the House \nresolution 246 to 182. That is a pretty solid vote. So, obviously, we \nwill be getting to vote on that resolution, and I hope we will get to \nvote on these other resolutions.\n  In my remarks at the Command and General Staff College, I told \nGeneral Petraeus we had not been personally acquainted over a long \nperiod of years, but in our short span of time, I certainly came to \nknow him well. I have had several stimulating and enjoyable \nconversations with him over a wide range of issues, most especially the \nBritish experience in Iraq from 1921 to 1931, the example of Lawrence \nof Arabia. Lawrence of Arabia wrote ``The Small Warfare Manual,'' and \nhe wrote ``The Pillars of Wisdom.'' As I indicated, the U.S. Marine \nCorps had similar manuals, one called a ``Manual on Antiguerrilla \nOperations,'' which I participated in, and now the manual the general \nhas written.\n  It seems we cannot get it right with regard to insurgencies. The same \nthings we write in these manuals we have to be careful about and pretty \nwell play out the problems, to say the least, that make it very \ndifficult.\n  Anyway, with regard to General Petraeus, he is exactly the right man \nfor the right job at the right time. He knows this. He has been to \nIraq. He was successful in his second tour. He is going back. I hope \nand pray he will be successful in his third effort. Our brave young men \nand women in uniform deserve nothing but the very best leadership, and \nthey are getting it.\n  But I think it is a paradox of enormous irony that the Senate \nconfirmed David Petraeus without a dissenting vote--not one, not one \nSenator--a vote of confidence that is unique, certainly given today's \ncontroversy and turmoil and the times. Yet at the same time, the same \nSenators who gave their vote of confidence are now in the business of \nwhat I call--I don't mean to perjure them--``confetti'' resolutions \nsupporting the general and the troops but not the mission they are \nundertaking now. That to me is unprecedented for the Senate. I think it \nis remarkable, and I have said many times that these resolutions--and \nit has been said many times--are nonbinding. They have no legislative \nimpact. They are so-called sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. For those \nwho do not pay attention to the parliamentary procedure around here, \nthat means they are meaningless except for the message you want to \nsend, and that can be important to the Executive, i.e., to President \nBush and the folks back home.\n  With all due respect, we have long crossed the message Rubicon with \nregard to sending mixed messages to our allies, our troops, the \nAmerican people, the media and, yes, our adversaries. Words have \nconsequences and, rest assured, our adversaries will read to try and \nfigure out, analyze every word of the resolution just passed in the \nHouse and perhaps the one, maybe two resolutions we can pass in this \nbody, hopefully three or four, and try to figure it out. I suspect they \nwill be absolutely flummoxed in trying to discern the sense in reading \na resolution that states support for the troops and our new commander, \nwith new rules of engagement, with a limited timeframe for achieving \nand reporting benchmarks of progress, but that opposes the \nmission. That is a mixed message, and it should cause quite a bit of \nhead scratching among the 31 different terrorist organizations that are \nplanning various attacks around the world and even on the United \nStates. My real concern is that the Senate is not considering or even \ntalking about the probable consequences of these actions, let alone our \nresponsibilities should they happen.\n\n  I want to make it very clear I do not question the intent or purpose \nor patriotism of any Senator, regardless of whatever resolution they \nare proposing voting for. I do question the judgment and the law of \nunintended effects. Bluntly put, with all this debate with regard to \nnonbinding resolutions, we appear like lemmings splashing in a sea of \npublic concern, frustration, and expressing anger over the war in Iraq.\n  In this regard, I don't know of anybody in this body or anybody in \nAmerica who does not want our troops home at the earliest possible \ndate, and stability in Iraq, if possible. If possible--and that is a \nreal question here. That is not the issue.\n  When all of this confetti settles, the end result of all this frenzy \nwill be: ``General, you and the troops have our solid support--but we \ndon't support your mission. However, press on and good luck.''\n  I think that message is remarkable. This is not a profile in courage. \nThis is not the Senate's finest hour. If we are going to debate and \nvote on nonbinding resolutions, let us at least consider resolutions \nthat will send a clear message or which can be of useful purpose. In \nthat regard, we should consider the McCain resolution. It lists \nbenchmarks of progress that General Petraeus has told Senator McCain \nand me would be useful in his discussions with Prime Minister Maliki, \nand certainly the Gregg resolution that supports spending for our \ntroops in harm's way. I think that is the precedent we have to set. \nThat is the killer in this debate, along with the Feingold resolution, \nbecause my colleagues across the aisle do not want to vote on the Gregg \nresolution, let alone the Feingold resolution.\n  Senator Feingold has a resolution which certainly does something. I \ndon't agree with his resolution, but he is at least very forthright and \nsends a clear message, and he is a good Senator.\n  As the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, \nlet me again stress what is not happening in the Congress or the media, \nand has received very little public attention regarding this challenge \nwe face in Iraq. No one is talking about the consequences of what will \nhappen if we simply withdraw or redeploy. And we may just do that, \nbecause I do not believe this war can or should be sustained if we do \nnot see progress in the next 6 months. If General Petraeus doesn't come \nback and tell us there has been measurable progress, where we can see \nit, feel it, and touch it, we have some serious policy decisions to \nmake. We need to be thinking about a policy of containment as opposed \nto intervention if this latest mission does not work.\n  I would also point out that most of the time deadlines for withdrawal \nare either in the nonbinding resolutions or they mirror exactly the \ntime period General Petraeus has told the Armed Services Committee he \nwould follow in reporting whether this new effort is making any \nprogress, pretty much along the lines of the benchmarks that are in the \nMcCain resolution. So the obvious question is: Who can better make that \njudgment, General Petraeus in theater or Senators here on the floor?\n  We have not discussed the difficult policy decisions that may \nconfront us if it becomes necessary to redeploy, what that mission \nmight be if we redeploy, where are we going, what is the mission going \nto be, or even how to withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have about 4 minutes left. If I could \nask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan allow me that privilege, I \nwould greatly appreciate it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to that, provided that \nthe 30 minutes which was to have started for our side at 3:30 will be \nextended for the full 30 minutes following the completion of the \npresentation.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will try to finish as fast as I can. I apologize. I \narrived late. I asked for 15 minutes, and I thought I could get it done \nin 15 minutes. Obviously, ``Roberts-ese'' is expanding that time \nperiod. I will try to finish as fast as I can.\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 30 \nminutes begin following the presentation of Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. As I indicated, Mr. President, we have not discussed the \ndifficult policy decisions that will confront us if it becomes \nnecessary to withdraw or redeploy, what that mission would be, or even \nhow to withdraw. The reality is what we will do when certain \nconsequences would take place. These are the possible, if not probable, \nconsequences we should be confronting and debating and explaining to \nthe American people and ourselves and in the media, even if some may \nhave a deaf ear.\n  First. A dramatic increase in sectarian violence quickly escalating \nto a civil war--and I mean a real civil war--and a humanitarian \ndisaster far more devastating than what is happening now. Shia versus \nShia, Shia versus Sunni. What do we do? Thousands of Iraqis have \nalready become refugees and left the country.\n  Second. Given a civil war and struggle for control, we can expect an \nincursion of Sunni troops from other Mideast countries--I want to make \nit very clear about that: other Mideast countries--to prevent an \nIranian takeover of Iraq and the very real possibility of an Iraq led \nby Muqtada al-Sadr, whose street appeal could endanger their own \nGovernments. I am talking about other Mideast countries. When that \nhappens, the war becomes regional. What do we do?\n  Third. We can expect an Iraq certainly dominated by Iran, thus \ncompleting a Shia crescent with Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. Today, \ncountries such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt are talking about \nbuilding their own nuclear programs, given Iran's nuclear ambitions and \nprogress. Iran has just refused inspectors from the IAEA. With the \npossibility of Shia Muslims and Sunni Muslims each working to achieve \nnuclear capability and weapons, what does Israel do? What do we do?\n  Fourth. Iraq will become a safe haven for terrorists. This time it is \nfor real. What do we do?\n  Fifth. In their eyes, with the defeat of the ``Great Satan'' only \nmonths away, as expected--a clear signal by this body and perhaps \ninevitable--terrorists around the world are already emboldened, waiting \nus out and planning more attacks; that is, if you believe what they \nsay.\n\n  Read Afghanistan and the Taliban and the spring offensive. Will we \nsoon be in the business of passing nonbinding resolutions about \nAfghanistan?\n  Sixth. We can expect a perceived, if not real, lack of American \nresolve in the eyes of adversaries and potential adversaries around the \nworld resulting in additional national security threats.\n  Read Putin and Belarus and Iran, and his recent remarkable speech at \nMunich in Germany at the NATO security conference. Kim Jong Il. We are \nmaking some progress with North Korea right now, but he does have a \npenchant for missile launches on the 4th of July.\n  Read Hugo Chavez--31 countries in the southern command. He is the new \nCastro, nationalizing his oil production and directly involved in five \ndifferent countries. What do we do?\n  The point is that globally and over the long term this is not a Bush \nissue or a Democratic or a Republican issue, or even how you feel about \nIraq or the war. Even as we argue about whether we debate and vote on \none resolution or three or four, I hope, there are terrorist \norganizations and their second-generation affiliates--guided and \ninspired--are plotting attacks against the United States and throughout \nthe world. It is obvious we can't sustain the status quo in Iraq, but \nwhile we debate on how to proceed, these folks are not giving up.\n  The irony is that should the President wake up in the morning and \nsay, well, the House has voted for this resolution, they are not for \nthis new mission, and the Senate is about to, and they may or may not \ndo that, so I am going to terminate it, I am going to end it, then we \nare back to square one, back to a stalemate, back to the status quo. \nThat, to me, doesn't make sense.\n  Given the fact there were at least five successful attacks that \nkilled Americans--and others that, thank goodness, were not \nsuccessful--before President Bush came to office and before military \naction in Iraq--given the fact this threat will face the next President \nand future world leaders, surely we can figure out it makes no sense to \nfight each other when the terrorists then and now and in the future do \nnot kill according to party affiliation, nationality, race, age, or \ngender.\n  We do not need a Republican approach to national security and the \nwar. We do not need a Democratic approach to national security and the \nwar. We need, however, an American approach to our national security \nand the war and to our individual freedoms. This is a time to engage in \nhonest dialog, to work together and think through and agree on the \nstrategy that will defeat our enemies and make the American people \nsafe. And yes, bring our troops home but in a way that we don't have to \nsend them back.\n  So I say to the leadership, with all due respect, let us end this \nnonbinding business and get these confetti resolutions behind us. We \nhave all had a chance now to discuss the war and we need to vote on I \nthink at least four resolutions, and then come together with a \nbipartisan commitment--a difficult and perhaps impossible task but, I \nbelieve, a task that must be undertaken for the sake of our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time and I thank my \ncolleagues across the aisle for permitting me to finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, an historic vote was announced in the \nHouse Chamber moments ago. By a vote of 246 to 182, the House of \nRepresentatives, in a bipartisan rollcall vote, has approved the \nresolution relative to the President's call for escalation of the \nnumber of troops serving in Iraq. That resolution is fewer than 60 \nwords in length, and I believe it should be read into the Record. This \nis a resolution which we are hoping to bring to the Senate floor \ntomorrow so that the debate can begin in this Chamber. It reads:\n\n       Congress and the American people will continue to support \n     and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably \n     in Iraq; Congress disapproves of the decision of President \n     George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy \n     more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to \n     Iraq.\n\n  It is unembellished, it is straightforward, and it states a position. \nThose who agree with this resolution, as I do, should be heard. Those \nwho disagree and believe we should escalate the number of troops in \nthis war have a right to be heard as well. That is the nature of this \ninstitution. It is the nature of our democracy.\n  For the Republicans to continue to threaten a filibuster to stop the \ndebate in the Senate so that Members of the Senate cannot come forward \nand express themselves and vote on this issue is wrong. It is unfair. \nIt is inconsistent with the reason we ran for office. We were asked by \nthe people kind enough to entrust us with this responsibility to face \nthe issues of our times, to address those issues in a responsible \nmanner, to have a civilized debate on the\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nfloor of the Senate, and to take a vote and take a stand. We are \nexpected to do that.\n  We are not expected to waffle and weave and avoid the obvious. This \nis the issue of the moment. It is the issue of our time. With over \n130,000 American soldiers' lives on the line, it is unacceptable that \nthe minority would stop us from debating this issue. It is unacceptable \nto our troops and to their families who wait anxiously to know what \ntheir fate will be. It is unacceptable to the rest of the Nation, which \nexpects the Senate to be a full partner in congressional debate.\n  It takes 60 votes to bring a measure to the floor in the Senate. On \nthe Democratic side, with one absence by illness, we have 50. We need \nthe cooperation of the Republicans to even debate the issue. They have \nmade it clear in pronouncements on the floor and in press conferences \nthey are going to stop this debate at any cost. They are prepared to \nfilibuster this measure so we cannot have a debate and a vote on this \ncritical issue. That is wrong. It is inconsistent with the reason we \nran for office and the reason this institution exists.\n  We have to face the obvious. Since the decision was made by the \nUnited States of America to give President Bush this authorization of \nforce, we have seen horrible results.\n  Mr. President, 3,132 of our best and bravest soldiers have given \ntheir lives, thousands have been seriously injured, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of taxpayers' money have been spent in pursuit of \nthis war, with no end in sight. Our soldiers did their job and did it \nwell--deposed a dictator and gave the Iraqis an opportunity for the \nfirst time in their history to stand and govern themselves and guide \ntheir nation into the future.\n  Instead, we have seen this situation disintegrate into a civil war, \nand we have watched our soldiers caught in the crossfire of a battle \nthat started 1,400 years ago among followers of the Islamic faith. That \nis not what America bargained for. That is why the majority of the \nAmerican people believe we need to change course, we need a new \ndirection, and we need to bring our troops home. We need to tell the \nPresident that the escalation of this war and the escalation of the \ntroops is the wrong policy at this moment in history.\n  For this Senate to speak, we need to engage in a debate, a debate \nwhich leads to a vote. There are choices before us. This choice, which \nI support, tells the President we disagree with his policy. It joins \nwith the House of Representatives, which made the same decision on a \nbipartisan basis. We have offered to Senator McCain, a Republican from \nArizona, an opportunity to bring his position forward in support of \nadding more troops in Iraq. That is the fair parameter of a good \ndebate. But sadly the Republican minority has said they will deny us \nthat opportunity.\n  I hope those who believe it is important for the Senate to engage in \nthis debate will contact their Members of the Senate as quickly as \npossible and let them know the vote tomorrow at 1:45 in the afternoon \nhere on the Senate floor is a historic vote, a vote of great \nimportance. Every Member should be here. Every Member should vote. \nEvery Member should understand the nature of this institution. The \nreason we serve is to give voice to the people we represent on the \nissues of our time. There is no more compelling and timely issue than \nthis war in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my colleague \nfrom Illinois. This debate we are trying to have is actually a debate \nabout a debate. This must be the only place, the only real estate in \nthe United States of America in which, rather than having a debate \nabout the war and strategy, we are having a debate about whether we \nshould debate it. It is pretty unbelievable.\n  This is called the greatest deliberative body in the world. It is an \nunbelievable privilege for me to be here. I came from a very small town \nof about 300 people, a high school class of 9. I am here in the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. I am enormously proud to be \nhere. But I came here not to avoid debate but to engage in debate, to \ntalk about this country and its future.\n  There is an old saying: When everyone is thinking the same thing, no \none is thinking very much. There is a desire in this Chamber by some \nwho have spoken that we all be thinking the same thing about these \nissues, that we all support President Bush and whatever his strategies \nmight be and wherever he might take us. This Congress has a \nconstitutional role to play, and the constitutional role is not to \ndecide to come to the floor from Monday through Friday to support the \nPresident of the United States, it is to come to the floor of the \nSenate to support this country and its interests as best we see those \ninterests.\n  Some long while ago, I went to a veterans hospital on a Sunday \nmorning and I presented medals to a veteran. His name was Edmund Young \nEagle. He was an American Indian. He had fought in the Second World \nWar, had gone all around the world, had fought in northern Africa, \nfought at Normandy, fought across Europe, and came back to live on the \nIndian reservation. He never married, never had very much. He loved to \nplay baseball. But he had kind of a tough life. At the end of Edmund \nYoung Eagle's life, this man who served his country, at the end of his \nlife he was dying of lung cancer. He was in the veterans hospital in \nFargo, ND, and his sister called and said her brother Edmund Young \nEagle had proudly served his country and had never received the medals \nfor his service in the Second World War.\n  Would you get him his medals, she asked?\n  I said, Of course I will.\n  So I achieved getting the medals he earned but never received from \nthe Pentagon, and I went to the VA hospital on a Sunday morning to \npresent medals to Edmund Young Eagle, a Native American, one of those \nfirst Americans who served this country and then went home and lived \nquietly.\n  When I went to his room that morning, Edmund Young Eagle was very \nsick. I didn't know it at the time, but he would die within a week or \nso. We cranked up the hospital bed for Edmund Young Eagle so he was in \na sitting position, and I pinned his World War II medals on his pajama \ntops and told him that his country was grateful for his serving our \ncountry in the Second World War.\n  This man, very sick, looked up at me and said: This is one of the \nproudest days of my life.\n  This man who lived in a spartan way, never having very much but \nserved this country with honor, felt great gratitude at the end of his \nlife for a country recognizing what he had done for us. That is the \nlife of a soldier, someone who commits himself or herself to answer \ntheir country's call without question. So many have done it.\n  I will attend a funeral this week of a young man killed in Iraq. I \nreceived a call this morning from a mother, the mother of a soldier who \nspent a year in Iraq and returned with very difficult circumstances--\npost-traumatic stress, all kinds of difficult emotional problems--who \njust this week received the alert notice that his reserve unit will \nlikely be called up again.\n  This is about war. It is about commitment. It is about our soldiers. \nIt is about our country and our future. Some say we should not talk \nabout that, we should not debate it. If that is the case, this is the \nonly real estate, this is the only room in America where it is not \nbeing discussed and debated. It is being debated in the homes, in the \nrestaurants, in the gymnasiums, in the schools, in the office. It ought \nto be debated here as well. This has a profound impact on our country \nand its future.\n\n  Make no mistake about it, our military has won every battle it has \nfought. Our military will win the battles they fight. But winning \nmilitary battles does not win the war in Iraq. We disapprove of \nPresident Bush's plan to deepen our escalation in Iraq because it is a \nmilitary response to a problem that must be resolved through diplomacy \nand through negotiation. The civil war and the violence in Iraq is only \ngoing to stop when there is genuine reconciliation between groups in \nIraq.\n  Let's think through what we have done in Iraq. Through our soldiers' \nblood and our Treasury, we sent troops to Iraq. The Iraqi leader, \nSaddam Hussein, is dead. Good riddance, I say. We have unearthed mass \ngraves in Iraq showing that hundreds of thousands of\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nIraqis were murdered by a dictator. But Saddam Hussein was executed. \nThe country of Iraq was able to vote for its own new Constitution. The \ncountry of Iraq voted for its own Government. That is very substantial \nprogress.\n  But the next step has not shown much progress. The next step is this: \nDo the Iraqi people have the will to provide for their own security? \nThis is their country, not ours. Iraq belongs to them, not us. The \nquestion is, Do the Iraqi people have the will to provide for their \nsecurity? If they do not, this country cannot and will not be able to \ndo that for any length of time. That is the question. Do they have the \nwill to take back their country?\n  Iraqi leaders are going to have to make very difficult decisions, \npolitical decisions in some cases which may undermine their own power \nand their own base of support. But it is the only way this is going to \nbe resolved. The sectarian violence that exists in Iraq today can trace \nits roots in some cases back to the year 700 A.D. This violence is not \ngoing to dissipate soon unless there is reconciliation between the \nfactions. This requires Iraqi troops to fight their ethnic and \nreligious allies who are part of the insurgency as well as fight their \nopponents. It requires Iraqi security, Iraqi police, and Iraqi troops \nto provide for the security of the whole country of Iraq.\n  The resolution we want to debate is a resolution which does not say \nwe don't support our troops. Clearly we support our troops. We support \nour troops with everything we believe is necessary for their safety and \nsecurity and for them to do their jobs the way we expect them to do \ntheir jobs. This Congress, every man and every woman, supports \nAmerica's troops and prays for their safe return.\n  This resolution says we support our troops but we do not agree with \nPresident Bush in his desire to deepen our involvement in Iraq. Some \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say: Your position on this \nemboldens the enemy. It is a message to embolden the enemy. It sends \nthe wrong message to our troops.\n  It is neither of those. It is a message from the Congress of the \nUnited States to the President, and that message is we do not support \nhis proposal to deepen our involvement in the war in Iraq.\n  A blue ribbon commission was put together, of some of the best \nthinkers, foreign policy and military thinkers in our country, headed \nby James Baker and Lee Hamilton, very distinguished Americans. That \ngroup included former Secretaries of State and military leaders and \nsome outstanding thinkers. They worked for months, many months, to \ndevelop a plan. We all understand the alternatives are not good in \nIraq. We understand that. If there were an easy way to deal with this, \nbelieve me, it would have been dealt with. In many ways, we found a box \ncanyon in Iraq, and it is hard to get out of a box canyon.\n  The Baker-Hamilton report represented a consensus of some of the best \nthinkers in our country, having worked months on this problem. The \nPresident chose to ignore that report. The President says he is the \ndecider.\n  You know, the Constitution says something about that as well. I agree \nwith my colleagues that we can't have 100 or 535 commanders in chief. I \nunderstand that. But I also understand that the Constitution has a role \nfor the Congress. Only the Congress can declare war--only the Congress. \nYes, the President is Commander in Chief, but only the Congress can \ndeclare war. Only the Congress has the power of the purse.\n  The question is, What do we do about what is now happening in Iraq? \nNo other country that I am aware of, in what the President has called \nthe coalition of the willing, has decided they are going to deepen \ntheir involvement or expand their troops to Iraq. No other country. \nEven Great Britain, the strongest supporter of President Bush's Iraq \npolicy, has refused to increase their troop strength in Iraq. In fact, \nthe British news reports say that Britain intends to have all or most \nof its troops withdrawn by the end of 2007. None of our allies, old or \nnew, of which I am aware, have decided the proper approach at this \npoint, given the sectarian involvement in Iraq, is to deepen their \ninvolvement and increase their troop strength in Iraq.\n  The President is saying we should surge some additional troops to \nIraq. We have done that before. In early 2004, we surged 20,000 \nadditional troops. A similar one happened in the fall of 2005. Most \nrecently, last summer the President announced that thousands of \nadditional troops would be surged into Baghdad. What happened as a \nresult of that was the violence increased, and deaths and injuries to \nAmerican troops went up. So we have seen some examples of a surge, and \nthe examples have not been very helpful. In fact, it has been \ncounterproductive.\n  This map is a map of the city of Baghdad--about 4 million to 6 \nmillion people, about 250 square miles. We have people in this city who \nhave grievances that go back 1,300 and 1,400 years. The Shia and the \nSunni religious split occurred in the seventh century, and they have \nclashed frequently since then.\n  This country is not put together by natural borders. This country was \nput together by a pen and paper, by a decision 90 years ago of how to \ndraw the borders of this country. This was a diplomatic decision, that \nthis should be the country of Iraq.\n  Let me describe what is happening now in this city. We have areas \nthat are Shia areas and Sunni areas, and now we have areas that are \nturning Shia and turning Sunni. In many ways, you will see from this \nmap the dramatic evidence of violence in this capital city of Iraq. It \nis getting worse, not better.\n  I mentioned that some of the hatred goes back 1,400 years. But a more \nrecent example, in a story I was reading about Iraq, a Shiite was \nrecently driven from his home and farm by the Sunnis who killed his \nbrother and nephew, and he was so bitter and angry, he said, ``A \nvolcano of revenge has built up inside. I want to rip them up with my \nteeth.'' It is this hatred which fuels a civil war and the atrocities \nthat occur nearly every day.\n  Saturday, February 3, saw the deadliest single suicide bombing since \nthe war began nearly 4 years ago, with 130 people killed and more than \n300 wounded. It was the fourth major attack against a densely populated \nShia area in less than 3 weeks. On the Thursday before, twin suicide \nbombers struck a market jammed with people--60 killed, 150 \nwounded. Again, 60 killed, 150 wounded; spraying body parts so far that \npolice were scouring rooftops late in the night for body parts. A few \ndays before that, 75 people killed in Baghdad's Shia neighborhoods in \nmultiple bombings; 160 wounded. The day before that, 3 car bombs \ndetonated within minutes of each other at the vegetable market. More \nthan 1,000 Iraqis were killed in the last week of January. We are told \nthere were 3,000 killed in the last 3 weeks. Unbelievably, it seems to \nme, they pick up bodies in the middle of the morning in Baghdad from \nthe night's carnage with holes drilled in their kneecaps, holes drilled \nin their skulls. These are unbelievable signs of torture. These are \nacts of unimaginable violence committed against others. No one is safe, \nnowhere is safe, and this violence pervades nearly every aspect of \ndaily life.\n\n  The question I think the President proposes with his suggestion of a \nsurge of an additional 20,000 or 21,000 troops in Baghdad poses is: \nWill additional troops in Baghdad on street corners, going door to \ndoor, embedded with the troops, with the security of the Iraqi \nGovernment, stem the violence? The answer is likely no. We have seen \nthis attempted previously and it did not stem the violence; the \nviolence increased.\n  Let me make another point I think is important. No one has made, I \nthink, the point that this troop escalation, whatever it is, is \ntemporary. The United States troops are leaving Iraq. The question is \nwhen, not if. At some point, United States troops will leave Iraq. The \nquestion is: Will we leave in a time that gives us the opportunity to \nturn the country of Iraq back to the Iraqi people and say, this is your \njob to provide for your security.\n  Let me talk about the National Intelligence Estimate. The National \nIntelligence Estimate was done with 16 intelligence agencies. They \nspent the last 5 months analyzing the situation in Iraq, reviewed by \nthe head of the CIA, the head of the intelligence units at the \nPentagon, State Department, Justice Department, and the Director of \nNational Intelligence, our most senior intelligence official. Some of \nit is top secret, but some was released publicly. Let me read \nsomething:\n\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\n\n       Even if violence is diminished, given the current winner-\n     take-all attitude and sectarian animosities affecting the \n     political scene, Iraqi leaders will be hard-pressed to \n     achieve sustained political reconciliation in this time \n     frame.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Iraq's neighbors are influenced by the events within Iraq, \n     but the involvement of these outside actors is not likely to \n     be a major driver of violence or the prospect for stability \n     because of the self-sustaining character of Iraq's internal \n     sectarian dynamics.\n\n  That is a fancy way to describe the civil war.\n  I might say the last National Intelligence Estimate was done was in \n2004 and it detailed 3 possible outcomes for Iraq over the next 18 \nmonths, which at the time would put us in the fall or winter of 2006. \nThe worst-case scenario for the previous NIE was a civil war. Well, \nthat is what the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate says has now \nhappened. That is right; what is going on in Iraq now is the worst-case \nscenario of the previous National Intelligence Estimate.\n  Let me make a couple of other points, if I might. General Abizaid \njust over 2 months ago came to the Congress and here is what he said:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     Corps Commander, General Dempsey, and I said, ``In your \n     professional opinion, if we were to bring in more American \n     troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to \n     achieve success in Iraq? And they said no.''\n\n  This is our top military commander testifying to the Senate just over \n2 months ago: They said no.\n  Now, here is why General Abizaid said the commanders did not believe \nthey should have additional troops brought into Iraq:\n\n       The reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It is \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future. The only way Iraq works in the future is for the \n     Iraqis to take more responsibility for that future. That is \n     what General Abizaid said. He was right then; he is right \n     now. This is the testimony heard by the Senate just over 2 \n     months ago. Interestingly enough, as a side note, just 2 \n     weeks ago--3 weeks ago, John Negroponte, the head of the \n     intelligence in this country at that time said this in open \n     testimony to the Senate:\n       The greatest terrorist threat to America is al-Qaida and \n     its network around the world.\n\n  The greatest terrorist threat to our country is al-Qaida and its \nnetwork around the world, and he said they operate from a ``secure \nhideaway'' in Pakistan. If that is the case, if the greatest terrorist \nthreat to our country is al-Qaida operating from a ``secure hideaway'' \nin Pakistan, and that comes from the head of our intelligence service \nin this country in open testimony to the Senate, if there are 21,000 \nadditional American troops available to surge somewhere, why on Earth \nwould we not choose to move those troops through Afghanistan near to \nPakistan to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida, the greatest \nterrorist threat to our country? I do not understand the priorities \ncoming from the administration. There has to be a change. We all \nunderstand that. We know Iraq is a different place. The various sects, \ntribes, religions, in some cases do not speak to each other, and in \nmany cases don't trust each other. In other cases, they hate each \nother, and in too many cases, they kill each other.\n  That is what must change. It is why reconciliation is the key. It is \nwhy more U.S. troops are not going to make a difference.\n\n  Does anyone believe that if we go back 4 years and the President \nbrought a proposition to the floor of the Senate and said: Look, we \nhave a civil war in Iraq. What we ought to do is send more American \ntroops to the middle of that civil war, or at least begin sending \nAmerican troops to the middle of that civil war because we don't \nbelieve after 3 years of training that the Iraqi people are prepared to \nprovide for their security, does anybody believe we would think it a \ngood strategy to send additional troops to the middle of a civil war? I \ndon't believe so.\n  I understand there are very different opinions here in this Chamber, \nand I respect them. I wouldn't diminish anyone in this Chamber for \nholding any views on this subject. I understand their passions. I share \ntheir passions. But I don't understand this: I don't understand how it \nis that this great body has to spend days debating whether we will have \na debate. This is, after all, a debate about the motion to proceed. \nThis isn't a debate about Iraq or Iraq strategy; it is about whether we \ncan proceed to a motion on that subject. It is a debate about whether \nwe can debate. If there is any space left in this country in which this \ndebate should take place, it ought to be this space on this floor, this \nreal estate. This is the great deliberative body. I do not for the life \nof me understand a vote against cloture that says: No, we believe the \nUnited States should not debate this issue. This is an issue the \nAmerican people care a great deal about, and it is long past the time, \nin my judgment, for us to have this debate.\n  We are all united, I think, in loving this country. We want what is \nbest for this country. We want to protect the American troops. We want \nour country to succeed. All of us want all of those things. I don't \nbelieve anybody who says we are undermining this or that or anything of \nthat sort. All that is nonsense. This country deserves from this Senate \na thoughtful, serious, real debate about what is happening that affects \nevery part of American life, and that is the struggle we are involved \nin with respect to Iraq. The American people deserve this debate, and I \nhope that tomorrow when we have a vote on the motion to proceed, we \nwill have the opportunity to proceed from that motion to a debate on \nthe underlying petition that is on the floor of the Senate with respect \nto the subject of the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time was I allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has until 4:30.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this morning I got up and I went to get \non an airplane and the plane was delayed because of mechanical issues. \nThen I got the word that the leader said we should come vote on \nquestions being discussed, just as I heard now.\n  I am here to participate in a charade. This is nothing but a charade. \nIt is a nonbinding resolution. We are coming back to vote on Saturday \non a nonbinding resolution that the American public doesn't support. As \na matter of fact, as I read in The Hill newspaper and as I see on the \nfront page, there is the majority leader's photograph and a story about \nhow the majority is trying to embarrass the 21 of us who are up for \nelection in 2008. I think the majority--current majority, former \nminority--ought to look at that paper. Inside it, after giving the \nmajority leader credit for this charade, is a poll. It is an online \npoll, and this was a question: Does debate on a nonbinding Iraq \nresolution help or harm Americans? Harm: 57 percent; help, 43 percent.\n  Nothing at all will be accomplished tomorrow, even if we got cloture. \nWe would vote on a nonbinding resolution that is an embarrassment to \nthe troops that are wearing our uniforms in Iraq. What we should be \ndoing is voting on cloture on a series of votes which would include \nSenator Gregg's resolution or amendment that declares our support for \nour troops.\n  The reason we face this situation today is the new majority, with one \nvote--a majority of one vote--went over to the House and negotiated a \nresolution--a nonbinding, nothing resolution--and brought it over here \nand said: You are going to vote on this resolution and nothing else. If \nwe do this, we become a lower body of the House. The House, in \nresponding to the Rules Committee, had no chance to offer any \namendments to that bill. Over here, the majority leader says: You \ncannot offer any amendments to this because I am the leader.\n  Well, it is time we showed this leader the processes of the Senate \nare here for the purpose of allowing debate. The House represents the \npopulation of a whole series of congressional districts. We represent \nour States. The national viewpoint is settled in the Senate. This is \nthe place where debate is supposed to take place and it should not be \nlimited.\n  If we voted for cloture on this resolution tomorrow, we would not be \nallowed to vote on the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment:\n\n       Expressing the sense of Congress that no funds should be \n     cut off or reduced for American troops in the field which \n     would result in undermining their safety or their ability to \n     complete their assigned missions.\n\n  What is wrong with that? Why won't the leader let us vote on that? \nYou\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nknow why? Because it would carry. It would carry. Because Senators on \nthat other side of the aisle know they must support the forces in the \nfield.\n  Senator Gregg's amendment goes on to say:\n\n       Whereas under Article II, section 2, of the Constitution of \n     the United States, the President is the ``commander in chief \n     of the Army and Navy of the United States'', and in such \n     capacity the President has the command of the Armed Forces, \n     including the authority to deploy troops and direct military \n     campaigns during wartime.\n       Whereas under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution of \n     the United States, Congress has the power of the purse \n     specifically as it relates to the Armed Forces, and in such \n     capacity Congress has the responsibility to fully and \n     adequately provide funding for the United States military \n     forces, especially when they are at war and are defending our \n     Nation; and\n       Whereas the United States military forces are in harm's way \n     and are protecting our country, Congress and the Nation \n     should give them all the support they need in order to \n     maintain their safety and to accomplish their assigned \n     missions, including the equipment, logistics, and funding \n     necessary to ensure their safety and effectiveness, and such \n     support is the responsibility of both the Executive Branch \n     and the Legislative Branch of Government.\n  Senator Gregg goes on to say this:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring)--\n\n  And they have to concur if we send it back to them--\n\n       That it is the sense of Congress that Congress should not \n     take any action that will endanger United States military \n     forces in the field, including elimination or reduction of \n     funds for troops in the field, as such action with respect to \n     funding would undermine their safety or harm their \n     effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n\n  It is nothing but a charade to say an amendment that does nothing \nshould not have a resolution such as this attached to it. That is our \npurpose. That is our job. It is our constitutional responsibility to \nsupport the forces in the field.\n  I am ashamed the Senate is taking action to prevent the voting on a \nresolution, once again, establishing the principle. Our duty is to \nsupport our forces in the field.\n  I have a chart to show, but it is difficult for many to understand \nwhy we need surge forces. This whole concept we are talking about is \nsafety. Senator Gregg's resolution deals with safety of our forces. \nThis is a chart that shows the Iraqi Army and national police with lead \nresponsibility for counterinsurgency operations in their areas.\n  In May of 2006 this was their deployment, fairly small. By February \nof 2007, this is their deployment. We are now in the process of going \nforward on the new plan to deal with the fact that we have trained a \ngreat many of these forces now, but they have not been moved into the \nareas of real combat, and those are the white spaces on this chart. The \nwhole idea now is to start moving these forces into those areas.\n  By the way, the hot spots are also on arterial highways in Iraq. This \ndemonstrates where it is. The white areas are occupied by American \nforces and coalition forces. We want to give them a chance now to move \nthem into those areas. As such, forces will be moving all over this \ncountry. In that period of time, these additional surge forces are \nnecessary in order to provide the safety for the people whom they are \ngoing to be moving. They are our forces, they are their forces. \nSecretary Gates has said he does not think they will be there too long. \nHe made a point to make that statement. They will come out as soon as \nthey are no longer needed. Safety is a problem.\n  To those people who say: Let's get ready to withdraw, if we try to \nwithdraw right now, there would be mass murder in this country. Think \nof what happened to the Russians and the Soviets when they tried to get \nout of Afghanistan--and multiply it by factors of 10 to 20. We are \nspread out all over this place and so are the Iraqis because that was \nthe problem, we were providing for the defense until they were ready to \nmove in and take care of their defense.\n  This is a chart that shows the current position of forces in Iraqi \nFreedom. We can see various operations, Japanese and coalition forces, \nincluding the British, around the periphery. We are there, in Baghdad, \non the major highways. We are in the white spaces on the chart. To get \nthe Iraqi forces in there, we have a new scheme where we will have \nIraqi brigades--not divisions but brigades--with an embedded battalion \nin each brigade move in. Our people will be along with them to make \nsure their training is carried out and they do the job of defending \nthemselves.\n  As a practical matter, in order to do that, we need the increased \nsafety of movement in this country. I fully support the plan. It was an \nIraqi plan improved on by Secretary Gates, the President, and his \nstaff. Very clearly, the whole program is so they can provide the basic \ndefense for themselves in areas where there is key opposition.\n  Assume the other side, the side who wants to withdraw, would get \napproval of the Congress and had some way to mandate the President to \nwithdraw forces. The first thing that would have to be done would be to \nmove the Iraqi forces in there where they can defend themselves and \nhold back the insurgents currently combatting our forces.\n  I am not a general, I am not even an armchair general, but I have \nbeen around wars for almost all my life now starting out when I was 19. \nI have seen a great many wars, and I have seen a great many problems \nwith war. Coming back from overseas, I talked to some of my friends and \nI decided I was going to become an aeronautical engineer to try to find \nout what caused wars. I hate wars. But I know my duty is to support the \nmilitary and to support those people carrying out our constitutional \nmandate to provide for the common defense of this country.\n  In my opinion, this is the common defense of our country. We have \ntaken on the task of trying to stop a movement that could very well \ndestroy the world. I do believe we should stop these incessant debates \non resolutions that mean nothing. Why would we spend all this time and \ncome back on Saturday in order to vote on a nonbinding resolution that \nwould not do a thing? It would not do a thing at all for anyone in that \nconflict, not one thing. It is nothing but a charade, a charade. It \nembarrasses me to have to say that. The whole reason for it, pick up \nThe Hill newspaper, back to where I started, to provide a challenge to \nthe 21 Members, Republicans, up for election in 2008, 3 on that side of \nthe aisle. The whole idea is to try to see if we cannot force them to \ncome back on Saturday in order to say to our State constituents: They \nwere not here to vote. I am here to vote. I happened to get off the \nairplane because I was pretty irritated when I read that story. I am \nstill irritated.\n\n  I remember Steve Syms in 1986, when everyone was trying to embarrass \npeople up for election, he said: I am going home and I am going to talk \nto my constituents, and he did not get sucked back into the debates \nsuch as this. He was reelected.\n  What these people do not know is, we are going to stand up and speak \nup. We are going to call a spade a spade. This is a charade. I have not \nbeen home since January. And I got off that plane to come back and \ncomplain about this. I have a right to go home once in a while. I live \n4,500 miles from here. As a matter of fact, I am stopping off on my way \nhome to see a very sick relative before I get to Alaska on Monday. \nLeadership is leadership, and I have been in leadership in this Senate. \nI was not elected leader, but that is another story. As a practical \nmatter, I have seen leaders come and I have seen leaders go. My friend \nfrom Nevada has been my friend for a long time. I am saying I am not \ngoing to be embarrassed to come out and say this is nothing but a \ncharade. We should not come back tomorrow to vote on a nonbinding \nresolution to see if we would vote on a resolution that doesn't tell \nthe story that America wants us to tell, and that story is we support \nour forces in the field, we support what they are doing. We want them \nto do what we said we would do, move the forces in that are now trained \nin Iraq. Let them show how they can defend themselves and we then pull \nout our embedded battalions and we will be in a position to figure out \nwhat is the long-term plan now for this new democracy we have helped \nestablish.\n  What does this nonbinding resolution do to people in the field? What \ndoes it do to the Iraqis? What is it selling them? People are telling \nme now we should find some way to take the money the President has \nasked for, the supplemental, and to use it for something else--not to \nuse it to support the people in the field.\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\n  There is what is called the Food and Forage Act of the United States. \nI hope the Senate understands that act. I have been involved in defense \nappropriations now for over 25 years. The President of the United \nStates has the authority to take money from wherever it is to support \nforces in the field. We will never abandon our people in the field. We \nwill support them in every way possible. That is why the current \nmajority does not want to vote on the resolution of Senator Gregg. They \ndo not want to be put in a position of saying no to Senator Gregg \nbecause if they vote, if they support that resolution, they are \ncontinuing the concepts that have been embodied in my life and in the \nSenate's life as long as I have known it. That is, we support our \nforces in the field. We are not going to divert money they need for \ntheir support, and we are not going to waste our time on nonbinding \nresolutions that do not do anything to help anybody.\n  We have a lot of things we could be working on, immigration, energy, \nglobal climate change. What are we doing? We are spending our time \ncoming back on Saturday to debate whether we should vote on a bill that \nwas started in the House of Representatives, with not one amendment, \nand brought over here, not one amendment, and expresses a point of view \nthat the American public does not approve of.\n  I hope we can get to a debate one of these days, and people will stay \naround after they make comments such as I heard before I came in. I \nguarantee, in my heart and in my mind, I know what it means to be in \nuniform, what it means to be in a position to feel it is necessary to \nhave support at home.\n  I spent some time last night talking to Colin Powell, one of the \nfamous generals of this country, and reminded him once when we were \ntalking years ago, he told me about the time when he was sent into Laos \nas a young captain with about 12 days' rations and how when you get up \non the morning of the 12th day and realize a drop mission is coming to \ngive you your rations for the next 12 days, how you realize what it \nmeans to rely on people, to understand that people in the United States \nare behind their military, to know you can eat those rations because \nthe supplies are going to come in when they are supposed to come in. \nThat is support to people in the field.\n  Another concept I speak of is our people have a doctrine that hardly \nany armies or military in the world has had--we never abandon our \nforces in the field. What these people are doing now if you listen to \nthem on this other resolution, they are saying, we are going to take \nand divert this money and put it somewhere else. Not this Senator. If \nthey need that money over there to carry out the commands of the \nCommander in Chief, I am going to support it. The Senate should support \nit. We should stop this business of trying to embarrass people who are \nup for election and demanding they come back and vote on Saturday.\n  This recess was announced a month ago. Those who live a long distance \nfrom here rely on that. The Senate has to start keeping its commitments \nto our Members whether they are up for election or not.\n  This is political posturing at its worse. I will be here to vote \ntomorrow to represent some of those people who could not get back. I \nstayed to vote so I could come and say this: Political posturing has no \nplace in the Senate of the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on December 23, 1783, George Washington, \nhaving successfully led the Continental Army to victory in the \nRevolutionary War, appeared before the Continental Congress and \nresigned his commission as commander of the Armed Forces.\n  It was a quietly pivotal action in the history of our young country, \nan event so important in shaping the Nation that it is one of only \neight moments in our history deemed worthy enough of gracing the walls \nof the Capitol rotunda.\n  A painting of Washington's historic act hangs not far from this \nChamber alongside more well known moments in American history such as \nthe signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Battle of Bunker \nHill.\n  The precedent that Washington set on that December day was as \nrevolutionary as it was clear: In the United States of America, the \npower to make and execute war will be held not by the military but \ninstead by peacefully elected leaders sitting in a legislative body.\n  Washington understood that the will of the people--the will of the \nAmerican people--shall be the guiding hand of government, even on \nquestions of war and peace.\n  I wonder how President Washington would feel, I wonder what he would \nsay to each of us today. First, I think he would be very proud of what \nhas happened this afternoon in the House of Representatives, where they \ncame together, after lengthy debate, to state their opinions about the \nmost pressing issue of war, the war in Iraq. I am very proud that we \nsaw the House of Representatives vote 246 to 182 to say, first, that \nthey support the troops and, secondly, that they do not support the \nescalation of the war in Iraq.\n  Regardless of how each person voted today in the House, they took \nthat vote. They were willing to stand up and be counted and give their \nopinion. I believe the majority of the American people--and their will, \ntheir belief--was represented in this vote today of 246 to 182.\n  What has happened in the Senate? Well, first of all, I commend our \nmajority leader, Senator Harry Reid, for his perseverance, for his \ncontinuing effort to reach across the aisle with the minority leader to \nfind a way to do the same thing the House has done. He has put forward \nnumerous proposals, and, as late as yesterday, very simply and in a \nstraightforward way, offerred us the opportunity to vote on a \nresolution opposing the escalation and one that supports the \nPresident's escalation. What could be more fair? What could be simpler? \nYet we continue to see the minority block the efforts to bring us to a \nvote.\n  For over 2 weeks now, I have watched the Republican leadership engage \nin legislative games and political posturing to avoid taking a vote on \nthe most pressing issue of our time, the war in Iraq. They say they \nsupport it, but they will not vote on a resolution, up or down, whether \nor not to support the President's escalation. I believe it is because \nthey do not like what they know the outcome will be if we are able to \nhave that vote. They have turned their backs on their responsibility to \nthe people who elected them and to our troops because they may lose a \nvote.\n  Four years ago, 23 of us stood on the floor of the Senate and lost a \nvote. It was a vote to go to war. It was a vote to give the President \nthe authority to go to war in Iraq. It was a tough vote. We knew we \nwere not going to win that vote, but we all--those for and against--\nmade a determination and voted because we are elected officials, \ncharged with overseeing the U.S. Armed Forces, and we had a \nresponsibility to voice our opinions for the record on the question of \nwar.\n  I have stood on the floor of the Senate time and time again to voice \nmy opposition to this President's proposals of escalation--more of the \nsame, calling it a different strategy, and yet doing the same thing \nover and over again. Sending more Americans into combat without a \nstrategy for success will not improve the situation on the ground in \nIraq. And it will not bring our men and women in uniform home any \nsooner.\n  Only the Iraqis can secure Iraq. Only the Iraqis can secure Iraq. We \nhave heard that from generals and military experts and the Iraq Study \nGroup and learned colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The American \ntroops cannot be seen as a substitute for Iraqi resolve. Why would we \ngo further down the path that has led us to this point? Why would we \nrepeat our previous mistakes and call it a new strategy?\n  Unlike the President, all of us and our counterparts in the House \nwill go home over recess and on weekends and face our constituents, our \nneighbors. We see them and talk to them at church, in the line at the \nbank, at our kids' schools, in the grocery store, and at countless \nevents and meetings as we travel throughout our States.\n  And we are here because they elected us to be their voice.\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\n  This is not Washington, DC's, war. We may set policy here, we may \nmake speeches here, and we may take votes here, this is America's war.\n  The men and women putting their lives on the line in Iraq every day \nare from our smallest neighborhoods and our biggest cities, from farm \ncommunities and factory towns, from places many of us have never heard \nof and few of us will ever go. Flint, Howell, West Branch, Hemlock, La \nSalle, Port Huron, Ypsilanti, Muskegon, Ann Arbor, Byron, Flushing, Bay \nCity, Canton, Paw Paw, Lake Orion, Saginaw, Sand Creek--these are only \nsome of the dozens of communities in my home State of Michigan that \nhave given up a son or a daughter to this war.\n  We sit in this historic Capitol and argue over whether we should \ndignify this war with a simple vote, while these and other communities \nacross the country bury their loved ones, while high schools hold \nvigils for alumni laid to rest too young, while churches comfort \nparishioners who have lost sons and daughters and husbands and wives \nand fathers and mothers.\n  We are the voice of these communities, of these towns and cities and \ncounties. We were elected with their sacred trust to come here, to \nWashington, and to speak out for them, to make our mark for them on the \nissues that face this country. There can be nothing more important than \nthe issue of war.\n  By continuing to stonewall a vote on this resolution, the Republican \nminority has stripped all of America of their voice in this debate. \nThey have said to the people who elected us that this issue--the issue \nof an escalation of war--is not important enough for their elected \nrepresentatives to consider.\n  Too often in the white noise of politics we lose sight of the \nresponsibility we bear. We get bogged down in the politics of \npartisanship and lose sight of why we were elected. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to take this vote. This is the most serious issue of \nour time. There is nothing more important or more pressing than our \nNation being at war. It is the responsibility of the Congress to engage \nin shaping policy concerning the war on behalf of the American people.\n  Let me take a few moments to remind everyone what is really at stake. \nWhile some posture and jockey for legislative position, lives are on \nthe line this moment and every moment the war goes forward. It doesn't \nmatter if you support or oppose the war. Anyone involved in slowing a \nvote on this resolution should be ashamed. Our military has not failed \nus at any turn in this endeavor. But we are failing them as a body by \nfailing to lead. What is at stake?\n  On January 21, the Grand Rapids Press published the following account \non the war in Iraq:\n\n       The first roadside bomb four months ago knocked a front \n     tire off Kyle Earl's Humvee, rang his head like a bell and \n     made his ears bleed.\n       The second bomb a couple of weeks later blew out the front \n     tires and took out the transmission but, again, spared Earl \n     serious injury.\n       The third one, on Oct. 17, was his last.\n       With the headlights out for security and wearing night-\n     vision goggles, the 20-year-old Marine lance corporal from \n     Cedar Springs was driving the lead Humvee returning from a \n     night patrol in Iraq's Al Anbar province near the border with \n     Syria. He and a Marine manning the Humvee's machine gun saw \n     it at the same time: a hump in the road ahead, a sure sign of \n     a buried improvised explosive device (IED).\n       Earl instantly made the calculation: If he swerved, the \n     trailing Humvee carrying the company commander would hit the \n     IED, so ``I drove right into it, knowing it was probably \n     going to kill me,'' he said.\n       He ran over the hump, igniting three 155-mm artillery \n     shells and five propane tanks. The flash, amplified by the \n     night-vision goggles, was brighter than anything he'd ever \n     seen. A fireball shot through the cab, and shrapnel pierced \n     his right leg, arm and face. The shock wave felt like someone \n     had placed him inside a plastic bag and sucked out all the \n     air.\n       Still, he remained conscious, as the Humvee rolled off the \n     road and came to a stop. Blood streamed from his eyes, ears \n     and nose. He reached for his 9 mm handgun, but noticed \n     something about the size of his palm on it. He picked it up \n     and examined it, unaware it was a chunk of his flesh, ripped \n     from his right forearm.\n       He smelled something burning and realized he and the Humvee \n     were on fire. He rolled out onto the ground as his fellow \n     Marines kicked him to extinguish the flames.\n\n  We are here because of that lance corporal. He and his comrades, the \nmen and women serving, deserve our best--our best judgment, our best \ndecisions, our best funding, our best strategy for them.\n  On November 16, 2006, the Detroit Free Press gave us this insight \ninto life on the ground in Iraq:\n\n       ``A few days ago, from out of a crowd of kids, one of them \n     threw a grenade and it went off under the vehicle, and my \n     executive officer's door was peppered,'' said Lance Cpl. \n     Michael Rossi, a 28-year-old student majoring in urban \n     planning at Wayne State University who lives in Detroit. ``A \n     crowd of kids, and one of them threw a grenade.''\n       ``Out here,'' he said, ``nobody is safe.''\n\n  On January 5, the editorial page of the Flint Journal paid its \nrespects to one of Flint's fallen sons:\n\n       It's touching and laudable that the father of Marine Cpl \n     Christopher Esckelson would want the family of a fellow \n     Marine to understand the full heroics these men displayed in \n     Iraq combat that claimed both their lives.\n       They are among more than a dozen local military men whom \n     the Iraq war has claimed, with each succeeding loss being no \n     less painful to an area that has supplied an ample measure of \n     these patriots.\n       Of course, the grief is much greater for the families who \n     knew the men in so many other wonderful ways. Those memories \n     undoubtedly will be recalled during services for Miller and \n     Esckelson Saturday and Sunday, respectively.\n\n  All of us have stories of the men and women who have served \nheroically and lost their lives, men and women who have come home and \nneed our assistance now as veterans while in our hospitals and will \nforever carry a remembrance of this war through lost limbs and other \nhealth conditions. They deserve a vote on whether we believe this \nstrategy for them and their colleagues is the right strategy. They \ndeserve this. They expect us to stand up and speak out and work as hard \nas we can to get it right.\n  Too often on the floor of this Chamber and too often in politics, we \nuse words such as ``bravery'' and ``toughness'' and resolve.'' We \ndescribe votes as ``tough.'' We describe speeches as ``brave.'' The men \nand women serving in combat know the real meaning of these words. They \ngo about their dangerous duty with the pride of professionals. They \nlive and work under the shadow of violence, never knowing what might be \nfacing them around the next corner, and they do it with stoic resolve \nthat reflects their character and their training. They do not have the \nluxury of picking and choosing when and where to fight. They go where \ntheir country sends them and stand shoulder to shoulder with their \nbrothers and sisters in arms and face whatever is thrown at them. What \nwe consider heroic, they consider doing their job.\n  Their sacrifices deserve and demand leadership, our leadership, \ncollectively. We owe to it them and to every person we were elected to \nrepresent to vote on this resolution, to take a stand about how this \nwar will proceed. It is our job. It is time to stop stalling and face \nour responsibility, a responsibility that pales in comparison to that \nwhich is taken every day by our troops in Iraq.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to state my support of the vote \nwe will take tomorrow. Last week, I expressed my support for the \nbipartisan Levin-Warner resolution which was denied a vote by the full \nSenate due to procedural motions. Ten days later, we find ourselves in \na similar situation.\n  Our colleagues in the House have spent the last 4 days debating the \ncurrent course of action in Iraq, and they have completed a vote on \nfinal passage today. At the same time, the Senate has continued to \nengage in partisan bickering and political gamesmanship. The House \nfound a way, it found a bill, and it took a vote. We have a bill, and \nwe need to debate it.\n  At bottom, this debate is not about whether one is a Republican or \nDemocrat; it is about the legislative branch exerting its proper \nconstitutional oversight by deliberating on the most vital and \nchallenging issue of our day. I would urge my colleagues to think about \nthe vote that took place in 2002 authorizing the use of force in Iraq \nand about what happened afterward. This was not a party-line vote. I \nwas not a\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nMember of this body, and I do personally believe it was an erroneous \nvote, at least in its outcome, but at the same time, most importantly, \nwe should look at the lack of respect shown by the administration after \nthe vote. This lack of respect was a clear signal that the true issues \ndividing us in this Government are more related to the relations \nbetween the executive and legislative branches than between our \nrespective parties.\n  The administration has failed the country again and again in the \nconduct of this war. At the same time, it repeatedly claims that it \nholds the power, regardless of the input of the Congress, to continue \nto push our military people to the limits of their endurance, while \navoiding the diplomatic options crucial to resolving the situation in \nIraq which inevitably evolved from our invasion and occupation.\n  I have heard discussion today about the consequences of withdrawal. \nNo one on this side is advocating a precipitous withdrawal, but the \nconsequences that are being described--increased terrorism, the \nempowerment of Iran, the loss of prestige of the United States around \nthe world, and economic distress in our country--are, quite frankly, \nthe exact conditions many of us were warning about if we invaded in the \nfirst place. The question is not how we withdraw or should we withdraw. \nSome day, we are going to withdraw. Inevitably, we are going to \nwithdraw. The question is the conditions we leave behind when we do so.\n  I have long advocated that an integral part of our strategy in Iraq \nmust include engagement with all of Iraq's neighbors, including Iran \nand Syria. As Iraq's neighbors, they are stakeholders in both the \nfuture of Iraq and the need for stability in the region. As we seek to \ndecrease our presence in Iraq and increase our ability to fight \nterrorism and address strategic challenges elsewhere in the world, we \nmust bring those two countries to the table. An overwhelming majority \nof those who recently testified before hearings at the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee agree with that assessment.\n  I have heard today the name of General Petraeus invoked several times \nas evidence of this body's support for the administration's current \npolicy. I voted for General Petraeus. A vote for General Petraeus is \nnot a vote for this administration's policy or its strategy or its, \nquite frankly, lack of strategy. That vote was to support the \nqualifications of an individual to command troops in Iraq. That was a \nmilitary vote, not a political vote. If the strategy were to change, as \nI hope it will, I have full confidence that General Petraeus is capable \nof overseeing that policy as well. We must see evidence of a new \ndiplomatic effort from this administration before we, as a Congress, \nnot as Democrats and Republicans, ratify the expanded use of our \nmilitary.\n  On that note, it should be emphasized that despite comments today \nabout the fact that the Baker-Hamilton group supported a temporary \nmilitary surge in its report, it did so only in consonance with a \nrobust regional diplomatic surge which was supposed to begin more than \n2 months ago.\n  Many Republicans seem to be implying that we must support all of this \nadministration's actions or, by inference, we don't support the troops. \nThe issue is not whether we support the troops; it is whether we agree \non the political issues to which they are being put. This effort \ndemands clear direction from the top. It depends on the extent to which \nthis Government is capable of forging a regional consensus regarding \nIraq's future. This administration has refused to do so. It is not in \nthe interest of our troops to continue sending them in harm's way \nwithout a clear strategy that will bring closure to this endeavor.\n  I believe very strongly that our political representatives should be \ncareful in claiming to speak politically for our troops. Our military \nis a mirror of our society, and so are its political views. We have \nheard a lot of anecdotal evidence today--TV clips, newspaper interviews \nwith individuals. But anecdotal evidence notwithstanding, poll after \npoll shows that our troops are just as concerned about this policy as \nis the public at large.\n  I have one poll from a year ago, a Zogby poll, that says that 72 \npercent of the people then stationed in Iraq believed the war should \nhave ended by the end of 2006. This includes 7 out of 10 of our Regular \nArmy soldiers and a vast majority--nearly 60 percent--of our marines. \nThese are people who have done their job. They know what their military \njob is, but they have the same questions about the political policies \nas do the rest of Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Zogby poll in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [February 28, 2006]\n\n          U.S. Troops in Iraq: 72 Percent Say End War in 2006\n\n       Le Moyne College/Zogby Poll shows just one in five troops \n     want to heed Bush call to stay ``as long as they are \n     needed,'' While 58 percent say mission is clear, 42 percent \n     say U.S. role is hazy, Plurality believes Iraqi insurgents \n     are mostly homegrown, Almost 90 percent think war is \n     retaliation for Saddam's role in 9/11, most don't blame Iraqi \n     public for insurgent attacks, Majority of troops oppose use \n     of harsh prisoner interrogation, and Plurality of troops \n     pleased with their armor and equipment.\n       An overwhelming majority of 72 percent of American troops \n     serving in Iraq think the U.S. should exit the country within \n     the next year, and more than one in four say the troops \n     should leave immediately, a new Le Moyne College/Zogby \n     International survey shows.\n       The poll, conducted in conjunction with Le Moyne College's \n     Center for Peace and Global Studies, showed that 29 percent \n     of the respondents, serving in various branches of the armed \n     forces, said the U.S. should leave Iraq ``immediately,'' \n     while another 22 percent said they should leave in the next \n     six months. Another 21 percent said troops should be out \n     between six and 12 months, while 23 percent said they should \n     stay ``as long as they are needed.''\n       Different branches had quite different sentiments on the \n     question, the poll shows. While 89 percent of reserves and 82 \n     percent of those in the National Guard said the U.S. should \n     leave Iraq within a year, 58 percent of Marines think so. \n     Seven in ten of those in the regular Army thought the U.S. \n     should leave Iraq in the next year. Moreover, about three-\n     quarters of those in National Guard and Reserve units favor \n     withdrawal within six months, just 15 percent of Marines felt \n     that way. About half of those in the regular Army favored \n     withdrawal from Iraq in the next six months.\n       The troops have drawn different conclusions about fellow \n     citizens back home. Asked why they think some Americans favor \n     rapid U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq, 37 percent of troops \n     serving there said those Americans are unpatriotic, while 20 \n     percent believe people back home don't believe a continued \n     occupation will work. Another 16 percent said they believe \n     those favoring a quick withdrawal do so because they oppose \n     the use of the military in a pre-emptive war, while 15 \n     percent said they do not believe those Americans understand \n     the need for the U.S. troops in Iraq.\n       The wide-ranging poll also shows that 58 percent of those \n     serving in country say the U.S. mission in Iraq is clear in \n     their minds, while 42 percent said it is either somewhat or \n     very unclear to them, that they have no understanding of it \n     at all, or are unsure. While 85 percent said the U.S. mission \n     is mainly ``to retaliate for Saddam's role in the 9-11 \n     attacks,'' 77 percent said they also believe the main or a \n     major reason for the war was ``to stop Saddam from protecting \n     al Qaeda in Iraq.''\n       ``Ninety-three percent said that removing weapons of mass \n     destruction is not a reason for U.S. troops being there,'' \n     said Pollster John Zogby, President and CEO of Zogby \n     International. ``Instead, that initial rationale went by the \n     wayside and, in the minds of 68 percent of the troops, the \n     real mission became to remove Saddam Hussein.'' Just 24 \n     percent said that ``establishing a democracy that can be a \n     model for the Arab World'' was the main or a major reason for \n     the war. Only small percentages see the mission there as \n     securing oil supplies (11 percent) or to provide long-term \n     bases for US troops in the region (6 percent).\n       The continuing insurgent attacks have not turned U.S. \n     troops against the Iraqi population, the survey shows. More \n     than 80 percent said they did not hold a negative view of \n     Iraqis because of those attacks. About two in five see the \n     insurgency as being comprised of discontented Sunnis with \n     very few non-Iraqi helpers. ``There appears to be confusion \n     on this,'' Zogby said. But, he noted, less than a third think \n     that if non-Iraqi terrorists could be prevented from crossing \n     the border into Iraq, the insurgency would end. A majority of \n     troops (53 percent) said the U.S. should double both the \n     number of troops and bombing missions in order to control the \n     insurgency.\n       The survey shows that most U.S. military personnel in-\n     country have a clear sense of right and wrong when it comes \n     to using banned weapons against the enemy, and in \n     interrogation of prisoners. Four in five said they oppose the \n     use of such internationally banned weapons as napalm and \n     white phosphorous. And, even as more photos of prisoner abuse \n     in Iraq surface around the world, 55 percent said it is not \n     appropriate or standard military conduct to use harsh and\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n     threatening methods against insurgent prisoners in order to \n     gain information of military value.\n       Three quarters of the troops had served multiple tours and \n     had a longer exposure to the conflict: 26 percent were on \n     their first tour of duty, 45 percent were on their second \n     tour, and 29 percent were in Iraq for a third time or more.\n       A majority of the troops serving in Iraq said they were \n     satisfied with the war provisions from Washington. Just 30 \n     percent of troops said they think the Department of Defense \n     has failed to provide adequate troop protections, such as \n     body armor, munitions, and armor plating for vehicles like \n     Hum Vees. Only 35 percent said basic civil infrastructure in \n     Iraq, including roads, electricity, water service, and health \n     care, has not improved over the past year. Three of every \n     four were male respondents, with 63 percent under the age of \n     30.\n       The survey included 944 military respondents interviewed at \n     several undisclosed locations throughout Iraq. The names of \n     the specific locations and specific personnel who conducted \n     the survey are being withheld for security purposes. Surveys \n     were conducted face-to-face using random sampling techniques. \n     The margin of error for the survey, conducted Jan. 18 through \n     Feb. 14, 2006, is +/- 3.3 percentage points.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Another poll, of December 29, 2006, by the Military Times, \nthe most credible military newspaper in America, indicates that barely \none-third of our service members approve of the way the President is \nhandling the war. In fact, only 41 percent of our military now believes \nthe United States should have gone to war in Iraq in the first place.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this poll be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Military Times Poll, Dec. 29, 2006]\n\n                            Down on the War\n\n                          (By Robert Hodierne)\n\n       The American military--once a staunch supporter of \n     President Bush and the Iraq war--has grown increasingly \n     pessimistic about chances for victory.\n       For the first time, more troops disapprove of the \n     president's handling of the war than approve of it. Barely \n     one-third of service members approve of the way the president \n     is handling the war, according to the 2006 Military Times \n     Poll.\n       When the military was feeling most optimistic about the \n     war--in 2004--83 percent of poll respondents thought success \n     in Iraq was likely. This year, that number has shrunk to 50 \n     percent.\n       Only 35 percent of the military members polled this year \n     said they approve of the way President Bush is handling the \n     war, while 42 percent said they disapproved. The president's \n     approval rating among the military is only slightly higher \n     than for the population as a whole. In 2004, when his \n     popularity peaked, 63 percent of the military approved of \n     Bush's handling of the war. While approval of the president's \n     war leadership has slumped, his overall approval remains high \n     among the military.\n       Just as telling, in this year's poll only 41 percent of the \n     military said the U.S. should have gone to war in Iraq in the \n     first place, down from 65 percent in 2003. That closely \n     reflects the beliefs of the general population today--45 \n     percent agreed in a recent USA Today/Gallup poll.\n       Professor David Segal, director of the Center for Research \n     on Military Organization at the University of Maryland, was \n     not surprised by the changing attitude within the military.\n       ``They're seeing more casualties and fatalities and less \n     progress,'' Segal said.\n       He added, ``Part of what we're seeing is a recognition that \n     the intelligence that led to the war was wrong.''\n       Whatever war plan the president comes up with later this \n     month, it likely will have the replacement of American troops \n     with Iraqis as its ultimate goal. The military is not \n     optimistic that will happen soon. Only about one in five \n     service members said that large numbers of American troops \n     can be replaced within the next two years. More than one-\n     third think it will take more than five years. And more than \n     half think the U.S. will have to stay in Iraq more than five \n     years to achieve its goals.\n       Almost half of those responding think we need more troops \n     in Iraq than we have there now. A surprising 13 percent said \n     we should have no troops there. As for Afghanistan force \n     levels, 39 percent think we need more troops there. But while \n     they want more troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly three-\n     quarters of the respondents think today's military is \n     stretched too thin to be effective.\n       The mail survey, conducted Nov. 13 through Dec. 22, is the \n     fourth annual gauge of active-duty military subscribers to \n     the Military Times newspapers. The results should not be read \n     as representative of the military as a whole; the survey's \n     respondents are on average older, more experienced, more \n     likely to be officers and more career-oriented than the \n     overall military population.\n       Among the respondents, 66 percent have deployed at least \n     once to Iraq or Afghanistan. In the overall active-duty \n     force, according to the Department of Defense, that number is \n     72 percent.\n       The poll has come to be viewed by some as a barometer of \n     the professional career military. It is the only independent \n     poll done on an annual basis. The margin of error on this \n     year's poll is plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n       While approval of Bush's handling of the war has plunged, \n     approval for his overall performance as president remains \n     high at 52 percent. While that is down from his high of 71 \n     percent in 2004, it is still far above the approval ratings \n     of the general population, where that number has fallen into \n     the 30s.\n       While Bush fared well overall, his political party didn't. \n     In the three previous polls, nearly 60 percent of the \n     respondents identified themselves as Republicans, which is \n     about double the population as a whole. But in this year's \n     poll, only 46 percent of the military respondents said they \n     were Republicans. However, there was not a big gain in those \n     identifying themselves as Democrats--a figure that \n     consistently hovers around 16 percent. The big gain came \n     among people who said they were independents.\n       Similarly, when asked to describe their political views on \n     a scale from very conservative to very liberal, there was a \n     slight shift from the conservative end of the spectrum to the \n     middle or moderate range. Liberals within the military are \n     still a rare breed, with less than 10 percent of respondents \n     describing themselves that way.\n\n\n                           Seeing media bias\n\n       Segal was not surprised that the military support for the \n     war and the president's handling of it had slumped. He said \n     he believes that military opinion often mirrors that of the \n     civilian population, even though it might lag in time. He \n     added, ``[The military] will always be more pro-military and \n     pro-war than the civilians. That's why they are in this line \n     of work.''\n       The poll asked, ``How do you think each of these groups \n     view the military?'' Respondents overwhelmingly said \n     civilians have a favorable impression of the military (86 \n     percent). They even thought politicians look favorably on the \n     military (57 percent). But they are convinced the media hate \n     them--only 39 percent of military respondents said they think \n     the media have a favorable view of the troops.\n       The poll also asked if the senior military leadership, \n     President Bush, civilian military leadership and Congress \n     have their best interests at heart.\n       Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of those surveyed said the \n     senior military leadership has the best interests of the \n     troops at heart. And though they don't think much of the way \n     he's handling the war, 48 percent said the same about \n     President Bush. But they take a dim view of civilian military \n     leadership--only 32 percent said they think it has their best \n     interests at heart. And only 23 percent think Congress is \n     looking out for them.\n       Despite concerns early in the war about equipment \n     shortages, 58 percent said they believe they are supplied \n     with the best possible weapons and equipment.\n       While President Bush always portrays the war in Iraq as \n     part of the larger war on terrorism, many in the military are \n     not convinced. The respondents were split evenly--47 percent \n     both ways--on whether the Iraq war is part of the war on \n     terrorism. The rest had no opinion.\n       On many questions in the poll, some respondents said they \n     didn't have an opinion or declined to answer. That number was \n     typically in the 10 percent range.\n       But on questions about the president and on war strategy, \n     that number reached 20 percent and higher. Segal said he was \n     surprised the percentage refusing to offer an opinion wasn't \n     larger.\n       ``There is a strong strain in military culture not to \n     criticize the commander in chief,'' he said.\n       One contentious area of military life in the past year has \n     been the role religion should play. Some troops have \n     complained that they feel pressure to attend religious \n     services. Others have complained that chaplains and superior \n     officers have tried to convert them. Half of the poll \n     respondents said that at least once a month, they attend \n     official military gatherings, other than meals and chapel \n     services, that began with a prayer. But 80 percent said they \n     feel free to practice and express their religion within the \n     military.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I believe very strongly that we should leave our military \npeople out of these political debates. I am not using these figures to \nadvance the Democratic Party's point. I believe it is inappropriate for \nthe other party to use our military people in a way that might insulate \nthem from criticism over the woeful failures of this administration's \npolicy. The American people's confidence in this administration is at \nrock bottom. Many rightly believe they were misled on the reasons for \ngoing to war.\n  The administration's credibility has suffered--rightly so--also with \nrespect to its intentions for dealing with Iran. I do not believe one \ncan speak of our responsibility on these immediate issues without \nstating clearly our concerns about the entire region, and especially \nthe administration's position regarding its constitutional authority to \nuse military force outside of Iraq.\n  The administration's view of its Presidential authority to conduct \nunilateral military action against other\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\ncountries, and particularly with Iran, was documented in President \nBush's signing statement accompanying the original authorization for \nthe use of force against Iraq in October 2002. I urge my colleagues to \nexamine this language. In part, it states:\n\n       My signing this resolution does not constitute any change \n     in the long-standing positions of the executive branch on \n     either the President's constitutional authority to use force \n     to deter, prevent, or respond to aggression or other threats \n     to U.S. interests.\n\n  In other words, if one were to read that carefully, this \nadministration is stating that it has the authority to use force to \nrespond to threats to our interests. What is an ``interest''?\n  I have raised this language with the Secretary of State, as well as \nwith the Deputy Secretary. My question was whether this administration \nbelieves that it possesses the authority to conduct unilateral military \nactivity against Iran in the absence of a direct threat and without the \napproval of the Congress. I have not received a clear answer from \neither of them on that point. That is troubling.\n  This administration and its supporters must understand the realities \nthat are causing us, as a Congress, to finally say enough is enough. \nAfter 5 years of misguided policy, ineffective leadership, and \ndiminished U.S. stature around the world, the Congress must show the \nway to reclaiming the moral high ground and exert its proper oversight \nrole more forcefully.\n  For these reasons, I support the pending Iraq resolution before us, \nand I will vote for cloture. I urge my fellow Senators to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was a Member of the Senate when we \nvoted to authorize the use of force against Iraq. It was not just a \nrapid, quickly done deal, we talked about it for months. We talked \nabout primarily the 16 or 17 resolutions that Saddam Hussein had failed \nto comply with that he agreed to with the United States and the United \nNations; that he was setting about systematically to break out of the \nbox of the embargo placed on him because he failed to comply with those \nresolutions.\n  We were flying, if you remember, aircraft over Iraq on a regular \nbasis, and they were shooting missiles at us, trying to bring down our \naircraft. We were dropping bombs on them on a weekly basis. This was \nthe context of the debate that we entered into.\n  At the end, a great deal of emphasis was placed on the question of \nweapons of mass destruction by the President and others. But for most \nof us, I think it was a strategic American decision based on the \nfundamental questions: Were we going to give up? Were we going to let \nthe embargo elapse? And would Saddam Hussein be able to continue to \nsay--actually say with conviction and some honesty--that he had won the \n1991 gulf war? He said he won the war. He never complied with the \nagreements that he entered into and, as a result, we entered this \nconflict.\n  The initial invasion went far better than most of us believed \npossible, than many predicted--those who supported the war and those \nwho did not. The aftermath has been much more troubling and difficult. \nI have been one of those who shared General Abizaid's view of let's \nkeep the number of our troops as low as we can, let's push as hard as \nwe can to train and bring on the Iraqi forces, and let's let their \ngovernment be responsible for its own activities as soon as possible. \nBut I have to be honest, it has been more difficult than most of us \nwould have thought. We now have many soldiers there in dangerous \ncircumstances. So I am concerned about that. I respect anybody who is \nconcerned about that.\n  I am not here to say I know you are wrong, that I know this is the \nonly way and the only right policy, and I guarantee you it will be \nsuccessful. I want to say that in the beginning. We have some difficult \nchoices to make, and I respect people who don't agree.\n  I am not able, however, to justify a resolution that appears to be \ndesigned to embarrass the President, appears to be contradictory to our \nNation's policy, that would indicate to our adversaries and enemies \nthat we are divided. I cannot see that as a positive step for us. I am \ninclined to agree with the view of General Petraeus. He finished at the \ntop of his class at West Point. He was No. 1 in his class at the \nCommand and General Staff College. He got his Ph.D. at Princeton. He \nwas in Mosul, right after the initial invasion, commanding the 101st \nAirborne Division. He was a Ranger, a soldier, a fabulous leader. I saw \nhim in operation when some of the Alabama National Guard members had \nfelt they were not being fully utilized right after they got to Mosul. \nI told General Petraeus, and he said:\n\n       Let's go over and meet them.\n\n  He told them:\n\n       You are part of our effort. I will be bringing you right \n     away the Screaming Eagle patch and you are going to put it on \n     and be one of ours. There won't be any difference in the \n     Guard and Reserve.\n\n  That was such an example of leadership, I thought. Later, he showed \nhow they captured Uday and Qusay under his command. He showed how they \nformed the government. He had a Sunni, Shia, Christian, and a Kurd on \nthe city council. He formed a court system. He was a fabulous leader \nand everybody recognized that. He finished his tour and came back.\n  We realized that we needed to spend more effort and be more effective \nin training the Iraqi Army. So we sent him over there. We asked him to \ngo back. He went back to specifically be in charge of training the \nIraqi security forces. During that time, he got to know virtually every \nmajor Iraqi military leader. He knows them personally and he worked \nwith them and with most of the Iraqi leadership. He said he didn't know \nPrime Minister Maliki, but he knows most of them.\n  After some 15 months at that, well over 2 years in Iraq, he came back \nhome and he was placed in charge of writing the doctrine for the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense on how to confront and defeat an insurgency \noperation, the so-called Counterinsurgency Manual. It is a real serious \ndocument. A lot of people don't know this, but there are ways--proven \nways--to confront and defeat insurgency operations. In fact, one \nmilitary historian recently pointed out that very few insurgency \noperations ultimately become successful. They can cause great distress \nfor substantial periods of time, but they usually fail. There is a \nfairly significant number--70, 80, 90 percent--that fail, according to \nthis report. So this manual that he painstakingly put together had \nincredible subtleties in it about how to handle various situations \nbecause every situation is different. What might be true in the Kurdish \nnorth may not be true in Bosra, the Shia south, or in the Sunni west. \nEvery part of the Sunni and Shia and Kurdish areas are different \nthemselves. Their tribes and their heritage and their religious sects \nare different. You have to handle them all differently.\n\n  President Bush asked General Petraeus to help formulate a plan to be \nsuccessful in Iraq. He committed to him five additional brigades, over \n20,000 soldiers. That is a bitter pill to me. I was very pleased--and I \nspoke out when some were critical--and in favor of General Casey over a \nyear ago saying he hoped to be able to bring troops home. He brought \nsome home. He asked for more at different times. What happened? Well, \nviolence began to pick up substantially in Baghdad. The Sunni and al-\nQaida terrorists saw the country beginning to come together, and they \ndecided to make a devilish decision, and that decision was to \ndeliberately provoke a sectarian conflict. They began to attack the \nShia in the marketplaces and they attacked their holy mosque at \nSamarra. They blew up that mosque and killed people. It began to work. \nShia militias began to grow and strengthen and develop, feeling they \nwere not being protected by the government. They began to kill Sunnis, \nand people would find bodies that had been killed execution style. It \nwas a very grim thing to happen. It still is going on to a substantial \ndegree.\n  But I believe that this can be reversed. I cannot guarantee that, but \nI believe it can be reversed with the leadership of the United States, \nwith increased effort on behalf of the Iraqi military and the country \nof Iraq, that they can begin to reverse this trend. I will just cite \nthat recently General Conway testified at a hearing. He commanded the \nMarines in the western part of Fallujah and during some of the toughest \nfighting. Now commandant of\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nthe Marine Corps, he testified a few days ago. I told him about the \nvisit Senators Levin, Warner, Pryor, and I made to Iraq last fall. The \nbriefing that we had gotten by the Marines in the Ramadi area really \nconcerned me. Some of the information they gave--and the Presiding \nOfficer and I traveled over there, and I know he cares about these \nissues. That briefing was one of the more troubling things I had heard \nin visiting there five times, as I have. He pointed out how, in just a \nmatter of weeks, that made a dramatic change; that 12 out of 16 tribal \nleaders in that area have gotten fed up with al-Qaida and their \nmurdering ways, their parasitic ways, and their domination. And they \nhave made agreements with the U.S. military. We are helping them create \ntheir own law enforcement entities, hiring their young people, and they \nare resisting al-Qaida. There has been a dramatic change in the \ntoughest area, the Sunni area, the area where most of al-Qaida has \nbeen. So that is good.\n  I say to my colleagues that can happen in Baghdad. Don't think that \nbecause things have been very difficult in the last year they cannot \nbegin to get better. General Petraeus has stepped up. We are going to \nincrease our forces. The Iraqis are going to increase their forces. I \nthink the Iraqis know this may be their last chance to save this \ncountry as a decent and progressive country that treats people fairly \nand equally. I think they are beginning to wake up to that fact--I hope \nso. They are moving substantial numbers of troops in there. They are \nnot as good as the American troops in many ways. They have a lot of \ndifficulties. We know that. But they have taken more casualties than we \nhave, and they continue to sign up. We have an opportunity, I believe, \nto make a difference.\n\n  If this effort does not succeed and we do not begin to notice that \nmore progress has been made, that the Iraqis do not meet certain \nbenchmarks we have called on them to make, then we do need to review \nour policy. I have to say it. What we will do then, I am not sure. But \nwe need to be smart about it. We don't need to be aberrational or \nspasmodic in how we face those challenges.\n  What happened on the floor of the Senate is not something that I \nthink has brought credit to this body. After approving General Petraeus \nto go to Iraq 94 to 0, after making clear we intend to fund the policy \nthe President, as Commander in Chief, is executing, our soldiers are \nexecuting, and soldiers have been sent over there as part of this \nsurge--some have already gotten there as part of this surge--it became \na goal of the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the Democratic \nleadership, apparently, to vote on a resolution that disapproved it, \nthat criticized the President, I guess to make happy some of the people \nout there who oppose this war so deeply, some with great passion and \nlegitimate concerns and some with fevered brow who believe we are over \nthere trying to steal Iraqi oil. But that crowd is out there. They want \na resolution that is critical of the President and this policy.\n  Our leader, the Republican leader, said: You can have that vote, that \nwill be all right, let's have that vote, but Senator McCain has a \ndifferent view. Senator McCain's view is we need to set some benchmarks \nfor the Iraqis and we need to support the President. Senator Gregg said \nit is most important when troops are in harm's way, when they are \nplacing their lives at risk for us, that we tell them we are going to \nsupport them financially. Oh, no, we can't vote on those amendments. We \nare only going to vote on the one we want.\n  This resolution, by the way, should have come, by historical \ntradition and rules of the Senate, out of the Armed Services Committee, \nbut it didn't come out of the Armed Services Committee. Why didn't it \ncome out of the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member? \nBecause it doesn't have the votes. It wouldn't have passed out of the \nArmed Services Committee. So what Senator Reid did is, he filed it as a \nbill instead of a resolution. He filed it and, under rule XIV, brought \nit to the floor and determined that no other amendments could be \naccepted or even voted on, only his view should be voted on. And they \ncarefully calculated, I am sure, to make sure they had over 50 votes, \nso they would be able to pass one resolution that was deemed an attack \non the President and a rejection of the policy we are now funding and \nis being executed by our soldiers who are far more worthy, in my view, \nof maturity and respect than a Congress that gets itself tied up in \nthis kind of mess.\n  I think most of us on this side--even some Republicans and some \nDemocrats who supported the resolution--have refused to vote for \ncloture to bring it up for a vote because they think Senator McCain's \nand Senator Gregg's resolutions deserve a vote too. Senator McCain \nsaid: I would just be satisfied if you vote on Gregg if you don't vote \non mine.\n  I would like to vote on both of them, and I am not afraid to vote on \nthe Democratic resolution. I would vote on all three of them. I am not \nafraid to talk about this war or to talk about the resolutions. But \nsomehow the media has adopted the Democrat's talking points and \nsuggests Republicans don't want to debate and vote on the issue. That \nis not true. How many times do we have to say that? I don't think what \nI said is inaccurate. If it is, I would like to be corrected on the \nfundamental debate in which we find ourselves.\n  But what I wish to say to my colleagues is we are, at this very \nmoment, in reality, financially supporting the policy with which they \ndisagree. Advice and suggestions from business, athletics, church, and \nfamilies needs to be welcome, but naysaying after a decision is reached \nis nearly always destructive, in my opinion. People have to pull \ntogether once a decision is reached. We only have one Commander in \nChief. We have the absolute power to shut off every dime going to Iraq \nand bring our troops home immediately. That is the constitutional power \nthis Congress has. But while we are executing this effort in Iraq, we \nonly have one Commander in Chief. And for the life of me, I can see no \nadvantage to our Nation, to our foreign policy or to our soldiers in a \nresolution that disagrees with the President's plan, a plan to which we \nhave our soldiers committing their lives this very moment.\n  Congress should either support it or stop it. But, of course, we all \nknow the awesome responsibility that voting for a precipitous \nwithdrawal out of Iraq would entail because stopping the funding for \nIraq is real, just like funding Iraq is real, just like voting for \nGeneral Petraeus is real. It is not positioning, it is not an \nexpression of concern or an effort to distance oneself from a war that \nover three-fourths of us in this Senate voted for but has now become \nvery difficult.\n  The President studied the Baker-Hamilton report, he met with his \ncommanders in Iraq and in the United States, and he met with retired \nofficers, elder statesmen. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Peter Pace, started a bottom-up review of our Iraq policy in \nAugust. I called him about that time to raise some questions and urge \nthat he do that. He said: Senator, I have started that already. After \nall of this evaluation and receipt of ideas for improvement, both \npublic and private, our President, the one given the power to decide \nsuch issues in our system, made his call. He changed his policy. \nPerhaps he should have done it earlier. I think this kind of review \nwould have been more appropriate earlier.\n\n  The President has gone through a deliberative process, though, and \nmade his decision, and I have decided the right response for me, as a \nMember of this Senate trying to serve the national interest, is to \nsupport that policy, at least for the immediate future, and to support \nthose who will execute it--our military personnel.\n  Others may disagree. An official expression of disagreement, though, \nabout a policy we authorized and we are now funding and our soldiers \nare executing does not meet, I believe, high standards of \nresponsibility to which a great Senate should adhere. Please remember \nalso that what we do is not contained just in these Halls. I am not \npersuaded there can be any effect, other than a pernicious one, on \nthose allies and other nations that are assisting us in our efforts. \nNor do I see how the threat of an imminent withdrawal could cause the \nIraqi Government and the leaders of the various sects and groups to be \nmore willing to reach an accord than would be achieved if we continue \nassistance in restoring\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\norder, particularly in the nation's capital. I don't know. I don't \nthink so myself. If it was so, I would be persuaded. If that would be \nthe result of a rapid withdrawal, that they would all get together and \nreach an accord, then I would support it because I don't think we need \nto be an occupying force in Iraq. But this is not what our generals \ntell us. It is not what we have heard from the intelligence community.\n  Some people said: I talked to a retired general; that is what he \nsaid. Maybe that is what he said. Maybe that retired general is right. \nThe people we are hearing about are not saying this is any kind of \npanacea, to pull out, and there is going to be harmony and compromise \nreached all at once.\n  In fact, many are saying the violence in Baghdad is so significant \nthat if we allow it to continue to grow, it makes it harder for the \nwarring factions to get together and reach an accord.\n  Still, despite the difficulties, our experts in public and private \nconversations believe there is hope for stability with this new policy \nin Iraq, this new surge. They give that evaluation with full and \nrealistic evaluations of all the challenges we face. The new Iraqi \npermanent Government has only been formed for 8 months, maybe 9 months \nnow. That Government has only been up for 8 or 9 months. The forces of \nviolence, oppression, and extremism have attacked it full force. They \nare determined to bring it down. But it still stands, and it has made \nnew commitments to taking the necessary steps toward security and \nprogress.\n  This is a test for them, no doubt. Maybe they will fail. Maybe they \nwould not meet the commitments they have made. But perhaps not. Perhaps \nthis fragile Government and the Iraqi Army working in new and better \nways with General Petraeus and our forces together can be successful, \nas our experts tell us is possible and realistic.\n  I, thus, have concluded this Congress should fund this new strategy, \nnot adopt a resolution that has any tendency whatsoever to lessen the \nchance of that strategy being successful.\n  Finally, I do not see how a congressional resolution that disagrees \nwith, or one that rejects the President's new policy will have any \nother effect than to reduce the morale of our soldiers.\n  Right out here a couple of days ago, I talked with a group from \nHartsville, AL. The man pulled me aside and said his son was an \ninfantry officer at Fort Benning. He said: Senator, I want you to know \none thing. When you make your decisions, don't think they don't know \nwhat is going on. He said: ``They are watching you like a hawk.''\n  We have a responsibility to them. Yes, we have a responsibility to \nsay pull out if we have to pull out, if that is the thing to do--and I \ndon't think it is yet; I think we have a chance for success. If that is \nour decision, so be it. But when we send them over there, they should \nbe supported. They should have no doubt that we are going to be with \nthem.\n  We are waging a war against violent extremists who bomb markets, who \nbehead people who disagree with them, who murder, who kill, who destroy \nteachers because they teach young girls how to read and write. So this \nis a complex effort. It is an important effort that to date has \nprotected our homeland from further attack.\n  We didn't choose this duty. It has fallen to us. By working together, \nI believe we can achieve more in Iraq than many people think.\n  And I will say this, while we are being very serious about the \nchallenges we face. I have had personal meetings with Secretary Gates, \nthe new Secretary of Defense, and an extended meeting with GEN Peter \nPace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and I had a good long \nconversation with General Petraeus, the new commander in Iraq, and \nAdmiral Fallon, who is going to be the Central Command, commander. I \nhave asked them, and each one of them stated to me that they fully \nunderstand their responsibility to give us their best military advice, \nand if at any time this conflict in Iraq becomes untenable, if at any \ntime they conclude that putting more soldiers into harm's way will not \nbe successful and will not achieve the aims which we are seeking there, \nthey will tell us.\n  I asked Peter Pace that in an open hearing, and he said: ``Yes, sir, \nSenator, I understand that.'' Secretary Gates cut in and said: \n``Senator, I fully understand that, and I feel like that is my number \none responsibility.'' I asked General Petraeus that, and he said the \nsame. And I asked him if he believed he could be successful. Remember, \nthis is the man who spent over 2 years in Iraq. He is the best of the \nbest. He has written a manual on how to confront and defeat an \ninsurgency. His answer to whether he can be successful, in sum, was: \n``Senator, I do, and I wouldn't be going over there if I didn't think I \ncould be.''\n  I know people are worried about this conflict. I am worried about it. \nI talked to a widow yesterday, whose fabulous husband was killed in \nIraq, and I don't take it lightly at all. But we are a nation that has \nbeen attacked and we have a responsibility to defend our just national \ninterest, and our just national interest would be greatly served by a \nprosperous, free, democratic Iraq, where terrorists do not find haven \nand which is not subverted by hostile forces. We have a national \ninterest in that, as well as a humanitarian interest.\n  I think we need to give General Petraeus a chance. I think we may \nfind that progress in Baghdad can occur, even when it is dark, as it \ndid in Al Anbar Province a few months ago. I was feeling pretty \ndiscouraged about what was happening there, but great progress has been \nmade in the last few weeks there. It is time for us to stick together.\n  I don't think this resolution is good. If we are going to vote on it, \nwe ought to vote on the Gregg resolution and we ought to vote on the \nMcCain resolution. Because only together will that convey to the world, \nour allies, and our soldiers the real feelings and insights of this \nCongress. As I have said from the beginning, I don't favor any \nresolution. We have done what we have to do. We sent General Petraeus \nand we sent money to execute the policy. I don't know why we have to \nhave a resolution at all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe motion to invoke cloture to proceed to S. 574 so the Senate can \nundertake a full, vigorous, and honest debate on the future course of \nAmerican policy for the war in Iraq.\n  As we speak about and debate the war, let us never forget our troops \nin battle, those troops in battle on the streets in Baghdad, in Anbar \nProvince, or other areas of Iraq. We also remember, as we debate this \nissue, their families and their sacrifice. Finally, today, and in all \nthe days we debate this critically important issue to our country, we \nhonor the sacrifice of those soldiers and marines who gave, as \nPresident Lincoln said at Gettysburg, ``the last full measure of \ndevotion to their country.'' We pray for them today and always, and we \npray for ourselves that we may be worthy of their valor.\n  At this time in the Senate we are confronted with two simple \nquestions: First, does the Senate agree with President Bush's plan to \nescalate our military involvement in Iraq by deploying some 21,000 more \ntroops? Second, will the Senate vote tomorrow to allow debate to go \nforward?\n  Just those two questions confront us today and tomorrow. There will \nbe further debate about our policy in Iraq in the weeks and months \nahead, but for the next few days it is those two questions.\n  As I have stated before, I oppose this escalation, but I also support \ndebating it. The grave question of war must always be--always be--the \nsubject of vigorous debate, especially in the Senate. As a Senator from \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a State that has lost 150 young men \nand women in combat, I have a solemn obligation to speak out about the \nescalation.\n  Many of these brave Americans from Pennsylvania come from small towns \nsuch as Rockport and Connellsville and Beaver Falls, and from cities \nsuch as Bethlehem and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. I have an obligation \nto speak out against those policies that only increase the likelihood \nthat even more of\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nPennsylvania's sons and daughters will die or be grievously wounded on \nbehalf of a flawed strategy.\n  I had hoped, like many in this Chamber, we could have moved forward \nwith the debate on Iraq 2 weeks ago. The American people don't \nunderstand why the Senate isn't debating this war when all of America \nexpects us to do so. Perhaps a rare Saturday vote will help this body \nrealize the importance as this debate moves forward.\n  We owe it to the troops, their families, and to those who have loved \nand lost someone dear to them in this war to debate our Iraq policy and \nto clearly express our opposition to the President's escalation. The \nAmerican people have clearly voiced their strong support and their \ndesire for their elected representatives to address this issue. The \nelections last November turned in large part on the failure of the \nprevious Congress to engage in adequate oversight of the administration \nand ask the tough questions when it came to the execution of the war. \nDebating is essential to good oversight.\n  We know that recent polls conducted across America reveal Americans \nconsider the war as one of the two most important problems facing our \nNation. An overwhelming 63 percent of respondents in a recent national \npoll expressed concern that the Senate had been unsuccessful to date in \nattempts to hold a debate on the war in Iraq. We have an obligation to \nact, and that begins with a full debate.\n  S. 574 is short but eloquent. It respects and honors our troops who \nare serving or who have served with distinction in Iraq, and it \ncommunicates our disapproval of the President's escalation of the war. \nIt mandates--mandates--additional reporting requirements so there is \ntransparency with regard to military, political, and diplomatic \noperations in Iraq. This resolution deserves our support because it \nsends the right message to the President to change course in Iraq.\n\n  In the first 5 weeks of this new Congress, as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have listened carefully to more than 25 \nwitnesses over the course of a dozen hearings, some 50 hours of \ntestimony from generals and other military experts, diplomats and \nforeign policy experts, the cochairmen of the Iraq Study Group, and so \nmany others. I have asked tough questions, and I have listened to \nstatements and questions from my colleagues, some of whom have had \ndecades of experience in foreign affairs and the oversight of military \noperations. After all these hearings, I am even more certain that this \nescalation is the wrong strategy.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate--we know it by the acronym NIE--\nreleased in January on Iraq's prospects for near-term stability paints \na dire picture. The unclassified version describes a growing sectarian-\nbased polarization, ineffective security forces with questionable \nloyalties, and an all-but-certain rise in communal violence in the \ncoming months. The National Intelligence Estimate clarifies that Iraq's \nviolence today is primarily driven by ``the self-sustaining character \nof Iraq's internal sectarian dynamics.''\n  Reading the key judgments of the NIE, I can only conclude that \npolitical reconciliation between the respective leaders of Iraq's \nvaried populations is the best way and probably the only way to reduce \nthe violence and to begin to create a stable state that is not a threat \nto its neighbors. Escalating military conflict by inserting additional \nU.S. troops in Iraq is not the answer.\n  As Chairman Biden remarked during the Foreign Relations Committee's \ndeliberations on a related resolution, this effort is not inspired by a \ndesire to embarrass or isolate President Bush. Rather, it is an attempt \nto demonstrate to the President that his approach is flawed and will \nnot result in the outcome he seeks. The President is still searching \nfor a military solution when, in fact, it is time for a political \nsolution led by the Iraqis themselves. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-\nMaliki himself declared last November, ``The crisis is political, and \nthe ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of \ninnocents are the politicians.''\n  What we need is not just a political strategy; we need sustained and \nvigorous diplomatic engagement that I would argue has been lacking. The \nPresident and his senior officials have failed to make the case that \nthe so-called new way forward in Iraq is, in fact, new or promises \nsignificant changes needed to achieve real victory. Instead, the \nPresident's escalation strategy risks repeating mistakes already made. \nIt inserts more American troops into the crossfire of growing sectarian \nconflict, and it ignores the urgent need to reorient the mission of \nU.S. forces in Iraq toward those objectives which offer our best chance \nto leave behind a secure and stable Iraq.\n  In spite of all the rhetoric from the White House in recent weeks, I \nbelieve, and many in this Senate believe, that the President's policy \nis more or less more of the same: Stay the course. The United States \ntoday has approximately 137,000 troops in Iraq, growing by the day and \nby the week. Sending an additional 21,000 troops will not fundamentally \nchange the current dynamic in Iraq.\n  The reality is that more American troops is not the answer in Iraq. \nGeneral Abizaid, the outgoing U.S. Central Command commander, testified \nin November that the unanimous opinion of his top subordinates was that \nmore American troops would only perpetuate the dependence of Iraqi \ntroops and would not offer a positive solution. No matter how many \ntroops we send, they cannot provide lasting security on the streets of \nBaghdad or other Iraqi cities. Only fully equipped, trained, and \ndedicated Iraqi military and police forces--those who do not pick and \nchoose sides among sectarian groups--only they can provide the type of \npermanent security that will enable the Iraqi political and civilian \nlife to emerge and the nation to embark on a path to reconciliation.\n  We heard from former Congressman Lee Hamilton during our Foreign \nRelations Committee hearings. He noted in his testimony before that \ncommittee that the money, time, and attention we are devoting to \nescalating the level of U.S. forces in Iraq must not detract from what \nshould be a primary mission for the United States: training Iraqi \nsecurity forces to enhance their capability to take the lead and allow \nU.S. forces to redeploy out of that country.\n  Congressman Hamilton and so many others have placed the primacy on \nthe question of training. Instead, by adopting the President's \nstrategy, I fear we are sending an additional 21,000 troops without a \nmore focused mission and lacking a solid plan to accomplish it.\n  I fear we are still investing too much trust in the Maliki \ngovernment, a regime that has failed to demonstrate it is acting on \nbehalf of all Iraqis and may be focused only on one sectarian group. I \nfear American forces will continue to serve as a bull's-eye target for \nthose resentful of a prolonged U.S. occupation in Iraq. In short, I \nfear, and many in this Senate fear, we are sending more American men \nand women into Iraq without a new blueprint for victory and without the \nessential political, diplomatic, and international groundwork required \nto succeed.\n\n  The President has based his troop escalation on the hope--the risky \nhope, I would argue--that this time the Maliki regime will carry \nthrough on its commitments and deliver the required Iraqi forces to \nhelp U.S. forces secure neighborhoods throughout Baghdad and, more \nimportant, then remain to allow reconstruction to proceed and normal \nlife to return. Yet the record is not encouraging. In Operation \nTogether Forward, Prime Minister Maliki had pledged six battalions, but \nonly two were sent. Some of those Iraqi units suffered subsequent \nserious attrition rates. Many of those forces have been infiltrated by \nthe very sectarian militias they are now being asked to disarm.\n  We are already seeing troubling signs in the initial stages of this \nlatest escalation. The New York Times, January 22, the Washington Post, \nUSA Today, and so many other news articles which I will not repeat here \ntoday have talked about the problems with Iraqi security forces showing \nup late or not showing up at all, not serious about their mission, not \ntrained, not focused, and frankly not helping enough in terms of \nhelping American forces. Americans are dying because of that \nincompetence. The fact remains that it is very difficult to rely on \nIraqi forces when you have to ask them to deploy outside of their \nnormal areas of operation and their ethnic strongholds.\n  I also retain real doubts when the President insists that this time, \nthis\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\ntime it will be different, that Mr. Maliki now means it when he says \nIraqi forces will truly crack down on all troublemakers, whether they \nare Shia or Sunni. The Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to \nassume a greater share of security responsibilities, disband militias, \nconsider constitutional amendments, and enact laws to reconcile \nsectarian differences and improve the quality of essential services for \nthe Iraqi people. Yet, despite those promises, little has been achieved \nby the Iraqis.\n  Moreover, I am skeptical of this escalation of U.S. troops because we \nhave seen it before. We have seen it before, tried over and over again. \nOperation Together Forward in 2006 represented a similar escalation; \n12,000 additional U.S. troops were introduced into the city of Baghdad, \nonly to see U.S. and Iraqi casualties spike considerably without a \nsustained reduction in sectarian violence. We have seen similar efforts \nto ``flood the zone'' with additional U.S. troops in places such as \nFallujah and Ramadi, only resulting in temporary gains. If more troops \nhave not worked in the recent past, why should we have any reason to \nbelieve it will work this time?\n  I am concerned, as are so many others, about the dual-chain-of-\ncommand concept that is being introduced as part of this escalation. \nRecently, Prime Minister al-Maliki's commander in the region and the \ncapital itself has been trying to carry out part of this strategy. At \nthe same time, there will be a separate or parallel U.S. command headed \nby MG Joseph Fil, Jr. Both commanders will have ultimate control over \ntheir own national troops, but this ``partnered'' command could create \nserious complications if there are disputes between U.S. and Iraqi \nmilitary forces over specific operations. A unified chain of command is \none of the hallmark principles that have long governed deployment of \nU.S. forces abroad.\n  Finally, I oppose this escalation strategy because I fear it will \nonly exacerbate the longstanding strains on our Nation's military \noverall. Seven years ago, President Bush declared that his predecessor \nwas leaving office with a military in decline. He alleged that the \nprevious administration had not adequately funded our Armed Forces \nwhile simultaneously deploying those forces in excessive engagements \naround the world. It is one of the most tragic ironies that this \nPresident is himself now stretching our military to a genuine breaking \npoint, as he pursues a misguided strategy in Iraq.\n  The Washington Post recently published an important article \ndocumenting the impacts of this proposed troop escalation. According to \nthe Post, the Army and Marine Corps already lack thousands of necessary \nvehicles, armor kits, and other equipment needed to supply the extra \nforces. Diverting 21,000 troops from other essential missions around \nthe world will only further deteriorate the readiness of our overall \nground forces, making it more difficult to respond quickly and \ndecisively in the event of other military contingencies, and raise the \nlikelihood of greater U.S. casualties.\n  Our Nation's military is facing a genuine crisis. The war in Iraq has \nexacted a heavy toll--in casualties, first and foremost, but also in \nterms of combat equipment that undergirds our fighting men and women. \nOur National Guard and Reserve troops in particular are paying a heavy \nprice. Army data shows that the Army National Guard units today \nonly have, on average, 40 percent of their required equipment--40 \npercent. National Guard combat brigades are being involuntarily \nmobilized, and reservists are being sent back to the command theater on \na repeated basis.\n\n  Representative John Murtha, a decorated marine from my home State of \nPennsylvania, painted a distressing picture of our military's \nreadiness--or I should say lack thereof--during recent testimony before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As he noted:\n\n       At the beginning of the Iraq war, 80 percent of all Army \n     units and almost 100 percent of active combat units were \n     rated at the highest state of readiness. Today, virtually all \n     of our active duty combat units at home and all of our guard \n     units are at the lowest state of readiness, primarily due to \n     equipment shortages resulting from repeated and extended \n     deployments in Iraq.\n\n  Chairman Murtha then went on to cite recent House testimony from a \nsenior Pentagon official that our country was threatened because we \nlacked readiness at home.\n  I welcome, as so many do, the President's intention to expand our \nmilitary--permanently elevating the Army and Marine Corps' Active-Duty \nranks over the next 5 years. But that is only a long-term solution. Our \ncurrent forces are badly overextended, and an escalation in strategy in \nIraq will only worsen that condition. Our Nation faces growing \nchallenges around the world. We must ensure that our military forces \nreceive adequate training, are fully equipped, and retain the necessary \nflexibility to quickly respond to contingencies wherever they may \narise. Pouring more troops into Iraq does not make those requirements \nany easier to meet.\n  Just listen to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group on this matter:\n\n       America's military capacity is stretched thin; we do not \n     have the troops or equipment to make a substantial sustained \n     increase in our troops presence.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group goes on to say:\n\n       Increased deployments to Iraq would also necessarily hamper \n     our ability to provide adequate resources for our efforts in \n     Afghanistan or respond to crises around the world.\n\n  So says the Iraq Study Group.\n  For all these reasons, I am proud to stand here today in support of a \nbipartisan effort to send the President a message that the troop \nescalation in Iraq is the wrong choice for our Nation. Instead, our \nIraq strategy should emphasize a new direction, encouraging Iraqi \nleaders to make political compromises that will foster reconciliation \nand strengthen the unity of the Government, laying the groundwork for \nan improved security situation, and redeploying our military forces in \nIraq so they can focus on maintaining that nation's territorial \nintegrity. We also must deny al-Qaida and other terrorists a safe \nhaven, conduct counterterrorism operations, promote regional stability, \nand, most important, train and equip Iraqi forces to take the lead in \nsecurity and combat operations. The President's escalation strategy of \nthrowing more U.S. troops into Iraq's burgeoning civil war undercuts \nand detracts from each of these objectives: A campaign of escalation is \nincompatible with securing a new and better direction in Iraq. For \nthose who argue that supporting this resolution only offers criticism \nbut does not offer specific alternatives, I urge you to listen to what \nI and others have said in these days and what we will say in the next \ncouple of days especially.\n\n  We have heard from the opponents about what this all means. I will \nnot go into their opinions today. But I will say this: Every Member of \nthis Chamber in both parties honors our troops, no matter which way we \nstand on escalation. We honor their sacrifices--the sacrifices they and \ntheir families make on a daily basis. But we must examine--we have an \nobligation to examine our national policies which we are asked to carry \nout and to be supportive of or in opposition to. If we disagree with \nthe broad strategic direction in which the President is taking our \nNation, it is our duty to speak out. To remain silent or passive in the \nface of an approach we believe is misguided and not in the national \ninterests is an abdication of the responsibilities of our offices.\n  Our military forces and their loved ones have paid a heavy price for \nthis mission in Iraq. As I have noted before, at least 150 \nPennsylvanians have given their lives, with hundreds more suffering \nfrom serious and lifelong injuries. PFC Ross A. McGinnis of Knox, PA, \nwas one of those killed in action. He was 19 years old. He died of \ninjuries on December 4, 2006, after a grenade was thrown into his \nvehicle in Baghdad. Private McGinnis has been nominated by his \ncommanders for the Medal of Honor. He was manning the gunner's hatch \nwhen a grenade was thrown into his humvee. He could have jumped out to \nsave himself, but he threw himself on the grenade to save the lives of \nhis crew members. We must always remember this debate we must have must \nnot have a focus on abstract policy matters. This has real implications \nfor our men and women in the Armed Forces. We cannot forget the lessons \nand the life of Private McGinnis or any of the more than 3,000 \nAmericans who have died during this conflict. Our troops are deserving \nof our support and the support of all the American people.\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n  Mr. President, I conclude with this: A troop increase will only \nendanger more young Americans in Iraq without any clear hope of \nsuccess. For that reason, I support honest and open debate on the \nmerits of the President's plan and an opportunity for the Senate to \ndeclare its views. I will vote to allow this important debate to \nproceed, and I will vote in favor of S. 574.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I must say I am disappointed the \nDemocratic leadership continues to preclude the Senate from debating \nand amending the insufficient resolution sent over from the House of \nRepresentatives. This denies the Senate from robustly debating other \nalternatives, including the bipartisan Warner resolution.\n  The strategy is to avoid controversial procedures that split the \nDemocratic caucus regarding cutting off funding for the troops and \ncapping the deployment of troops in Iraq. We have the same kind of \nsplit to a degree in the Republican caucus. The Warner resolution \nrepresents a negotiated agreement that reflects a bipartisan approach \nto the war and deserves to be debated and voted upon.\n  This is the second piece of legislation this week that Democratic \nleaders have brought to the Senate floor straight from the House with \nno amendments for debate allowed, and I think this is setting a \ndangerous precedent and frustrates the role the Constitution envisions \nfor the Senate.\n  I will continue to back the minority's right to bring up amendments \nand participate in real debate, even if I don't agree with those ideas. \nI tried to support that when we were in the majority. The American \npeople want Congress to play a role in the way this war is being \nhandled. The first step is to demand a better plan, and we owe the \npeople more than 10 lines in the House Resolution. You can't even begin \nto address a real solution to a complex situation in 10 lines.\n  I wish to emphasize to my colleagues that there are 15 cosponsors of \nthe Warner resolution, 6 of whom are Republicans and 9 are Democrats. \nThe resolution has the support of the Democratic chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Joseph Biden, who has been here for many \nyears--a very wise individual. It has the support of the Democratic \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin. It also has the \nsupport of the No. 2 ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Chuck Hagel. I mention this because I wish to stress \nthat the Warner resolution is believed to be a fair and reasonable \nresolution that is broadly supported by both Republicans and Democrats. \nI believe, if given the opportunity, that resolution will attract over \n60 votes of the Senate.\n  That is why tonight I wish to share some of my thoughts about our \ncurrent situation in Iraq. I wish to stress that had we received \nbetter, more comprehensive prewar intelligence and done our homework \nabout what would be needed after the military offensive, we could have \nentered Iraq adequately prepared to win the war and secure the peace. \nWe would have been more adequately prepared. Both the administration \nand Congress should have recognized that by removing Saddam Hussein \nfrom office, we would shift the balance of power within the country \nfrom Sunni to Shiite and change the contour of the region. Our \nintelligence errors, our lack of troop preparation, and the bungling of \nthe initial efforts on the ground, specifically disbanding the Army and \nisolating former Baathists--in spite of advice from people such as GEN \nJake Garner and others--is unacceptable. And today, we are paying the \nprice for that, which means all of us have to pay a lot more attention \nto every decision and plan we endorse from here on out.\n  I cannot support the proposed troop surge. In spite of meetings at \nthe White House, two with the President, private-session briefings as a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, and a meeting with General \nPetraeus for over 40 minutes, I am not convinced the additional troops \nwho are proposed is the best means toward success in Baghdad. That is \nwhy I have decided to support the Warner resolution.\n\n  A military solution is not sufficient to win the peace in Iraq. As I \nwill get into it, Iraq faces political problems, a power struggle, and \nprimal hate between the fighting sects. More troops alone cannot solve \nthese problems. That being said, I continue to have the highest praise \nfor the generals and, more importantly, for their troops who have \nremained steadfast in their efforts to secure Iraq. I am grateful to \nthose who have served and continue to serve our Nation in a time of \nneed. I am especially indebted to those who made the ultimate sacrifice \nand whose families have suffered and who will grieve and those whose \nlives have been changed forever, as well as some 25,000 men and women \nwho have been wounded over there, 13,000 of them not able to go back \ninto the service.\n  Winning this war, securing peace in Iraq and stability in the region \nrequires a comprehensive approach and the use of different tools, the \nmost important of which is the will of the Iraqis. At this point, I am \nafraid we have focused disproportionately on the military component of \nthis war, and we have not adequately stressed the nonmilitary arm of \nour strategy.\n  Moving forward in Iraq, we must focus on strengthening our \nnonmilitary or political tactics. That is why now, more than ever \nbefore, I am concerned about Iraq's willingness to bring an end to the \nviolence. As the Warner resolution states:\n\n       The responsibility for Iraq's internal security in halting \n     sectarian violence must rest primarily with the government of \n     Iraq and Iraq security forces.\n\n  I recently met with a young man from Ohio out of Bethesda who had \ncompleted three tours of duty in Iraq and who was wounded by an IED. I \nasked him what he did. He said: My main goal, Senator, every day was to \nkeep my men alive and keep peace in the neighborhood.\n  We have to ask ourselves: How long can we continue to do this? Even \nif the surge is successful, how long will we have to stay before the \nIraqis can handle the situation themselves? Even when I talked with \nGeneral Petraeus, he did a good job in Mosul--they secured the \nneighborhoods--but when the Iraqis came in and they left, they lost it. \nHow many American lives will be lost in what is best described as a \ncivil war between Sunni and Shiite that has 1,400 years of Sunni \ndomination over Shiite at its root? More of our Members of the Senate \nshould read about the history of Iraq and the people who are there.\n  After many closed-session briefings with the National Security \nCouncil, four meetings at the White House, including two with the \nPresident, and as I mentioned, 40 minutes with General Petraeus, and \nafter hearing hours of witnesses testifying before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I can feel confident saying it is time for the \nIraqi people and their leadership to stand up to the sectarian violence \nbetween Sunni and Shiite. They need to recognize that all Iraqis and \nthe future of the Nation of Iraq is threatened by this constant \nbloodshed, and their future is in their hands, not our hands.\n  U.S. Central Commander GEN John Abizaid, who the President relied \nupon to lead the ground campaign in Iraq, testified to Congress on \nNovember 15:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     Corps commander and General Dempsey. We all talked together. \n     And I said, ``In your professional opinion, if we were to \n     bring in more American troops now, does it add considerably \n     to our ability to achieve success in Iraq?'' They all said \n     no. The reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It \n     is easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  That is General Abizaid. If we don't follow the advice of our \ngenerals and other military people I have talked to, we run the risk of \nhelping one side at the expense of another, and the Sunnis could \ninterpret our offensive as part of a larger effort to do the dirty work \nof the Shiite. And don't you think the Sunnis would not spin it that \nway.\n  The reality we face today is that an overwhelming majority of the \nMuslim population in Iraq, be they Shiite or Sunni, look upon us as \ninfidels and occupiers. They do. And our presence there is exploited \nevery day by our enemies. In fact, one poll claimed 60 percent of the \npeople in Iraq said it is OK to kill Americans. While we cannot even \nbegin to capture what is happening in the hearts and minds of the \nIraqis with one poll, it sends a striking\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nmessage about what additional troops might face there.\n  We have to consider the reliable information we have that suggests \nthe surge could ignite an even more aggressive countersurge, in which \nevery martyr--every martyr--in the country is drawn to Baghdad to \ndefeat the infidels, as the Sunnis were drawn to Mecca on Ramadan. We \ncould see a terrible situation there, and I don't want--I wish to make \nclear I am not analogizing the Sunnis going to Mecca on Ramadan. I am \nsaying it would bring lots of people into Baghdad.\n  The fact of the matter is we cannot stop the sectarian violence with \ncombat brigades and more forces alone. Implementing martial law in Iraq \nwould be impossible because of the sheer number of Iraqi citizens and \nour commitments elsewhere around the globe. At this point, we wouldn't \nbegin to have enough forces.\n  Mr. President, the only way to bring stability to Iraq is by \naddressing a number of serious political problems that lie at the root \nof this violence. Before the war, Iraq was united by Saddam's reign of \nterror, as Slobadan Milosevic kept everybody under his control or, \nbefore him, Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia. When he was removed from \noffice, the major power struggle ensued, and it is not surprising. In \nfact, it should have been expected. In fact, as we later found out, \nmany academics and intelligence officers did predict this. In the \naftermath of Saddam's regime, many different sects and local leaders \nrealized a power shift was taking place, and they wanted to come out on \ntop. They knew the greatest source of potential power is in oil. That \nis why the critical component of the political solution must be to \nreach a decision on how the oil can be distributed to all sects and \ncommunities in Iraq. It is absolutely critical that Prime Minister \nMaliki moves quickly--tomorrow--to pass the legislation that guarantees \nthat all Iraqis will benefit from oil. If he can do this, it will show \nthe sects how the power in Iraq will be dispersed in the future.\n\n  Recently, I met with the Foreign Minister, Deputy Prime Minister of \nTurkey. The Foreign Minister agreed that the oil situation is the most \nimportant issue today and the one that will have profound impact on the \nlong-term stability of Iraq. This must be a component of the overall \nnational reconciliation plan to unite Iraqis and give them confidence \nin their Government.\n  A second key political priority must be the reintegration of the \nSunni Baathists into society. When we went into Iraq, we cut the \nBaathists out of the military and security forces. The result of the \npolicy was they had nowhere to go. They were frightened about their \nfutures. They could not feed their families. They were angry. They were \nresentful. So they went to the streets. Before long, they became part \nof the problem, joining with militias and other fighters to resist the \nShia government. So a major political priority must be to develop a \nplan to reintegrate the former Baathists and it needs to happen now. It \nis essential that the Iraqi Government work toward provincial elections \nso there is more equal representation of the different sects.\n  The third vital component of our nonmilitary strategy must be greater \nregional diplomacy. We must work to encourage Iraq's neighbors to get \ninvolved in containing the violence. Specifically, these neighboring \ncountries have the ability to put pressure on the different sects and \nlocal leaders to help unite the Iraqi Government. They have the ability \nto pass debt relief, participate in border control, and help avoid a \npotential refugee problem. I don't think people realize that there have \nbeen over 3.5 million refugees who have come out of Iraq.\n  In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group issued their \nrecommendations for a successful United States strategy in Iraq. A core \ncomponent of their proposal was that the United States act immediately \nto undertake a ``diplomatic offensive'' consisting of ``new and \nenhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region.'' The \nrecommendation called on the administration to engage the international \ncommunity, the Arab League, traditional United States allies in the \nMiddle East, and all Iraq's bordering neighbors in order to address \nregional conflicts and jointly bring stability to Iraq. They advised \nthe administration to work quickly to convene a regional conference--it \nhas not happened--which would complement the Iraq Compact undertaken by \nthe United Nations. We need to embrace the study group's \nrecommendations on this issue and act now to increase diplomatic \nengagement with the international community.\n  Without a broad political strategy, our military objectives, no \nmatter what the tactic, will be pursued in vain. These political \nelements must be the focus of our plan in Iraq. And that said, I agree \nthere is a military component here, as well. I want to be very clear \nthat I do not support a military withdrawal from Iraq nor do I support \ndisengagement from the Middle East.\n  As we debate this issue, we must consider our broader national \nsecurity interests in the Middle East. We are only focusing on Iraq. We \nhave to start thinking about the whole greater Middle East area. \nDespite one's views about the current situation in Iraq, it is in our \ncountry's vital security interest to pursue a strategy of diplomacy and \nmilitary action in the region. To put it simply, the stakes are too \nhigh for us to sit on the sidelines. We must remain active players in \nthe Middle East to maintain regional stability, to protect vital energy \nsupplies, and to guarantee peace and security at home.\n  We have had long-standing economic and military interests in the \nMiddle East and we were involved in the region long before we decided \nto challenge Saddam Hussein for his defiance of the U.N. Security \nCouncil. But today, with conflicts brewing in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian territories, it is even more \ncritical we remain steadfast in our commitment. Despite what one might \nbelieve about the President's strategy in Iraq, we cannot confuse \ndebate over tactics with the nonnegotiable need to remain engaged in \nthe Middle East.\n  Currently, the greatest threat to the stability in the Middle East is \nthe possibility of failure in Iraq which threatens to destabilize the \nregion and poses a critical national security risk to the United \nStates. A premature withdrawal from Iraq will signify in essence that \nwe are abandoning the region in its entirety. Our departure could \ngreatly damage, if not sever, relationships with key allies, resulting \nin dire political and social consequences throughout the world.\n\n  The long-term security interests of the United States will be best \nserved by a peaceful Iraq that can sustain, govern, and defend itself. \nThat is why we must figure a way forward and why we cannot withdraw \nfrom Iraq.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate which was just released \nunderscores the danger of withdrawal, stating succinctly:\n\n       If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term \n     of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would \n     lead to significant increase in the scale and scope of \n     sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the \n     Iraq government, and have adverse consequences for national \n     reconciliation.\n\n  They conclude that the immediate withdrawal of United States troops \nlikely would lead the Iraq security forces to unravel, encourage \nneighboring countries to engage openly in the conflict, and lead to \nmassive civilian casualties and population displacement. It is also \nvery likely, were the United States to pull out of Iraq prematurely, \nal-Qaida would use Iraq as a training ground to plan future attacks, \nand this escalation of violence could ultimately prompt Turkey to \nlaunch a military incursion of its own. These are outcomes we cannot \nafford to risk.\n  I will refer to a few of the experts whom I have met or who have \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in recent \nweeks.\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger testified that ``withdrawal \nis not an option'' and continued that:\n\n       An abrupt American departure would greatly complicate \n     efforts to stem the terrorist tide far beyond Iraq: Fragile \n     governments from Lebanon to the Persian Gulf would be tempted \n     into preemptive concessions. It might drive the sectarian \n     conflict in Iraq to genocidal dimensions, beyond levels that \n     impelled U.S. interventions in the Balkans.\n\n  Think of that. It might drive sectarian conflict in Iraq to genocidal \ndimensions beyond levels that impelled United States intervention in \nthe Balkans.\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\n  The new Ambassador from Jordan sat next to me at the prayer \nbreakfast, and we started talking about Iraq and the Middle East. He \ntold me that if you do not handle this right, we could see a schism \nbetween the Sunni and Shiite that extends from Malaysia to Indonesia.\n  Another reason I back the Warner resolution is it does not in any way \nthreaten to reduce or jeopardize critical funding for United States \ntroops serving in Iraq. In fact, the resolution states explicitly:\n\n       Congress should not take any action that will endanger the \n     United States military forces in the field, including the \n     elimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field, as \n     such an action with respect to funding will undermine their \n     safety or their effectiveness in pursuing their assigned \n     missions.\n\n  A decision to cut funding would be a serious, irreversible mistake.\n  Last month, this Senate confirmed General Petraeus as the commanding \ngeneral of the multinational force in Iraq without a dissenting vote. \nHe is carrying out the orders of the President. It is critical that \nGeneral Petraeus get the resources and equipment he believes are \nnecessary to complete the mission and keep his forces safe in the \nfield. I spoke to General Petraeus and I told him to make sure to ask \nfor what he needs to be successful. He is concerned about receiving the \nequipment and other nonmilitary resources he will need to be \nsuccessful, such as contributions of the State Department and other \nagencies. We cannot send our forces into the field without the \nnecessary equipment. We did this at the beginning of the war. Our \nsoldiers were underequipped. It was despicable. It cannot happen again. \nWe have the resources in this country to ensure that our men and women \nhave everything they need in combat.\n  We also must provide the funding to reset the equipment when it comes \nhome and to keep the Armed Forces from breaking under the strain of the \nwar. We must ensure that soldiers have the proper training before they \nleave and we must fund the mobilization centers and other military \nfacilities at home so we can undergo the necessary training.\n  In my State of Ohio, I met this week with the head of the Ohio \nNational Guard who is now being told he is going to have to train the \ntroops in Ohio because they do not want to send them someplace else \nbecause they want them trained fast so they can get them to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The fact is, he said:\n\n       I don't have the additional funds or equipment to do this.\n\n  We have lost 150 Ohioans, 150 in Iraq. In terms of the States, we are \nprobably two or three in the United States in the number of members \nlost. We lost two because humvees rolled over and they were not trained \nto drive those humvees. Now they are much heavier than they were \nbefore.\n  The Warner resolution makes it clear that we must guarantee the \ntroops what they need when they need it. And the Gregg amendment \nunderscores the point further. The best exit strategy for United States \ntroops is a multifaceted and comprehensive strategy focused on creating \nan Iraq for the Iraqis. We must focus on training the Iraqi security \nforces so the Iraqis can defend and protect themselves. The Iraqi \npeople must understand they will be given the full responsibility of \ndefending and rebuilding their country. We must remove any ambiguity in \nthe minds of Iraqis about our intention and desire to lead and make it \nclear we do not want to be there. In fact, they need to understand we \nwant to bring our troops home and we want to help them develop the \npolitical and military tools necessary to carry on this mission without \nus.\n  Bringing stability to Iraq will require our best minds, our \nresources, and our bipartisan cooperation. We need a massive \nimprovement in interagency coordination, better communication, better \nreporting to Congress, and the help of our allies and friends \nthroughout the region.\n  This is my responsibility as a Member of Congress, to exercise \noversight and to contribute to our national security. That is why I \nsupport the bipartisan Warner resolution. Again, I am confident that \ngiven the opportunity, over 60 Members of this Senate will support it.\n  Last but not least, all of us who represent the people of this \ncountry should get down on our knees and ask the Holy Spirit to \nenlighten the President and us in our decisionmaking because the impact \nof Iraq will not only affect Iraq, the Middle East, and world peace, \nbut it will impact dramatically the national security of the United \nStates of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, from the gravity of the terms \nwith which the senior Senator from Ohio has spoken, I know the Senator \nspeaks from his heart. This Senator certainly concurs it is of the \nutmost importance of the interests of the United States that we are \nsuccessful in Iraq because of the threat to the security interests to \nour country in that region of the world.\n  If someone will look at a map, we have the Persian Gulf, and on the \neastern portion of the Persian Gulf is the Strait of Hormuz, which is \nonly 19 miles wide, through which most of the super oil tankers of the \nworld have to flow out of the Persian Gulf, or if you are from an Arab \ncountry, the Arabian Gulf into the great oceans of the world to an oil-\nthirsty world. That is clearly one interest.\n  Another interest is clearly the fact that Iran wants to build a \nnuclear weapon. What an enormously destabilizing situation that would \nbe to put in a rogue nation's hands that is not unaccustomed to \npeddling things to itchy fingers that like to exact mischief on the \nrest of the world. You put a nuclear weapon in those itchy fingers, and \nwe have a whole new kind of threat to the stability of the civilized \nworld.\n\n  But there are other reasons--the reasons of countries that have been \nin enormous strife, countries that have been very favorable to the \nUnited States, as the country of Jordan and all of the internal turmoil \nthey have. I could go on and on, but there are so many reasons why it \nis very necessary that the United States have success in that part of \nthe world.\n  But what we are coming down to is a momentous decision tomorrow, at \n1:45 p.m., on whether we are going to continue a policy of this \nadministration of stay-the-course or whether we are going to change \nthat course. This Senator believes we should change that course and \nthat the President's decision to put additional troops into Baghdad is \nnot changing the course, it is more of the course. It is putting more \nAmerican lives into a sectarian violence caldron where the temperature \nis so high that we see the reports every day of more and more killings.\n  Now, this violence did not just start. This violence started 1,327 \nyears ago, when, after the death of Mohammed, the prophet, there was a \npower play, and his grandson was eliminated as one of the natural heirs \nto the Prophet Mohammed, and the power was controlled within the \nclerics who had succeeded Mohammed. It was in that grandson's clan that \nthey then started a resistance born out of revenge, and that then \nstarted the separation of the Shiites from what are today the Sunnis. \nAnd that has happened for 1,327 years. In the midst of that full-scale \ncivil warfare, this Senator does not believe it is in the interest of \nour country to put in an additional 17,500 American lives. This Senator \nbelieves we ought to force the Iraqis to stop killing each other and to \nstart working out their differences.\n  Now, at the same time, as recommended by the Iraq study commission, \nit is clearly important that we have a vigorous international \ndiplomatic initiative to engage all the countries in the region to help \nbear upon Iraq and that sectarian warfare to get them to try to come to \ntheir senses, to try to start striking peace instead of warfare, \nbecause all of the countries in the region clearly understand that is \nin their interest. You take a country such as Saudi Arabia. One of the \nworst things in the world would be if Iraq was just completely \nenveloped in chaos; the same with Jordan--two of our friends in the \nregion.\n  It is in the interests of the United States to conduct this \ndiplomatic initiative in a way that it has not been done in the last 4 \nyears: engaging people whom we have refused to engage, listening and \nlearning in the process, instead of always imposing or giving the \nperception of imposing ourselves on\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\neverybody else, and at the same time letting the forces that are there \nstabilize instead of putting more American lives at risk.\n  So we come to a momentous decision that will come tomorrow afternoon: \nDo we keep the same course or do we start changing the course with new \nand fresh ideas, with ideas that have clearly been laid out in the Iraq \nstudy commission? It is the conclusion of this Senator that we ought to \nsend a very strong message to the White House that the time for \nchanging the stay-the-course policy is now.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Dan Shapiro\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make note, in the presence of my longtime, \nvery faithful staff member, Dan Shapiro, who has served me so ably for \nover 6 years as legislative director, that the needs of providing for \nhis little family have called upon him to leave the public sector, \nwhere he has been engaged for years, to enter into the private sector. \nI want to say on behalf of the people of Florida and the people of the \nNelson office that we are grateful for his public service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of thousands of Rhode \nIslanders who have talked with me about the need for a new direction in \nIraq and the need to bring our troops home.\n  I speak on behalf of the veterans' families who traveled here to \nWashington to speak to me about their memories of war and the need for \nthis one to end.\n  I speak on behalf of the brave men and women serving in Iraq who have \nsacrificed so much and whose families anxiously await their return.\n  I speak on behalf of mothers I met who felt they had to buy body \narmor for their sons and daughters headed for Iraq because they could \nnot trust this administration to provide what was needed.\n  The Senate may have been muzzled in recent days, but Rhode Islanders \ncertainly have not been. More than 2,000 of them have reached out to my \noffice in frustration, in anger, and in concern--and in the hope that \nthis new Democratic Senate will listen to them and hear them, as this \nadministration will not.\n  I want to share some of what they have written me:\n\n       I was at Michael Weidemann's funeral.\n\n  Mr. President, Michael was a 23-year-old Army sergeant from Newport, \nkilled in an IED blast in Anbar Province last November.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       Please, if nothing else, take care of things, so that we do \n     not have to go through what we went through at that funeral. \n     Michael and my son . . . were in the JROTC together. . . . He \n     is on his second tour of Iraq. Please, don't make yesterday a \n     dress rehearsal for me. I want my son to come home, safely.\n\n  From Johnston, Rhode Island:\n\n       My son . . . is presently serving in Iraq and on his second \n     tour of duty there. . . . The President's plan ignores the \n     American people who voted for change in November, and who \n     continue to demand we bring our troops home. . . . The \n     people made their voice heard, and if the President isn't \n     going to listen, the Democratic Congress will. The \n     President's policies have failed!\n\n  From Portsmouth, Rhode Island:\n\n       President Bush has ignored the advice of experience, lied \n     to us all, lacked any plan and seems to be expecting his \n     successor to solve the problems. It is our only hope that \n     you, as a member of Congress, can work toward bringing our \n     troops home soon.\n\n  From Kingston:\n\n       I am appalled at the loss of life--today it was reported 20 \n     more service people were killed. The Kurds are deserting \n     rather than fight in Baghdad. . . . We are not just losing \n     people, we are losing big money. We have seven grandchildren. \n     What kind of debt are we placing on those future generations?\n\n  From Warwick:\n\n       We never should have begun this war, let's now have the \n     sense to end it, not prolong it. Please do whatever you can \n     to stop the president's initiative to increase our military \n     presence in Iraq. . . . , to spend even more money waging a \n     war that your constituents have indicated they no longer \n     support.\n\n  From North Kingstown:\n\n       We are looking to you to do whatever is in your power to \n     stop the U.S. escalation of troops in Iraq. I and many in our \n     nation feel this will only make a bad situation worse, widen \n     what is essentially a civil war and lead to further \n     casualties and costs without contributing towards a political \n     solution. . . . We are counting on you and your colleagues on \n     both sides of the aisle to stand up and be counted and forge \n     a bipartisan solution to end this war.\n\n  And finally, a woman from Cumberland forwarded me a message she sent \nto President Bush:\n\n       My nephew . . . is in the 82nd Airborne serving our country \n     in Iraq. He is the bravest person I have ever known, along \n     with all the other men and women serving this country. I am \n     proud to be an American! Please, please, on behalf of my \n     family and the families of all U.S. troops--bring them home \n     now!\n\n  Mr. President, these voices will not be unfamiliar to anyone in this \nbody. In every State, we have heard similar voices. You have heard them \nin Colorado, Mr. President. My friend, Senator Sanders, has heard them \nin Vermont. People all across America are speaking to all of us, and it \nis time for us to listen and to show that we have heard and to start to \nbring our soldiers home.\n  The President has not heard these voices. He wants to send tens of \nthousands more troops to Iraq. He calls this a surge. We consider it a \ngrave mistake.\n  Tomorrow, our vote can stop the parliamentary maneuvers that have \nstalled us, and this great deliberative body can begin to debate the \nmost pressing question of this day.\n  Let's talk for a moment about that question. The other side wishes to \ndebate every question, any question--any question but the escalation by \nthis President of our troops in Iraq by over 21,000 men and women. But \nthis question we want to debate is not a question selected by Democrats \nfor political reasons. It is possible here to choose self-serving \nquestions and to force a debate on those questions just to make a \npolitical point. But we have not done that.\n  This question, whether to escalate the war in Iraq, is not an \ninvention of the Democratic Party. It is not an invention of the \nSenate. It is President Bush, who proposed to send tens of thousands \nmore troops into harm's way and to escalate this conflict, who has \npresented this question. This question is what was presented to us by \nPresident George W. Bush, and by him alone, and it is the pressing \nquestion of today.\n  For weeks, we on this side of the aisle have emphasized and \nreemphasized our strong commitment to having a real debate--a debate to \na vote--to telling the American people where we stand and to casting \nour votes on the precise question the President of the United States \nhas presented to America. But we have been impeded, obstructed, \nmaneuvered away from this critical question.\n  The other side argues that to dispute this President's judgment is to \nfail to support the troops--even though that judgment has failed the \ntroops and has failed our country and has left us with few good \noptions.\n  But that is a false choice, Mr. President. And this hour demands \nbetter of this institution.\n  There are ways to accomplish the change America demands, and that \nreason and good conscience dictate. For instance, I believe that rather \nthan send a single additional American soldier into the sands and \nmarshes of Iraq, this President can announce clearly and unequivocally \nthat our troops will be redeployed from Iraq and will soon come home.\n  The most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is \nthe prospect of our redeployment out of Iraq. Let me repeat that. The \nmost powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is the \nprospect of redeployment out of Iraq. Using this power wisely, deftly, \nand thoughtfully would accomplish three critical objectives that, as I \nhave said, would make great strides toward security in Iraq and \nstability in the region.\n  First, a clear statement of our intent to redeploy our troops from \nIraq would eliminate the sense there that we are an Army of occupation. \nThis in turn would quiet the nationalist sentiment of the Iraqi people, \nnow aroused against us. Many Iraqis are now so opposed to our presence \nthey think killing American soldiers is acceptable.\n  Second, without America's intervening presence, the world community \nwould have to face directly the consequences of the situation in Iraq. \nThe prospect of our departure would compel the world to take a more \nactive role to work together with America to bring peace and stability \nto the region. We\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\ncannot continue as we are now, in every meaningful way completely \nalone.\n  Third, Iraq's neighbors will be obliged to assume greater \nresponsibility for averting the risk of a Sunni-Shiite conflict \nigniting in Iraq and spreading beyond Iraq's borders. Without us in \nIraq as a police force for a civil war, neighboring nations will have \nan enlivened incentive to avert a wider war.\n  Finally, the Bush administration's preoccupation with Iraq leaves us \nweakened in our capability to address other obligations around the \nworld, from the changing situation in North Korea, to the ongoing \nbattle for Afghanistan, to the serious threat posed by Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, these are serious matters, and they deserve the \nserious and sustained attention of the Senate. I hope tomorrow's vote \nwill allow us to bring this question that attention.\n  Mr. President, I will support that vote tomorrow. I ask other \nSenators, who hear our fellow Americans' genuine and sincere concern \nabout our national interest, will do the same.\n  I will support not only the resolution disapproving of the \nPresident's escalation plan and supporting our troops, but also other, \nstronger measures that will follow, and that will continue to put \npressure on this administration to finally bring our troops home.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2158-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2158-S2161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, before I begin discussing the war in \nIraq, I wish to say a few words about another issue that is perhaps \neven more important and that is the constitutional issues at the very \nheart of this entire debate.\n  Let me be very frank: I am not a great fan of the Bush \nadministration. And of the many grave concerns I have about President \nBush and his actions, at the top of that list is that the President \nseems not to understand what the Constitution of the United States is \nall about. Whether it is the consistent attack on our constitutional \nrights which his administration has pursued for a number of years or \nhis ``signing statements'' which attempt to circumvent legislation \npassed by Congress, the President appears to believe he can do whatever \nhe wants, whenever he wants to. That, in my view, is not what the \nUnited States of America is all about, and it is not what our \nConstitution provides for.\n  In that regard, I wish to inform my colleagues in the Senate that I \nhave submitted a resolution, similar to one introduced by Congressman \nDeFazio in the House, that makes it very clear the President does not \nhave the constitutional authority to start a war against Iran without \nthe express authority of the Congress. There are many people in my \nState of Vermont--and there are people all over this country--who are \ndeeply worried that the President may take us into a war in Iran and \nthat he is currently laying the groundwork for that war in exactly the \nsame way he led us into the war in Iraq.\n  So let me be very clear: If President Bush were to start a war in \nIran without receiving the authority to do so from Congress, he would \nnot only be creating, in my view, an international disaster, he would \nalso be creating a major constitutional crisis. I hope very much he \ndoes not do that.\n  President Bush fails to understand the power to declare war under the \nConstitution is given to the Congress, not the President. My \nresolution, S. Con. Res. 13, is very simple. It states clearly that it \nis ``the sense of Congress that the President should not initiate \nmilitary action against Iran without first obtaining authorization from \nCongress.'' I hope my colleagues will give strong support to this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Vermont and all across this Nation, the \nAmerican people are increasingly concerned about the war in Iraq. As \nothers have stated more eloquently than I, the American people want \nreal debate in Washington, in the Senate, on this issue that is \nworrying people all across our Nation. More importantly, not only do \nthey want debate, they want action, and they want action now.\n  Frankly, I have a hard time understanding why some of my colleagues \nwould try, through parliamentary maneuvers, to prevent a vote on what \nis at best a very modest proposal. This issue is not complicated in \nterms of what will be taking place tomorrow on this floor. It seems to \nme that if you support President Bush's escalation of the war in Iraq--\nand there are many who do--then vote against the resolution. That is \nyour right. On the other hand, if you don't believe that an escalation \nof this war is a sensible idea--and I certainly do not--then vote for \nthe Reid resolution. But at the very least, there should be a vote. Let \nthe American people know how we stand.\n  Let me be clear in giving you my perspective on this war: In my view, \nPresident Bush's war in Iraq has been a disaster. It is a war we were \nmisled into and a war many of us believe we never should have gotten \ninto in the first place, a war I voted against as a Member of the \nHouse. This is a war the administration was unprepared to fight. The \nadministration has shown little understanding of the enemy or the \nhistorical context in which we found ourselves.\n  Who will ever forget President Bush declaring ``mission \naccomplished'' aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln when, in \nfact, the mission had barely begun. Who will forget Vice President \nCheney telling us that the insurgency was ``in its last throes'' just \nbefore some of the bloodiest months of the war. Who will forget those \nBush advisors who predicted the war would be a cakewalk, nothing to \nworry about, and that we would be greeted in Iraq as liberators.\n\n  This war in Iraq has come at a very high price in so many ways. This \nis a war that has cost us terribly in American blood. As of today, we \nhave lost over 3,100 brave American soldiers. In my own small State of \nVermont, we have lost 25. Twenty-three thousand more Americans have \nbeen wounded, and tens of thousands will be coming home with \nposttraumatic stress disorder which will impact their lives forever. \nThis is a war which, with the President's proposed increase in funding, \nwill cost us some $500 billion, with the price tag going up by $8 \nbillion every month. This cost is going to add to the huge national \ndebt we are leaving to our children and our grandchildren and it is \ngoing to make it that much more difficult for us to fund health care, \neducation, environmental protection, affordable housing, childcare, and \nthe pressing needs of the middle class and working families of our \ncountry which have been so long neglected. Yes, for more military \nspending; no, for the needs of ordinary Americans who are struggling so \nhard to keep their heads above water.\n  This increased expense for the war will make it that much harder for \nus to fund the needs of our veterans whose numbers are increasing as a \nresult of this war. This is a war which has caused unimaginable horror \nfor the people of Iraq. People who suffered so long under the brutality \nof the Saddam Hussein dictatorship are suffering even more today. There \nare estimates that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or \nwounded and almost 2 million have been forced to flee their own \ncountry, some 8 percent of their entire population. While civil war \ntears neighborhoods apart, children are without schools, people are \nwithout electricity, health care, and other basic necessities of life. \nThe doctors and nurses, teachers and administrators who have provided \nthe professional infrastructure for the people of Iraq are now long \ngone.\n  This is a war which has lowered our standing in the international \ncommunity to an all-time low in our lifetimes, with leaders in \ndemocratic countries hesitant to work with us because of the lack of \nrespect their citizens have for our President. Long-time friends and \nallies are simply wondering: What is going on in the United States of \nAmerica, that great country? This is a war which has stretched both our \nActive-Duty military to the breaking point as well as our National \nGuard and Reserve forces.\n  Morale in the military is low, and this war will have a lasting \nimpact on the future recruitment, retention, and readiness of our \nNation's Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\n  This is a war which has, in many respects, lowered our capability to \neffectively fight the very serious threats of international terrorism \nand Islamic extremism. Five years after the horrific attacks of 9/11, \nOsama bin Laden remains free. Using the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq \nas their rallying cry, al-Qaida's strength around the world continues \nto grow. And currently the situation in Afghanistan is becoming more \nand more difficult.\n  Tragically, this administration has refused to listen to the American \npeople who, in this last election, made it very clear they want a new \ndirection in Iraq and they want this war wound down. This \nadministration has refused to listen to the thoughtful suggestions of \nthe bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which included two former Secretaries \nof State, including President Bush's own father's Secretary of State, \nas well as a former Presidential Chief Of Staff and a former Secretary \nof Defense, that it was time for a change of direction. The President \ndidn't listen to them. This administration has refused to listen to the \nadvice of our military leaders in Iraq who told us increasing troops \nfrom the United States would make it easier for the Iraqi Government \nand military to avoid their political and military responsibilities. \nThe more troops that come in, the easier it is for the Iraqi Government \nto avoid making the political compromises and the tough choices they \nhave to make.\n  This administration has refused to listen to the Iraqi people, who, \naccording to a number of polls, tell us very strongly that they believe \nin the midst of all of the chaos and horror taking place in Iraq today, \nthe Iraqi people say they would be safer and more secure if our troops \nleft their country. In fact, this administration has tragically refused \nto listen to anybody, except that same shrinking inner circle, led by \nVice President Cheney, who has been consistently wrong from day one. \nThose are the people the President continues to listen to.\n  As most everybody understands, and as the recent National \nIntelligence Estimate has recently confirmed, the situation in Iraq \ntoday is extremely dire. The sad truth is that now there are no good \noptions before us; there are simply less bad options. In Iraq today, \naccording to Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, there are now at least \nfour separate wars being fought--four separate wars that our soldiers, \nwho have fought with incredible bravery and skill, now find themselves \nin the middle of.\n  Let me quote Secretary Gates, who has recently stated:\n  I believe there are essentially four wars going on in Iraq: One is \nShia on Shia, principally in the south; second is sectarian conflict, \nprincipally in Baghdad, but not solely; third is the insurgency; and \nfourth is al-Qaida.\n  The reality today, as described by the Secretary of Defense, has \nnothing to do with why President Bush got us into this war in the first \nplace. In March of 2002, he told us Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction and that they were poised to use them against us. That was \nnot true and certainly has no relevance to the war today. In 2002, he \ntold us Iraq was somehow linked to al-Qaida and had some responsibility \nfor the 9/11 attack against our country. That also turned out not to be \ntrue and certainly has no relevance today to the situation in which we \nfind ourselves.\n  In the 2006 elections, the American people, in a loud and \nunmistakable voice, told us they no longer had confidence in the Bush \nadministration's handling of the war in Iraq. In my view, they told us \nthey wanted Congress to begin asserting its constitutional authority \nover this war and that they wanted us to rein in this administration. \nMost importantly, they told us they wanted us to begin the process of \nbringing our troops home as soon as possible. And as a Vermont Senator, \nthat is exactly the effort I intend to make.\n  In my view, the Reid resolution before us is but a small first step \nat moving us forward. If it is passed--and I hope it will be--it must \nbe followed with much stronger legislation that has real teeth in it. \nThat is what the American people want. I have cosponsored legislation, \nintroduced by Senator Kennedy, that would prohibit the use of funds for \nan escalation of U.S. military forces without a specific, new \nauthorization from the Congress--a prohibition also included in the \nlegislation introduced by Senator Obama, whose bill I also support.\n  Instead of just voicing our disapproval of President Bush's \nescalation of the war in a nonbinding manner, we should now be \nconsidering legislation that provides for the safe and orderly \nredeployment of virtually all of our troops out of Iraq within the next \nyear, even as we continue to give support to the Iraq Government and \ntheir military for the purpose of helping them accept their political \nand military responsibilities. That is the legislation we should be \npassing.\n  Senator Feingold has introduced legislation requiring that our troops \nbe redeployed from Iraq within 6 months of passage of the bill. Senator \nObama has introduced similar legislation requiring that our troops be \nredeployed starting this May.\n  In my view, while I will vote for the Reid resolution tomorrow, and \nwhile I think it is terribly important that we bring together a \nbipartisan effort to tell the President this escalation is wrong, the \nbottom line is we must go forward well beyond that, and we must do that \nin the near future. We must exercise the constitutional responsibility \nwe have over the power of the purse.\n  We are mired in a war that has now gone on longer than any American \ninvolvement--longer than American involvement in either the First World \nWar or the Second World War. We will spend more money on this war in \nreal dollars than we spent on either the Korean war or the Vietnam war. \nOur standing in the international community has declined and our \nability to combat international terrorism has been seriously \ncompromised.\n  It is time to say no to this ill-conceived escalation. It is time to \ndeploy our troops out of harm's way. It is time to end this war and to \nbring our troops home as soon as we possibly can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I have listened \ncarefully to the remarks of the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders. I \nknow of his passion and his knowledge on the subject. That was \ndemonstrated by his words this evening. He speaks from the heart on \nmany issues. I know he spoke from his heart this evening about this war \nin Iraq. Before him, Senator Whitehouse, a new colleague from Rhode \nIsland, read letters he received from constituents asking the same \nquestions we are hearing across Illinois and across the country--\nquestions about why we are in this war and how we will start to bring \nour troops home.\n  Today, in the House of Representatives, in a historic vote, by a \nmargin of 246 to 182, the House of Representatives made it clear they \ndo not approve of President Bush's new policy to escalate this war in \nIraq.\n  I think you have to step back for a moment and reflect on what \nhappened today. Four years into a war--which Senator Sanders has \nreminded us has lasted longer than World War I or II--we are now \nengaged in the first meaningful debate about the course of that war \nsince the invasion; and 3,132 American soldiers have died, thousands \nhave been injured, billions have been spent, and for years the \nCongress, in the thrall of another party, didn't have a hearing, didn't \nhave a debate, and didn't question the policy of this war.\n  It is no surprise that the American people reached the limit of their \ntolerance and, in the last election, made it clear they want a change--\nnot just a change in Congress but a change in the policy when it came \nto this war in Iraq. I was heartened after the election, particularly \nwhen President Bush asked for the resignation of Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld. I thought that finally we were going to see a breakaway from \nthis so-called neocon theory that dragged us into this terrible \nconflict. Unfortunately, what I hoped for wasn't realized. Even though \nI think Robert Gates, the successor of Rumsfeld, is a good man and will \nbe a good Secretary of Defense, when it came time for the President to \ntalk about the policies of the war and what we would do, he dug the \nhole deeper.\n\n  I am not a military strategist and don't profess to be. There are \npeople in our caucus with military experience who can speak to a wise \nstrategy and an unwise strategy. I am not necessarily one of those, nor \ndo I profess to be. But I have been to Iraq twice--first, in the early \nstage, when we visited the Green Zone in Baghdad and it\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nwas so dangerous that we could not even stay overnight. In October, we \nwere allowed to stay the night and visit with troops in the field and \ntalk to some of the people who were working in Iraq. I will share some \nof those recollections in a moment.\n  First, let me tell you that my highest priority was to sit across the \ntable from our soldiers, to break bread with them and talk about home \nand try to take their minds away from the danger of their daily lives. \nThese men and women are the best. These are the best and bravest among \nus. They are volunteers to a person. They have enlisted in the services \nand they risk their lives every single day.\n  Unfortunately, many want to drag this debate into a referendum about \nwhether we respect, admire, and honor these troops. Any honest person \nwould tell you that you should concede the obvious: We all respect, \nadmire, and honor these troops. Many of us believe the best way to \nhonor them is to start bringing them safely home. When I think about \nwhat they have faced, and continue to face, and I think about these \nyoung men and women getting into these humvees or walking the streets \nof Baghdad and other cities, risking their lives every day, I want this \nto end and end soon.\n  What those on the other side argue is the opposite. They argue that \nthe President is right, that sending more troops into harm's way is the \nbest way to end the war. I could not disagree more. But the point of \nthat disagreement is the reason the debate is necessary. It happened in \nthe House. It should happen in the Senate.\n  Tomorrow, we will have a chance, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time, to vote \nas to whether we will have a real debate on this war in Iraq. I am not \nhopeful. We need the cooperation of Republican Senators to even debate \nthe issue. Many have already announced they are opposed to this debate; \nthey don't want it to occur. I think they are wrong. I think they are \nwalking away from our basic responsibility as Members of the Senate.\n  I think those who want an escalation of the war need to answer some \nfundamental questions. I think they should answer the question: How \nmany troops will be involved here? Will it be 21,000, as the President \nsays or, as the CBO tells us, a number much larger than 21,000, which \nrepresents combat troops; they may need an equal or larger number to \nsupport those combat troops, endangering the lives of 40,000 more \nsoldiers, not 20,000.\n  Outgoing Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker said yesterday that an \nincrease of 17,500 Army combat troops in Iraq represents, in his words, \n``only the tip of the iceberg.'' It worries me that this is the \nbeginning of a spiraling escalation, endangering even more troops.\n  Army officials have also stated that virtually all of the U.S.-based \nArmy combat brigades are not prepared to be deployed. The Army is \nscrambling to find the gear and personnel for units that are being sent \nto Iraq and Afghanistan, pulling both people and equipment out of other \nunits, scavenging for pieces of equipment that are necessary, to get \nthem ready in some fashion for battle. General Schoomaker testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee that--pay special attention \nto this--``I am not satisfied with the readiness of our nondeployed \nforces.''\n  We ask a lot of our men and women in uniform. We ask for their \ncommitment to our country. We ask them to be trained and to be brave. \nBut we should never ask them to go into battle without the equipment \nthey need in order to come home safely.\n  What this general says, the outgoing Army Chief of Staff, is that \nthat is exactly what is going to happen with this escalation. Men and \nwomen will be sent into dangerous situations without the protection \nthey need.\n  On January 25, the Department of Defense inspector general released a \nsummary report that stated that American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan \nexperienced ``shortages of force-protection equipment, such as \nuparmored vehicles, electronic countermeasure devices, crew-served \nweapons, and communications equipment.'' January 25, just a few days \nago.\n  The report went on to say:\n\n       As a result, servicemembers were not always equipped to \n     effectively complete their missions.\n\n  We have a special responsibility--those who make the policy in this \ntown and those who vote for it--to keep our promise to these soldiers \nand their families that we will give them the training and equipment \nthey need so they can perform their missions effectively.\n  The same report I referred to stated that when servicemembers were \nasked to perform tasks outside their usual duties, they often did not \nreceive the equipment necessary to perform their wartime mission.\n  These were tasks such as training Iraqi forces, one of our most \nimportant missions, or disposing of explosives, a highly dangerous \nundertaking.\n  Today's Washington Post states that approximately 40 percent of Army \nand Marine Corps equipment is now in Iraq or Afghanistan or undergoing \nrepair or maintenance.\n  It is inexcusable that 4 years and almost $400 billion into this war, \nwe should be sending our troops into action without the equipment they \nneed. Those who support the escalation and say they are supporting the \ntroops need to be asked, and answer, the basic question: How can you \nsupport a soldier if you don't give them the equipment they need to be \nsafe, perform their mission, and come home?\n  Army Deputy Chief of Staff of Force Development, LTG Stephen Speakes, \nrecently said the Army would need 1,500 up-armored trucks for the new \nforces that were being sent to Iraq. But he went on to say:\n\n       We don't have the [armor] kits, and we don't have the \n     trucks.\n\n  He said it will take the Army months, probably until the summer, to \nsupply and outfit additional trucks. In the meantime, units are sharing \nvehicles, many of which are not properly protected so that these \nsoldiers will be safe.\n  The Washington Post interviewed commanders in Iraq about the \nequipment situation. These commanders doubted that the new units would \nreceive the full complement of humvees that they need.\n  One senior Army official was quoted as saying shortfalls would be \ninevitable ``unless five brigades of uparmored humvees fall out of the \nsky.'' This official predicted some units would have to rely more \nheavily on Bradley fighting vehicles and tanks.\n  The good news is that these vehicles are very highly armored, but \nthey may not be the best vehicles for the mission.\n  Our troops are the best. Shouldn't their equipment be the best? If \nyou believe that an escalation of this war and more soldiers thrown \ninto the crossfire of the civil war is in the best interest of America, \nshouldn't those same Senators step forward and demand that these \nsoldiers be given the equipment they need?\n  These equipment shortfalls are more acute on the battlefield, of \ncourse, but they are echoed throughout our military, including the \nGuard and Reserve. I recently met with Lieutenant General Blum, Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon. He reports that National \nGuard equipment readiness levels are at 34 percent. Guard units have \nabout one-third of the equipment they need to be ready for battle. That \nis 34 percent of the equipment they need for missions at home and \nabroad. That is another direct cost of the war in Iraq.\n  I asked the general what the Pentagon's plans were to address this \nsituation. He said there was a 5-year budget plan to bring the Guard up \nto a readiness level of 60 percent, which incidentally is below the \nlevel of readiness when this war began.\n  In the world we live in, 60 percent is not good enough if it is your \nson, your daughter, your brother, your sister, your husband, or your \nwife. It will cost another $40 billion to bring the Guard up to the \nreadiness level that we really need. I think that is an investment we \nought to make.\n  That is one of the real costs of this war--to make sure our troops, \nour Guard, have the equipment they need. These issues demand our \nattention, our debate, and our vote.\n  Tomorrow, if the Republicans refuse to cross the aisle to cooperate, \nto start this debate, these questions will not be addressed as part of \nthis debate over the escalation of this war. That is not fair to these \nsoldiers. That is not fair to their families. It certainly is not fair \nto the States and the people we represent.\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n  We should have an up-or-down vote, a basic exercise of Congress's \nresponsibility. We have offered to the Republicans an opportunity to \nvote not only on the measure that passed the House today but on an \nalternative offered by Senator McCain, who is asking we increase the \ntroops who will be involved.\n  I have read many things about this war. Some of them I think are \nextremely insightful; some of them are troubling. Yesterday in the \nWashington Post, there was an article which laid out what was expected \nto happen in Iraq and never occurred.\n  When GEN Tommy Franks and his top officers got together in August \n2002 to review the invasion plan for Iraq, they reflected on what would \nlikely occur. By their estimate today, we would have 5,000 American \nsoldiers left in that theater. Instead, we have over 130,000 and a \nPresident wanting to increase that number by 20,000 or 40,000 more. It \nshows that the planning and vision of the people who scheduled this \ninvasion was seriously flawed.\n  I joined 22 others on the floor of the Senate voting against the \nauthorization for this war. I felt at the time that the American people \nhad been deceived--deceived about weapons of mass destruction that did \nnot exist, deceived about connections with al-Qaida terrorists and 9/\n11, which did not exist, deceived about nuclear weapons and mushroom \nclouds when there was no threat.\n  That deception that occurred in the fear and panic that still \nfollowed 9/11 led many of my colleagues to vote for this war. I was not \none of them. But then came the time when I was challenged, and others, \nas to whether we would vote for the money to wage the war. I stopped \nand reflected and said if my son or my daughter was in uniform, I would \nwant them to have everything they need to come home safely, even if I \nthink this policy is wrong.\n  These soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen didn't write this \npolicy. It was written in the Pentagon and the White House. They were \nsent into battle with the battle plans that were handed to them, not \nbattle plans that they wrote. They deserve a lot better. They deserve \nto come home. If they are going to war, they deserve the equipment they \nneed. They deserve leadership in the White House and in Congress that \nis sensitive to their bravery and responds with real caring for their \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2161-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2161-S2162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to come to the floor, as I \nhave done many times before, to speak on the crisis in Darfur, Sudan. I \nkeep coming because at the very least, I want to do that, to keep \nspeaking out. But this Senator, this Congress, this country, and the \nworld must all do more. None of us have done enough.\n  Last fall, U.S. Special Envoy to Darfur Andrew Natsios declared that \non January 1, 2007, the United States would launch a forceful ``plan \nB,'' as he called it, if Sudan did not accept the joint United Nations-\nAfrican Union peacekeeping mission that is desperately needed in \nDarfur. As described in the Washington Post, plan B was to include \naggressive economic measures against Sudan.\n  Today is February 16. There are only a handful of U.N. peacekeepers \nin Darfur. Still no sign of plan B, other than four U.S. Army colonels \nwho have been stationed along the Chad-Sudan border.\n  Last week, according to a student publication at Georgetown \nUniversity and other news sources, Ambassador Andrew Natsios told a \nstudent audience that genocide was no longer taking place in Darfur. He \nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       The term genocide is counter to the facts of what is really \n     occurring in Darfur.\n\n  I understand it is possible to get entangled in words and semantics \nin the definition of ``genocide,'' but I was truly surprised to read \nthis statement from Ambassador Natsios.\n  On December 10, not that long ago, the White House released a \nstatement headlined in part, ``President Bush Appalled by Genocide in \nDarfur.''\n  The President's statement continued:\n\n       Our Nation is appalled by the genocide in Darfur, which has \n     led to the spread of fighting and hostility in the Republic \n     of Chad and the Central African Republic.\n\n  Nothing that I have seen or been told convinces me that conditions in \nDarfur are significantly better today than they were on December 10 \nwhen President Bush reconfirmed the ongoing horror of genocide. I can \nonly assume the President was troubled by the Special Envoy's statement \nas well.\n  The State Department has since sought to clarify these remarks and \nstated that it remains the administration's position that the situation \nin Darfur is genocide. The State Department explained that the Special \nEnvoy was referring to the fact that death rates are lower now, but the \nconditions could escalate.\n  I would argue that they are already escalating. People continue to be \nmurdered and villages have been attacked by air. Humanitarian aid \nworkers have come under special assault recently. These brave men and \nwomen, unarmed, working for the poorest people on Earth, have been \nsubjected to beatings, rape, and arrests.\n  These concentrated attacks threaten the people of Darfur who depend \non thin relief lines for survival. If the relief workers are forced to \nwithdraw and these lines are severed, hundreds of thousands of lives \nwill be in jeopardy.\n  Recently, along with Senator Coburn, I held the first hearing of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. The focus of the \nhearing was genocide and the rule of law. Before this hearing, we noted \nthat the United States was a late signatory to the treaty on genocide. \nOne of our predecessors in the Senate, Senator William Proxmire of \nWisconsin, literally came to the floor of the Senate every day it was \nin session for years to convince the Senate to ratify this treaty. \nFinally, it happened. We focused on that treaty and the rule of law.\n  Given the ongoing crisis in Darfur and our own ineffectual attempts \nto halt the killing, I felt that should be the first topic of this new \nsubcommittee.\n  The witnesses who came before us included the Canadian general, \nformer U.N. general, and now Senator in Canada, Romeo Dallaire.\n  In 1994, General Dallaire commanded a small U.N. force in Rwanda. \nWhen the first wave of murders began, General Dallaire called for 5,000 \ntroops--5,000 troops--to halt the killing.\n  My predecessor, my mentor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, along with \nSenator Jim Jeffords from Vermont, of the opposite party, both came \ntogether and called on President Clinton to help. Sadly, the Clinton \nadministration did not. In fairness, they have acknowledged it was the \nmost serious foreign policy mistake of their years in Washington.\n  General Dallaire did not receive the reinforcements. Instead, this \ntiny force of 2,500 was reduced. His country started withdrawing their \nsoldiers from the U.N. force until there were only 450 left on the \nground. They couldn't deal with the slaughter that followed. It is \nestimated that over 800,000 people were murdered in a very short period \nof time.\n  In Darfur, the African Union has tried to stop the killing, but after \n4 years, U.N. peacekeeping forces have not even reached the level of \n450. In his statement for the subcommittee hearing on genocide, General \nDallaire said this of Darfur:\n\n       I have on occasion considered bringing a flak jacket I wore \n     during the Rwandan genocide--a jacket that was blood-soaked \n     from carrying a 12-year-old girl who had been mutilated and \n     repeatedly raped--into the [Canadian] Senate chamber and \n     throwing it in the middle of the room. Maybe this would \n     finally capture the attention of the political elite in a way \n     words fail to do. Maybe it would finally bring home the point \n     that human rights are not only for those who have the money \n     to buy and sustain [them]; they are the privilege and the \n     right of every human being.\n\n  Mr. President, we must do more in Darfur. The United States must work \nthrough the United Nations and with other countries of influence to \ncompel the Khartoum Government to accept a peacekeeping mission, and we \nmust help provide the resources to make that possible.\n  Here at home we can do more as well. I am a strong supporter of \ndivestment. I served in the House of Representatives during apartheid \nin South Africa when we tried everything in our power to stop the \nracist government. We suggested divestment. Many said it would be \nworthless; it wouldn't have an impact. But I think it was a positive\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nthing, and I am glad that we moved forward.\n  We need to do the same in Sudan today. Millions of Americans are \nunknowingly investing in companies that do business in support of the \nKhartoum Government. I know because I was one of them. I discovered \nthat fact when a reporter, who researched my publicly disclosed \ninvestments--not a massive portfolio, I might add--told me one of the \nmutual funds I owned included the stock of a company doing business in \nSudan. I immediately sold it. But that reporter's question was a \npowerful wake-up call for me.\n\n  A growing number of States, led by my home State of Illinois and \nState Senator Jacqueline Collins, a real leader on this issue, and a \ngrowing number of colleges and universities, including Northwestern \nUniversity--and I particularly salute President Henry Bienen--have \ntaken steps to address this issue of investing in Sudan. Some have \nsought to fully divest pension funds and endowments, others have \nadopted more targeted measures to restrict investments in the largest \ncompanies operating in Sudan.\n  I salute these efforts, and I plan to introduce legislation to help \nprovide Federal support for these efforts as well.\n  Our subcommittee's genocide hearing also identified a serious \nloophole in Federal antigenocide law that Congress needs to close. \nGenocide is a Federal crime, but under the law, as currently written, \nonly genocide that takes place in the United States or is committed by \na U.S. national can be punished by our courts. Federal investigators \nhave identified war criminals who were involved in the Rwandan genocide \nand the Srebrenica massacres who have found safe haven in our country. \nThese are people perpetrating genocide in other places on Earth now \nsafely ensconced in the United States. But because they are not U.S. \nnationals, because the genocide didn't occur within our borders, we \ncannot, under our current law, prosecute them.\n  The Justice Department has been unable to prosecute these \nindividuals, and we need to take another look at it. Let me give an \nexample: Salah Abdallah Gosh is the head of security of the Sudanese \ngovernment. He reportedly has played a key role in the government's \ngenocidal campaign in Darfur. In the year 2005, Mr. Gosh came to \nWashington to meet with senior administration officials. Under current \nlaw, the Justice Department could not arrest him for the crime of \ngenocide.\n  I am developing legislation that closes this loophole, giving Federal \nprosecutors the tools they need to prosecute individuals who have \ncommitted genocide that are found in the United States. No one guilty \nof genocide should ever view the United States as a safe haven.\n  This change in the law would simply bring the antigenocide statute \ninto line with a lot of other Federal laws that cover crimes committed \noutside the United States, including torture, piracy, material support \nto terrorists, terrorism financing, and the taking of hostages. \nGenocide should be subject to the same basic penalties.\n  I hope these initiatives will be bipartisan, as much of the \nCongresses work on Darfur has been. These steps I have mentioned will \nnot stop the killing in Darfur, but they will add to our arsenal of \nweapons against genocide. We should do far more to deal with these \ndangerous situations, more to prevent mass atrocities from occurring, \nmore to stop crimes against humanity once they begin, and more to help \nthose who have been victimized, punishing the perpetrators.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt once asked: ``Where do universal human rights \nbegin?'' And she answered: ``They begin in small places, close to home. \nSo close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the \nworld. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the \nneighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the \nfactory, the farm, or office where he works.''\n  I believe the means to stopping genocide in Darfur begins with each \nof us, and so does the responsibility.\n  I will close with one observation. As a student at Georgetown \nUniversity many years ago, I had an outstanding government professor \nnamed Jan Karski. Professor Karski had been involved in the Polish \nunderground during World War II. He was a brave man who risked his life \nfighting the Nazis. He learned of the Holocaust, came to the United \nStates, barely speaking English, trying to find people in Washington \nwho would listen and who could understand that hundreds of thousands of \ninnocent people were being killed. He couldn't find an audience with \nthose who could make a difference.\n  I thought about that course, and I thought about the course of \nhistory, how the Holocaust unfolded during World War II and at least 6 \nmillion died, maybe many more, and nothing happened. And I wondered, \ndespite all that time and all that notice, why couldn't they do \nsomething?\n  Now I know.\n  It has been 4 years since we declared a genocide in Darfur. People \ncontinue to be murdered on our watch. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle will join me not only in these \nefforts but efforts they believe will move us toward a day when there \nis peace in this region of the world. We have a responsibility to do \nthat to these people and to the cause of humanity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2162-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2162-S2163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to come before \nthe Senate today to speak on legislation that the Senate passed last \nnight, S. 188.\n  Just last month, I introduced S. 188 with Senators Reid, Leahy, \nFeinstein, Boxer, and Menendez. This straightforward measure would \nincorporate Cesar E. Chavez--a truly remarkable civil rights leader and \nAmerican--into the title of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights \nAct passed last year.\n  Cesar Chavez is an American hero. Like the venerable American leaders \nwho are now associated with this effort, he sacrificed his life to \nempower the most vulnerable in America. For this reason, he continues \nto be an important part of our country's journey on the path to a more \ninclusive America. Cesar Chavez believed strongly in our American \ndemocracy and saw the right to vote as a fundamental cornerstone of our \nfreedom. I believe it is fitting that his name be a part of the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n  I would like to thank Senator Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, for his support. I sincerely appreciate his efforts to \nquickly steer S. 188 through his committee. I enthusiastically \nsupported last year's Voting Rights Act reauthorization. I firmly \nbelieve that this landmark civil rights legislation has opened the door \nfor millions of Hispanic Americans to fully exercise their right to \nparticipate in our democracy.\n  Adding Cesar E. Chavez's name sends an important message to Hispanic \nAmericans. It signals to the Nation's 40 million Hispanics that the \nVoting Rights Act has been reauthorized with their interest and \nconstitutional rights in mind. During the Judiciary Committee's \nconsideration of S. 188, Senator Leahy offered an amendment that \nincorporated another important American leader. His amendment to add \nWilliam C. Velasquez to the title of the Voting Rights Act \nreauthorization bill has my strong and unequivocal support.\n  In 1974, Mr. Velasquez founded the Southwest Voter Registration \nEducation Project, SVREP. Using his powerful slogan--Su Voto es Su Voz \nor your vote is your voice--he energized the Hispanic community and \nregistered many to vote. Mr. Velasquez envisioned a time when Latinos \nwould play an important role in the American democratic process. When \nSVREP was established, there were only 1,566 Latino elected officials. \nToday, there are over 6,000 Hispanics elected to local, State, and \nFederal office, including 3 U.S. Senators and 23 U.S. Representatives. \nLike Cesar E. Chavez, Mr. Velasquez did not live to see the remarkable \nprogress our country has made. He passed away in 1988 from kidney \ncancer. However, I am sure he is looking down on this body with joy and \npride.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  In addition, Senator Cornyn sought to include the name of former \nCongresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also played an integral part in the \nhistory of the Voting Rights Act, and Dr. Hector Garcia, founder of the \nAmerican GI Forum.\n  Congresswoman Jordan was certainly a remarkable civil rights and \nsocial justice leader and I support her inclusion in my legislation. In \naddition, Dr. Garcia fought for half a century for civil and education \nrights for Mexican Americans.\n  Former President Bill Clinton, who first met Dr. Garcia while \nregistering voters in the Rio Grande Valley in 1972, called him a \n``national hero.'' In the coming months, I will work with Senator \nCornyn to find another appropriate manner to honor Dr. Garcia's work \nwith the American G.I. Forum. The American G.I. Forum was established \nin the wake of World War II when Hispanic veterans returned home and \nwere categorically denied their G.I. Bill of Rights benefits. Dr. \nGarcia was propelled into the national spotlight when he fought to have \nArmy PVT Longoria buried alongside others in the local cemetery in his \nhometown of Three Rivers, TX. Dr. Garcia called Members of Congress and \nalerted the press to this injustice.\n  Within 24 hours, he received a telegram from then Senator Lyndon B. \nJohnson that stated:\n\n       I deeply regret to learn that the prejudice of some \n     individuals extends even beyond this life. I have no \n     authority over civilian funeral homes. Nor does the federal \n     government. However, I have made arrangements to have Felix \n     Longoria buried with full military honors in Arlington \n     National Cemetery ... where the honored dead of our nation's \n     war rest.\n\n  As our Nation moves forward toward the next chapter of civic equality \nand inclusion, starting, last year, with the reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act, it is fitting that we honor civil rights leaders \nwhose contributions and courage helped pave the way for today's more \ninclusive democracy.\n  With the Senate's passage of S. 188, my attention and efforts will \nnow focus on the U.S. House of Representatives. I am hopeful that they \nwill approve this measure so that this landmark law can now be known as \nthe Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, Cesar E. Chavez, \nBarbara Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and Hector P. Garcia Voting \nRights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the \naccomplishments of the Kansas Air National Guard, and specifically of \nthe 190th Air Refueling Wing.\n  I have made several statements on the floor recently regarding my \nfeelings on these resolutions. And today, instead of repeating my \nfeelings on the subject, I would like to acknowledge some of our \ncountry's brave men and women.\n  As we all know, our Nation has been relying heavily on our National \nGuard in the war on terror. In Kansas, it is no different. However, \nthese men and women continually rise to the challenge, saving lives and \ndefending democracy at home and abroad.\n  Next week, we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the 190th Air \nRefueling Wing in Kansas. The enormous sacrifice and dedication of the \nmen and women serving in 190th brings great credit to their unit and to \nthe State of Kansas.\n  This outstanding organization began as the 117th Fighter-Interceptor \nSquadron in Hutchinson, KS. The unit was federally recognized on \nFebruary 23, 1957.\n  Next week they will celebrate 50 years of flying aircraft--from the \nF-80 to the B-57 to the KC-135 tankers they maintain today.\n  Since 1967, the 190th has been based in our State capital of Topeka, \nKS. They continue to be leaders in the State and in the Air National \nGuard, which is evident through their most recent awards--the Spaatz \ntrophy for outstanding Air National Guard Flying Wing and the Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award.\n  As we continue to debate the difficult topic of our presence in Iraq, \nI hope my colleagues will take a moment to recognize, with me, the \noutstanding contributions of our Nation's troops. Not only has our \nvolunteer force proven themselves the best in the world, our citizen \nsoldiers have proven themselves second to none.\n  I hope we will remember the personal sacrifices of these men and \nwomen as we debate our support for them and their mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2163-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ARMITAGE II\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a report released today by a bipartisan panel of Asia \nspecialists cochaired by Richard L. Armitage and Joseph Nye. The \nreport, ``The U.S.-Japan Alliance: Getting Asia Right Through 2020,'' \nhighlights major trends in Asia and provides the panel's comprehensive \nanalysis with security and economic policy recommendations, with \nspecific reference to our bilateral relations with Japan.\n  Many Senators will recall that Ambassador Armitage and Dr. Nye issued \na report in October 2000 titled ``The United States and Japan: \nAdvancing Toward a Mature Partnership.'' This landmark document, which \nsubsequently became known as the Armitage Report, aimed at \nstrengthening the U.S.-Japan relationship in the areas of politics, \nsecurity, Okinawa, intelligence, economics and diplomacy. This new \nreport, which is already being called ``Armitage II,'' continues to \nemphasize the importance of the alliance but goes a step further, by \naddressing the ways in which the alliance can work to positively \ninfluence future affairs in Asia.\n  The report, which is available on the CSIS Web site at: http://\nwww.csis.org/component/option,com--csis--pubs/task,view /id,3729/typ, \nis not a political document. It reflects the views of the study group \nmembers only. Nevertheless, it represents a serious attempt to outline \na vision that would achieve a balance of power in Asia through 2020 \nthat favors American interests and values and promotes regional \nstability.\n  I encourage all Senators and their staffs to examine this serious and \nsignificant new report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2163-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2163-S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BRIGHT STAR RESTAURANT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity to recognize the 100th Anniversary of the Bright Star \nRestaurant in Bessemer, AL. Since 1907, the Bright Star has been \nproviding the citizens of our State and its visitors with delicious \nfood and superior service. Today, this family-owned business, led by \nJimmy and Nick Koikos, continues to build on this tradition. While \nAmerica is famous for its chain restaurants, there remain many of the \nold ones which have atmosphere, friendship, and good food. They are a \nvaluable part of our communities and unite us in many ways. The Bright \nStar is a classic.\n  Known for fresh gulf seafood, quality steaks, and fresh vegetables, \nthe Bright Star is certain to satisfy every palate. The restaurant's \nGreek style specialties are my personal favorites. In fact, I don't \nbelieve the broiled snapper, along with the Greek salad, can be topped. \nAlthough, admittedly, the daily meat and three-vegetable specials \ncertainly give them a run for their money.\n  Famous faces, like legendary coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant and former \nSenator Howell Heflin, frequented the Bright Star. I am certain that \nvirtually all of our congressional delegation have eaten there \nincluding my colleague, Senator Shelby, on many occasions. It is the \nplace for good friends, good food, and even a small taste of politics. \nToday, you will still see Alabama coaches and fans filing through the \ndining room on their way to and from seeing the Crimson Tide play.\n  Not so long ago, I brought John Ashcroft by for dinner. This was his \nfirst visit to Alabama after becoming the U.S. Attorney General, and I \nwill never forget the wonderful reception Jimmy and the staff gave us. \nI wanted to show off the best of Birmingham, so dinner at this fine \nrestaurant was a no-brainer. Jimmy gave us a mouth-watering overview of \nthe menu, emphasizing as I had hoped that he would, the renown seafood \ndishes. Everything sounded delicious, however it turned out that the \nAttorney General was allergic to seafood and shellfish. I seem to \nrecall he had a steak that he enjoyed, but he certainly missed out on \nthose fresh gulf delicacies.\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\n  Located just outside of Birmingham in the quaint downtown area of \nBessemer, the Bright Star is easily accessible and certainly a \ndestination attraction. Moreover, you can always expect a good crowd of \nfolks dining there on any day of the week. Luckily, expansions to the \nbuilding over the years, including ample banquet space, enable diners \nto be comfortably accommodated. I look forward to the lunch I have \nscheduled there for next week, and I highly recommend a visit to \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2164-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2164-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2164-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \narthritis research and public health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, with more than 100 different forms, \narthritis is one of the most widespread and devastating health \nconditions in the United States. Nearly 46 million, or one in every \nfive, American adults suffer from arthritis or chronic joint symptoms, \nand 300,000 children live with the pain, disability and emotional \ntrauma caused by juvenile arthritis.\n  As the leading cause of disability in the United States, arthritis is \na painful and debilitating chronic disease affecting men, women and \nchildren alike. This is why the Federal Government must make a stronger \ninvestment in research, treatment and prevention of arthritis.\n  We know that early diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate management \nof arthritis can control symptoms and improve quality of life. The \nArthritis Prevention, Control and Cure Act will expand the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to find new ways to prevent, treat, and care for \npatients with arthritis and related rheumatic diseases by: (1) \nimproving coordination among Federal agencies and the public with \nregard to the Federal investment in arthritis research and public \nhealth activities through a National Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases \nSummit; (2) accelerating research that will lead to improved treatments \nand a cure for juvenile arthritis; (3) investing in a nationwide public \nhealth initiative designed to reduce the pain and disability of \narthritis through early diagnosis and effective treatment of the \ndisease; and (4) ensuring kids with arthritis have access to specialty \ncare by addressing the nationwide shortage of pediatric \nrheumatologists.\n  We have a responsibility to look for solutions to this issue in a \ncomprehensive manner. I look forward to working with Senator Kennedy on \nthis important legislation which will make a real difference in the \nlives of the millions of Americans, both young and old, who suffer from \nthis debilitating disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2166-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2166-S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Brown, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 655.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The American National Red \n     Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The \n     American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.\n       (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The \n     American National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') \n     commissioned an independent review and analysis of the Board \n     of Governors' role, composition, size, relationship with \n     management, governance relationship with chartered units of \n     The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower and audit \n     functions.\n       (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, \n     entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st \n     Century'' (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors \n     recommended changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and \n     other governing documents of The American National Red Cross \n     to modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of \n     Governors and governance structure of The American National \n     Red Cross.\n       (4) It is in the national interest to create a more \n     efficient governance structure of The American National Red \n     Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to \n     support the critical mission of The American National Red \n     Cross in the 21st century.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic \n     oversight board and for The American National Red Cross to \n     amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations \n     described in the Governance Report, to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors and to outline the areas of its \n     responsibility, including--\n       (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement for The \n     American National Red Cross;\n       (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's strategic \n     plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational \n     matters;\n       (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level of \n     compensation of the corporation's chief executive officer;\n       (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the \n     compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for \n     management succession;\n       (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit process, \n     internal controls, and legal compliance;\n       (F) holding management accountable for performance;\n       (G) providing oversight of the financial stability of the \n     corporation;\n       (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the \n     corporation;\n       (I) providing oversight of the protection of the brand of \n     the corporation; and\n       (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the \n     corporation.\n       (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors \n     is a critical component of effective governance for The \n     American National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the \n     national interest that The American National Red Cross amend \n     its bylaws to provide a method of selection consistent with \n     that described in the Governance Report.\n       (B) The new method of selection should replace the current \n     process by which--\n       (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board of \n     Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which \n     includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other \n     individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\n       (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors are \n     nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of \n     Governors; and\n       (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are appointed by \n     the President of the United States.\n       (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance \n     Report reflects the single category of members of the Board \n     of Governors that will result from the implementation of this \n     Act:\n       (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of the Board \n     of Governors) would be nominated by a single committee of the \n     Board of Governors taking into account the criteria outlined \n     in the Governance Report to assure the expertise, skills, and \n     experience of a governing board.\n       (ii) The nominated members would be considered for approval \n     by the full Board of Governors and then submitted to The \n     American National Red Cross annual meeting of delegates for \n     election, in keeping with the standard corporate practice \n     whereby shareholders of a corporation elect members of a \n     board of directors at its annual meeting.\n       (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American \n     National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it is in the national interest that the \n     Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any \n     changes to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights \n     and obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry \n     out its purposes.\n       (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in \n     carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and \n     meeting its various obligations, the effectiveness of The \n     American National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation \n     of an organizational ombudsman who--\n       (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute resolution \n     practitioner whose major function will be to provide \n     confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and \n     external stakeholders of The American National Red Cross;\n       (B) will report to the chief executive officer and the \n     audit committee of the Board of Governors; and\n       (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in The \n     American National Red Cross.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of \n     American society, but these organizations can only fulfill \n     their important roles by maintaining the trust of the \n     American public;\n       (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and \n     transparency, which are the principal goals of the \n     recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance \n     Report and this Act;\n       (3) Federal and State action play an important role in \n     ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting \n     standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public; \n     and\n       (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will \n     remain a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it has the rights and obligations consistent with \n     that status, The American National Red Cross nevertheless \n     should maintain appropriate communications with State \n     regulators of charitable organizations and should cooperate \n     with them as appropriate in specific matters as they arise \n     from time to time.\n\n     SEC. 3. ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 300101 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``a Federally chartered \n     instrumentality of the United States and'' before ``a body \n     corporate and politic''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The corporation may conduct its \n     business and affairs, and otherwise hold itself out, as the \n     `American Red Cross' in any jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 300102 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n       ``(5) to conduct other activities consistent with the \n     foregoing purposes.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP AND CHAPTERS.\n\n       Section 300103 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or as otherwise \n     provided,'' before ``in the bylaws'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1)--\n       (A) by striking ``board of governors'' and inserting \n     ``corporation''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     related''; and\n       (3) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     shall require''; and\n       (B) by striking ``national convention'' and inserting \n     ``annual meeting''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the American \nNational Red Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007. This \nlegislation, a product of close cooperation with my colleagues Senator \nGrassley and Senator Kennedy, seeks to create a more efficient \ngovernance structure of the American Red Cross, and to enhance the \nBoard of Governors' ability to support the critical mission of the \nAmerican Red Cross in the 21st Century.\n  Charitable organizations are an indispensable part of American \nsociety, but these organizations can only fulfill their important roles \nby maintaining the trust of the American public. This trust is fostered \nby effective governance and transparency, which are the principal goals \nof this legislation. The role of the American Red Cross is one of vital \nsignificance to the American people. The ability of the American Red \nCross to meet its responsibilities requires a governance structure that \nreflects a need for clear mission and a culture of accountability.\n  This past October the American Red Cross Board of Governors announced \nits unanimous support for a series of important changes to its charter \nand business practice. The American National Red Cross Governance \nModernization Act of 2007 enables a number of those changes, including \nclarifying the role of the Board of Governors as one of governance and \nstrategic oversight. As this bill facilitates these governance reforms, \nthe American Red Cross is expected to continue to implement amendments \nto its bylaws consistent with those described in the Governance Report \nto clarify further the role of the Board of Governors and to outline \nareas of its responsibility.\n  This bill ensures that the American Red Cross will remain a federally \nchartered instrumentality of the United States, and it has the rights \nand obligations consistent with that status. Consistent with that \nstatus Congress expects that the American Red Cross will maintain \nappropriate communications with State regulators of charitable \norganizations and to cooperate with them as appropriate in specific \nmatters as they arise from time to time.\n  Finally, we believe the effectiveness of the American Red Cross will \nbe promoted by the creation of a Red Cross ombudsman to be a dispute \nresolution practitioner to provide confidential and informal assistance \nto the many internal and external stakeholders of the American Red \nCross. The American Red Cross ombudsman will report to Congress, the \nAmerican Red Cross chief executive officer, and the audit committee of \nthe Board of Governors. The Red Cross ombudsman will have access to \nanyone and any documents in the American Red Cross. This is an \nimportant tool for improving processes and protections for those inside \nthe American Red Cross who wish to express concerns about the \norganizations practices and procedures, and an important tool for \nCongress in providing oversight of the activities of the American Red \nCross.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the American National Red Cross \nGovernance Modernization Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Burr, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Isakson, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 657. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to add \nrequirements regarding trauma care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nRoberts, along with Senators Kennedy, Burr, Murray, Clinton, Brown, \nBingaman, Collins, Isakson, and Biden in introducing the Trauma Care \nSystems Planning and Development Act.\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\n  Our Nation's emergency medical system is a system on the brink. We \nneed to support and strengthen this essential component of our health \ncare system. The Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act is an \nimportant building block to achieving an improved national network of \ncare across the country.\n  Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among people \nbetween the ages of 1 to 44 and in 2002, injuries were responsible for \n161,000 deaths. In 2004, about 29.6 million people were treated for an \ninjury in U.S. hospital emergency departments, of which nearly 2 \nmillion injuries were severe enough to require hospitalization. Yet, \nbetween 20,000 and 25,000 trauma deaths are preventable each year.\n  A trauma system is an organized, coordinated effort in a specific \narea that delivers the full range of care to all injured patients. It \nprovides resources, supporting equipment, and personnel along a \ncontinuum of care including pre-hospital, hospital, and rehabilitation \nservices. Trauma systems have been proven to reduce mortality rates and \nprovide efficient, cost-effective, and timely care. Since 1990, the \nFederal Government, through Title XII of the Public Health Service Act, \nhas helped States and territories develop and implement regional and \nstatewide trauma care systems.\n  The legislation I am introducing today along with my colleagues will \nreauthorize and reaffirm the Federal Government's commitment to trauma \ncare systems. It will also authorize additional resources for systems \nplanning and development, as well as improved data collection and \nanalysis and the inclusion of an Institute of Medicine study on the \nstate of trauma care and trauma research.\n  Trauma care is not only critical to providing timely access to \nlifesaving interventions for persons suffering from serious \nunintentional injuries, it is central to our national security and \ndisaster preparedness. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 and \nHurricanes Rita and Katrina serve as stark reminders of the potential \nintentional and natural disasters that threaten our Nation. Trauma care \nsystems are an important element of our security and response efforts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward expeditious \npassage of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trauma Care Systems Planning \n     and Development Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish kinship navigator programs, to establish \nguardianship assistance payments for children, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce the Kinship \nCaregiver Support Act today with my friend and colleague, Senator \nOlympia Snowe. The growth of kinship care is a phenomenon that is \nquietly changing the face of the American family and creating new \nchallenges for our Nation's child welfare system. This bill would be a \nhuge help to kinship caregivers in New York and across the country.\n  Nationwide, now more than ever children are living in households \nheaded by grandparents and other relatives. In New York City alone, \nthere are over 245,000 adolescents already living in grandparent \nhouseholds. Nationwide, an estimated 20,000 children living in foster \ncare could leave the system if Congress made subsidized guardianship \navailable to their families.\n  As caregivers who often become parents unexpectedly, these generous \nfamily members face unique challenges to\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nsuccessfully raising children. These challenges are physical, emotional \nand of course, financial. Grandparents and other relatives raising \nchildren often encounter a variety of unnecessary barriers, including \ndifficulties enrolling children in school, authorizing medical \ntreatment, maintaining their public housing leases, obtaining \naffordable legal services, and accessing a variety of Federal benefits \nand services. Almost one-fifth of grandparents responsible for their \ngrandchildren live in poverty.\n  The Kinship Caregiver Support Act attempts to address the full range \nof difficulties facing kinship caregivers, by allowing relatives to \nbecome formal guardians while receiving some financial assistance. This \nbill will provide relative caregivers with the information and \nassistance they need to thrive as non-traditional families.\n  First, the Act contains a ``subsidized guardianship provision'', \nwhich will give States the option to use their Title IV-E funds to \nprovide payments to grandparents and other relatives who have assumed \nlegal guardianship of children they have cared for as foster parents.\n  The Act also establishes the Kinship Navigator Program, which will \nprovide families with the guidance they need to learn how to obtain \nhealth care coverage for the children in their care, apply for housing \nassistance, locate childcare, enroll children in school, and gain \naccess to other services.\n  Finally, this legislation will require States to notify grandparents \nand other close relatives when children enter the foster care system. \nUnfortunately, grandparents and other relatives often do not know when \ntheir grandchildren or nieces and nephews come under the care of the \nState. Notifying grandparents and other relatives when children enter \nthe foster care system will make it easier for families to stay \ntogether.\n  So many grandparents and other relatives are making great personal \nsacrifices to provide safe and loving homes for the children in their \ncare. It is my hope that my colleagues will join Senator Snowe and me \nas we continue this fight for children and families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 663. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to repeal the \nstatutory designation of beneficiaries of the $100,000 death gratuity \nunder section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, and to permit \nmembers of the Armed Forces to designate in writing their beneficiaries \nof choice in the event of their death while serving on active duty; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to fix \na serious problem that has recently come to light with respect to the \nadministration of the so-called Death Gratuity. The legislation is \ndesigned to ensure that a service member can designate to whom a death \ngratuity benefit is awarded.\n  Today's Washington Post includes an informative yet troubling article \ndescribing the plight of the mother of Petty Officer Second Class Jaime \nS. Jaenke, U. S. Navy, who died in Iraq in June 2006 as a result of an \nIED attack. Petty Officer Jaenke was a member of the Navy Reserve and a \nmedic assigned to a Seabee Construction Battalion. She left behind a \nyoung daughter, Kayla, who is in the care of Kayla's grandmother, Susan \nJaenke.\n  Regrettably, because of the manner in which death benefits are \nadministered, a hardship situation has been created for Mrs. Jaenke. \nThe article spells out that while the insurance proceeds have been set \naside by the State court for the benefit of Kayla, they have not yet \nbeen made available. So in the meantime her grandmother is left trying \nto make ends meet because she is not allowed to receive the gratuity \nbenefit that her daughter thought she would be providing, should the \nservice member's unfortunate death occur.\n  The article describes a very difficult situation for the person on \nwho Petty Officer Jaenke depended. The financial difficulties Mrs. \nJaenke is experiencing is due in part by confusion about how the death \ngratuity benefit--a sum of $100,000--is being administered under law.\n  Under current law, the recipient of the $100,000 is dictated by the \nstatute. It provides that a benefit is first awarded to an existing \nspouse. If there is no spouse, it then is provided to the children, and \nso on. It's a scheme that was set up to permit speedy resolution of \nwhat used to be a very modest benefit. In today's world, however, with \nthe complex needs of service members, it does not comport with the \nrealities of many of our service members and their families. It needs \nto be changed.\n  The legislation I am introducing would replace the statutory order of \nbeneficiaries with provisions identical to that used to select \nbeneficiaries under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance--SGLI. The \nbill would give service members the power to select precisely who will \nreceive the $100,00 death gratuity. It would require the Secretary of \nDefense to, no later than April 1, 2007, to prepare regulations and \ncreate election forms that will enable service members to designate who \nwill receive this benefit.\n  I hope we can move this legislation quickly and ensure that the \nintentions of our service members regarding the well being of their \nchildren and families can be carried out. We owe at least that much to \nthose who are giving their lives for our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF SCHEME FOR PAYMENT OF DEATH \n                   GRATUITY PAYABLE WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The death gratuity authorized under sections 1475 to \n     1480 of title 10, United States Code, was intended, when \n     originally enacted to provide an immediate cash payment to \n     assist survivors of deceased members of the Armed Forces to \n     meet their financial needs during the period immediately \n     following a member's death and before other survivor benefits \n     become available.\n       (2) The death gratuity, when first implemented in 1908, \n     amounted to six months of a service member's pay and, until \n     1991, could not exceed $3,000.\n       (3) However, following the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     and the initiation of Operation Enduring Freedom and \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom, Congress determined that the death \n     benefits available to survivors of members of the Armed \n     Forces should be substantially increased.\n       (4) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2006, which was enacted on January 6, 2006, as Public Law \n     109-163, increased the amount of the death gratuity to \n     $100,000, effective retroactively to October 7, 2001.\n       (5) Under section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, the \n     law authorizing the death gratuity, those living relatives of \n     deceased members of the Armed Forces who shall receive the \n     death gratuity are specifically designated. Service members \n     are not provided with the opportunity to make an election \n     choosing a beneficiary other than those set forth in section \n     1477 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (6) The increased death gratuity, in combination with \n     benefits available under the Servicemembers' Group Life \n     Insurance program, the Survivor Benefit Plan, and Dependency \n     and Indemnity Compensation provide significant support and \n     compensation to the next of kin of deceased members of the \n     Armed Forces. Individual members are best qualified to \n     determine who the beneficiaries for death benefits should be \n     and should be afforded the opportunity to make these \n     selections at appropriate times throughout military service \n     and particularly prior to mobilization or deployment to a \n     combat zone.\n       (7) Under the current system, many members of the Armed \n     Forces have designated individuals as beneficiaries for the \n     death gratuity in a manner not provided for by law. In these \n     cases, the wishes of these members regarding the disposition \n     of the death gratuity has in many cases not been implemented, \n     to the detriment of their children and other loved ones.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     all members of the Armed Forces should be given the \n     opportunity to affirmatively select who shall receive the \n     death gratuity and that the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretaries of the military departments should take prompt \n     action to afford members the opportunity to make an election \n     in writing about the disposition of the death gratuity \n     proceeds and to provide appropriate and timely counseling \n     about the manner in which the proceeds of the death gratuity \n     and other forms of insurance will be administered.\n       (c) Modification.--\n       (1) In general.--Subsection (a) of section 1477 of title \n     10, United States Code, is amended by striking all that \n     follows ``on the following list:'' and inserting the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\n       ``(1) To any individual designated by the person in \n     writing.\n       ``(2) If there is no person so designated, to the surviving \n     spouse of the person.\n       ``(3) If there is none of the above, to the children (as \n     prescribed by subsection (b)) of the person and the \n     descendants of any deceased children by representation.\n       ``(4) If there is none of the above, to the parents (as \n     prescribed by subsection (c)) of the person or the survivor \n     of them.\n       ``(5) If there is none of the above, to the duly appointed \n     executor or administrator of the estate of the person.\n       ``(6) If there is none of the above, to other next of kin \n     of the person entitled under the laws of domicile of the \n     person at the time of the person's death.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--Such section is further \n     amended--\n       (A) in subsection (b), by striking ``Subsection (a)(2)'' in \n     the matter preceding paragraph (1) and inserting ``Subsection \n     (a)(3)'';\n       (B) by striking (c) and inserting the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c) For purposes of subsection (a)(4), parents include \n     fathers and mothers through adoption. However, only one \n     father and one mother may be recognized in any case, and \n     preference shall be given to those who exercised a parental \n     relationship on the date, or most nearly before the date, on \n     which the decedent entered a status described in section 1475 \n     or 1476 of this title.''; and\n       (C) by striking subsection (d).\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Applicability.--Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the \n     provisions of section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, shall continue to apply to each member of the Armed \n     Forces covered by such section until the earlier of the \n     following--\n       (A) the date on which such member makes the designation \n     contemplated by paragraph (1) of section 1477(a) of such \n     title (as amended by paragraph (1) of this subsection); or\n       (B) January 1, 2008.\n       (d) Regulations.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than April 1, 2007, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to implement \n     the amendments to section 1477 of title 10, United States \n     Code, made by subsection (c).\n       (2) Elements.--The regulations required by paragraph (1) \n     shall include forms for the making of the designation \n     contemplated by paragraph (1) of section 1477(a) of title 10, \n     United States Code (as amended by subsection (c)), and \n     instructions for members of the Armed Forces in the filling \n     out of such forms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 667.

A bill to require the Food and Drug Administration to conduct \nconsumer testing to determine the appropriateness of the current \nlabeling requirements for indoor tanning devices and determine whether \nsuch requirements provide sufficient information to consumers regarding \nthe risks that the use of such devices pose for the development of \nirreversible damage to the skin, including skin cancer, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join Senator Isakson in introducing \nthe Tanning Accountability and Notification (TAN) Act.\n  Approximately 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their \nlifetime. While the decline in cancer deaths reported earlier this year \nis an indication that we are starting to turn the corner on our fight \nagainst cancer, approximately 1 million people will be diagnosed with \nskin cancer and 10,850 are expected to die in 2007 alone.\n  There are many factors that contribute to these startling figures. In \nrecent years efforts have been undertaken by various organizations to \nbetter inform the public about the risk of sun exposure and ways to \ndecrease the chance of developing skin cancer. One area, however, where \nbetter information is sorely needed is on the use of indoor tanning \nsalons.\n  Every day approximately 1 million people visit a tanning salon. It is \na practice particularly popular among teens, the group that seems most \nat risk from the effects of indoor tanning. The American Academy of \nDermatology, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, and the World Health Organization, WHO, all discourage \nthe use of indoor tanning equipment.\n  This message and the current information about the risks of indoor \ntanning I fear are not being adequately passed on to consumers. The FDA \nhas not updated its warnings on tanning beds since 1979. Regular users \nof indoor tanning beds deserve to be fully informed.\n  The TAN Act calls upon the FDA to revisit the current label on indoor \ntanning beds and determine through a process of public hearings and \nconsumer testing what kind of labeling requirements would convey \nimportant information on the risks of indoor tanning.\n  This legislation is not about introducing new regulations but \nensuring that the current FDA regulations remain effective in \ncommunicating accurate, current, and clear information to consumers \nabout indoor tanning salons.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward passage of this \nbipartisan legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tanning Accountability and \n     Notification Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT BY FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REGARDING \n                   LABELING INFORMATION ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN \n                   USE OF INDOOR TANNING DEVICES AND DEVELOPMENT \n                   OF SKIN CANCER OR OTHER SKIN DAMAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), acting \n     through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall determine--\n       (1) whether the labeling requirements for indoor tanning \n     devices, including the positioning requirements, provide \n     sufficient information to consumers regarding the risks that \n     the use of such devices pose for the development of \n     irreversible damage to the eyes and skin, including skin \n     cancer; and\n       (2)(A) whether adding the warning suggested by the American \n     Academy of Dermatology to the current warning label, or any\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\n     other additional warning, would communicate the risks of \n     indoor tanning more effectively; or\n       (B) whether there is no warning that would be capable of \n     adequately communicating such risks.\n       (b) Consumer Testing.--In making the determinations under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall conduct appropriate \n     consumer testing, using the best available methods for \n     determining consumer understanding of label warnings.\n       (c) Public Hearings; Public Comment.--The Secretary shall \n     hold public hearings and solicit comments from the public in \n     making the determinations under subsection (a).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Congress a report that provides the determinations under \n     subsection (a). In addition, the Secretary shall include in \n     the report the measures being implemented by the Secretary to \n     significantly reduce the risks associated with indoor tanning \n     devices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 671. A bill to exempt children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitations on immigrant visas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senators Harry Reid, Daniel Inouye, Barbara Boxer, Maria \nCantwell, and Edward Kennedy to introduce a bill which will award \nspecial immigrant status to the children of naturalized Filipino \nveterans who fought in World War II thereby allowing these veterans to \nbecome reunited with their families.\n  With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the courage of many \nFilipino soldiers who fought alongside our troops during World War II \nwas finally honored and acknowledged by our government and they were \noffered the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. However, the Act \ndid not extend this opportunity to the sons and daughters of these \nveterans. As a result, many of the brave men who defended this Nation \nmay spend the last years of their lives without the comfort and care of \ntheir families.\n  For over twenty years, many of the sons and daughters of these \nsoldiers have been waiting to obtain immigrant visas. While some have \nbeen fortunate enough to have their visas approved, other are still \nwaiting because of a backlog. This is unacceptable. My legislation will \nfinally allow them to reunite with their elderly parents.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to honor the sacrifices of these brave \nmen by supporting this bill and allowing those who have served our \ncountry so valiantly to have their families by their side for the \nremainder of their years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 672. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax-exempt financing for qualified renewable energy facilities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S. 673. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncredits for the installation of wind energy property, including by \nrural homeowners, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills that \nwill help drive the renewable energy revolution that is currently \nunderway in our rural communities. The Rural Community Renewable Energy \nBonds Act, which I am introducing with Senator Smith, and the Rural \nWind Energy Development Act, which I am introducing with Senators \nSmith, Dorgan and Craig, will help spur much needed private investment \nin renewable energy infrastructure in rural areas.\n  I have spoken countless times about the great possibilities that \nrural America holds for our Nation's energy future. I have also \nexpressed my alarm at how our rising dependence on foreign oil is \nundermining our security and our interests around the world.\n  How do we build a more energy secure economy--one that is less \nvulnerable to wild swings in oil prices, political instability, and \nsupply disruptions? Unfortunately, we don't have the resources in this \ncountry to drill our way to energy independence. We do, however, have \nthe most productive lands in the world, and the most productive \nfarmers, ranchers, engineers and entrepreneurs in the world. If we give \nthem the right tools, they can build a new, clean energy economy that \nwill rely heavily on biofuels, wind power, solar energy, and \nalternative sources.\n  If you spend time in places like Prowers County or Alamosa County, \nyou see that a clean energy revolution is already underway in our \nheartland. In these rural communities, like so many across the country, \npeople are banding together to build small biofuels plants, solar \nfarms, and wind turbines. These projects are already underway, and they \nare the seeds for a full-blown clean energy revolution in rural \nAmerica.\n  The farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs who are behind these \nprojects want to be a part of the solution to our Nation's energy \nchallenges. They also understand that home-grown energy can revitalize \nthe Main Streets that have been boarded up in the last few years.\n  The bills I am introducing today provide tools that rural communities \ncan use to build a renewable energy economy.\n  The first bill, the Renewable Energy Bonds Act, provides incentives \nfor investment in wind and other renewable energy projects by giving \nprivate developers access to tax-exempt bond markets.\n  Currently, the Federal tax code only allows municipal and public \nentities access to tax-exempt bond markets for wind and other renewable \nenergy projects. Private developers, who are more likely to invest in \nsmaller projects and who are currently responsible for nearly 75 \npercent of current renewable energy development, are not eligible to \nuse these federally tax-exempt bonds.\n  This is unfortunate because these are the same small developers who \ndon't benefit much from the production tax credit, as their Federal tax \nliabilities usually aren't big enough to reap the tax credit's \nbenefits.\n  Renewable energy bonds make sense for these small developers and, \nbecause they cost the Federal Government less than the production tax \ncredit, they also make sense from a fiscal perspective. This bill may \nactually save the Government money.\n  The second bill I am introducing, the Rural Wind Energy Development \nAct, would extend the production tax credit to include small wind \nsystems. We have made great strides in wind development over the last \nfew years, as evidenced by wind energy's growing availability to \nColorado consumers.\n  The trouble is that the existing production tax credit only benefits \nlarger producers that want to build wind farms with million-dollar \nturbines. Small businesses, towns, farms, and families aren't given the \nsame incentive to produce their own renewable power from smaller, more \naffordable turbines.\n  This is unfortunate because the National Renewable Energy Lab in \nGolden, Colorado, and others are making great strides in the \ndevelopment of small wind systems that can be installed on homes and \nbusinesses. The system now available costs around $50,000 for 10kW of \ncapacity.\n  That's a steep investment for any family or any business. But our \nbill, by providing a tax incentive for their purchase, would not only \nreduce the cost, but it would create more market certainty for \nmanufacturers of small wind systems. With more systems in production, \ncosts will fall further and small wind will be a real option for more \npeople.\n  The bill is simple: it creates a five year tax credit of $1500 per \nhalf-kW. There is no cap for the purchase and installation of small \nwind systems, so long as they are smaller than 100kW. It will put more \nsmall wind systems on the market and it will give consumers more \nchoices of how to power their homes and businesses.\n  I'm proud to introduce these bills with my colleagues because they \nrepresent two more building blocks for a new, clean energy economy and \nbecause they will help revitalize a rural America that has been \nforgotten for too long.\n  I hope we can move these straightforward, bipartisan solutions \nthrough as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Cochran, Mr.\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\n        Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 675. A bill to provide competitive grants for training court \nreporters and closed captioners to meet requirements for realtime \nwriters under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nTraining for Realtime Writers Act of 2007, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues, Senators Grassley, Cochran, Dodd, Durbin, Kerry, Kohl, \nMurray, Rockefeller, Snowe and Stabenow.\n  The 1996 Telecom Act required that all television broadcasts were to \nbe captioned by 2006 and all Spanish language programming was to be \ncaptioned by 2010. This was a much needed reform that has helped \nmillions of deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans to be able to take full \nadvantage of television programming. And now the first deadline has \npassed. On January 1, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began \nfining stations for not captioning.\n  Unfortunately, the United States has fallen behind in training \ncaptioners. We must jump start training programs to supply captioning \nfor the many broadcasters just realizing their obligation now. And \nlooking forward, we need to get students in the pipeline now to begin \nto address the need for Spanish language broadcasting.\n  This is an issue that I feel very strongly about because my late \nbrother, Frank, was deaf. I know personally that access to culture, \nnews, and other media was important to him and to others in achieving a \nbetter quality of life. More than 30 million Americans are considered \ndeaf or hard of hearing and many require captioning services to \nparticipate in mainstream activities. In 1990, I authored legislation \nthat required all television sets to be equipped with a computer chip \nto decode closed captioning. This bill completes the promise of that \ntechnology, affording deaf and hard of hearing Americans the same \nequality and access that captioning provides.\n  With baby boomers aging, the percentage of the population with \nhearing loss is increasing dramatically and will continue to outpace \npopulation growth for the next decade. But let me emphasize that the \ndeaf and hard of hearing population is only one of a number of groups \nthat will benefit from the legislation. The audience for captioning \nalso includes individuals seeking to acquire or improve literacy \nskills, including approximately functionally illiterate adults, \nimmigrants learning English as a second language, and children learning \nto read. Empirical research studies have been conducted repeatedly \nsince 1988 to demonstrate that captions improve the performance of \nindividuals learning to read English.\n  I see people using closed captioning to stay informed everywhere--\nfrom the gym to the airport. Here in the Senate, I would wager that \nmany individuals on our staff have the captioning turned on right now \nto follow what is happening on the Senate floor while they go about \nconducting the meetings and phone calls that advance legislation. \nCaptioning helps people educate themselves and helps all of us stay \ninformed and entertained when audio isn't the most appropriate medium.\n  Although the 2006 deadline has passed, our nation is facing a serious \nshortage of captioners. The rate of job placement upon graduation nears \n100 percent. In addition, the majority of closed captioners are \nindependent contractors. They are the small businesses that run the \nAmerican economy and we should do everything we can to promote the \ncreation and support of those businesses.\n  That is why my colleagues and I are re-introducing this vital piece \nof legislation. The Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2007 would \nestablish competitive grants to be used toward training real time \ncaptioners. This is necessary to ensure that we meet the promises we \nmade in the 1996 Telecom Act.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee reported this bill unanimously in the \nlast two sessions, the full Senate has passed this Act without \nobjection three times now, and we stand here today, once again at the \nbeginning of the process. I am hopeful that this will be the Congress \nmoves our country forward on this accessibility issue. I ask my \ncolleagues to join us once again in support of this legislation and \njoin us in our effort to win its passage into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2180-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2180-S2181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 85--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n CREATION OF REFUGEE POPULATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, NORTH AFRICA, AND \n     THE PERSIAN GULF REGION AS A RESULT OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Coleman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 85\n\n       Whereas armed conflicts in the Middle East have created \n     refugee populations numbering in the hundreds of thousands \n     and comprised of peoples from many ethnic, religious, and \n     national backgrounds;\n       Whereas Jews and other ethnic groups have lived mostly as \n     minorities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian \n     Gulf region for more than 2,500 years;\n       Whereas the United States has long voiced its concern about \n     the mistreatment of minorities and the violation of human \n     rights in the Middle East and elsewhere;\n       Whereas the United States continues to play a pivotal role \n     in seeking an end to conflict in the Middle East and \n     continues to promote a peace that will benefit all the \n     peoples of the region;\n       Whereas a comprehensive peace in the Middle East region \n     will require the resolution of all outstanding issues through \n     bilateral and multilateral negotiations involving all \n     concerned parties;\n       Whereas the United States has demonstrated interest and \n     concern about the mistreatment, violation of rights, forced \n     expulsion, and expropriation of assets of minority \n     populations in general, and in particular, former Jewish \n     refugees displaced from Arab countries, as evidenced by--\n       (1) a statement made by President William J. Clinton in an \n     interview after Camp David II in July 2000, at which the \n     issue of Jewish refugees displaced from Arab lands was \n     discussed, where he said that ``[t]here will have to be some \n     sort of international fund set up for the refugees. There is, \n     I think, some interest, interestingly enough, on both sides, \n     in also having a fund which compensates the Israelis who were \n     made refugees by the war, which occurred after the birth of \n     the State of Israel. Israel is full of people, Jewish people, \n     who lived in predominantly Arab countries who came to Israel \n     because they were made refugees in their own land.'';\n       (2) a statement made by President Carter after negotiating \n     the Camp David Accords, the Framework for Peace in the Middle \n     East, where he stated in a press conference on October 27, \n     1977, that ``Palestinians have rights . . . obviously there \n     are Jewish refugees . . . they have the same rights as others \n     do'';\n       (3) section 620 of H.R. 3100, 100th Congress, which states \n     that Congress finds that ``with the notable exceptions of \n     Morocco and Tunisia, those Jews remaining in Arab countries \n     continue to suffer deprivations, degradations, and hardships, \n     and continue to live in peril'' and that Congress calls upon \n     the governments of those Arab countries where Jews still \n     maintain a presence to guarantee their Jewish citizens full \n     civil and human rights, including the right to lead full \n     Jewish lives, free of fear, with freedom to emigrate if they \n     so choose; and\n       (4) Senate Resolution 76, 85th Congress, introduced by \n     Senator William E. Jenner on January 29, 1957, which--\n       (A) noted that individuals in Egypt who are tied by race, \n     religion, or national origin with Israel, France, or the \n     United Kingdom have been subjected to arrest, denial or \n     revocation of Egyptian citizenship, expulsions, forced exile, \n     sequestration and confiscation of assets and property, and \n     other punishments without being charged with a crime; and\n       (B) requested the President to instruct the chief delegate \n     to the United Nations to urge the prompt dispatch of a United \n     Nations observer team to Egypt with the objective of \n     obtaining a full factual report concerning the violation of \n     rights;\n\n       Whereas the international definition of a refugee clearly \n     applies to Jews who fled the persecution of Arab regimes, \n     where a refugee is a person who ``owing to a well-founded \n     fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, \n     nationality, membership of a particular social group, or \n     political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, \n     and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to \n     avail himself of the protection of that country'' (Convention \n     relating to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva July 28, \n     1951, and entered into force April 22, 1954 (189 UNTS 150));\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     (UNHCR) determined that Jews fleeing from Arab countries were \n     refugees that fell within the mandate of the UNHCR, namely--\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n       (1) when in his first statement as newly elected High \n     Commissioner, Mr. Auguste Lindt, at the January 29, 1957, \n     meeting of the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNREF) Executive \n     Committee in Geneva, stated, ``There is already now another \n     emergency problem arising. Refugees from Egypt. And there is \n     no doubt in my mind that those of those refugee who are not \n     able or not willing to avail themselves of the protection of \n     the Government of their nationality, they might have no \n     nationality or they may have lost this nationality, or, for \n     reasons of prosecution may not be willing to avail themselves \n     of this protection, fall under the mandate of the High \n     Commissioner.'' (United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, Report of the UNREF Executive Committee, Fourth \n     Session-Geneva 29 January to 4 February, 1957); and\n       (2) Dr. E. Jahn, on behalf of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees, wrote to Daniel Lack, Legal \n     Adviser to the American Joint Distribution Committee, \n     stating, ``I refer to our recent discussion concerning Jews \n     from Middle Eastern and North African countries in \n     consequence of recent events. I am now able to inform you \n     that such persons may be considered prima facie within the \n     mandate of this Office.'' (United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees Document No. 7/2/3/Libya);\n\n       Whereas the seminal United Nations resolution on the Arab-\n     Israeli conflict and other international initiatives refer \n     generally to the plight of ``refugees'' and do not make any \n     distinction between Palestinian and Jewish refugees, such \n     as--\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 of \n     November 22, 1967, which calls for a ``just settlement of the \n     refugee problem'' without distinction between Palestinian and \n     Jewish refugees, and this is evidenced by--\n       (A) a failed attempt by the United Nations delegation of \n     the Soviet Union to restrict the ``just settlement'' \n     mentioned in Resolution 242 solely to Palestinian refugees \n     (S/8236, discussed by the Security Council at its 1382nd \n     meeting on November 22, 1967, notably at paragraph 117, in \n     the words of Ambassador Kouznetsov of the Soviet Union), \n     which signified the international community's intention of \n     having the resolution address the rights of all Middle East \n     refugees; and\n       (B) a statement by Justice Arthur Goldberg, the Chief \n     Delegate of the United States to the United Nations at that \n     time, who was instrumental in drafting the unanimously \n     adopted United Nations Resolution 242, where he observed, \n     ``The resolution addresses the objective of `achieving a just \n     settlement of the refugee problem'. This language presumably \n     refers both to Arab and Jewish refugees, for about an equal \n     number of each abandoned their homes as a result of the \n     several wars.'';\n       (2) the Madrid Conference, which was first convened in \n     October 1991 and was co-chaired by President of the United \n     States, George H.W. Bush, and President of the Soviet Union, \n     Mikhail Gorbachev, and included delegations from Spain, the \n     European community, the Netherlands, Egypt, Syria, and \n     Lebanon, as well as a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, \n     where in his opening remarks before the January 28, 1992, \n     organizational meeting for multilateral negotiations on the \n     Middle East in Moscow, United States Secretary of State James \n     Baker made no distinction between Palestinian refugees and \n     Jewish refugees in articulating the mission of the Refugee \n     Working Group, stating that ``[t]he refugee group will \n     consider practical ways of improving the lot of people \n     throughout the region who have been displaced from their \n     homes''; and\n       (3) the Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the \n     Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, which refers in Phase III to an \n     ``agreed, just, fair, and realistic solution to the refugee \n     issue'', language that is consistent with United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 242, which applied equally to \n     Arab and Jewish peoples;\n\n       Whereas Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians have affirmed \n     that a comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict \n     will require a just solution to the plight of all \n     ``refugees'', as evidenced by--\n       (1) the 1978 Camp David Accords, the Framework for Peace in \n     the Middle East, which includes a commitment by Egypt and \n     Israel to ``work with each other and with other interested \n     parties to establish agreed procedures for a prompt, just and \n     permanent resolution of the implementation of the refugee \n     problem'';\n       (2) the Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt, signed at \n     Washington March 26, 1979, which provides in Article 8 that \n     the ``Parties agree to establish a claims commission for the \n     mutual settlement of all financial claims'' and makes general \n     references to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 \n     as the basis for comprehensive peace in the region; and\n       (3) Article 8 of the Treaty of Peace Between the State of \n     Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, done at Arava/\n     Araba Crossing Point October 26, 1994, entitled ``Refugees \n     and Displaced Persons'', refers to ``the massive human \n     problems caused to both Parties by the conflict in the Middle \n     East'';\n\n       Whereas the call to secure rights and redress for Jewish \n     and other minorities who were forced to flee Arab countries \n     is not a campaign against Palestinian refugees;\n       Whereas the international community should be aware of the \n     plight of Jews and other minority groups displaced from the \n     Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf;\n       Whereas the history and legacy of Jewish refugees from Arab \n     countries must be preserved;\n       Whereas no just and comprehensive Middle East peace can be \n     reached without recognition of, and redress for, the \n     uprooting of centuries-old Jewish communities in the Middle \n     East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and\n       Whereas it would be appropriate and just for the United \n     States, while recognizing rights for Palestinian refugees, to \n     recognize equal rights for former Jewish, Christian, and \n     other refugees from Arab countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND REFUGEES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States deplores the past and present ongoing \n     violation of the human rights and religious freedoms of \n     minority populations in Arab and Muslim countries throughout \n     the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and\n       (2) with respect to Jews, Christians, and other populations \n     displaced from countries in the region, for any comprehensive \n     Arab-Israeli peace agreement to be credible, durable, \n     enduring, and constitute an end to conflict in the Middle \n     East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf, the agreement must \n     address and resolve all outstanding issues, including the \n     legitimate rights of all refugees of the Middle East, North \n     Africa, and the Persian Gulf.\n\n     SEC. 2. UNITED STATES POLICY ON REFUGEES OF THE MIDDLE EAST.\n\n       The Senate urges the President to--\n       (1) instruct the United States Permanent Representative to \n     the United Nations and all representatives of the United \n     States in bilateral and multilateral fora that, when \n     considering or addressing resolutions that allude to the \n     issue of refugees in the Middle East, North Africa, and the \n     Persian Gulf, they should ensure that--\n       (A) relevant text refers to the fact that multiple refugee \n     populations have been created by the Arab-Israeli conflict; \n     and\n       (B) any explicit reference to the required resolution of \n     the Palestinian refugee issue is matched by a similar \n     explicit reference to the resolution of the issue of Jewish, \n     Christian, and other refugees from Arab and Muslim countries \n     throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian \n     Gulf region; and\n       (2) make clear that the United States Government supports \n     the position that, as an integral part of any comprehensive \n     peace, the issue of refugees and the mass violations of human \n     rights of minorities in Arab and Muslim countries throughout \n     the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf must be \n     resolved in a manner that includes--\n       (A) consideration of the legitimate rights of all refugees \n     displaced from Arab and Muslim countries throughout the \n     Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and\n       (B) recognition of the losses incurred by Jews, Christians, \n     and other minority groups as a result of the Arab-Israeli \n     conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2181-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2181-S2182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

The report of the \nSecretary of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n  The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine \nEnvironment of the Wider Caribbean Region (the ``Cartagena \nConvention'') is a regional framework agreement negotiated under the \nauspices of the Regional Seas Program of the United Nations Environment \nProgram (UNEP). It sets out general legal obligations to protect the \nmarine environment of the Gulf of Mexico, Straits of Florida, Caribbean \nSea, and immediately adjacent areas of the Atlantic Ocean--collectively \nknown as the Wider Caribbean Region. The United States became a Party \nto the Cartagena Convention in 1984. The Cartagena Convention envisions \nthe development of protocols to further elaborate certain of its \ngeneral obligations and to facilitate its effective implementation.\n  Negotiated with the active participation and leadership of the United \nStates, the Protocol addresses one of the most serious sources of \nmarine pollution in the Wider Caribbean Region. It is estimated that 70 \nto 90 percent of pollution entering the marine environment emanates \nfrom land-based sources and activities. Among the principal land-based \nsources of marine pollution in the Caribbean are domestic wastewater \nand agricultural nonpoint source runoff. Such pollution contributes to \nthe degradation of coral reefs and commercial fisheries, negatively \naffects regional economies, and endangers public health, recreation, \nand tourism throughout the region.\n  The Protocol and its Annexes list priority source categories, \nactivities, and associated contaminants that affect the Wider Caribbean \nRegion, and set forth factors that Parties will be required to apply in \ndetermining prevention, reduction, and control strategies to manage \nland-based sources of pollution. In particular, the Parties are \nrequired to ensure that domestic wastewater discharges meet specific \neffluent limitations, and to develop plans for the prevention and \nreduction of agricultural nonpoint source pollution. The Protocol is \nexpected to raise standards for treating domestic wastewater throughout \nthe region to levels close to those already in place in the United \nStates.\n  The United States would be able to implement its obligations under \nthe Protocol under existing statutory and regulatory authority.\n  The Protocol is the first regional agreement to establish effluent \nstandards to protect one of our most valuable resources, the marine \nenvironment. It differs markedly from other, similar regional \nagreements in its conceptual approach and the specificity of its \nobligations. As such, the Protocol is expected to set a new standard \nfor regional agreements on this subject. Early ratification will \ndemonstrate our continued commitment to global leadership and to the \nprotection of the marine environment of the Wider Caribbean Region.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol and its Annexes, with the declaration described in the \naccompanying report of the Secretary of State, and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, February 15, 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/16/senate-section/article/S2182-4", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
