We have a lot to do. We are \ngoing to do everything we can do so that we do not have to be in \nsession this weekend. It will take cooperation from Members because \nthere are a number of issues that we have to deal with.\n  We are going to try to finish the farm bill and the Energy bill \ntoday. We have a lot of other things to do today. Hopefully, we can get \nagreement.\n  I would also say this to all Senators: We are past the point where \nyou can just have your staff call the cloakroom and say: I have a \nSenator who objects. If somebody wants to object, we are not going to \ntake cloakroom calls during these last few days of the session.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 9:15 a.m. shall be equally divided between the leaders or their \ndesignees and shall be for debate only.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I designate 5 minutes to Senator Bingaman \nand 5 minutes to Senator Cantwell, two Senators who have been \ninstrumental in bringing this bill to where we are today on energy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding \nme 5 minutes to discuss this bill we are going to vote on, the cloture \nvote we are going to have in relation to the energy legislation a \nlittle later this morning.\n  One of the objections that has been raised to this legislation is \nthat it still contains a so-called energy tax package. It is very \ndifferent from what the House passed.\n  Senator Baucus has worked with Senator Grassley to take out \nprovisions that were objectionable to Members, particularly on the \nRepublican side, but it is still a tax package.\n  Now, what does it do? What it does is extends the tax incentives and \ncredits we put into law in 2005. Those are the tax incentives, the tax \ncredit for the production of electricity from wind, biomass from our \nclean energy sources. It provides the extension of the solar energy \ninvestment tax credit. It provides an extension of residential solar \ncredits to encourage people to use solar heating and energy generation \nin their own residences. It provides an extension of existing credits \nfor biodiesel.\n  It creates a new credit for producing ethanol made from nonfood \ncellulosic material. It tries to extend into the future and expand upon \nthe incentives we put into law in 2005 to encourage the\n\n[[Page S15381]]\n\ntransition to more of a clean energy technology.\n  At the beginning of the week, I had the view or the understanding \nthat the disagreement about the tax package centered around the \nquestion of which offsets should be used to pay for it. I thought there \nwas general consensus that we ought to have an extension of these tax \nprovisions but that there was disagreement about how we went about \npaying for them.\n\n  It is clear to me that at least for the administration, it is not a \nquestion of which offsets should be used to pay for it, the real issue, \nfrom their perspective, is they do not consider these tax incentives \nvery important, and they do not believe they are important enough to be \npaid for.\n  They believe if they are going to be extended, they should be \nextended without any increase in revenue anywhere else in the Tax Code \nto offset that. This is a very unfortunate view on the part of the \nadministration as I see it because it sets up a circumstance where, if \nwe are not able to get the votes to pass this tax package as part of \nthe overall energy package this morning, then we are in a circumstance \nwhere the administration says: We will not support--the administration \nwill not support--a tax package that is paid for, and the Congress, \nunder our pay-go rules, most likely will not be able to muster the \nvotes to pass a tax package that is not paid for.\n  So we have a checkmate situation that is particularly bad for the \ncountry and cuts short the effort we tried to begin in 2005 to \nencourage more development of energy from renewable sources and more \nenergy efficiency through these tax provisions.\n  There are some in the Congress, in the Senate, who are going to say, \nwell, they support doing something on taxes but not here, not now. We \nshould not do it as part of this bill. We ought to do what we can. It \nis nearly Christmas, and then we will come back next year and deal with \ntaxes.\n  The problem is, it does not get any easier next year to deal with \nthis situation. We have already made dramatic changes in this tax \npackage to accommodate concerns of the administration, concerns of \nRepublican Members. But the truth is, we need to go ahead and extend \nthese tax provisions as part of this bill. We need to do so in a way \nthat is paid for. Clearly we need to comply with our pay-go rules and \nnot just add this to the deficit and say it is up to the next \ngeneration to worry about finding the revenue to pay for the tax \nprovisions.\n  I believe it is essential that we pass this, that we go ahead and \ninvoke cloture on the energy package. This energy package that Senator \nReid is now bringing before the Senate does not have a renewable \nelectricity standard in it. He dropped that again because of opposition \nfrom Republican members, opposition from the administration.\n  But it does have CAFE improvements, it does have renewable fuels \nstandards, it does have energy efficiency standards, it is does have \nthis tax package. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I too rise in support of the cloture \nmotion this morning and ask my colleagues if we are going to pass the \nEnergy bill before the end of this year. I know the American consumer \nhas gotten a wake-up call because they are paying higher gas prices at \nthe pump. But the question is whether Congress and the White House have \ngotten the same wake-up call.\n  Fortunately, thanks to the hard work of Members on both sides of the \naisle and many staff members we are within grasp of a very important \nsolution. I am not even going to spend my time this morning talking \nabout the important details of this bill because many of my colleagues, \nincluding the chairman of the Energy Committee, has extolled its \nvirtues. Perhaps, if I have a minute at the end, I might elaborate on \nsome of these. But it is time to get to the heart of the matter. And \nthat is, the American people need serious relief from a future of high \noil prices by making a transition this legislation would provide. That \nis we need to make sure we have an energy package that starts investing \nmore aggressively in renewable energy and will actually get us \ncompetition at the gas pump and on our electricity grid.\n  I know some are saying the tax title in this bill must go. And some \nhave even been bold enough to say that it's an increase in taxes. That \nis an interesting position because these are really tax subsidies for \nthe oil industry. They are not a tax increase on consumers. When we \npassed similar tax provisions in the 2005 energy bill no one on the \nother side called that a tax increase.\n  In fact, when the President put broader subsidies in his budget this \nyear, reducing some of the same subsidies, it was called a \nmodification. So do not tell us now that cancelling a subsidy for the \noil industry is somehow raising taxes on consumers. What we are really \ndoing is continuing to make consumers pay more at the gas pump because \nwe are not giving them true competition. At the heart of the matter is \nthe fact that of the energy subsidies and investments that our country \nmakes--that is, using American tax dollars to invest in energy \nstrategies that will help our country--right now 75 percent of them is \ngoing to the fossil fuel industry. Only about 15 percent is going to \nclean energy.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, when the United States only has 3 percent \nof the world's oil reserves, is it smart to continue to have the 75 \npercent investment in fossil fuels? I would say that we should pass \nthis legislation and make more investments in renewable and energy \nefficiency.\n  If someone says that somehow this is going to impact the oil \nindustry, I would like to refer them to a quote from Lee Raymond, the \nformer ExxonMobil CEO who said on ``Fox News'' when asked whether Exxon \nwas taking advantage of the new legislation that became law to speed up \nthe development of refineries and capacity here in the U.S., he said \n``it will not have a major impact.''\n  So I do not know why we are so concerned about keeping these \nsubsidies when the industry itself, the big five oil companies are \nsaying it has had a negligible impact. What it has had an impact on is \nconsumers. And even the Joint Economic Committee has pointed out that \nthe removal of these tax breaks are going to have very little impact on \nconsumers. In fact, another third party observer, the Joint Tax \nCommittee, basically said this $300 million in subsidies from the big \nfive oil companies in 2008 that would be taken away would be less than \n1 percent. In fact, it would have only a one-quarter of 1 percent \nimpact on their profits.\n  That is right. They made $120.8 billion in profit in 2006, so taking \nthis subsidy away from them it will have a negligible impact. So what \nare we holding this up for? Why are we going to hold up the Energy bill \nbecause someone does not want to take more subsidies away from the oil \nindustry and put them toward clean energy?\n  Even President Bush recognized that the oil industry does not need \nmore subsidies. President Bush, in April of 2005, said:\n\n       I will tell you with $55 oil we don't need incentives to \n     oil and gas companies to explore. There are plenty of \n     incentives.\n\n  I couldn't agree with the President more. He said that at $55 a \nbarrel. Now that we are at $90, we need to move faster in changing \nthese incentive programs. We all know that fossil fuels will continue \nto be a big part of the energy mix for decades and that there is a \ngreat deal of economic benefit from the incentives in oil and gas \ntoday. But what we have to realize is we cannot continue in this same \ndirection. We have to change course. We have to level the playing field \nand take away subsidies from very mature, very profitable industries \nand make investments in renewables instead.\n  I know the President also agrees with that because when he signed the \n2005 bill, he said:\n\n       The bill offers new incentives to promote clean, renewable \n     geothermal energy . . . When you hear us talking about less \n     dependence on foreign sources of energy, and one of the ways \n     to become less dependent is to enhance the use of renewable \n     sources of energy.\n\n  Again, I couldn't agree with the President more. But this is about \ngetting a package that will help us give consumers the confidence that \nthey are going to have true competition over the price at the pump.\n  The Energy and Finance Committees had hearing after hearing talking \nto the experts. I know some people on the other side of the aisle would \nsay that\n\n[[Page S15382]]\n\nsome of these tax incentives don't expire until the end of 2008. But \nthis is about giving predictability to energy investment strategies. We \nheard in the Finance Committee testimony after testimony from experts \nsaying: If you want to get more investment in renewable energy, you \nneed to have more predictable energy tax credits. That is why we can \nsee from our failed policies in the past that countries such as Denmark \nhave made more headway, because they made more investment in \nrenewables. Countries such as Japan have made more headway in solar \nenergy because they made the investments. If we want to get beyond \npetroleum, we have to stop subsidizing it.\n  The impact of this morning's vote is that our colleagues are going to \nsay we should take out the Finance package and that somehow will be a \ncompletion of an energy strategy. I tell my colleagues, nothing could \nbe more important than getting the long-term fundamentals right for \ninvestment so that America can get off our dependence on foreign oil.\n  This legislation does represent nearly a 20-percent reduction in our \ncurrent CO2 output and a 35-percent reduction in our foreign \noil dependence. But to get those savings, we not only have to pass \nCAFE, we also have to pass incentives for renewable energy and do it \nfor more than just 1 year so that we have predictable investment in \nthese energy strategies and reap the economic benefits in jobs for \nAmerica.\n  I thank the staff and all Members who have worked so hard on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues not to \nvote for this bill and to insist that we have an energy bill that will \ncreate more energy for our country.\n  The Energy bill before us today for a cloture vote will not increase \nthe supply of energy. There are some good parts of this bill. The House \nand Senate could pass a bill that would do major things for renewable \nenergy sources, for clean energy sources, and for an increase in the \nsupply of energy sources, but the bill that is being brought up today--\nand I hope it will not get cloture--is a bill that will not increase \nsupply.\n  We have two problems we need to address in an energy policy. One is \nthe cost of energy. We need to provide more supply in order to bring \nthe cost down. The second is, we are 60 percent dependent on foreign \nsources for our energy needs, which is an economic and security risk \nfor America.\n  I cannot imagine the Congress trying to continue to pass a bill that \nwill decrease supply and increase our dependence on foreign sources for \nour energy needs. We are the greatest nation on Earth. We should be \naddressing this aggressively to increase supply.\n  The good part of this bill is the CAFE standards which have been \nagreed to in a bipartisan way. That will go a long way toward \nconservation and beginning to make our automobiles more efficient and \nenvironmentally friendly. But the $20 billion in taxes on oil supply \ntakes away the increase in supply that is so important to bring down \nprices.\n  We are a country that ought to be the model for the world in \nstability in oil and tax policy. Instead, our country has the \nreputation for not being stable in tax policy, for changing tax policy \nevery 2 years or every 4 years, so businesses sometimes would rather do \ntheir exploration, their production, their refining, their \nmanufacturing overseas because they know they can count on stability in \ntax policy and regulatory policy. That is absolutely the opposite of \nwhat people should be saying about America. America should be the one \nthat our businesses say they can rely on for stable policy. Yet the \nbill before us will change the incentives we gave for refineries to \nincrease just 2 years after we gave them.\n  It was beginning to work. Big oil companies that had not invested in \nrefinery capacity for 20 years, because of the regulatory hurdles, were \nwilling to go in and have already announced expansions. I know a big \nexpansion would be going on in Mississippi, a big one in Texas that \nwould add to our refinery capacity so that we would have more supply \nmore cheaply. We would have more dependence on ourselves for our energy \nneeds, and we would bring prices down. This takes away those incentives \nfor refinery capacity to increase. It also will drive overseas the \nproduction of oil because we are penalizing our oil companies with this \n$20 billion in taxes.\n  What this will do is decrease supply and increase price. I cannot \nthink of a worse message to send and a worse tax policy that would say \nto the world and to any business that wants to do business in our \ncountry that you can count on tax policy for a year or two, but you \ncannot make long-term plans in America because we may change policy if \nwe change Congress.\n  We have changed Congress, all right. What we are seeing is a tax-and-\nspend Congress that we haven't seen in 15 years. Once again, we are \ngoing to increase spending and we are going to increase taxes. That is \nnot what we should be doing in an environment in which our economy is \nfragile. Raising taxes in this economy is going to increase the price \nof energy, which has a ripple effect throughout our economy. It means \nevery farmer is going to have to pay more for fuel. It means every \nbusinessperson, especially small businesspeople, is going to have to \npay more for fuel.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this piece of legislation that the \nPresident has said he will veto. Let's stop the games in Congress. \nLet's do something that will help our energy supply, that will bring \nprices down. Let's take the good parts of this bill, such as the CAFE \nstandards and the incentives for renewable energy and clean energy. All \nof those things are very good.\n  I want clean energy. I want solar power. I want wind power. I want \nbiofuels. I want cellulosic ethanol and corn-based ethanol. But to take \none segment of our energy, which happens to be the biggest source \ntoday, and increase the price on that, decrease the incentives for the \nrefinery capacity which we must have--these companies do not have to \ninvest and go through all of the regulatory procedures and millions of \ndollars off their bottom line to go into refinery expansions. They \ndon't have to do it. They had tax incentives to do it 2 years ago. \nTaking that away pulls the rug out from under those who have already \nmade those investments. It is counterproductive for the economy.\n  I hope we will provide adult leadership in the Congress. Let's not \npass cloture on this bill. Let's do an energy bill that the President \nwill sign, that will have bipartisan support, that will make CAFE \nstandards much more environmentally friendly, and that will increase \nour supply of renewable and environmentally friendly energy needs. \nLet's keep the bread-and-butter energy supply we have by increasing \nrefinery capacity so that we bring the cost down to consumers and keep \nour economy on a more even keel.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote no today so we can pass an energy bill \nthat will have the support of a bipartisan majority in Congress and get \nthe President's signature. That should be the goal, not political game-\nplaying, which we are seeing this week at the very last minute in \nCongress. It is not going to do what is right for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 11 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are there any other commitments to speak on this?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't need the entire time, but I will speak a while \nand see what happens.\n  I am here because there is a misunderstanding somewhere about the \nCAFE bill that is coming before us. We all acknowledge the CAFE \nstandards bill that is before us is long overdue. We all understand \nthat it is very good legislation. We all understand that the cellulosic \nprovisions--the postcorn ethanol--are very important. It is here, \nalthough it has some problems. The President finds some problems with \nit. So do many on our side find problems with it. But it is in here.\n  But the issue is not whether that is a good package. The issue is \nwhat is going to happen if we decide we are going to pass this bill \nwith the taxes that are in it as it sits before us at the\n\n[[Page S15383]]\n\ndesk, $21 billion worth of taxes. What is going to happen to the bill \nif we pass it with those taxes in? It is very simple: It is going to \nget vetoed. We have heard it. The President has said it. The only thing \nwe could do would be to get a tape recorder and ask him to say it and \nbring that down here and make it legal and let him tell us. He has said \nhe doesn't want those taxes on this bill.\n  We still have people voting for this, as I talked to them, because \nthey want this bill. They say it is great; it is a wonderful bill. I \nask you, how are you going to get a bill if you leave the taxes on and \nsend it to the President when he has already told you in advance he was \ngoing to veto it? What we should do is, if you want the bill, produce a \nbill the President will sign.\n  We have already taken one giant step. We took out the mandatory wind \nfor electricity production. A percentage was mandated, and we took that \nout. Now, today, the issue is, Are we going to take out the taxes? That \nis the vote when we come to a vote on the Energy bill.\n  Some people think that is a nice vote; I like the taxes; I am going \nto vote for them. But the point is, you are not going to get the taxes \nand you are going to lose with it the energy portion of the bill \nbecause the President is going to veto it. I can't answer any more than \nto repeat what he has said. I am not his spokesman on the floor; I am \nmerely repeating what has come up Pennsylvania Avenue from down there \nwhere he lives and up here where we work. He has said: If the taxes are \nin, the bill is gone. So it looks to me as if those who want a winner \nought to vote to take the taxes.\n  Those who want a loser ought to vote to leave the taxes in and they \nwill get their wish. But they will not only lose the taxes--which some \nsay: They are pretty good; I like them--they will lose the entire \nEnergy bill on CAFE and cellulosic, which follows right after ethanol \nand is desperately needed to buttress the ethanol market, as my friend \nwho spoke eloquently for her side of this bill knows.\n  We need the bill on cellulosic. I call it ethanol 2 for simplicity. \nWe need it because we need to get that ethanol market stabilized a \nlittle better and come in with a second kind of product instead of just \ncorn. But we are not going to get that, so the wishers are not going to \nget their wishes, if they vote for the taxes, even if they say: I have \nlooked at them, and I love them. Lots of people love taxes. Some have \nlooked at this $21 billion or $20-plus billion and said: We love them. \nThey are great. They are incentives. They are the right thing.\n  But, look, the point is, this is not the bill you are going to get \nthem on. You are not going to get the taxes on a bill that is \nessentially an energy bill. Send the President an energy bill. Send the \nPresident an energy bill and look around for another time when we could \nsend him the tax bill.\n  I still talk to Senators--some yesterday--and they say: Well, I think \nthe taxes belong in. And I ask them: How do you think we are going to \nget the CAFE standards, which you certainly would acknowledge is one of \nthe most important energy measures we could do? ``Well, we will just \nvote for it.'' No, we won't. The President is going to veto it if the \ntaxes that you like so much are in it.\n  So why don't we take the taxes off and send the President a clean \nbill with CAFE, cellulosic, and a couple other things? It would then be \nan energy bill which he would want and he would sign, and instead of a \nveto, we would have a victory party. That would be good, it seems to \nme.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 5\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nmajority has 6 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nprior to the cloture vote, each leader be permitted to use leader time, \nwith the majority leader speaking last.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, if I could respond to a couple of things \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle said because this is an \nimportant debate. If there are people who want to continue to debate \nthe farm proposal we are going to be voting on this morning, I will be \nhappy to yield the floor. But not seeing that, I am happy to continue \nthe discussion on the Energy bill.\n  Both Senators from New Mexico have played an incredible leadership \nrole in energy, and the 2005 Energy bill was a bipartisan effort. I \ncertainly know what it is like to take half a loaf. That was not the \nbill I would have written myself, but I voted for that legislation. I \nthink it started us on a course of making investments in renewable \nenergy technology that was beneficial.\n  In particular I happen to disagree that the 2005 tax provisions, as \nthey related to more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, have been \na big benefit for us. We even had an executive of an oil company say \nthey did not think they were going to have much impact. So now \nconsumers in my State are paying over $3 at the pump, and home heating \noil prices are up 35 percent. So I do not think those subsidies to the \noil industry have had any kind of magnificent impact that my colleague \nfrom Texas was saying.\n  What we do know is the investment we started in the 2005 bill in \nrenewable energy is having an incredible impact. The question is \nwhether we are going to give predictability to that industry. I would \nhate to think this is a vote--whether it is on this bill or any future \nbill; and this Senator would certainly take these provisions and put \nthem on lots of different vehicles. It does not have to always be in \nthis precise fashion--but the fact is, this bill and these tax \nincentives will generate over 50,000 megawatts of new, clean energy \nsupply and efficiencies. That is right, it does create new generation.\n  Mr. President, 50,000 megawatts, in case anybody wants to know, is \nthe same amount of electricity that is used in 26 States today. So the \nquestion is whether we are going to have a 1-year extension--that is, \nuntil 2008--for renewable energy, or whether we are going to give them \n2, 3, 4 years of predictability so we can get that generation, as I \nsaid, that will produce enough electricity for 26 States out of \nrenewable and efficiency generation, instead of continuing to use those \ntax subsidies for the oil industry that, even by their own account, \nthey say are not having a significant impact.\n  So I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I \nhave heard what the President has said. We have heard all along that he \nthinks these particular provisions are raising revenues on one \nindustry. The President included in his own budget a broader reduction \nin the subsidies that we had previously passed, and nowhere did he call \nthat raising revenue. So by his own account, it is hypocrisy to now \nstart claiming these are somehow different.\n  What we need is to pass this Energy bill. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion on many of the provisions \nthat are in this legislation that will diversify us off of fossil fuel \nand get us into renewables and biofuels, so we can lower the price at \nthe pump for consumers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business at this time?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3695, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is debating the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 2 minutes 25 seconds, and \nthe opponents have 5 minutes 29 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, would you like a \ncouple minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me understand, we are debating my \namendment, and I have 2 minutes left on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, somebody spoke off \nyour amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand. About energy?\n\n[[Page S15384]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. About energy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take the time that remains on our \nside, at least.\n  We have a 9:15 vote, and the vote is a vote on determining whether we \nare going to continue to do business the way we have always done \nbusiness on these issues or whether we are going to vote for some \nchange here and some reform.\n  This amendment is very simple. It provides some payment limitations \nwith respect to the farm bill. It says those people who have never \nfarmed and are never going to farm, living on land that has not \nproduced a crop for 20 years, should not be getting farm program \npayments. But they are today, and they will under the bill that is here \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I support the bill on the floor of the Senate, but I want to improve \nit by amending it with these payment limitations. My colleague, Senator \nGrassley, joins me. My colleague, Senator Nelson from Nebraska, joins \nme, and others.\n  This issue is some payment limitations. We are supposed to provide a \nfarm program that helps family farmers during tough periods. This farm \nprogram has become a set of golden arches for some of the biggest \ncorporate farms in this country. Millions of dollars are being sucked \nout of this farm program in large payments for large corporate \nagrifactories. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, as I have indicated, we have farm program payments going to \npeople who have never farmed and never will farm. Mr. President, in the \nlast 5 years, $1.3 billion went from this country's Treasury in farm \nprogram payments to people who are not farming. Think of that: $1.3 \nbillion.\n  Do you think there might have been a better use for that? Do you \nthink maybe if we recovered that $1.3 billion we could provide a better \nsafety net for family farmers when they run into a tough patch or a \ntough spell? In my judgment, the answer is yes, we could do much \nbetter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask my colleague from New Mexico if \nhe is intending to use the remaining time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes 21 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was, I say to the Senator, but I will \nbe glad to give you a couple minutes. Go ahead and take a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I virtually said what I intended to say. \nIf my colleague from New Mexico wishes to speak about the Energy bill, \nthere has been a lot of work on an energy bill which is very important. \nThere has not been much debate or discussion about it. I do not object \nto continuing that discussion.\n  But I do want to say this 9:15 vote is very important. It is about \nchange and reform. It is about doing the right thing for family \nfarmers. I hope the Dorgan-Grassley-Nelson amendment will be supported \nand that we will finally say to the American people: Yes, we are about \nchange. We are about reform. We are about doing things right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time \nI have.\n  I want to start over again to make sure everybody understands what I \nhave to say. Sometimes the most simple thing is the most difficult to \nexplain.\n  This is a very simple proposition. We have put in a bill--the Energy \nbill--the work of two or three committees. It is not all an Energy \nCommittee bill. The lead pony in the bill is an important provision \nwith reference to the mileage on automobiles, and we have, for the \nfirst time in more than two decades, changed that in this bill.\n  We have an ethanol 2, which is cellulosic, which follows on right \nbehind ethanol to make sure ethanol is stabilized and we get a huge \nproduct in years to come to take the place of oil-based petroleum.\n  Those were in a bill, and they were working their way through, and \nthe decision was made: Well, we will put on that some taxes. They put \non $21 billion in taxes and another item that was long passed--we will \nleave it alone--and all of a sudden the President of the United States \nsaid: Well, don't send me that bill. I will veto it.\n  Now, I am one who happens to believe him. Since I believe him, I \nthink what we ought to do is see what we can do to make it most \nprobable we will get these two energy provisions that we need--the ones \nI have just alluded to for the third time today.\n  It would appear to me what we ought to do to get those energy \nprovisions, to most probably get them--you never know until the \nPresident signs; and this still has to go one time to the House--but it \nappears to me rather simple. The way to do that is to take out the \ntaxes the President does not want.\n  They may be good incentives. They may be good taxes on bad people--\nwhatever it is Senators have to say--but they are bad taxes for those \nwho want this Energy bill. They are bad taxes for anyone who wants \nthese two new provisions of the Energy bill, bad because the President \nwill veto them and we will get nothing.\n  So I urge that you vote today against cloture so we will have this \nbill before us, and we know, then, the majority leader will do \nsomething to see that we get a bill. He will have some time to work on \nwhat kind of language he wants to send to the House. It is very limited \nwith amendments because this is not a very ordinary way the House sent \nus this bill. They sent us this as a message on one of their bills, and \nthat is very unique.\n  Nonetheless, let's not get into that.\n  It is simple today: Do you want an energy bill? If you want an energy \nbill, then don't vote for cloture so taxes can be taken out of this \nbill, and then all you have to do is send it to the House after you fix \nit up, if you would like to, if the majority leader wants to repair it, \nbecause it needs some repair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So there we go. I thank the Senate for listening. I \nthink it is a pretty simple proposition and I hope everybody \nunderstands. If they want this bill, they ought to know how to vote. \nThank you.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Dorgan-Grassley \namendment No. 3695, of which I am a cosponsor, to enact commonsense, \nmeaningful farm program payment limitations. My bipartisan colleagues \nfrom North Dakota and Iowa and I have offered a straightforward and \nfiscally responsible proposal that would target our farm program \npayments and safety net.\n  The current farm program payment structure has, quite simply, failed \nrural America. Approximately 71 percent of our farm benefits are \nabsorbed by only 10 percent of the farming community. Our omnibus farm \nbill is intended to promote programs that function as a safety net for \nfarmers, in contrast to the cash cow they've become for a few \nproducers. I do not favor eliminating our farm program benefits, but \nrather prefer that they are targeted to small- and medium-sized \nproducers instead of large agribusiness.\n  According to farming data from the 2002 census, farms in South Dakota \nthat received program payments collected $16,518 on average. The \naverage producer in my State, then, received under $17,000 in benefits, \nwhich pales in comparison to the $360,000 current supposed ``limit'' \nand does not touch the proposed $250,000 hard payment cap.\n  The Dorgan-Grassley amendment includes several specific limits. Under \nthis amendment, direct payments could not exceed $20,000 per producer; \ncountercyclical payments are capped at $30,000; marketing loan gains \nare limited to $75,000; and total payments are restricted to $125,000. \nThe amendment would allow for doubling by a spouse, and also require \ndirect attribution. The amendment closes the triple entity loophole \nthat has opened up an avenue of opportunity for excessive payments.\n  In 2002, the Senate saw a strong vote in favor of payment limitations \nwith 66 Senators voting in favor of a $275,000 cap for farm program \npayments. We need 60 votes this morning to pass the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment, because of the filibustering that has been threatened by the \nminority party, and\n\n[[Page S15385]]\n\nwe are working to achieve that goal. That being said, in a time of \nbudgetary constraints, I find it unconscionable that a Member of \nCongress would not vote to restrict such egregious spending and vote to \npromote our rural communities. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first I want to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin and the \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nfor their leadership during the debate of this farm bill.\n  I commend them for their response to the needs and interests of our \nNation's farmers and ranchers. In my State, most of our farmers are \ndeeply concerned about the amendment offered by Senator Grassley and \nSenator Dorgan. If it is approved it will adversely affect family farms \nin many States by eliminating the ability to receive financing and \nmaking it harder for farmers from efficiently marketing their crop.\n  Since the passage of the 2002 farm bill there has been a good bit of \ncontroversy surrounding the issue of payment limits. Much of this has \nbeen based on misinformation and is a result of misunderstanding of \nmodern agricultural practices. While I am pleased that the legislation \npassed by the committee contains significant reforms to address the \nconcerns raised over the past 6 years, these reforms are not easy for \nproducers in my State of Mississippi to accept and will result in many \nfarms having to significantly alter their farming operation.\n  I believe it is important for us to understand just how significant \nthe reforms in the committee passed bill are. This legislation applies \ndirect attribution to the individual farmer, thus making all farm \npayments transparent. The committee passed legislation would limit the \ndirect payment a single producer can receive to $40,000. The \nlegislation reduces the amount of a countercyclical payment to $60,000. \nIn addition, the Senate language reduces the adjusted gross income \nmeans test for producers from $2.5 million to $750,000. While this may \nstill sound like a lot of money, when you consider production costs \nsuch as a four-hundred thousand dollar cotton picker, fuel prices, \nfertilizer costs, and technology fees for seed, these support levels \nare quite low.\n  Many crops of the Midwest are enjoying record prices right now due \nmostly to the use of corn in the current ethanol boom. The most \nprevalent crops in the South, cotton and rice, are not seeing the \nrecord prices created by renewable fuel incentives and tax credit \nsubsidies; and it is important to point out that none of these \nsubsidies are subject to an arbitrary limit.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would have a very negative impact on \nthe livelihood of thousands of farmers. It would undo what many farmers \ntoday and generations before them have established through hard work, \nsurviving natural disasters, and the Great Depression. This amendment \nis an attempt to make farmers in my State to conform to the way others \noperate in very different regions of the country. Mr. President, not \nevery farmer should be made to fit in the same mold. I urge the Senate \nto reject the Grassley-Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 3695, the Dorgan-\nGrassley payment limit amendment.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is a \nunanimous consent order in the Senate that prior to the next vote, \nSenator McConnell and I would be recognized; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.

Mr. President, I support this bill and, in particular, the \nprovisions that require the Department of Transportation, through the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, to set new fuel \neconomy standards for vehicles that will reach an industry fleet wide \nlevel of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 based on my understanding that \nthese new Federal standards will not be undercut in the future by \nregulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency regulating \ngreenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.\n  I believe that we have taken historic steps in this legislation by \nputting in place ambitious but achievable fuel economy standards that \nwill reduce our Nation's fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. \nIn this legislation, the Senate and House have come together and \nestablished the appropriate level of fuel economy standards and have \ndirected NHTSA to implement that through new regulations. In this \nlegislation, the Congress has agreed that the appropriate level of fuel \neconomy to reach is 35 miles per gallon in 2020, or an increase of 10 \nmiles per gallon in 10 years.\n  But it is essential to manufacturers that they are able to plan on \nthe 35 miles per gallon standard in 2020. We must resolve now with the \nsponsors of this legislation in the Senate any ambiguity that could \narise in the future when EPA issues new rules to regulate greenhouse \ngas emissions from vehicles pursuant to its authority under the Clean \nAir Act so that our manufacturers can have certainty. With that in \nmind, I want to clarify both Senator Inouye's and Senator Feinstein's \nunderstanding and interpretation of what the Congress is doing in this \nlegislation and to clarify their agreement that we want all Federal \nregulations in this area to be consistent. We do not want to enact this \nlegislation today only to find later that we have not been sufficiently \ndiligent to avoid any conflicts in the future.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has authority under the Clean Air \nAct to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and to delegate \nthat authority, as the agency deems appropriate, to the State of \nCalifornia. This authority was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and it is not our purpose today to attempt to change that \nauthority or to undercut\n\n[[Page S15386]]\n\nthe decision of the Supreme Court. We simply want to make clear that it \nis Congressional intent in this bill that, with respect to regulation \nof greenhouse gas emissions, any future regulations issued by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom vehicles be consistent with the Department of Transportation's new \nfuel economy regulations that will reach an industry fleet wide level \nby 35 miles per gallon by 2020.\n  Does the Senator from California and original sponsor of this \nlegislation, Mrs. Feinstein, agree with my view that the intent of this \nlanguage is for EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from \nvehicles to be consistent with the direction of Congress in this 35 \nmiles per gallon in 2020 legislation and consistent with regulations \nissued by the Department of Transportation to implement this \nlegislation?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, of course, we have worked hard to come together \non this legislation directing NHTSA to issue new fuel economy \nregulations to reach an industry fleet wide level of 35 miles per \ngallon by 2020, and it is our intent in the bill before us that all \nFederal regulations in this area be consistent with our 35 miles per \ngallon in 2020 language.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for her clarification of her intent.\n  Does the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, agree with my understanding of the \nintent of this bill that any regulations issued by the Environmental \nProtection Agency be consistent with the direction of Congress in this \nlegislation and regulations issued by the Department of Transportation \nto implement this legislation?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes. I. I agree that it is very important that all \nFederal regulations in this area be consistent and that we provide \nclear direction to the agency that has responsibility for setting fuel \neconomy standards, the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my distinguished colleague from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, for his clarification.\n\n\n                           agency management\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have worked for many months with the \nSenior Senator from California and the original sponsor of this \nlegislation, Mrs. Feinstein, to draft a sound policy to increase fuel \neconomy standards in our country. I stated earlier today that ``all \nFederal regulations in this area be consistent.'' I wholly agree with \nthat notion, in that these agencies have two different missions. The \nDepartment of Transportation has the responsibility for regulating fuel \neconomy, and should enforce the Ten-in Ten Fuel Economy Act fully and \nvigorously to save oil in the automobile fleet. The Environmental \nProtection Agency has the responsibility to protect public health. \nThese two missions can and should co-exist without one undermining the \nother. There are numerous examples in the executive branch where two or \nmore agencies share responsibility over a particular issue. The Federal \nTrade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission both oversee \ntelemarketing practices and the Do-Not-Call list.\n  The FTC also shares jurisdiction over antitrust enforcement with the \nDepartment of Justice. Under the current CAFE system, the Department of \nTransportation and the Environmental Protection Agency work together. \nDOT enforces the CAFE standards, and the EPA tests vehicles for \ncompliance and fuel economy labels on cars. The President himself \nforesaw these agencies working together and issued an Executive Order \non May 14, 2007, to coordinate the agencies on reducing automotive \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The DOT and the EPA have separate missions \nthat should be executed fully and responsibly. I believe it is \nimportant that we ensure that the agencies are properly managed by the \nexecutive branch, as has been done with several agencies with shared \njurisdiction for decades. I plan on holding hearings next session to \nexamine this issue fully.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to thank the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, and I would like to clarify what I believe to be the intent \nof the legislation I sponsored to increase fuel economy standards in \nthe United States.\n  The legislation increasing the fuel economy standards of vehicles by \n10 miles per gallon over 10 years does not impact the authority to \nregulate tailpipe emissions of the EPA, California, or other States, \nunder the Clean Air Act.\n  The intent was to give NHTSA the ability to regulate fuel efficiency \nstandards of vehicles, and increase the fleetwide average to at least \n35 miles per gallon by 2020.\n  There was no intent in any way, shape, or form to negatively affect, \nor otherwise restrain, California or any other State's existing or \nfuture tailpipe emissions laws, or any future EPA authority on tailpipe \nemissions.\n  The two issues are separate and distinct.\n  As the Supreme Court correctly observed in Massachusetts v. EPA, the \nfact ``that DOT sets mileage standards in no way licenses EPA to shirk \nits environmental responsibilities. EPA has been charged with \nprotecting the public's health and welfare, a statutory obligation \nwholly independent of DOT's mandate to promote energy efficiency. The \ntwo obligations may overlap, but there is no reason to think the two \nagencies cannot both administer their obligations and yet avoid \ninconsistency.''\n  I agree with the Supreme Court's view of consistency. There is no \nreason to think the two agencies cannot both administer their \nobligations and yet avoid inconsistency.\n  The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California in \nCentral Valley Chrysler-Jeep v. Goldstone has reiterated this point in \nfinding that if approved by EPA, California's standards are not \npreempted by the Energy Policy Conservation Act.\n  Title I of the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007, H.R. 6, \nprovides clear direction to the Department of Transportation, in \nconsultation with the Department of Energy and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, to raise fuel economy standards.\n  By taking this action, Congress is continuing DOT's existing \nauthority to set vehicle fuel economy standards. Importantly, the \nseparate authority and responsibility of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions under \nthe Clean Air Act is in no manner affected by this legislation as \nplainly provided for in section 3 of the bill addressing the \nrelationship of H.R. 6 to other laws.\n  I fought for section 3. I have resisted all efforts to add \nlegislative language requiring ``harmonization'' of these EPA and NHTSA \nstandards. This language could have required that EPA standards adopted \nunder section 202 of the Clean Air Act reduce only the air pollution \nemissions that would already result from NHTSA fuel economy standards, \neffectively making the NHTSA fuel economy standards a national ceiling \nfor the reduction of pollution. Our legislation does not establish a \nNHTSA ceiling. It does not mention the Clean Air Act, so we certainly \ndo not intend to strip EPA of its wholly separate mandate to protect \nthe public health and welfare from air pollution.\n  To be clear, Federal standards can avoid inconsistency according to \nthe Supreme Court, while still fulfilling their separate mandates.\n\n\n                             Energy Savings\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk to the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee about energy savings in Federal \nbuildings in H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.\n  Along with Senators Feingold, Burr, and Corker, I offered an \namendment to H.R. 6 that would require the Federal Government to \nprocure the most energy-efficient commercial water heating systems in \nnew or renovated Federal buildings. This language was not incorporated \ninto the final version of the legislation we will be voting on today.\n  I would ask Chairman Bingaman if the energy savings in the Federal \nbuilding sections of H.R. 6 apply to all building systems and \ntechnologies, not just lighting?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for his question. The Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007 requires Federal agencies to \nreduce their energy consumption by 30 percent by 2015 and includes \nprovisions requiring new and renovated buildings to adopt energy \nefficient systems and technologies in\n\n[[Page S15387]]\n\norder to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Federal leadership in building \nperformance and procurement standards in our Federal facilities and in \ncommercial buildings generally is critically important in achieving our \nenergy conservation goals. The energy savings requirements for our \nNation's Federal facilities incorporated in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007 are intended to apply to all building systems and \ntechnologies.\n  Mr KOHL. I would like to thank the chairman for all of his help on \nthis issue. Chairman Bingaman's leadership on energy efficiency and \nthis Energy bill has been invaluable.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, they say that ADM William ``Bull'' Halsey, \nwho commanded the Pacific Fleet in World War II, once said:\n\n       There aren't any great men. There are just great challenges \n     that ordinary men like you and me are forced by circumstances \n     to meet.\n\n  Today, the circumstances around energy policy provide us another set \nof challenges. Today, we will see whether we can rise to meet them.\n  Prices for gasoline, heating oil, electricity, and natural gas have \naccelerated upward. Since the Senate last considered energy tax \nlegislation in June, oil prices have soared by $30 a barrel. Energy \ncosts have hit working families particularly hard.\n  Nearly every week, the news reminds us of the fragility of our energy \nsupply, whether it is trouble in South America or Africa or in the \nMiddle East.\n  As well, people have increasingly acknowledged the challenge \npresented by the link between energy use and global warming.\n  To help address these challenges, I am pleased that the Senate will \nvote today on energy tax incentives designed to promote clean and \nsustainable energy.\n  Energy tax policy is not new territory for the Finance Committee. In \n2005, the committee designed tax incentives for that year's major \nEnergy bill. And last December, we enacted energy tax provisions as \npart of the end-of-the-year package.\n  We are building on that strong foundation today with additional tax \nincentives. Most of those incentives were approved by a 19 to 5 vote in \nthe Finance Committee this past June.\n  We did not get 60 votes on the Senate floor in June. But the energy \ncrisis has not subsided. And so we are back here today with an even \nstronger package of energy tax incentives.\n  The energy tax proposal before us today continues our commitment to \nclean energy and renewable fuels. The amendment extends existing tax \nincentives for solar power, wind power, fuel cells, and energy-\nefficient homes and buildings. And we provide more than $2 billion for \nrenewable energy bonds.\n  But we need to go further. And we do in this proposal. We advance \nthree areas critical to our nation's energy future: cellulosic ethanol, \nhybrid cars, and coal sequestration.\n  Ethanol made from corn has become familiar territory. Now cellulosic \nethanol is the new frontier to explore. This bill proposes a production \ntax credit of up to $1.00 a gallon for up to 60 million gallons of \ncellulosic fuel produced from sawgrass, agricultural wastes, and other \nbiomass.\n  Hybrid cars provide a tremendous opportunity to make our \ntransportation sector cleaner. A high-mileage car with no emissions is \nterritory well worth exploring. Our proposal calls for a new $3,500 \ncredit for plug-in vehicles.\n  America has vast reserves of coal. But we have concerns about global \nwarming. It is thus imperative that when we use our coal, we need to \ntry to prevent carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere.\n  Our proposal would provide tax credits for capturing carbon dioxide \nemitted from industrial use of coal. The proposal also would provide \naccelerated depreciation for new dedicated pipelines used to transport \nCO2 from an industrial source to a geologic formation for \npermanent disposal. A proposal to encourage the construction of \nadditional refinery capacity is also included.\n  We do our work in a fiscally responsible way. Lower budget deficits \nhelp to keep interest rates low. That helps to make the economy more \ncompetitive. Paying as we go may be a tough task. But the proposal \ncontains offsets that are fair and economically sound.\n  We propose to simplify and improve the tax code by eliminating the \ndistinction between ``foreign oil and gas extraction income'' and \n``foreign oil-related income.''\n  We propose to withdraw the tax breaks under section 199 from the \nlarge oil companies. There is strong evidence that the boost from \nsection 199 that the Senate envisioned when we enacted the JOBS Act in \n2004 has not been realized.\n  We have heard from the major oil companies. But the majors collected \nover a half a trillion dollars in profits since 2001, and they are on \ntrack to collect up to a trillion dollars in profits over the next 10 \nyears. The Joint Economic Committee has assured us that these \nprovisions will have no affect on consumer prices for gasoline and \nnatural gas in the immediate future.\n  The proposal before us today drops a severance tax on the production \nof crude oil and natural gas from the Outer Continental Shelf in the \nGulf of Mexico. That severance tax was contained in the Senate Finance \nCommittee-passed bill but is not in the proposal on which we will vote \ntoday.\n  Here is the territory that we are in: Gas prices are well over $3. \nThe price of a barrel of oil is hovering around $90 a barrel. And \nconcern about global warming is growing.\n  If we do not move forward today, Americans will look back and ask who \nblocked energy legislation. And they will be astonished. They are not \ngoing to understand how good policy designed to address one of the \ngreatest challenges facing our country--some call it a crisis--was \nblocked by good Senators in December of 2007.\n  The proposal before us today will address the challenge. It addresses \ntoday's energy policy circumstances. So I urge my colleagues to meet \nthe challenge and vote in favor of this sound energy package.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to give my \nreasons for my vote against invoking cloture on H.R. 6, the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007 which was sent to the Senate from \nthe House of Representatives on December 6, 2007. It is regrettable \nthat certain tactics and maneuvers prevented a formal conference and \nthere was no accommodation for removal of controversial tax provisions \nwhich further complicated the negotiations. I am voting against cloture \non energy bill, although I support many of the bill's provisions, \nbecause key commitments to at least one of my Republican colleagues \nwere reportedly broken. Further, I understand the bill in its present \nform would likely draw a veto from the President.\n  I would have preferred a conference report which did not include \ntaxes on the oil and gas industries. Had there been a formal \nconference, those taxes might well have been left out of the conference \nreport. It has been reported that the oil and gas industries took steps \nto oppose convening a conference. If so, they bear some responsibility \nfor the inclusion of the taxes which might have been eliminated had \nthere been a conference.\n  This past summer, I supported the Senate-passed Energy bill, H.R. 6, \nwhich would have promoted oil savings by increasing our national \naverage vehicle fuel economy; alleviated dependence on imported oil by \nincreasing requirements for the use of biofuels and advanced biofuels; \nadvanced the prospects for cleanly utilizing our Nation's abundant coal \nreserves by furthering research, development and demonstration of \ncarbon capture and sequestration technology; and supported a reduction \nin our demand for energy by creating new efficiency benchmarks for \nappliances and authorizing research and development grants for more \nefficient building materials, processes and vehicle technology.\n  Furthermore, though the Senate did not include a minimum requirement \nfor the amount of electricity generated by renewable sources, I support \nsuch a measure as I have done in the past. On June 14, 2007, the Senate \nvoted 56-39 to table an amendment that would have replaced a 15 percent \nby 2020 renewable energy standard with 20 percent by 2020 using \nalternative sources including coal and nuclear energy. This amendment \nwas viewed as undermining a ``renewable'' standard, therefore I opposed \nthe amendment. I am proud that Pennsylvania is leading the way in \nrenewable energy use and development through its Advanced Energy \nPortfolio\n\n[[Page S15388]]\n\nStandard which requires that 18 percent of electricity in the \nCommonwealth be generated from clean and renewable sources by 2020.\n  While it would have been preferable for the House and Senate to have \nbeen able to work in a bicameral, bipartisan manner to produce \nlegislation that includes both stronger automobile efficiency and a \nrenewable portfolio standard, that clearly did not happen in this \ninstance. Therefore, I face a choice between procedural matters I \ndislike and policies I support. Many of my colleagues and I will oppose \nthis bill based on the process used by the majority and the inclusion \nof controversial tax offset provisions. Had there been an opportunity \nfor the two Houses and the two parties to come together, as is the \ncommon practice in Congress, to craft this important legislation \ngoverning our Nation's energy production and use, I am confident we \ncould have come to consensus on these issues and I still believe this \nto be the case.\n  This Nation has many challenges meeting today's energy needs, with \nthe price of oil at $100 per barrel, OPEC manipulating the oil markets, \nand concerns related to the environment including climate change, all \nof which will be directly addressed by this bill's provisions. Too \noften in this Congress, we are faced with questionable procedures which \nhave led to this situation of rancor and breakdown of the bicameral \nprocess. I urge the leaders of both parties and chambers to work \ntogether to improve this regrettable legislative environment and \nproduce a bipartisan Energy bill.\n  Considering the current veto threat over the bill, it is my hope that \nafter this difficult vote we can amicably move forward to work with our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives and the President to enact \nthese policy measures which are important for the energy future of the \nUnited States.\n  As I stated in my introduction, I am troubled by reports from a \nRepublican colleague that the legislation sent over by the House \nbreached key commitments. It is difficult to know exactly what \ncommitments were made, which were kept, and which may have been broken \nin multiple conversations with many parties. Therefore, in the interest \nof comity and improving the legislative process, I feel constrained to \ncast my vote against moving to this Energy bill, despite provisions I \nsupport.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the clock is about to run on the 2007 \ncongressional calendar. Our Democratic colleagues are about to show us \nonce again how we can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, all \nbecause they insist on raising taxes.\n  This time, the majority was on the verge of a real achievement with a \nbill that would increase the fuel efficiency standard for the first \ntime in years, increase our use of clean, renewable fuels. They had a \nmajor accomplishment in their grasp, so why not take ``yes'' for an \nanswer?\n  Unfortunately, as on so many bills, they simply could not bring \nthemselves to take the accomplishment without inserting an enormous tax \nhike--a tax hike that they knew would doom this legislation, that they \nknew would never be signed into law.\n  There should be absolutely no question about who or what is \nresponsible for the failure of this bill. We have been very clear that \nthe twin millstones of the utility rate increases--the RPS provision \nand the massive tax hikes--would sink the bill. There was no ambiguity \nabout it whatsoever. The majority had a week to remove them, and they \ntook a good step this week when they agreed to remove one of the \nmillstones but, inexplicably, they made the other milestone--the tax \nhike--even bigger. If the twin milestones were removed, this important \nbill would pass Congress this week--would pass the Senate in 2 days--\nand be signed into law.\n  By voting for this bill as written, it is a vote for a bill that will \nnot become law. Voting for this bill as written is a vote for a bill \nthat will not become law. Worse than that, it is a vote to block the \nrest of the Energy bill. It is a vote to block historic increases in \nfuel economy and an increase in renewable fuels.\n  The majority seems determined to accomplish little this year, and \nthey have helped ensure that with this bill. I believe it is time to \nquit playing games, get serious, and get rid of the veto bait so this \nlegislation can become law.\n  Make no mistake, if cloture is invoked with this massive tax hike \nstill attached, it will have killed this bill. The majority will have \ntraded an accomplishment for a tax hike and a veto.\n  I strongly urge a vote against this $22 billion tax hike by opposing \ncloture, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my dear friend, the senior Senator from New \nMexico, long time chair of the Budget Committee, long time chair of the \nEnergy Committee--and I underline and underscore ``my friend''--said a \nfew minutes ago this bill was bad because President Bush doesn't want \ncertain provisions in it, bad because President Bush doesn't want them.\n  We are the Congress of the United States. We can like things even \nthough the President may not like them. That is our responsibility \nconstitutionally. It is time for this Senate to vote as a third and \nequal branch of Government and do the right thing for one of the most \npressing problems facing America and the world today--energy. ``Bad \nbecause the President doesn't want them.'' That is a direct quote.\n  Without going into all the details, the fact that the President made \nthe worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the country by \nhaving Iraq invaded doesn't mean it is good.\n  The fact that the President vetoed children's health insurance, \ngiving insurance to 10 million children instead of the 4.5 million \nchildren, if we are fortunate enough to extend the bill, doesn't make \nit good because the President doesn't like it.\n  Global warming, the President doesn't believe it exists and has \nrefused to even acknowledge the words until a few days ago. Does that \nmake it right? No, it doesn't.\n  The President believes in certain interrogation techniques involving \ntorture. Does that make them right? No.\n  We, as a Congress, have to stand up and do what we think is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. REID. It is time to stop talking and putting America on a path to \na cleaner, safer, and more affordable energy future. The Energy bill \noriginally passed both the House and Senate with strong bipartisan \nmajorities. Democrats and some Republicans agree we must pass this \nEnergy bill for four main reasons: No. 1, we must take action that will \nhelp reduce the constantly rising price Americans pay for gasoline.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. REID. The last time I was in California, I saw one of the \nmarquees, $4 a gallon. In Nevada, everyplace is more than $3 a gallon.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. REID. No. 2, we must begin to break our country's addiction to \noil. We are addicted to oil. Even President Bush said that. We will use \n21 million barrels of oil today. Almost 70 percent of it we import from \nforeign countries and most are led by tyrannical rulers, despots.\n  No. 3, we must begin to reverse global warming. It is a crisis caused \nby our use of fossil fuel.\n  And No. 4, we must invest in renewable energy. Why? It is good for \nthe environment, and it creates lots of jobs. In Nevada alone, the tax \nportions of this bill will create thousands of jobs and countless--tens \nof thousands, hundreds of thousands--jobs throughout America.\n  Last week, the Republican minority blocked this crucial bipartisan \nbill from passing. In order to ease these concerns, we have reluctantly \nremoved the renewable electricity standard from the version of the bill \nnow before us. The renewable electricity standard would have required, \nby the year 2020, 15 percent of our Nation's electricity come from \nrenewable, environmentally sound sources.\n  That sounds pretty reasonable, 15 percent by the year 2020. We had to \ntake it out. Taking this step would reduce carbon emissions from \npowerplants by 126 million tons, reduce the cost of natural gas and \nelectricity bills by between $13 billion and $18 billion, and create \ngood, new American jobs.\n  This is not the last we will hear of the renewable electricity \nstandard. The\n\n[[Page S15389]]\n\nSenate has passed a similar bill before, and we will do it again. But \nin the spirit of compromise and in a genuine pursuit of progress, \nDemocrats have reluctantly agreed to remove that important provision \nfrom the Energy bill. But that is not all.\n  We also compromised by making changes to the energy tax title to \naccommodate the Republican minority. I would have preferred to make \nthese tax credits permanent, certainly longer than 2 years.\n  Unless my colleagues vote for this bill, they are not doing anything \nto help the production of electricity in our country by alternative \nmeans. They are doing nothing. The great entrepreneurial minds of our \ncountry need these tax credits. They need incentives to invest billions \nof dollars into renewable energy. They cannot do it without these tax \ncredits. If they do not vote for this tax provision of this bill, they \nare doing nothing to change our addiction to oil. But this compromise \nwill ensure that critical investments in clean and sustainable sources \nof energy will continue.\n  We have business people looking at new solar, wind, and geothermal \nprojects, and they will be spurred to action if we help them make their \ninvestment worthwhile.\n\n  I hope we reach the 60-vote threshold and send this bill to the House \nand on to the President today. I hope many Republicans will recognize \nthe importance of this bill for their States and their country.\n  The White House is objecting to our provision requiring major oil and \ngas companies to part with a few dollars--a few dollars--of their \nbillions of dollars of tax breaks they are scheduled to receive over \nthe next 10 years.\n  Let's be very clear. Our bill eliminates those tax breaks for these \nhuge oil companies, international oil companies, an industry raking in \nrecord profits of half a trillion dollars in the last 6 years. Those \nare profits. We want to do our tax program so we can invest in clean \nenergy.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike should agree that even without the \nrenewable electricity standard, we have an energy bill that reduces \nenergy costs, begin to break our addiction to oil, and reverse the \nthreat of global warming. This is still an important, historic bill. I \nam very happy to support it and ask my colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle to hear the call of the American people for lower energy \ncosts, less oil consumption and a cleaner environment and send this \nhistoric bill to the President.\n  I have been told there are Senators who have voted for our version of \nthe bill--that is, CAFE and renewable fuels standard--who are \nconsidering voting against this bill because the President says he is \ngoing to veto this bill. That is not good enough. We have to flex our \nlegislative muscles and do the right thing and not be stampeded because \nof 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Democrats and Republicans have to heed \nthat call. This could be the first step toward an energy revolution \nthat starts in America and ripples throughout the world, but it can \nonly start in the Senate today.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the \nyeas are 59, the nays are 40. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen \nand sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was rejected.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this was a good, hard-fought battle. I am \ndisappointed we did not pick up one more vote, but I know how difficult \nit was for some of my Republican colleagues to vote the way they did, \nand I admire and appreciate that very much.\n  We are going to finish this bill today, if at all possible. What we \nwould like to do is go back to the farm bill for a while, and as soon \nas we get the path forward on this bill, we will come back. My \nintention is to eliminate the tax title, and we would vote, then, on a \npiece of legislation that deals with CAFE and deals with renewable \nfuel.\n  Now, we, of course, really believe in the tax title, as I indicated \nin my speech before the vote, and hopefully we can work together to get \nthat done. We all know we need to do renewable fuel, and really in a \nbig way. I hope my friends on both sides of the aisle will work with us \nvery early next year to get this done. It is extremely important.\n  But everyone should understand, as disappointed as I am and as \ndisappointed as people throughout the country are, what we are going to \nwind up with is still historic--the first increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards in 32 years. And we have increased them significantly. There \nhas been a push from everybody to change various portions of what we \nhave left, and there may be a little bit of tinkering with some of it \nbut very little of it.\n  We are going to move forward as quickly as we can today to complete \nthis legislation. If we have to file cloture on the rest of it, we will \ndo that. If we do that, that will mean there will be a cloture vote on \nSaturday, just so everyone understands. Hopefully, this is the last \nweekend before we adjourn for the year, so I hope we don't have to do \nthat. I hope we can have people working here together to maybe overcome \nsome of the procedural hurdles we normally have to go through to move \nthis legislation.\n  Also, we are going to finish the farm bill this week. Today is \nThursday, tomorrow is Friday, and the next day is Saturday. We are \ngoing to finish the farm bill. I had a conversation earlier this \nmorning with the Democratic\n\n[[Page S15390]]\n\nmanager of the bill, I didn't have a chance to speak to the Republican \nmanager, but we would like to have all voting completed tonight or \nearly--sometime before noon--tomorrow. If that is the case, we have a \nnumber of other issues that are extremely important that we want to try \nto get a handle on before we leave. We need to take a look at the \nintelligence authorization bill. That is a conference report which has \nbeen completed. We also have to do the Defense authorization conference \nreport. We need to complete that.\n  We have to take a hard look at FISA. It would be in the best \ninterests of the Senate and this country if we could determine what the \nwill of the Senate is on the domestic surveillance program. It expires \non February 5. I hope prior to our coming back here in January that we \nhave the Senate's position on that and we send it to the House before \nwe leave here.\n  Then, finally, it is kind of a moving target, but the spending bill \nwe are going to get from the House--I have spoken to the Republican \nleader today. We are going to figure a way to go forward on that when \nwe get it from the House. It appears at this time we will get it \nsometime Tuesday--maybe Monday but probably Tuesday.\n  Then--there are no secrets here; I wish we could have a few more--we \nhave to do the domestic spending, get that done. Also, as much as it \npains me to say this, we have to do something about the supplemental \nappropriation for the President for the war in Iraq.\n  Those are the main issues we have. With the little bit of time we \nhave, there are a number of holds we are trying to work our way \nthrough. I had a good conversation with Senator Coburn yesterday and he \nhas indicated a willingness to let us move some of those. I hope that \nin fact is the case. As much as I disagree with Senator Coburn on so \nmany things, I have found him to be an absolute gentleman and someone \nwho is a man of his word. He has different beliefs than I do. He is \nentitled to those. He does it because it is a matter of principle. That \nis obvious. From all I know about him, it is not because of political \npurposes but because it is something he believes in. I came to learn a \nlong time ago that other people's beliefs are as important as mine.\n  That is the track forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15390-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15390-S15412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent we now move back to the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The farm bill is now pending.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me join the leader indicating there \nis no reason we should not and we will pass the Energy bill today. Now \nthat it is clear it is not going to be a bill to raise taxes and drive \nup the price of fuel at the pump, I think there is broad bipartisan \nsupport for this bill. This is the way the Senate ought to function, \ncoming together behind those things that are achievable.\n  The bill, with the changes the majority leader has indicated we are \ngoing to make, could be signed by the President and it will be \nsomething we could all be proud of.\n  We also intend to finish the farm bill as rapidly as possible, so I \nshare his goals for today, and tomorrow if need be. I think we should \nmove forward with the farm bill and finish it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator from Nevada leaves, I \nwish to note first I was very pleased to accept your definition of our \nrelationship--good friends. We are friends. I thank you for that and I \nwant to say that now.\n  I do want to say to you about the bill we have had a long fight \nabout, and we just finished about as difficult a vote as we have had in \na long time, that the bill you are going to send back to the House, \nthis bill up here, with a few alterations and the taxes out, this bill, \nI guarantee, will get signed and it will become law. It will be the \nmost significant act we can take to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil, all by itself. It will get passed, now that we are finished with \nthe hurdles, and you will be the one who will be leading it through the \nremainder of its journeys and you will be there when, indeed, it \nbecomes the law of the land. It will be the most significant energy act \nwe can do.\n  It was done by the Committee on Commerce, led by Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens. Because they know how to work, they passed it when we \ncould not pass it for years. Now it is ready to go. It is not dead. The \nvote caused it to stay alive and go down its way to the President for \nhis signature.\n  I think the Senator's accomplishments in this regard are to be \ncommended. We are going to get a great bill and you will be part of it. \nI am sorry it is not exactly what you want, and you can rest assured \nthere will be some of us helping you and helping the other side when it \ncomes to the incentives you spoke of in your remarks. Some of us think \nthey are important. We just don't think they belong on this bill and \nthey do not deserve a veto.\n  I thank the Senator for his kindness as we work this through. I hope \nwe can make a couple of changes that Senator Inouye thinks are \nimportant before the bill is sent to the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my heart is heavy, and I say that seriously, \nrecognizing next year at this time Senator Domenici will be in the last \nfew days of his 36-year service in the Congress of the United States. \nDuring 25 years of that, I have worked with him. My next year will be \n26 years. As partisan as he is and as partisan as I am, we have worked \ntoward meeting the demands of the State of Nevada, heavily involved in \nthe defense of this country for decades, as is the State of New Mexico. \nIn the process of our working together, we have helped the country. The \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile as it exists today is a \nresult--and I say this in no way to boast but to be factual--of what \nSenator Inouye and Senator Domenici and I put into effect as members of \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations. We do not need to \ndwell on this longer than to say his dedicated service to the country \nis something I recognize, the people of New Mexico and of our country \nwill recognize for many years to come.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this last vote was a historic vote for \nAmerica. This was a decision about whether we were going to look to the \nfuture to change to an energy policy and a environmental policy \nconsistent with America's best interests. Pitted in that vote were the \noil companies, the energy companies of years gone by, and those energy \nsources for our future. The energy companies of years gone by \nprevailed.\n  The irony is that the Republicans, Senator McConnell and others, have \nstood steadfast in protecting the subsidies for the oil companies of \nAmerica. That is a time-honored tradition in the Senate. Whether you \nagree with it or not, the Senate, by and large, has been very kind to \nthe oil companies and the oil industry throughout our history. We \ncouldn't have seen a vote they would have been happier with than the \nlast one, because in the last one, the last vote, we suggested that \nsubsidies for oil companies should give way to tax incentives for new \nsources of energy, sources of energy that are clean, renewable, \nsustainable, and that vote failed by one vote.\n  Isn't it ironic, at a time when oil companies in America have enjoyed \nthe highest profit margins in their history, that the Republican \nargument is we must continue the tax subsidies for those oil companies? \nIsn't it ironic, at a time when Americans are paying higher and higher \nprices at the pump for gasoline, while oil companies have the highest \nprofits in their histories, the Republicans argue we should not \npenalize these oil companies in any way or they will take it out on the \nconsumers? It is a craven political position. It is a position which is \ndevoid of leadership. It is a position which looks to the past instead \nof to the future.\n  The future suggests these oil companies should be held accountable \nlike\n\n[[Page S15391]]\n\nevery company. With $90-a-barrel oil, why in the world would they need \na Federal subsidy? Why in the world would the Members of the Senate \nprotect that subsidy when these oil companies are enjoying the highest \nprofits in the history of their industry?\n  I think many of us believe there is a future that is much different. \nIt is a future which most Americans are praying for--when we are less \ndependent on foreign oil, when we are using energy sources that are \nkind to the environment, and where we are reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions that cause climate change and global warming. That is the \nfuture. The future just failed by one vote. The past was preserved with \nthose who voted against this last motion.\n  The oil companies now are celebrating in their boardrooms. Not only \ndo they have the highest profits in history, they continue to have a \ndeath grip on this Senate. They continue to be able to muster enough \nvotes to stop us from moving forward with the energy for America's \nfuture. It may be a great political victory today for the oil \ncompanies, but I will tell you the day is coming, and soon, when the \nAmerican people will have a voice. In the election in 2008, they can \ndecide whether to elect those political figures who are preserving the \npast, ignoring the future, or vote for those who want real change.\n  I think this was a historic vote. To lose by one vote in terms of \nmoving us forward, to say that President Bush--who has his own history \nin the oil industry--is going to dictate America's energy future, is to \ncondemn us, I am afraid, to a future that is not hopeful. It is a \nfuture where this administration, having rejected Kyoto, still stands \nin lockstep with the oil industry and their view of the world. That has \nto change. That has to change if our future generations and our \nchildren are going to have a liveable world, one where they can cope \nwith the changes in the environment and say that our generation did not \nlet them down. The Senate let them down with this last vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, aren't prices of gasoline high enough? Why \nwould we want to raise the price of gasoline for the American consumer \nby raising taxes and the costs of doing business on the people who \nproduce oil and gasoline for the American consumer? That is exactly the \nargument I think we heard from the distinguished assistant majority \nleader: Taxes are not high enough on domestic producers of oil and \ngasoline.\n  I think this vote we had was a very important vote because what we \nsaid is we think prices are too high and should not be any higher. We \ndo not believe we ought to depend more and more on imported sources of \noil and gas. We believe we ought to produce more domestically, here in \nthe United States.\n  The kind of arguments we hear from the other side of the aisle so \noften demonstrate a kind of schizophrenia when it comes to a national \nenergy policy, further burdening those who produce oil and gasoline \nhere domestically and then at the same time railing about the high \nprices.\n  Congress can pass laws, Congress can repeal laws, but the one law \nCongress cannot repeal is the law of supply and demand. One of the ways \nwe are going to find our way to a more reasonably priced gasoline at \nthe pump is if we increase the supply. We know we are in a global \ncompetition for oil and gas. That is one of the reasons why the prices \ncontinue to go up, because supply is not keeping pace. One of the \nthings we need to do is to take reasonable steps to open areas that are \nnow out of bounds to domestic exploration for these precious natural \nresources--in an environmentally responsible way, as the modern oil and \ngas industry is capable of doing. It doesn't do any good to rail \nagainst big oil or to try to use any sector of the economy as a \npolitical football when it hurts the American consumer and the American \npeople.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico that it was \nimportant that we defeat this tax increase that would raise the price \nof gasoline at the pump for the American consumer. Now we can come \ntogether and work on another important element of our national energy \npolicy and that is conservation. We need to conserve and to use our \nnatural resources more efficiently. That is what the CAFE provisions of \nthis bill will do. Yes, we need to explore and put money into research \nand development of renewable fuels to try to find new and more \nefficient ways to limit our reliance on oil and gasoline.\n  But in the near term, we know that is going to be part of the puzzle. \nWe need to explore clean nuclear energy as a source of electricity. \nFrance produces more than 80 percent of its electricity using nuclear \npower; for America, it is around 20 percent. We need to get away from \nthe scare tactics and using the energy companies that we are going to \nhave to, in part, rely upon to find our way out of where we are and \ncome up with a comprehensive energy strategy which says, yes, we need \nto tap into all sources of energy in an environmentally responsible way \nand a way that will limit carbon production and will help with the \nissue of climate change at the same time. But we are not going to do it \nby raising taxes on the domestic oil and gas industry.\n  I would just point out that the competitors, for most of the people \nwhom the majority wants to add taxes to, are competing with people like \nHugo Chavez and Ahmadinejad in Iran, state-owned oil companies that \nwould not be subject to this increase in taxes. So they are literally \ntargeting the domestic producers in a way that will further harm our \nability to become less dependent on imported oil and gas.\n  I am proud of the vote the Senate had today. I hope we will go \nforward and come up with a commonsense, bipartisan resolution on the \nCAFE and renewable standards portion of this bill, that we will pass \nthe bill and send it to the President for a quick signature. It would \nbe one of the very few areas where this Congress will have actually \ndone something positive here in the last year, and I think we ought to \nnot give up that opportunity but take advantage of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, sometimes here in the Senate we have so \nmany competing views and so many different kinds of votes, some of them \nprocedural, that it is hard to tell when something good happens. I wish \nto talk about such an opportunity that we have right now. This is a \nlittle bit like something my late friend Alex Haley used to say: ``Find \nthe good and praise it.''\n  We are on a path in the Congress now to do something the Senate did a \nfew weeks ago, which was to take a step that our country's largest \nenergy laboratory, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has testified \nbefore our committees would be the single most important step we could \ntake to reduce our dependance on foreign oil. By reducing our \ndependance on foreign oil, we would do something that we could actually \nhonestly say would help to lower the $3-a-gallon gasoline price over \ntime, something that we could honestly say would help deal with the \nurgent issue of climate change, something that we could honestly say \nwould put us on a different path toward clean energy in this country. \nAnd those are the new fuel efficiency standards.\n  There is a clear consensus in this body--I gather in the House of \nRepresentatives, too--that for the first time in more than two decades, \nthe Congress should say to everyone who makes cars and trucks in this \ncountry: You have to make cleaner cars; these cars have to use less oil \none way or the other. We are not really saying to them, or at least I \ndo not think we should say exactly how they achieve that; we are just \nsaying that by the year 2020 the cars and the trucks have to average 35 \nmiles per gallon. This is a big step.\n  As I said, the Oak Ridge Laboratory testified in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, this is the single most important step the \nCongress can take to reduce our dependance on foreign oil. We have \nalready voted to do it in the Senate, and we have already voted to do \nit in the House, and we had a vote today to strip away the taxes that \nthe Senator from Texas just talked about. So we are on a path, a clear \npath to send this bill back to the House and then to the President and, \nbefore the first of the year, to take the most important step we can \ntake to reduce our dependance on foreign oil.\n\n[[Page S15392]]\n\n  There is a lot of talk and genuine concern about climate change. \nThere is not as much commonsense talk about solutions.\n  On the electricity side, we know what works, and we began, in 2005 \nwith the Energy bill, to take those steps. That bill could have been \ncalled--should have been called--a clean energy bill because it started \nwith aggressive steps on conservation and then it went to a renaissance \nof nuclear power.\n  The inconvenient truth on solutions to climate change is that \nconservation and nuclear power are the only way we will be able to deal \nwith climate change in this generation. We hope we will be able to move \nahead to sequester the carbon from coal, but we do not have that \ntechnology yet in a way that it can be used in a wholesale way. We hope \nthere will be solar thermal powerplants such as the one being built in \nCalifornia, and we hope photovoltaic solar panels will cost less and \npeople can use them on their houses, but those renewable ways to create \nelectricity only produce a very small percentage of what we need. So in \nthis generation, on the electricity side, conservation and nuclear \npower, which today produces 80 percent of all of our carbon-free \nelectricity, are the real ways to deal with climate change, and in our \npart of the country, in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, the real way \nto make the air clean.\n  In the same way, on the fuel side in this country that uses about 25 \npercent of all of the oil and gas, the single most important thing we \ncan do is what we have already voted for once in this body, the House \nhas voted for once, and if they take this bill and send it on to the \nPresident, the Congress will have done it; it will be fuel efficiency \nstandards that say to everyone who makes and sells cars here: Your cars \nand trucks have to average 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020.\n  So in the midst of all of the procedural votes and debating these \ngenuinely held differences of opinion, I simply want to put a spotlight \non the fact that this Congress is poised to send to the President the \nmost important thing we can do to lower prices, to reduce the \ndependance on foreign oil, and to deal with the climate change. It is \nthe kind of result, the kind of bipartisan result that most Americans \nwould like to see happen here. They know we have our differences. We \nwill be back and forth on our votes. That is what we are here for. The \ntough issues come to the Senate. That is why we are a debating society. \nBut in the end, we do not come here just to state our principles; we \ncome here to get principled solutions. We are on our way to one of the \nmost important principled solutions we can have in terms of energy \nefficiency.\n  I congratulate the Senators who have been so much involved in this. I \nhope we will pass the legislation that the Senator has promised, the \nmajority leader has promised to produce here. I hope the House of \nRepresentatives will pass it, as well, and send it to the President. I \nhope that over Christmastime, Americans will look at this Congress and \nsay: Good for you on energy independence, on climate change, on cleaner \nair, on reducing our dependance on foreign oil. You took the most \nimportant step you could take, and that is what we think a Congress \nought to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me join with the Senator from Tennessee \nin applauding an action that ultimately now will be taken by the Senate \nand therefore by the Congress to add substantially to an energy policy \nin this country that begins us down the road in a long march toward a \nhigher degree of energy independence.\n  I have been in the Congress 27 years. I have always supported, up \nuntil this year, leaving CAFE or fleet standards for efficiency alone.\n  I got here in 1980. We had just come out of the 1970s oil crisis. We \nhad put policy in place that was helping transform the automobile \nindustry in our country to a more efficient fleet average. But over the \ncourse of the last 5 years, I have seen it become increasingly \nimportant that we focus on every aspect of energy in our country.\n  I used to be somewhat selective in what ought to be produced versus \nwhat ought not be, where we ought to put our incentives, where we ought \nto put our tax dollars to improve availability in the marketplace. But \nit became increasingly obvious to me that just a few miles per gallon \nper automobile in this country could make all the difference in the \nworld.\n  We now import $1 billion a day in oil, approximately; $360 billion of \nAmerica's money goes overseas to foreign nations which are, at best, \nindifferent to our interests, and at worst, using the term that I call \n``petronationalism,'' use the power of their energy not only to squeeze \nus, but then they take that money and reinvest in our country or invest \nsomewhere else, in many instances not in our interests.\n  I have always been frustrated that a great nation such as ours could \nnot move toward energy independence, could not set as a goal that by a \ncertain time our country could and would become energy independent in \nall sectors if we did the following things and if we began to drive \npublic policy in that direction. So this spring, Senator Byron Dorgan \nof North Dakota and I did something I had never done before: We \nintroduced legislation for a mandatory 4-percent change in fleet \nefficiencies on an annual basis. Well, you would have thought the roof \ncaved in.\n  The automobile industry came to me wringing their hands and saying: \nWe simply cannot do that. You have always been with us.\n  I said: Yes, that is right. In 27 years, I have not changed, frankly, \nand in 27 years you have not changed, and it is time we do change a \nlittle bit.\n  Now there are a lot of new efficiencies coming on out there, from \nhybrids to flex vehicles, and hopefully we are going to see a hydrogen \nfuel cell car on the market in a very short period of time that will \nbegin to move its way in the market. So the automobile industry \ndeserves a lot of credit for beginning to recognize the need to change \nwhat we use to drive America's transportation fleet.\n  But the opportunity to change the industry, to cause them to move \ndown that road in a discernable and a direct way because it is the \npublic policy of this country, is something I decided to become a part \nof. I believe it was with the introduction of that bill, with Senator \nDorgan and I working together, that we got those kinds of things out of \nthe Commerce Committee and into the Energy bill that passed the Senate. \nAnd that was a strong energy bill. It had all of the right blends and \nmixes in it to begin to create a cleaner energy consumptive world for \nus and at the same time a more independent and a more efficient world.\n  Today's vote was critical. We are going to send an energy bill to the \nPresident in relatively short order, I hope, that has a lot of those \nthings in it and that causes America's transportation fleet to move in \nthe right direction.\n  Mr. President, $3 dollars a gallon for gas is coming out of the hip \npockets of moms and dads in this country today, and if that pace \ncontinues to go up, it is going to do more to change--I think in a \nnegative way--the American economy than anything we have seen. We ought \nto be all about helping the average American change that equation, and \nI think efficiencies do that. Conservation is critical as a component \nof a total energy package because that which you save you do not have \nto produce. Just a couple of miles to the gallon across America's \ntransportation fleet is millions and millions of barrels of oil. That \nis what we ought to be about. It will be a cleaner fleet and a fleet \nthat will produce less carbon into the atmosphere.\n  All of us are concerned about greenhouse gasses and climate change, \nand efficiencies and new technologies, in my opinion, are the best \ndirection to lead us to accomplish a cleaner world, and today a \ncritical vote occurred that will allow us to do that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3666\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 3666, \nwhich we will have a vote on at some point later in the day.\n  This amendment to the farm bill addresses manipulation in the \nlivestock industry. We have had consolidation in agribusiness over the \nlast many decades. In the meat packer industry, for example, there are \nfour major meat packers that control 80 percent of the\n\n[[Page S15393]]\n\nmarket in the United States. Being big is not necessarily bad, but it \ncan allow companies to manipulate and control the marketplace. We all \nknow a monopolistic and controlled marketplace doesn't benefit anybody. \nWithout competition, without that free market, we put our cow/calf \nproducers at risk.\n  The meat-packing companies have the past because of packer ownership \nmanipulated forward contracting and pressure on producers to distort \nthe supply and demand, maximizing their profits often at the expense of \nthe cow/calf producer. The producer ends up being price taker and not \nprice maker due to manipulation of the marketplace and restriction of \nthe free market we all expect in the cattle industry.\n  Way back in about 1921, this Government had the foresight to realize \nthe free market system was a good one and that it wasn't working quite \nright, even with the antitrust laws which were deemed inadequate. So \nthey passed an act called the Packers and Stockyards Act. That act has \nworked pretty well over the many decades since 1921. Unfortunately, \ncourt decisions recently misinterpreted the intention of the act.\n  Back in 2005, a lawsuit was brought forward by a handful of livestock \nproducers. This lawsuit claimed market manipulation by the meat-packing \nindustry, thereby artificially lowering the price the cow/calf producer \nwould get for their cattle. A jury awarded $1.28 billion in damages. \nSome time later, three judges decided to rewrite the Packers and \nStockyards Act instead of interpreting it. They overturned the decision \nbased on a legitimate business reason.\n  Amendment No. 3666 once again clarifies the Packers and Stockyards \nAct to its original intent, reintroducing competition into the \nmarketplace, helping maintain a level and competitive playing field \nbetween widely dispersed cattle producers throughout the country and \nhighly concentrated meat packers.\n  I don't think there is a person in this body who doesn't think the \nfree market system is a good one. Currently, what we have in the meat-\npacking industry is four companies that control 80 percent of the \nmarketplace. The CEOs of these four companies could go out on the golf \ncourse and determine how they are going to manipulate the marketplace. \nWe need to make sure as a government we have protection in place for \nour family ranchers. That is what this amendment will accomplish. It \nwill reinstate the Packers and Stockyards Act to its original form \nwhich worked so well for so many years.\n  We have 170 groups in favor of this amendment. There is going to be \nsome groups that oppose it. The truth is, if we want to have a vibrant \ncow/calf producer environment and economy, we need to pass the \namendment. We need to make sure they have every market advantage they \ndeserve. It is tough enough on the farm and on the ranch to make a \nliving. Right now in Montana, I didn't check the weather this morning, \nbut it is probably a heck of a lot colder than it is here. In some \nplaces in Montana, because of drought, they are out feeding cattle \nright now. They are doing an honest day's work, and they should get an \nhonest day's pay. When you have monopolization in the marketplace, it \ntakes away the ability to get an honest day's pay for an honest day's \nwork. This amendment is going to help the folks in Montana where \nagriculture is the No. 1 industry and the No. 1 issue. If we are going \nto keep this industry vibrant, we need to pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding me time.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Montana. Despite the fact our Nation \nenjoys but apparently some do not appreciate the fact that production \nagriculture does provide the best quality food at the lowest price in \nthe history of the world to feed not only America but the world's \nhungry, we have heard repeated calls for reform--and I know my \ncolleague thinks his amendment falls into that category--of farm \nprograms. While targeted and pertinent reform is certainly needed and \nthis farm bill does take major steps forward in answering those calls, \nit seems to me we must be cautious of what lurks under the banner of \nreform. We must be mindful of the unintended consequences of our \nactions, and nowhere in this bill is that more evident than in the \nlivestock title.\n  I represent a State where cattle outnumber people more than two-to-\none. I have always said, usually they are in a better mood, especially \nwith the weather we have been having. Cattle represented 61 percent of \nthe agricultural cash receipts by generating over $6 billion in 2005; \nobviously more in 2006. I tell you this so you understand when I say \nthe livestock industry is vital to Kansas and, I know, other States \nthat are represented very ably in the Senate and to our national \neconomy and our livelihoods. The underlying bill expands the scope of \nthe Agricultural Fair Practices Act and the Packers and Stockyards Act. \nBut these expansions will have major implications on the industry, and \nwe must proceed with caution.\n  In the livestock hearing held in April, witnesses referenced a study \nwhich showed alternative marketing arrangements account for only 38 \npercent of the transactions in the fed cattle market. The cash market \nis responsible for 62 percent. Only 4.5 percent of transactions went \nthrough forward contracts and 5 percent through packer ownership. More \nimportantly, this study concluded that alternative marketing agreements \ndo benefit all segments of the cattle industry. It is through these \nmarketing agreements that consumers are able to buy specialized \nproducts such as Certified Angus or Ranchers Reserve, or all-natural \nproducts.\n\n  Competition issues are nothing new to this body. I agree our \nproducers need to be able to compete in today's markets. I share the \nconcern of the Senator from Montana in this regard. It is the role of \nthe Government to protect producers from unfair practices and \nmonopolies. I understand the calls from some for increased Government \ninvolvement. At the same time, we must take careful steps to ensure \nthat in any action we might take, we do not suffer from the law of \nunintended consequences and risk the significant gains the livestock \nindustry has experienced to meet our consumers' needs. Regardless of \nthe Senator's intent--I don't question that--I am concerned this \namendment does that.\n  This amendment takes away a business's ability to make decisions \nfreely. Let me lay out a scenario I think can be fully understood. \nLet's say you are a producer who has developed a program that produces \na higher quality product than I, another producer, and both of us are \ntrying to sell our product to the same packer. If the packer picks you, \nnot me, or any other producer to fill the contract because your product \ndoes perform better or meets the demands of the customer, under this \namendment, I can bring a lawsuit for that or that other producer can \nbring a lawsuit against the packer, even though they were making a \ndecision based on sound business principles. The language is as clear \nas day in this amendment, ``regardless of any alleged business \njustification.'' Certainly, a packer can defend their cattle buying \nchoices as a business justification.\n  This amendment would allow lawsuits to be filed regardless of this \nbusiness justification. This amendment will result in all producers \nbeing treated the same--sounds good--regardless of how efficient or \ninefficient their operation may be and regardless of the quality of \nproduct they produce.\n  I know it would be easy, maybe nostalgic, maybe something we would \nwant to do as we are sitting around having a cup of coffee, to return \nto the production days of 20 or 30 years ago. The market has changed \ndramatically. Production today is more efficient because of consumer \ndemands. In this regard, the consumer is king. They want specialized \nproducts. They want all-natural beef. They want Certified Angus. They \nwant U.S. premium beef or many other products that are produced under \nspecified standards that meet a higher quality. Thankfully, the entire \nlivestock industry, from growers\n\n[[Page S15394]]\n\nto feeders to packers to retailers, has made great strides in recent \nyears to meet the demands of the marketplace. I am concerned this \namendment puts all these consumer, market-driven products and \ninvestment at risk. This amendment does discourage innovation in the \nindustry. Our producers would receive no premiums for adding value to \ntheir products. Why would anyone invest additional resources into their \nproduction system if they were not allowed to receive a return on their \ninvestment? This amendment, combined with the language in the \nunderlying bill, will spur lawsuit after lawsuit and stifle innovation. \nThis amendment does remove choices from producers and from processors \nand consumers.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe my colleague had 15 minutes \nyielded to him. I ask unanimous consent to use the remainder of his \ntime to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Kansas in \nopposition to the Tester amendment. I appreciate my colleague from \nMontana offering this amendment. I respect his background and \nknowledge. He has worked in this field. He has lived this. He is living \nit in his own operation in Montana. I have a lot of respect for that \nand for what he is targeting. I have spent all my life in the \nagricultural business. I was raised on a farm, have undergraduate \ndegrees in agriculture. I was Secretary of Agriculture in Kansas. I \nhave worked on these issues a long time. We have all wanted to get more \nmoney in agriculture and keep more family farms operating. That is \neverybody's desire. I believe that is the desire and intent of this \namendment.\n  However, in my State in Kansas, as my colleague has described, this \nis going to hurt family farm operations, and it will hurt people who \nare trying to get more money in their operation from the marketplace. I \nwould like to briefly describe one example I recently experienced, an \noperation of a small family feed yard that does operate for a number of \ndifferent individuals in the eastern part of Kansas. It is the Knight \nFeedlot. They have been operating for quite a few years in Lyons, KS. \nThey have an innovative program. It is an alternative marketing \nprogram. They raise hormone-free, antibiotic-free cattle. They sell the \nmeat directly from this feed yard into premium grocery stores in \nConnecticut and New York. It is the sort of thing many of us have been \ntalking about. Let's get the producer closer to the consumer and sell \nthe product they want. This is hormone-free, antibiotic-free beef. \nAnybody in this room who has raised cattle knows that if you are going \nto go hormone free and antibiotic free, you have increased your risk \nand the cost of your operation substantially to meet that consumer \nneed. These guys are doing that. Any animal that gets sick, they have \nto pull out of the program because they have to keep the animal alive. \nTo do it, they are going to use antibiotics, so the animal is out of \nthe program when that takes place. It winnows down fairly fast. When \nyou get weather fluctuations such as are taking place now, you get more \nproblems and more animals out of the program.\n  But eventually, because of a contractual operation they have with a \npacker--because these are feeders, they are not packers--they are able \nto get their animals identified through the system, they are able to \nget the packer to deliver that meat to the counter in Connecticut and \nNew York, because my Kansas feeders are not lined up to do that, they \nhave a contractual arrangement to do that, and, as a result, they are \nable to get a substantial premium for their beef.\n  The consumer in Connecticut and New York can see who produces it, and \nthe pictures of Kenny and Mark Knight are by the display counter on the \nbeef case in these stores. They have been there, and they have been \nthere to sell their beef. It works. It works for them, and they get a \nsubstantial premium for this beef. The consumer likes it, and they like \nseeing who has produced their beef.\n  That operation would be illegal under the direction of this \namendment. I believe this amendment would generate lawsuits against \nthat very type of operation.\n  I respect my colleague from Montana and his efforts to preserve the \nfamily farm operation--family farm operations like what my parents have \nand my brother is on. This amendment is not the way. It is \nmicromanagement from here. One of the things I have certainly seen is \nyou cannot micromanage America, and you should not try. The best is to \nset up fair playing rules. We have rules in this system. But we should \nnot punish people who are trying to innovate to get more money for \ntheir producers in innovative fashions and using alternate marketing \nmeans and being successful at it.\n  The Knights had to invest a substantial amount of money to get this \narrangement set. They had to hire somebody to do the marketing. They \nhad to hire somebody and get enough cattle to be able to enter into a \ncontractual arrangement with the packer to keep these cattle identified \nand keep them identified to be able to deliver to the consumers in \nConnecticut and New York. Without that, they are not packers, they \ncannot do this. This amendment would hurt their operation. As a matter \nof fact, it would make it illegal and bring lawsuits against it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment on a number of \ngrounds: No. 1, it prohibits innovation, and No. 2, it really tries to \nmicromanage something we should not try to micromanage. It is going to \nhurt my Kansas feeders.\n  For all those reasons, I urge opposition to the Tester amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time, if there is \nany on our side on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I make an inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Are there any more who wish to debate the Tester amendment \nprior to us moving to--\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the good \nSenators from Kansas for their comments. I, too, respect your opinion. \nI ask that you pay careful attention to what I am about to say. I am \nactually in the specialty crop business personally. It has been well \ndocumented, I raise organic crops. I do not raise organic beef, but I \nam around people who raise organic beef and market it freely. They will \nbe able to continue to market it freely with the adoption of this \namendment. So the folks, the Knights you talked about, in Kansas are \nstill going to be able to market their hormone-free beef.\n  It speaks specifically in the Packers and Stockyards Act about \nrestraining commerce and creating a monopoly. They cannot have an \nalleged business justification to do that. When you are adding value to \na product, you are increasing the value. When you are raising specialty \ncrops or you are specializing in grass-fed beef or specializing in \nhormone-fed beef or antibiotic-fed beef, you still have access to those \npremium prices.\n  What the Packers and Stockyards Act does is it protects the cattle \nproducers and those feeders you talked about. It allows them to stay in \nbusiness, to be able to get that premium price. What this amendment \ndoes is protects them from those four packers--who control 80 percent \nof the country's meat supply; and it could be fewer than that next year \ncontrolling 80 percent of the meat supply if they buy one another out--\nit protects them from those four packers setting prices by using an \nalleged business justification to create a monopoly or restrain the \ncommerce around the meatpacking industry.\n  It is critically important that you know that the unintended \nconsequences you talk about are not going to exist with this amendment. \nThose unintended consequences are simply not there. What this amendment \nwill do is it will reinstate the free market system in our cattle \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S15395]]\n\n  The point I made earlier, in my opening statement, is where you can \nliterally have four CEOs of four companies that control 80 percent of \nthe meatpacking industry be able to manipulate forward contracts, be \nable to manipulate the transactions within their business, and put on a \nbusiness justification for it, and now all of a sudden it is OK under \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act. That simply is not right. We ought not \ngo encouraging monopolization anywhere, much less in agriculture that \nputs our producers at risk to driving them off the ranches in this \ncountry.\n  In Montana, we have about four times as many cattle as we do people, \nI believe. It is a big issue. Premiums are still going to be there. \nSpecialized beef is still going to be there. The ability to add value \nto our meat products is still going to be there for them to get the \nprice they deserve for it. What this will stop is the meatpackers \nfrom--and I read right straight from the Packers and Stockyards Act--\nrestraining commerce, creating a monopoly, regardless of any alleged \nbusiness justification.\n\n  Next paragraph: restraining commerce, regardless of any alleged \nbusiness justification.\n  The last time I heard, the last time I checked, if you are getting \npaid a premium, you are not restraining commerce, you are promoting \ncommerce.\n  And it goes on: to manipulate or control prices regardless of any \nalleged business justification.\n  There are no boogeymen in these amendments, folks. This is a good \namendment. We dealt with an amendment yesterday that talked about \nproducers and the kind of pressures they are under and the mental \nhealth aspects that impact farmers and ranchers when they are put under \nfinancial pressures. I believe we adopted that amendment.\n  The fact is, if you want to help farmers' and ranchers' success, \nadopt this amendment. It will make them more financially vibrant.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment has 19 minutes, \nand there is 17 minutes for the opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have 19 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 19 minutes; the opposition has \n17 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, will he yield me 4 or 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. TESTER. You bet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Montana. I am a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  First, I will just make an observation. In this body, out of 100 \nSenators, we have 2 bona fide farmers, one on the Republican side, my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and one on our side, the Senator \nfrom Montana, Mr. Tester. These are people who actually do farm--not \njust own a farm, but they actually do farm. So when I hear them talk \nabout things in agriculture, I give a lot of weight to it, not that \nthey are always right, obviously. They would not claim that, I am sure. \nBut you have to give some weight to their arguments, especially when \nthey are making it on behalf of farmers.\n  So when this amendment was first offered by the Senator from Montana, \nI began to look at it and consider it because I, too, had thought about \nthe issues raised by the Senators from Kansas about whether it would be \nrestrictive of a packer who wanted to provide premiums. I think he \nmaybe mentioned an Angus cut or a cowboy cut, Black Angus bone-in rib \neye, those that have premiums.\n  So I was concerned. I asked my staff: Let's look at this and make \nsure we are OK on this. I think the way the amendment is drafted does, \nin fact, allow those kinds of contracts to be made because they are not \nmanipulative of a marketplace.\n  What the Tester amendment really goes to, I think--and I think it is \nclear in the way it is drafted--it goes to the packers who, let's say, \nmight engage in collusive practices that would, in fact, depress the \nmarket price on a certain day or during a certain time and then claim \nthey have a pro-business reason for doing so.\n  I have not seen a business yet, in case after case--where they have \ncolluded or where there has been some dealings--where they have not \nsaid, well, it is better for their business. Of course, if they can \nincrease their profits, it is always better for their business, but \nincreasing their profits at what expense? At the expense of a farmer \nwho is relying upon the livestock market.\n  So I think the amendment is one that really gets to the heart of the \ncase, the Pickett case. We all know about the Pickett case. I think the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals really went riding off the range. I \ndo not know where they came up with some of their thoughts on that. It \nis not the first time that the courts have gotten off course.\n  The Packers and Stockyards Act was enacted to protect producers from \npackers. That was the intent, and it has been the intent ever since, to \nprotect producers from packers. It was never intended to be some bill \nto ensure that packers are competitive or that they are competitive \nwith other packers. That was never the intent of the Packers and \nStockyards Act. It is to protect producers from packers to make sure \nthere is as level a playing field as possible out there for the market \nto work.\n  Markets: many buyers, many sellers--that is how a market works. If \nyou have many buyers and one seller, no market. If you have one buyer \nand many sellers, no market. You have to have many buyers and many \nsellers for the market to work. That is what the Packers and Stockyards \nAct aims to protect.\n  So, again, the amendment is not in any way intended to infringe upon \ncontracts or forward contracts or the kinds of contracts that were \nmentioned in terms of giving premium prices for different kinds of meat \nproduced. It was never intended--I know the Senator talked about the \nlaw of unintended consequences, but, again, I think the amendment is \nclear. The intent is to ensure anti-competitive practices in the \nmarketplace are not allowed--are not allowed--regardless of a business \njustification.\n  So, again, right now I think we have a case where the packers--I know \na lot of them--I would like to say the ones I know are honest and above \nboard, and they are. But that does not mean they all are. When it comes \nto making a profit here, maybe dealing something on the side. \nEventually they will think they have a green light to engage in \ncollusive practices to manipulate the market, and all you have to do is \ngo into court and say: Business justification. What is the business \njustification? I made more money. I made more money. But at whose \nexpense? At whose expense?\n  That is why this amendment is so important. I think it is important \nwe shine a light and at least clarify for our producers that the \nEleventh Circuit Court's opinion on this is not the law of the land. We \ndecide the law, not the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to this \namendment.\n  I, too, have great deference to those folks who till the soil and \nproduce products that we all enjoy as consumers from an agricultural \nperspective. I am not a farmer, but I am a lawyer. I have read laws all \nmy life. Frankly, all you have to do is read this amendment to realize \nthat the amendment would prevent businesses from using legitimate \nbusiness justifications as a defense against claims of unlawful \npractices under the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  I would simply go to the first page, section 2, where it says on page \n1232 that we are going to strike the clause regardless of any business \njustification. This clearly is a determination that should be left to \nthe discretion of the U.S. courts and not summarily decided in advance \nby Congress.\n  A business should be able to offer as a defense that their actions \nwere done legitimately as a means of conducting business. The court has \nthe option to\n\n[[Page S15396]]\n\nexamine this defense and gauge it against those practices deemed \nunlawful under the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  If a producer believes a packer has conspired to create a monopoly, \nhe has a right to sue that packer. What if the packer's decision was \nmade not as an effort to create a monopoly but as an effort to secure \nhigher quality cattle from a consistent supplier? The courts simply \nmust have the discretion to make this determination.\n  Including language in the Packers and Stockyards Act that enumerates \nunlawful practices and adds the phrase ``regardless of any alleged \nbusiness justification'' is simply prejudicial against American \nbusinesses.\n  I am sympathetic to producers who are concerned about their evolving \nrole in the livestock marketplace, but this amendment is overreaching \nand will inject uncertainty into legitimate business decisions.\n  Let's not attempt to stack the deck on behalf of one party over \nanother. We should allow the courts all due discretion in determining \nif the actions of American businesses are justified under the Packers \nand Stockyards Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to use 5 minutes of that time.\n  I respect those who do farm. My dad does, and I have a lot of respect \nfor him. I have a brother who farms as well, and it is tough. It is a \nhard life.\n  I went to law school, and in my background I taught agricultural law. \nI have written two books on it, if anybody is interested. I don't think \nthey are still for sale because they never sold very well.\n  But my point in saying that is one of the key things which is always \ntalked about in agriculture is the Packers and Stockyards Act. It was \ndeveloped back in the 1920s and 1930s because of this imbalance that \nwas developing and was really heightened at that point in time even \nmore so than today between the packers and producers. There were a lot \nmore producers that were a lot smaller at that point in time and taken \nadvantage of by packers. It was a very unscrupulous setting, and they \npassed the Packers and Stockyards Act. It was a very important piece of \nlegislation, particularly in farm country, and it did have a \nsubstantial impact and continues to have a substantial impact today.\n  The situation today is different than it was back then. What you have \nnow are a number of producers that are, in many cases, of a larger \nscale and trying to get closer to the consumer. You have small \nproducers as well, such as my family, who are small producers and who \noften will link up with bigger sized producers and feed yards to try to \nget more money for their cattle. Everybody is trying to get more money \nfor their cattle, and that is what I want to take place: more money for \nthe producer for the cattle.\n  Unfortunately, because of the way this is drafted and because of \nbeing a lawyer and being somebody in the agricultural industry--and you \nare taking away: regardless of any alleged business justification. So \nmy family says we are going to try this hormone-free, antibiotic-free \nbeef, but we have to pool together at a feed yard that is big enough to \nnegotiate with the packers to do this, and so they do that. We have \n1,000 head of cattle from everybody--all 20 or more people who are \ndoing this--and then they are going to market it directly on forward. \nThat is a business justification to pay my family more for their \ncattle. That is a business justification for them to do it.\n  But we have taken it right out of here. We have said: regardless of \nany alleged business justification.\n  So, now, while my family is trying to move with this packer group \nthrough the feed yard to get closer to the consumer to take advantage \nof this, which is a business justification, this says, no, you can't \nassume that in the Packers and Stockyards Act. So somebody on the other \nside of this, or somebody just wanting to be ornery about it says: \nLook, you can't do that. You can't do it. It is right here.\n  I know the author's intent is not that intent. I also am a lawyer. \nThis is something you can do under this draft of it. I appreciate the \nsentiment with which this is made. I appreciate the history of the \nPackers and Stockyards Act. It has been important. It remains important \ntoday. This isn't the way to get at this. This is going to cause people \nto have to go back to a generic marketplace for beef. You can say: \nWell, I am fine with a generic marketplace for beef--most people are--\nbut there are a lot of people who like specialty beef. That is where \nthe producer gets in and gets a bigger slice of the pie is when he goes \nat the narrow marketplace for a specialty-type product and segments his \nmarketplace. This, I honestly believe, is going to cut off these types \nof arrangements for farm families in my State, and I believe a lot of \nother places, to be able to get into them.\n  I understand the intent. I look at it on the surface, and we could \nprobably say good idea, but this is something whereby lawyers who \npractice in this field are going to see a real opportunity to shut \nsomething off, and I think there are plenty of people who are desirous \nof doing something like that. I would urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Senator from Montana yield me some time, \nplease?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Why don't you say how much I can have.\n  Mr. TESTER. How much do you want?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TESTER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what the Senator from Montana is trying \nto do has to be done if we are going to have justice for the family \nfarmer. We have been involved in suits regarding the packing houses for \n20 years. I remember when I first came to Congress, we were trying to \noverturn the Illinois Brick case because it stood in the way of the \nfamily farmer getting justice in business. So you end up fighting the \nNational Manufacturers Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to \nbring justice to family farmers.\n  Finally, in a lawsuit down in Alabama, we get a jury who says the \nfamily farmer is right, but you get a judge who overrules the jury.\n  Now, I want to speak about not just this particular case, because \nSenator Tester is doing that, but I hope everybody in this Senate \nremembers that on several different occasions, everybody in the food \nchain beyond the farmer's gate was lining up against the farmer. I will \ncite just a recent example in regard to food and fuel and the ethanol \nissue and corn going to $4 and the price of food going up and every \nfarmer getting blamed for it. Every person in the food chain outside of \nthe farmer's gate was involved in that conspiracy that had nothing to \ndo with the price of food rising, but the family farmer got blamed for \nit when food went to $4--or when corn went to $4. But when the price of \ncorn went down to $2.85, I didn't see the price of food go down. But \nthe conspiracy exists.\n  This court case and this judge and this ruling on the Packers and \nStockyards Act is contributing to that conspiracy. We need to get \nbehind it and get some justice for the family farmer.\n  Now, if you want to know why there is a justification in doing what \nwe are doing, all you have to do is go to a statement that a CEO of a \nmajor corporation made a few years ago--a little bit unrelated to this, \nbut somewhat related to it--which is: Why do slaughterhouses and \npacking companies own livestock? We own livestock, the answer was, in a \nvery candid way; we own livestock because when prices are high, we kill \nour own, and when prices are low, we buy from the farmer.\n  What we need is a marketplace that has a great deal of transparency. \nWe fight, trying to get information on sales from these packing \ncompanies under price discovery. We pass legislation to make price \ndiscovery real. Then we get regulations from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture--we get regulations from the U.S. Department of\n\n[[Page S15397]]\n\nAgriculture to the extent that we do not meet the goals of the \nlegislation, and we don't get as much information under the regulations \nof the Department.\n  I had a staff person who just wanted to go back to Iowa and work for \nthe Department of Agriculture. He is going to work for the Packers and \nStockyards Act. I said to him: You know, you want to go there because \nyou don't want to do anything, because they don't do anything to help \nthe family farmer. I didn't change his mind. He is still there working, \nand I hope he is doing a good job. He knows how I feel about it. Maybe \nhe will actually get something done.\n  But we have to get rid of this attitude that you are going to let \neverybody beyond the farmer's gate gang up on the farmers, particularly \nwhen there is a court case where the jury is giving justice to the \nfarmers.\n  We have to pass this amendment so we get justice for the family \nfarmer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, can I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The supporters of the amendment have 7 minutes \n30 seconds; the opponents have 10 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nRoberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend from Iowa \nwho is shaking the hand of my good friend from Montana that justice and \nconspiracy are in the eyes of the beholder. I thank him for his feeling \nfor agriculture and his passion for all of agriculture and all that he \nrepresents. He is an outstanding champion of agriculture. However, in \nthis particular case, I don't agree.\n  I am going to use an example. Instead of cattle, I am going to use \nhogs. If producer A contracts with five neighboring producers to supply \nhis contract with packer A, but he decides he only wants to buy from \nneighbor 1 and 2 because the others are currently having animal health \nissues, as referenced by my distinguished colleague from Kansas, the \nothers are having these health issues impacting that producer A's \nperformance and pricing. Neighbors 3 and 4 and 5 under this amendment \ncan sue producer A because--yes, they have been injured because they \nare no longer selling hogs to producer A. So producer A's business \ndefense is that animal disease issues in the barns of neighbors 3, 4, \nand 5 are producing weak performers, and he made a business decision to \nnot buy from them.\n  The Tester amendment simply takes away that defense. This is hogs, \nnot cattle. So producer A will lose and have to pay damages and \nattorney's fees. I don't think that is the road we want to go down.\n  Now, 20 years ago the beef industry lost market share. There have \nbeen a lot of studies as to why. Many livestock associations, State by \nState by State, knew they were losing market share while producing what \nis now defined as a generic commodity. Through innovation and \nmanagement of genetics, premium products have been developed, and the \nconsumer has responded. I mentioned the variety of products the \nconsumers wish to buy and do buy. To return to this market scenario of \n20 years will be a loss to consumers, a loss to producers, and, quite \nfrankly, I am going to warn, there will be a movement to increase \nimports to meet these demands. If, in fact, this packer cannot get this \nparticular product for a consumer demand and we have a generic \ncommodity and we will not produce that, he will go overseas. He will \nask for beef imports. That will be one of the laws of unintended \neffects.\n  I urge the defeat of the Tester amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Kansas for their \ntime. I appreciate a good discussion on the amendment. If they would \nnot have come to the floor, we would not have had this good discussion. \nI also thank Senators Grassley and Harkin for cosponsoring this \namendment. I particularly thank Senator Harkin for his comments on the \nfloor, and also Senator Grassley for his comments.\n  Senator Grassley and I are arguably the two folks in the Senate who \nare in production agriculture. I am very proud of that fact personally. \nI know Senator Grassley is, too. I know everybody in this body wants to \nmake sure that people in production agriculture get a fair shake--not \nover and above what they deserve but a fair shake. That is what the \nfarmers want and what this bill is supposed to be about.\n  In this body, we all know you can only make good decisions if you \nhave good information. We also know if you take just three words--and I \nwill admit this is called the ``no justification amendment.'' But if \nyou take those three words and set aside all of the other words around \nit, they don't mean a heck of a lot. You can interpret them to mean \nanything you want. I am not an attorney. I respect those in this body \nwho are and folks around this country who are. But you need to take the \nentire bill and look at the language as it is inserted into the bill.\n  If a farmer or rancher has health issues with their herd, whether it \nis pork, chickens, beef, or any other livestock they are marketing for \nfood purposes, they don't have to buy it. That isn't restraining trade \nor commerce. That is not creating a monopoly. That is what those words \nrevolve around--those three words--``no business justification.'' You \nhave to take at least the segment before, if you are going to get an \nidea of what it says. It says the effect of restraining commerce or \ncreating a monopoly ``regardless of any alleged business \njustification.''\n  If you want to put the boots to the ranchers--it won't happen all the \ntime, and let's hope it happens very little. In fact, if they don't put \nthis amendment on the farm bill to make the Packers and Stockyards bill \nwhat it was when it was originally passed in 1921, you are not going to \nhave a free market system. You are going to have a system where the \nfour major packers can manipulate the marketplace when they feel like \nit. They may never feel like it. But if times get tough, what the heck, \nmake a few extra bucks and keep the stockholders happy.\n  It was talked about today that it is going to make beef or pork into \na generic commodity. I led the charge on country-of-origin labeling in \nMontana. We passed it in 2005. I want our products to be different. I \nam all in favor of certified Angus beef and grassfed and all those \nspecialized things that the consumer wants. This bill doesn't take that \nability away. If you have sick cattle, you don't have to buy them. If \nyou have Angus certified beef, you can market it that way, as long as \nit meets their criteria--certified Angus beef I am talking about, not \nstockyards.\n  In fact, this is good for production agriculture. Senator Grassley \ntalked about farm gate prices. If you want to hold them artificially \nlow and keep putting in subsidies, these are the kinds of things you \ndo. If you want to have a free market system where people get a fair \nprice for a fair day's work for the product they worked so hard to get \non the market, the family farms and ranchers--cow/calf operators, in \nthis particular case--this amendment needs to be passed.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. TESTER. In closing, there are no unintended consequences here. \nThis is straightforward. If you read the language as it goes in the \nPackers and Stockyards Act, it can be interpreted no other way other \nthan if a company wants to restrain commerce or create a monopoly, \nperiod.\n  It will stop packers from, as Senator Grassley talked about, dumping \ncattle when prices are high. It will make the market work better.\n  In closing, I again thank the Senators from Kansas. I thank Senator \nGrassley and Senator Harkin. I ask this body to take this amendment for \nwhat it is. It is an amendment that will indeed support family farm \ncow/calf producers on the ranches of this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes. The opposition has 7 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page S15398]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. We have a couple more speakers who are on the way. As \nsoon as they arrive, we will yield time to them.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I will speak after they get done, so I \nwill retain my 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I appreciate the generous offer from the \nranking member.\n  This is tough. Senator Tester is a friend, but he is misguided. The \nfact is that the law today has served us well in this country. I think \nit is vitally important for all Senators to realize that agriculture is \na business that reacts and changes to market demands.\n  We have put legislation into place that allows the markets to \noperate, and these laws serve as guidelines for farmers in how they \nmake their business plans for the future. As a matter of fact, we are \nthe envy of the rest of the world. The agricultural markets in this \ncountry, the hogs raised and sold and eaten, the chickens and the \nturkeys--and in North Carolina's case, we rank extremely high; we are \nNo. 2 in hogs and turkey production. I daresay every person in the \nroom, and even in America, has eaten pork from North Carolina at one \npoint or another. One of the reasons hog farmers in my State have been \nable to grow and produce the best pork in the world is the regulatory \nforces that govern the livestock industry.\n\n  What we are being asked to do in this amendment is to turn that on \nits head. Today, current law says if a producer wants to bring suit \nagainst a processor for injuries to the producer's business, they have \nto show that they have actually been injured. Let me restate that. \nCurrent law says if a producer wants to bring suit against a processor \nfor injuries to the producer's business, they have to show they have \nactually been injured. That is a threshold that ought to be for \neverything that a suit is brought on.\n  Let me put in practical terms exactly what the Tester amendment would \ndo. It would say that a company that contracts with a producer, a \ngrower, and because they have determined that that grower has exceeded \nthe minimum standards, has done things that technologically enhanced \nthe products they are going to purchase, that if they reward them by \npaying them more money because the product is better, they are now \nsusceptible to a grower who may not be dealing with 10,000 hogs, he may \nbe dealing with 10 hogs. He might not adapt his surroundings to the new \ntechnologies; therefore, the meat is not as good. But if they are not \npaid the same, he will go to court and sue that he should have been \npaid the same thing as the contract for 10,000.\n  What is the net result of it? If I were in a State that had smaller \nproducers who felt disadvantaged from a price, I might look at it \ndifferently, but what is the impact? The impact is that companies are \nnot going to raise everybody's boat, they are going to lower \neverybody's boat. They are going to pay every producer less. There will \nbe no incentive for new technologies to go into agriculture--\nspecifically hogs, turkeys, and chickens. There will be no choice for \nconsumers between grades of products, some that taste better than \nothers, because we will now dumb down to what this new standard is, and \nthat standard will be to make sure you are not susceptible to lawsuits. \nEverybody, regardless of size, regardless of the quality of the \nproduct, will be paid the same.\n  I will say that again. Regardless of the quality, regardless of the \nsize of the purchase, because of this one little change, which is that \nyou have to prove you were injured, producers will be obligated. You \nmight say it is their choice; but if a choice is between being sued \nevery time there are contracts that say different things, or accepting \none standard and applying that to everybody, they are going to accept \none standard and apply it to everybody because they cannot pass on the \nlitigation costs of these foods.\n  Please tell me when 1 minute is left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BURR. I hope my colleagues here understand that the law, as \ncurrently written, works. It has served this country well and it has \nproduced choice, it has produced quality, and it has fairly reimbursed \nall who entered into it. Let's not change it, and let's make sure the \nproducts that America has chosen and continues to choose in the \nmarketplace are driven by the marketplace, not manipulated by this body \nin Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina, \nmy comrade in the Russell Building. I appreciate his comments. You have \nto have good information to make a good decision. There are a couple of \nthings I need to point out. First, in production agriculture, we are \nnot price makers, we are price takers. When you have 80 percent \nconsolidation in the meat\npacking industry, you don't have much choice when they don't have this \nlanguage in the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  If you are talking about rewarding a grower because they have less \nfat, or bigger ribeye size, or leaner beef, this doesn't stop that from \nhappening. I believe there are enough attorneys in the room that if you \nread this Packers and Stockyard Act in its entirety, which is about a \npage, you will find out that the alleged business justification applies \nto when you are restraining commerce or creating a monopoly. If you \nwant a free market system, which you talked about, this body needs to \npass this amendment so there is a free market in the pork, poultry, \nbeef industry. Pork, by the way, is more consolidated than beef. \nChickens are worse yet. All I want for farmers and ranchers and the \npeople in production agriculture--the cow/calf operators, in \nparticular--is that they get a fair shake.\n  If we pass this amendment No. 3666, you will allow those cow/calf \noperators to get a fair shake in the marketplace and be able to become \nfinancially viable, so this Government doesn't have to talk about \nsubsidies, and they can get their paycheck from the marketplace, and it \nis a fair paycheck.\n  With that, I ask the Senate to vote for this amendment. I thank my \nfellow Members for the good debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been requested \non this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Parliamentary inquiry as to whether this could be a \nvoice vote so we can move on. We have a number of amendments. I inquire \nas to that issue. I will suggest the absence of a quorum to sort this \nissue through. We might be able to save the body some time. I wish to \nspeak with people about it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3720 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Schumer \namendment No. 3720 be withdrawn.\n\n[[Page S15399]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3640\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment, the \nTester amendment, be set aside and amendment 3640 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the Tester \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on or in relation to \nthe Tester amendment occur at a time to be determined later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request from the senior \nSenator from Idaho, Mr. Craig? If not, the amendment is once again \npending. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, earlier on, we thought we had a 40-minute \ntime agreement. We are going to start the debate on this amendment. \nSome of our colleagues want to discuss it. With that in mind, let me \nopen the debate on amendment No. 3640, an amendment we think is \ncritical to America's farmers and ranchers and the value of private \nproperty.\n  Ever since the Supreme Court in 2005 decided on the Kelo decision, I \nhave felt and many others have felt, including the American Farm \nBureau, that America's farmers' and ranchers' property is now at a \ngreater risk today than ever before by the issuance of eminent domain, \nor the broadening of the power of Government as it relates to that \nissue.\n  I debated this amendment earlier. Several of my colleagues are on the \nfloor and want to debate this amendment. Let me now turn to my \ncolleague from Colorado, the senior Senator, Mr. Allard, and yield to \nhim 10 minutes for the purpose of debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nleadership on this particular issue. I am involved because farmers and \nranchers all over the country are being impacted by their land values \nsince the Supreme Court's ruling in Kelo.\n  As was stated by the Farm Bureau, farmers and ranchers have been \nparticularly vulnerable to States or local municipalities taking their \nland for private economic uses, open space or other purposes.\n  Farmlands in several States have already been taken for open space \npurposes. The Farm Bureau goes on to say the amendment would strongly \ndiscourage the exercise of eminent domain for open space purposes.\n  I have a strong record of supporting limitations on eminent domain. I \nhave to rise on behalf of my farmers and ranchers in Colorado in \nsupport of Senator Craig's amendment. This amendment would protect \nfarmland and ranchland throughout this great Nation from land \ncondemnation for use as open space.\n  I wish to be clear at the outset that this amendment would not affect \nuses of eminent domain that have been found to be justified. There are \na few legitimate uses for eminent domain powers. Necessary use of \neminent domain for items such as utility corridors or military and \nnational security needs would not be affected.\n  America's farmers and ranchers are some of the best land managers \naround. Not only do they manage their land in a manner making it the \nmost productive in the world but also in a way that makes it some of \nthe most scenic land in our country and certainly a valuable way of \nkeeping open space because of the nature of their operations.\n  The vistas of rural America possess some of the most remarkable \nscenery in the world. However, while their beauty is remarkable, their \ntrue value lies in the foods and fibers they produce.\n  An unsettling trend is now unfolding in small towns and rural \ncommunities from coast to coast. The use of eminent domain to condemn \nworking agricultural lands or lands that will be transferred from one \nprivate property owner to another. This is an expansive use of eminent \ndomain.\n  This condemnation results not only in weakening our national security \nby threatening our food supply but harms the economies of rural America \nand steals--yes, steals--private land from rightful owners.\n  Senator Craig's amendment, which I support, along with Senator \nBrownback, would discourage this disturbing occurrence. It prohibits \naccess to Federal financial assistance for a period of 5 years to any \nState or unit of local government choosing to exercise the use of \neminent domain to take working agricultural ground for the purpose of \nopen space.\n  This reasonable and measured approach would help protect America's \nagricultural land by making governments weigh the need of taking land \nagainst their desire for Federal funds.\n  Senators should remember the right to own property was one of the key \nprinciples on which this Nation was founded. I daresay that if the \nFounding Fathers were here today, they would support passage of Senator \nCraig's amendment.\n  As Thomas Jefferson noted in 1775 in the Declaration on Taking Up \nArms:\n\n       The political institutions of America, its various soils \n     and climates, opened a certain resource to the unfortunate \n     and to the enterprising of every country and insured them the \n     acquisition and free possession of property.\n\n  Let me say this again: ``The free possession of property'' is the \nprinciple the Craig amendment supports. I have a long legislative \nrecord of supporting the rights of the private property owner. The \nState of Colorado also has a long record of opposition to the taking of \nprivate property. As a Senator, I believe it is important to ensure \nthat private property owners are able to retain possession of their \nland. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. Working with \nwilling sellers is the right way. Condemning working agricultural land \nfor open space is the wrong way. I urge my colleagues to listen to \ntheir conscience and support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We are operating under an open time agreement. With that \nin mind, I yield 10 minutes to our agricultural counsel from the great \nState of Kansas, Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am the senior Senator from Kansas to \nSenator Roberts. I wanted to acknowledge that on the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I said ``counsel.''\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I was called the junior Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's mistake. I apologize.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Presiding Officer. I appreciate that \ngreatly. I always need to watch my junior Senator and make sure he is \nin his place.\n  Mr. President, I note, properly, my junior Senator is the dean of the \nKansas delegation, even if he is the junior Senator.\n  I rise in support of the Craig amendment. I wish to make comments \nthat I think are pertinent and germane to the farm bill because I \nbelieve this admendment is pertinent and germane to the farm bill. I \nknow colleagues are looking at this amendment saying it is a private \nproperty rights issue, it belongs in the Judiciary Committee and this \nis an issue we should track through that committee. This is an issue \ninvolving agricultural lands, which I think is wholly appropriate for \nthe farm bill.\n  Also, private property issues are so key and central to farming in \nthe United States. It is in many places dominantly private property \nissues. In the West, there are a lot of public lands and agricultural \nuse in public lands areas. But private rights dominates throughout the \nagricultural system of our country. There was a shock sent out with the \nKelo case when the Court said you now don't have to have this \njustification of a public use for private property to be taken and can \ncondemn it.\n  Many were shocked on all sides of the aisle--right, left, middle, \npeople in urban areas, people in rural areas. I wish to say \nspecifically people from rural areas were particularly struck by this \ndecision because they all feel an\n\n[[Page S15400]]\n\nattack frequently from people in governmental entities to take lands \nfor power lines, parks, land that should go back to them in some cases, \nif it is a railroad line that has been abandoned and the deed said the \nland will revert to the farmland owner and then it is taken for a \ntrail. People are saying wait a minute, I thought we had private \nproperty rights, basic in our constitution, basic in our philosophy, \nbasic to agriculture.\n\n  This is a narrow issue to get at the Kelo decision. It is well \ncrafted by the Senator from Idaho to support those private property \nrights. The amendment will deter States and local governments from \ntaking working agricultural land against the will of the landowner only \nto designate that same land as open space. Here I think you can look at \nthat and say, well, obviously, that is something we should protect, \nthat private property right. If there is to be eminent domain, it has \nto be listed on a public purpose, like we have had eminent domain laws \nfor some period of time now, and not just taking it to keep an open \nspace. If that is to take place, there needs to be a different set and \na different system rather than what is being allowed or expanded after \nKelo by local or State units of government.\n  This narrows the decision of Kelo back to what it was prior to Kelo--\na protection of private property rights. I think that is important. I \nthink it is a key issue and one that is a top priority to agriculture \nand landowners. Indeed, the President of the American Farm Bureau \nFederation said after Kelo:\n\n       No one's home or farm and ranch land is safe from \n     government seizure because of this ruling.\n\n  Well, let's make sure their land is safe. We can do that, and this is \nan amendment that helps to do that. I think it is an important \namendment to help to do that. If you voted in support of private \nproperty rights, I would hope you would support the Craig amendment, \nwhichever side of the aisle you are on, and say there is an appropriate \nway and there is an inappropriate way and the appropriate way to make \nsure you have eminent domain is for a public purpose and not just \ntaking agricultural lands to maintain open spaces and reducing the \nvalue of that land or its workability as agriculture.\n  This is an important, good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield back to the sponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, it is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand this is a private property rights debate. For some who have \nsaid, well, this is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee--and \nI understand the other side is going to ask for a 60-vote threshold--\none of the reasons we are on the floor in a post-Kelo decision \nenvironment is because things are beginning to happen out there that \nfrustrate all of us.\n  My colleague from Kansas echoes the sentiment of the American Farm \nBureau and their president, speaking out about the risk now that open \nspace property, farming property, ranching property has as a result of \nKelo. Some would say on the floor it doesn't appear to be a problem. \nLet me suggest it is.\n  In Scattaway, NJ, a family protested its eviction from their 75-acre \nfarm the town had seized under eminent domain for an open space \ndesignation. That happened in New Jersey. In Woodland, CA, in Yolo \nCounty, CA, the board of supervisors decided to seize a large area of \nfarmland using eminent domain and declared the property open space. So \nhere a government entity steps in and says: We are going to take open \nspace and make it open space and we are going to use our power to do \nthat--no willing seller, no willing buyer, a new shaping of eminent \ndomain.\n  Eminent domain, as we knew it pre-Kelo, said, public use for a \nlegitimate public use, and that usually almost always fell into rights \nof way, roads, power lines, and those kinds of things where, for the \npublic good, access was being denied.\n  Kelo tipped that upside down.\n  New Brunswick, NJ. New Brunswick moved forward to condemn, using its \npower of eminent domain, a 104-acre farm. Open space again. Telluride, \nCO. The senior Senator from Colorado was on the floor supporting our \namendment. The town decided to use its power of eminent domain to take \nabout 570 acres of an 800-acre ranch and designate the property as open \nspace. Once again, the power is being used.\n  That is why America's farmers and ranchers and America's agricultural \norganizations that represent them grow increasingly alarmed.\n  Sussex County, NJ. The State of New Jersey used its power of eminent \ndomain to take 17 acres of working agricultural property to create a \nwetlands. Open space again.\n  Matthews, NC. York County, PA. York County, PA, was the one I used as \nI introduced this amendment a couple days ago, where the family fought, \ninvested lots of money, and took on the county. As a result, two county \nsupervisors were defeated in the election because they were going after \nprivate property for an open space designation, and the county said: \nOh, no, you don't; you are out. Ultimately, the family won but at great \nexpense defending their right of private property.\n  That is why the American Farm Bureau has said this is a high priority \nfor us.\n  Madam President, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, dissenting in Kelo v. \nthe City of New London, which has tipped this eminent domain issue \nupside down, said this in her dissenting views, and it is so clear \ntoday the vision of this justice.\n\n       The outfall from this decision will not be random. The \n     beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with \n     disproportionate influence and power in the political \n     process, including large corporations and development firms. \n     As for the victims, the government now has license to \n     transfer property from those with fewer resources to those \n     with more.\n\n  She spoke with great wisdom, particularly about the victims--those \nare the property owners--because that is exactly what is happening out \nthere.\n  Is open space necessary? You bet it is. Does open space have value? \nYou bet it does. There is no question in an urbanizing environment, \nparks and parkland and open space is critical. Why not willing seller/\nwilling buyer? Why not go into the market as a city that has taxing \npower or a county that has taxing power ought to do and say, you know, \nwe are going to raise a bit to go out and buy a piece of open property, \ninstead of taking it? Now, yes, they compensate in eminent domain, but \nthey basically establish the price. They do not have to compete.\n  So Kelo tipped us upside down, because in New London, as we remember, \nthe city used their right to take away private property and gave it to \na private developer because there was someone who was holding up a \ndevelopment. They were trying to hold onto their land. This is a \ncritical private property rights debate and so very necessary.\n  I mentioned the family in Pennsylvania. For over 3 years, in \nPennsylvania, that family fought their local government. How do you do \nit? You hire attorneys. Attorneys are expensive. You do the battle, you \nset up the legal case, because the county--in this instance the county \ngovernment--wanted to take the land. As I mentioned, it didn't sit well \nwith the citizens. Most citizens respect the right of private property. \nMost citizens understand that under our Constitution, there is a \nlegitimate purpose for taking, and it was called eminent domain when \nthe public good and the public value was clear.\n  That is the issue. It is quite simple. Now, is it a judiciary issue? \nYes, it is. It is also an agricultural, farm bill issue. The reason I \nam on the floor with the amendment is because this taking is beginning \nto accelerate across our Nation and our Judiciary Committee has done \nnothing, to date, to reshape the Kelo decision, to protect the rights \nof the private property owner beyond the legitimate public good, and it \nis an important thing we do. That is why we are speaking out at this \nmoment, and that is why it is important.\n  I yield to the chairman of the Senate Ag Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have read the Senator's amendment. I have sat and read \nthe whole thing.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is quite simple.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is quite simple. It doesn't take a lot of time to read \nit. Then I listened to the Senator talk about the Kelo decision.\n\n[[Page S15401]]\n\n  I am not a fan of the Kelo decision either, but it seems to me the \nway the amendment is written--and I ask the Senator this--if someone, \nif a private farmer had farmland, and a private developer came in and \ngot the local jurisdiction to condemn that farmland and take it for \nprivate development, that would be allowed under your amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Our amendment speaks to open space versus open space.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the question, though.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not disagree with your interpretation of the current \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is what I wanted to make clear; that the Kelo \ndecision----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Well, I would like to have gone further than that. The \nconcern we had, and what appears to be most visible today in the new \nuse of Kelo, is open space for open space. Municipalities and counties \nare stepping out--with the cases I gave, Mr. Chairman--and saying that \nfor purposes of parks, we find this is a new tool. Historically, parks \nwere willing seller/willing buyer, and wetlands, and now other broader \ninterpretations of ``public good.''\n  But Kelo, being specific and relating to private government entities \ntaking property for private development, we do not speak to that. We \nthink it is a broader issue that the judiciary ought to speak to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding and engaging in this \ncolloquy. I was listening to the Senator talk about the Kelo decision, \nbut the Senator's amendment doesn't reach the Kelo decision.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Oh, I disagree totally.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, if you allow----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me respond. When the Senator says we \ndon't reach the Kelo decision, we reach a portion of the Kelo decision \nthat is now most frequently impacting farms and ranches, and that is \nopen space for open space.\n  Municipalities and counties and in one instance, as I cited, a State, \nprior to Kelo, were not using these powers of eminent domain to acquire \nopen space. They were going out and buying it in the market and \ncompeting for it. Now they are. So Kelo, in fact, is being used for \nthis purpose. That is why we are addressing this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will have more to say about that later, but let me ask \nanother question.\n  Under the Senator's amendment--I wish to make sure I read it \ncorrectly--if a local jurisdiction--planning and zoning--decided to \ncondemn some land or to take land for a park, if the amendment were \nadopted and put into law, that would mean that jurisdiction, whatever \nthat jurisdiction is--it could be a county or a State--couldn't even \nget any money for education. No title I money for education. They could \nnot get special education money. Let's say, money for special \neducation, they wouldn't be able to get that either; is that a correct \nreading? For 5 years, they couldn't get that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If it were open and currently operating farmland and/or \npasture land.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. For agricultural purposes, and they did that for open \nspace purposes, there would obviously, if this were law today, be a \ngreat debate in that community. That community would say, you cannot \nuse this power and put our educational monies at risk.\n  We say, yes, Government monies, Federal Government monies. So it \nwould clearly have a dampening effect. You and I both know, because we \nhave been at those different levels of government, that there are \nthresholds by which a planning and zoning entity of a county or a \nmunicipality can and cannot operate. Would it have a chilling effect? \nYes. It would stop them from doing that. That is the intent. Would it \nput the educational money in jeopardy? No, it wouldn't because they \nwouldn't put it in jeopardy.\n  You can use scare tactics, you can create, if you will, stalking \nkinds of arguments. But you and I both know, in practicality, they are \nnot going to put those other values at risk. Sewage and water money and \nall of the kinds of other things that you and I work hard to get for \nour communities--that is not going to be put at risk because what is \ngoing to happen is they are going to quit using the Kelo decision. They \nare going to quit using eminent domain in its broadest sense until this \nCongress gets back in the business of shaping it again. That is why we \nare doing what we are doing here.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think, then, we get to the crux of this issue. What the \namendment of the Senator does is it has the Federal Government telling \na local entity, a local government or a State government what it can \nand cannot do within its own jurisdiction.\n  This is a very powerful Federal Government, a heavy hand coming in \ntelling people that we know better than they what they should be doing.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator knows as well as I do that, with wetlands, \nwith endangered species, you name it, the Federal Government, by law, \nby statute, by regulation, by Clean Water Act, does a lot of things. It \nis hard to deny that we do because local entities operate under those \nlaws. We are simply asking local entities, in their exercise of eminent \ndomain, to operate within the law. This amendment, broadly supported by \nAmerican agriculture for fear of taking of their land, and by the \nlivestock industry, and by the Public Land Council and others, says: \nNo, don't do that.\n  You can point out, if you will, those kinds of arguments. But they \nare hollow in the sense that we constantly do that, and we have done \nthat. Local governments operate under both local jurisdiction, local \nlaw, State and Federal law. So I do not see that as a problem. It can \nbe argued, but it is not precedent setting in any sense of the word.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Idaho that all of the things he \nmentioned--the Clean Water Act and all that kind of stuff--we can get \ninto that, but, yes, if a local entity violates that, they are subject \nto certain sanctions, usually fines.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. They are not subject to losing all their Federal money \nfor education, for health, for transportation, for everything else--\nnothing like that. I know of no instance like that in any Federal \nlegislation. If the Senator can find one for me I would appreciate it. \nI can't.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not disagree with the Senator. I believe the taking \nof a person's wealth--and you and I in farm and ranch company know the \nassets of a farmer and rancher are tied in the land. It is their bank. \nIt is their savings. It is their retirement. Some even like to pass it \ndown generationally.\n  To have a municipality flex a new muscle that grew out of a decision \nat the Supreme Court level because of an entity in Connecticut using it \nis ominous and needs to have powerful teeth in it to say to that local \nmunicipality or county: Thou shalt not, for these very narrow purposes, \nuse eminent domain.\n  I am saying you and I come from farm country. We know how valuable \nthat land is. It is that farmer's or that rancher's savings. It is \ntheir retirement, should they choose to sell it, and they can sell it \nto the city for a park if they want to. But for a county or city to \nstep in and take the land when you want to hand it to your daughter or \nyour son or your grandson, generationally, to pass it down through for \nagricultural purposes--there ought to be teeth, very powerful teeth. I \nthink counties and cities ought not be allowed to do it, period.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But it seems to me, I say to my friend, those are the \ngovernments that are closest to the people, rather than some distant \ngovernment in Washington telling them what they can and cannot do. \nPlus, I say to my friend from Idaho, with all due respect, this did not \ngrow out of the Kelo decision. Local governments have had the power of \neminent domain probably going back to the founding of our Republic. I \nwas trying to find out exactly when, but probably the early 1800s, \nmaybe the 1700s.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have under the Constitution for ``the defined public \ngood,'' and the defined public good was very clear, and we defined it \nin statute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But I say to my friend, defined public good has been \nparks and recreation areas and things like that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But they have not--excuse me. Senator?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Idaho I am sure he has visited \nGettysburg. Gettysburg National Park would not be a national park were \nit not for\n\n[[Page S15402]]\n\nthe power of the State of Pennsylvania to have the right of eminent \ndomain because that is what they used. They had to use it in order to \nget that land together for Gettysburg Park. I say to my friend, with \nall due respect, it is a national historical monument. But that is what \nthey had to use to do it.\n  Should Washington have been able to tell them no, you can't do that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Right in the middle of Gettysburg is a private operating \nfarm today. The reason it is there is because they would not allow it \nto be condemned, and they did not meet the threshold price of a willing \nseller, willing buyer. The State of Pennsylvania, for rights-of-ways of \nroad, but other than that in almost every instance in my knowledge as \nit relates to Gettysburg, bought it, acquired it, and they used Federal \nmoney to get it and they used the Federal Park Service and a variety of \nother tools.\n  No, there is something new happening out there in a post-Kelo \nenvironment. You need to talk to your Farm Bureau in your State, and \nothers, and your cattlemen and other farm organizations. Something new \nis happening in farmland, especially those lands adjacent to rapidly \nexpanding urban environments. It is happening in a post-Kelo \nenvironment. That is why we are addressing it today on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, again, the amendment doesn't even go \nto Kelo because my friend admitted a local government could condemn, \neminent domain, take private farmland for a private developer. Under \nhis amendment they can still do that.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. We don't speak to that. We speak to the issue at hand \ntoday: taking private farmland in municipalities and urban areas, \ncounties and States, for the purpose of open land, and that is a post-\nKelo phenomenon.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It has been that way, as I say, going back to Gettysburg. \nThey did use eminent domain in Gettysburg.\n  Mr. CRAIG. They did use some, yes, I don't deny that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. They carved out some sections where they didn't think \nthey needed them, but they did on some other sections. So it has been \nthat way forever. Kelo didn't open floodgates. What it did was open \nfloodgates for private, and that I find anathema; that you could use \neminent domain for some private purpose. But for a public purpose such \nas parks and recreation and things like that, it has been this way \nsince the founding of our Republic, I say to my friend.\n  My friend, I know is a conservative. It seems to me conservatives are \nalways looking askance at the Federal Government coming in, \nheavyhanded, and telling local jurisdictions what they can and cannot \ndo. This, it seems to me, would be the heaviest hand that I have seen \nin my years here.\n  My friend is right. We, a lot of times, do pass laws, Clean Air Acts, \nthings like that that he mentioned, and we impose fines if they don't \ndo something. But we don't say if you violate it, we are taking away \nyour education money, your health money, your transportation money, and \neverything else. I just know of no other case like that in Federal law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we have not yet a time limit. I have \nexpressed the will and concern of those who are cosponsors of the \namendment. I put into the record the expression of our largest national \nfarm organization that sees the threat as clearly as I do, maybe less \nclear than the chairman sees it because there is a pattern rapidly \ngrowing out there in a post-Kelo environment--open space taken for open \nspace purposes. They are taking it from the private landowner. We think \nthere ought to be strong teeth here.\n  With that, I retain the remainder of my time. Others are here to \ndebate the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I just have a few minutes. I know we \nwant to get to the Brown amendment. The Senator from Ohio has been very \npatient, waiting a couple of days to get to his amendment. I appreciate \nthat. I have just a couple of things I wanted to respond to.\n  First, regarding the Craig amendment, I have here a letter dated \nDecember 11 from the National League of Cities, the National Conference \nof State Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the Council \nof State Governments, all writing in opposition to the Craig amendment.\n  It says--I just want to read what they said in this letter:\n\n       This amendment is not only ill-advised, but it is also \n     unconstitutional. Amendment No. 3640 would preempt state and \n     local land use laws by prohibiting any federal funding that \n     goes to state and local governments from being used for \n     acquiring ``farmland or gracing land for the purpose of a \n     park, recreation, open space, conservation, preservation \n     view, scenic vista, or similar purpose.'' This would severely \n     chill state and local historical preservation, community \n     service, and environmental efforts.\n       Under this amendment, if a state or locality were to use \n     the power of eminent domain for virtually any public purpose, \n     even if such action was completely in accordance with its own \n     statues and land use development ordinances and regulations, \n     the state or locality could lose all applicable federal \n     funding. The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution expressly \n     permits the taking of private property for public use \n     provided just compensation is provided to the owner of the \n     property.\n       The power of eminent domain has always been, and should \n     remain, a state and local power. The state power to use \n     eminent domain for public purposes is fundamental to a \n     state's and locality's ability to provide for the community \n     needs of its citizens, to protect unique and scenic areas of \n     a state by creating parks, and to preserve wildlife and \n     topography of a significant nature.\n       Again, we urge you to reject the Craig Amendment No. 3640 \n     because it preempts state and local law and thwarts valid \n     state and local efforts to preserve their natural resources \n     for the use and enjoyment of all citizens.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter representing the National League \nof Cities, the National Conference of State Legislatures, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the Council of State Governments be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chair, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we write in strong opposition to the amendment offered by \n     Sen. Larry Craig (No. 3640) to H.R. 2419, the ``Food and \n     Energy Security Act of 2007,'' which is scheduled for floor \n     debate today. This amendment is not only ill-advised, but it \n     is also unconstitutional. Amendment No. 3640 would preempt \n     state and local land use laws by prohibiting any federal \n     funding that goes to state and local governments from being \n     used for acquiring ``farmland or gracing land for the purpose \n     of a park, recreation, open space, conservation, preservation \n     view, scenic vista, or similar purpose.'' This would severely \n     chill state and local historical preservation, community \n     service, and environmental efforts.\n       Under this amendment, if a state or locality were to use \n     the power of eminent domain for virtually any public purpose, \n     even if such action was completely in accordance with its own \n     statues and land use development ordinances and regulations, \n     the state or locality could lose all applicable federal \n     funding. The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution expressly \n     permits the taking of private property for public use \n     provided just compensation is provided to the owner of the \n     property.\n       The power of eminent domain has always been, and should \n     remain, a state and local power. The state power to use \n     eminent domain for public purposes is fundamental to a \n     state's and locality's ability to provide for the community \n     needs of its citizens, to protect unique and scenic areas of \n     a state by creating parks, and to preserve wildlife and \n     topography of a significant nature.\n       Again, we urge you to reject the Craig Amendment No. 3640 \n     because it preempts state and local law and thwarts valid \n     state and local efforts to preserve their natural resources \n     for the use and enjoyment of all citizens.\n     Don Borut,\n       Executive Director, National League of Cities.\n     Carl Tubbesing,\n       Deputy Executive Director, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures.\n     Tom Cochran,\n       Executive Director, The U.S. Conference Of Mayors.\n     Jim Brown,\n       Washington Director, Council of State Governments.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a letter of December 11 from a number of \nenvironmental and wildlife groups: National Audubon Society, Defenders \nof Wildlife, National Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, the \nWilderness Society, the World Wildlife Fund and others, in opposition \nto the Craig amendment.\n\n[[Page S15403]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     Re Oppose Craig Farm Bill Amendment.\n\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry \n         Committee.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry \n         Committee.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of our members and supporters, we \n     strongly urge you to oppose the amendment Senator Craig (R-\n     ID) has introduced to the Food and Energy Security Act of \n     2007 that would prohibit all state, local, and federal use of \n     eminent domain to take farmland or grazing land into public \n     ownership for the purposes of a park, recreation, open space, \n     conservation, preservation view, scenic vista, or similar \n     purposes. It would impose severe sanctions on any state or \n     unit of local government that uses eminent domain for these \n     purposes--a five-year loss of financial assistance and all \n     federal funds appropriated through an Act of Congress or \n     otherwise expended by the Treasury. The Craig amendment \n     arbitrarily imposes absolute bans on certain longstanding \n     uses of eminent domain for public use while totally excluding \n     others, including prisons, public utilities, roads or rights \n     of way open to the public or common carriers, pipelines, and \n     similar uses.\n       Acquiring land by purchase or donation is preferable, but \n     there are times when eminent domain is necessary and \n     appropriate, both for the public uses that would always be \n     banned by the Craig amendment and those that would always be \n     allowed.\n       Congress and the courts have repeatedly recognized that \n     local, state, and national parks and recreation, open space, \n     conservation, preservation view, and scenic vistas are \n     clearly valuable public uses that justify eminent domain. For \n     example, the Congressional Research Service's Annotated \n     Constitution cites laws and cases upholding eminent domain, \n     including an 1896 Supreme Court decision confirming the right \n     to condemn in order to ``promote the general welfare'' by \n     preserving an historic site (the Gettysburg Battlefield) \n     for public use and protection.\n       ``E.g., Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U.S. 282 (1893) \n     (establishment of public park in District of Columbia); \n     Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, 262 U.S. 700 (1923) (scenic \n     highway); Brown v. United States, 263 U.S. 78 (1923) \n     (condemnation of property near town flooded by establishment \n     of reservoir in order to locate a new townsite, even though \n     there might be some surplus lots to be sold); United States \n     v. Gettysburg Electric Ry., 160 U.S. 668 (1896), and Roe v. \n     Kansas ex rel. Smith, 278 U.S. 191 (1929) (historic sites). \n     When time is deemed to be of the essence, Congress takes land \n     directly by statute, authorizing procedures by which owners \n     of appropriated land may obtain just compensation. See, e.g., \n     Pub. L. No. 90-545, Sec. 3, 82 Stat. 931 (1968), 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 79 (c) (taking land for creation of Redwood National \n     Park); Pub. L. No. 93-444, 88 Stat. 1304 (1974) (taking lands \n     for addition to Piscataway Park, Maryland); Pub. L. No. 100-\n     647, Sec. 10002 (1988) (taking lands for addition to Manassas \n     National Battlefield Park).''\n       The Craig amendment would be a draconian infringement on \n     federalism by the federal government into the traditional \n     rights of state and local governments. It would even ban uses \n     of eminent domain to clear title when no one objects.\n       The Craig amendment would devastate the ability of states, \n     localities, and the Federal governments to create and protect \n     public parks, to provide for conservation of essential \n     resources and recreation, and to preserve open space. \n     Sometimes, the ability to require a property owner to sell \n     property at a fair price is needed to deal with an \n     unjustifiable ``hold out'' who seeks to stop a worthy public \n     project, or to extort a monopolist's profits from the public.\n       Finally, as the Congressional Research Service explained \n     about a different proposal, there does not: ``seem to be any \n     proportionality requirement between the prohibited \n     condemnations and the length and scope of the federal funds \n     suspension. If Congress' Spending Power includes a \n     proportionality requirement for conditions on federal funds, \n     as the [Supreme] Court suggests, the absence of \n     proportionality in some of the bill's applications may raise \n     a constitutional issue.''\n       For all these reasons, we urge you to oppose the Craig \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jason Jordan, Government Affairs Manager, American \n           Planning Association; William Snape, Senior Counsel, \n           Center for Biological Diversity; Brian Hires, Colorado \n           Field Coordinator, Center for Native Ecosystems; Bob \n           Dreher, Vice President for Conservation Law, Defenders \n           of Wildlife; Anna Aurilio, Director, Washington DC \n           Office, Environment America; Brian Moore, Director, \n           Budget and Appropriations, National Audubon Society; \n           Karen Wayland, Legislative Director, Natural Resources \n           Defense Council.\n         Linda Lance, Vice-President for Public Policy, The \n           Wilderness Society; Doug Kendall, Executive Director, \n           Community Rights Counsel; Martin Hayden, Legislative \n           Director, Earthjustice; Sandra Schubert, JD, MA, \n           Director of Government Affairs, Environmental Working \n           Group; Julie M.

Madam President, I think the Craig amendment, about which \nI just engaged in a colloquy with my friend from Idaho, the Craig \namendment really is the heaviest of heavy hands I have ever seen \nproposed for the Federal Government. First, I do believe also, as I \njust stated, it does violate the fifth amendment to the Constitution. \nAlso, it doesn't even get to the Kelo decision.\n  As the Senator himself admitted, even under his own amendment we \nwould have the oddest of all situations. It would then be permissible \nfor a local entity to condemn private land for private use, but it \nwould not be permissible for a local entity to condemn private land for \npublic use. That is the oddest of all circumstances. Again, to say to a \nlocal entity that you cannot use the power of eminent domain, granted \nto you by the Constitution of the United States, for a park or \nrecreation area or whatever it is, a public use for future generations \nto enjoy--to me, that is an interference in local government and local \ngovernment decisions.\n  My friend talked about, yes, somebody may want to pass farmland on to \nfuture generations and things like that. I am very sensitive to that. \nYes, they should be able to. But shouldn't also a local entity or a \nState devise parks and recreation areas, also for future generations? \nThere seems to be some thought if a State uses its power of eminent \ndomain, they can just take the land away. The fifth amendment of the \nConstitution says, no, you have to have just compensation. That is \nwhere you get into courts a lot of times.\n  We have seen eminent domain used for power lines, for example, to go \nacross the State. Again, the amendment of the Senator, I don't know if \nit would reach the power lines.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is important to state for the record this amendment \ntouches none of the standard uses of eminent domain and historic uses, \nand I said so and all the other Senators speaking to it said so. \nRights-of-ways--this is open space land only. It is very clear, it is \nvery targeted. It does not touch any other area of historic use of \neminent domain. OK?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, well, I say to my friend, one of the \nhistoric uses of eminent domain has been for parks. When was Central \nPark in New York set aside? The power of eminent domain was for Central \nPark in New York. I think that has been over a hundred years.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And a lot of people had their land acquired and purchased; \neminent domain was used.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, I do not have a catalog----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think the Record is replete now with the fact that there \nhas been an acceleration of counties and cities using it post-Kelo.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But my point----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I know what your point is; I know we should be speaking \nthrough the Chair for that purpose. In my opinion, it is a broadening \nof the definition of public use in a post-Kelo environment that has put \nAmerica's agricultural land at risk in a greater way than ever before. \nThat is why this amendment is brought to the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Idaho, that is the point I was \ntrying to make, that you could still have condemnation purposes for a \nprivate power line. Maybe a farmer does not want that power line going \nover his land; he does not like those big cables going over his land.\n  The State can come in and say: Here is your compensation.\n  I do not like it.\n  OK. We use power of eminent domain. We will go to court, and they \nwill build that power line right across your land.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Idaho would still permit that to \nhappen, would still permit that to go on, still permit that to happen, \nbut it would not permit a local entity to say:\n\n[[Page S15404]]\n\nWe have a lot of land; we want to preserve a park for future \ngenerations. We have some of this land here that is in there, and we \nneed that for the park, and it is generally accepted by the public. You \nmay have one person reticent to do that. So they say: OK, we use the \npower of eminent domain to do that. But that does not mean they get the \nland; that means they have to go to court to decide what is just \ncompensation under the fifth amendment.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, if he really wants to pursue this, he \nought to introduce an amendment to overturn the fifth amendment of the \nConstitution. Let's have a constitutional amendment. Who knows what it \nmight be next. You think of this as a precedent. What is next? What is \nnext that we might not agree with? Maybe we do not agree with speed \nlimits. I say to my friend from Idaho, maybe we do not agree with what \na State's speed limits are, so if you do not adhere to Federal \nstandards on speed limits, we are going to take away all of your \neducation and transportation and health money. How about education \npolicy? Let's say we do not agree with the local school board. We do \nnot agree with the local school board as to what its education policy \nis. It has to be what the Federal Government says, and if you do not \nadhere to it, we are going to take away your education money, your \nhealth money, your transportation money, and your community development \nmoney. We will take it away just because you do not agree with the \nFederal Government's policy on education. Zoning and other areas like \nthat--think of what kind of a path we are going down if we adopt this \namendment.\n  Again, I say this amendment would again intrude the Federal \nGovernment into the local and State jurisdictions that have been \npreserved by the Constitution of the United States. We ought not to go \nthere.\n  Madam President, I hope now we are ready to turn to the Brown \namendment. I thank the Senator for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3819\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the chairman for his outstanding \nwork.\n  Madam President, I call up amendment 3819.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \ncurrent amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment \nis pending.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 60 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the sides.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. On behalf of Senators Sununu, McCaskill--who is \npresiding--McCain, Durbin, and Schumer, I am proud today to offer the \nReduction of Excess Subsidies to Crop Underwriters--or the RESCU--\namendment to the farm bill.\n  Our bipartisan amendment takes dollars from where they do not belong, \nfrom oversubsidized crop insurers, and invests them in priorities with \na return for the United States of America, such as nutrition programs \nand conservation programs and initiatives that create sustainable \neconomic development in other countries and our own, which, after all, \nis the key to strong export markets and also to deficit reduction.\n  The RESCU amendment is based on a simple premise: When resources are \nlimited, we simply cannot afford to waste them. We cannot afford to \noverpay crop insurers with tax dollars while underinvesting in programs \nthat pay for themselves, programs that preserve farmland and deploy \nU.S. resources strategically in the global arena.\n  Our amendment does not increase the cost of crop insurance for any \nfarmer. I repeat: Our amendment does not increase the cost of crop \ninsurance for any farmer. In fact, it has no effect on premiums at all. \nIt does not, as some will claim, dramatically reduce the margin for \ncrop insurers, jeopardizing access to crop insurance. It draws from \nhuge, bloated overpayments and astounding profit margins, making them a \nlittle less huge and a little less astounding.\n  Crop insurers will have no incentive to leave a business that \ncontinues to reward them so generously, as this Federal program does \nwith these tax-dollar subsidies. They will have no incentive to leave a \nbusiness that continues to reward them so generously for their \ninvolvement. I can assure you that before and after this amendment, if \nit is enacted, crop insurers will continue to be generously rewarded \nfor their activities.\n  This amendment simply seizes an opportunity to do some good while \ndoing no harm. It is a fiscally responsible amendment that reroutes \ninsurance overpayments to accomplish several beneficial goals. Some of \nthe dollars go toward deficit reduction, some of the dollars honor \nfaith-based missions throughout the world by contributing to a like \nprogram that feeds hungry children in developing countries, and some of \nthe dollars help family farmers become better stewards of our land and \nour natural resources. This amendment is not glamorous or earth-\nchanging; it is simply an opportunity to move forward and to do the \nright thing.\n  I know some of my colleagues do not want to take any money from crop \ninsurers. They want to continue to shovel more taxpayer dollars to crop \ninsurers. As I mentioned, some of them are worried that taking these \ndollars will put crop insurers out of business. They are not really \nworried; that is what they will say. But you just can't get there from \nhere. This amendment is not going to break the backs of those insurers; \nit is just going to mean slightly less huge profits for those insurers. \nLet's face it, this amendment does not take crop insurers to the \ncleaners; this amendment takes a little drop from their rather large \nbucket.\n\n  Federal crop insurance is an essential part of the farm safety net, \nas it should be and as it will continue to be. However, billions of \ndollars that are intended to benefit farmers are instead siphoned off \nby large crop insurance companies.\n  Listen to this number for a moment. Since 2000, farmers received \n$10.5 billion in benefits from the Crop Insurance Program, but it has \ncost taxpayers $19 billion to provide those benefits--$10 billion in \nbenefits for farmers, $19 billion in taxpayer subsidies to get that $10 \nbillion to the farmers. That is because the crop insurance companies \nhave had such huge overpayments, huge profits during those 7 years.\n  So where does the difference go? According to GAO, crop insurance \ncompanies take 40 cents out of every dollar that Congress appropriate \nto help farmers. Think about that, 40 cents out of every dollar. No \nplace operates that way. Medicare does not operate that way, Medicaid \ndoes not operate that way. No other insurance company does that well.\n  Look at this chart. Private property and casualty insurance profits, \n8.3 percent; Federal crop insurance profits more than double that, 17.8 \npercent. So slicing a little off here, they are still going to be close \nto double the profits of other private property insurance companies, \nproperty and casualty insurance companies.\n  In the same report, GAO found that crop insurance--this was a GAO \nreport--company profits are more than double insurance industry \naverages. Again, over the past 10 years, crop insurance companies have \nalmost an 18-percent return, while most of the rest of the private \ninsurance market has an 8-percent return.\n  This amendment also reduces the exorbitant--I mean exorbitant \nadministration fees crop insurance receives. For each policy they sell, \nthe GAO report shows that the per-policy subsidies to insurance \ncompanies will be triple what they were less than 10 years ago. This is \nthe money crop insurance companies receive. A is administration and \noperations. So whatever the premiums are, the Government then--already \nprofitable for the crop insurance company--the Government then pays \nthem a percentage--roughly 20 percent, slightly more than that--in \naddition so that they can administer and operate this insurance \nprogram.\n  Look, as prices have gone up, as the price of corn, for instance, and \nsoybeans--which I have a huge growing crop, huge corn and soybean \nproduction in my State, one of the leading States in the country--the \ncrop insurance companies make more and more money the higher the prices \nare because the premiums are then higher. If you think the price of \ncorn is high, you are going to buy more insurance, the premiums are \ngoing to be higher, and\n\n[[Page S15405]]\n\nthe A and operations--subsidy is 20 percent of an \nincreasingly higher number. That is why you see from $497 million, to \n$591 million, to $700 million, to 830 million, to, in 2007, $1.172 \nbillion for these administrative bonuses, if you will. These delivery \nsubsidies have tripled because they are linked, as I said, to the total \npremiums and thus the rising price, particularly of corn and soybeans.\n  This amendment will reduce the administrative subsidies for each \npolicy to the national average of 2004 and 2006. This level is still \nwell above every year prior to 2006. We are not taking them back to \nthese numbers; we are just modestly bringing them back to this number. \nThis number still was historically the highest ever. It is historically \nvery generous to the crop insurance companies as a subsidy.\n  This amendment, I repeat, is no threat to the crop insurance \nindustry. It is a threat to something--it is a threat to complacency. \nInstead of taking the painless route and leaving the crop insurance \nindustry be, we can simply apply a dose of reason and do a world of \ngood. We can help feed children in impoverished nations. We can help \nrestore the McGovern-Dole Program--two of the most respected Members to \nhave served in this distinguished body. We can help bring down, by \nhundreds of millions of dollars, something near and dear to the heart \nof Senator Conrad, I know--we can bring down the Federal deficit.\n  Simply put, we can do the right thing. I hope Members on both sides \nof the aisle will support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nRoberts, 15 minutes, followed by Senator Grassley for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Georgia has \nyielded to the Senator from Kansas. I am supposed to be presiding now. \nThe kind Senator from Ohio assumed the chair to allow me to speak on \nour amendment. I hate to hold up the Senator from Ohio who has to \nleave. If I may, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a couple of \nminutes on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we are fine with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I appreciate the courtesy shown by the Senator from \nGeorgia and, importantly, by my friend from Kansas who, although we \ndisagree about football, I know we agree about protecting taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, we spend a lot of time here talking about whether we \ncan afford things and trying to save money. My father was in the \ninsurance business. In fact, he was commissioner of insurance in the \nState of Missouri when I was in high school and college. I have no \nproblem with insurance companies making a profit. They are businesses; \nthey should make profit. But we have to take a close look when it is \ntaxpayer-subsidized profit. We are not talking about the normal profit \nof a private business. We are talking about taxpayer-subsidized profit. \nI don't care how you look at this insurance industry in this particular \nniche, this is a wildly profitable insurance industry right now, \nbillions and billions of dollars in profit over the last several years. \nYou have to ask yourself: Isn't there a way we can continue to make \nsure that crop insurance is readily available? Keep in mind this \namendment does nothing whatsoever to cause costs to go up for the \nfarmers. The premium subsidies remain the same.\n  What this does is say: We can't continue with the deficits we have. \nWe can't afford to do children's health insurance. The President vetoes \nthat. We can't afford another $11 billion for domestic spending. The \nPresident threatens a veto on that. We can't afford to do anything \nexcept make sure we subsidize a very profitable insurance industry.\n  We have to stop some of the ability of this particular niche \nindustry. They don't even have to worry about antitrust laws because we \nhave written that into the law for them.\n  This is a modest attempt. If our amendment had been in place in 2006, \nthe companies still would have received $797 million in underwriting \ngains alone in comparison to the $885 million they actually received. \nWe are not talking about putting anybody out of business. We are \ntalking about doing what is right in terms of watching taxpayer \ndollars.\n  This is about priorities. I want the billions in subsidized profits \nto go where the needs are. There are many in this farm bill. That is \nwhere they are directed. There is also a great attempt to do something \nabout these mind-numbing, jaw-dropping deficits. It seems a lot of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle don't want to pay for anything. \nThey don't want to pay for AMT. They don't want to pay for anything in \nthe Energy bill. If we keep going down this road, we should do away \nwith an attempt to pay for anything and just print money, see how that \nworks.\n  It is time we do the right thing on this particular taxpayer-\nsubsidized profit and find a middle ground where we can continue to \nmake sure crop insurance is available and affordable, which this \namendment will do, but allow some of the taxpayer money to go to more \nurgent needs than major profits in this industry.\n  I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer and my friend from \nGeorgia. I see the Senator from Missouri is the Presiding Officer. I \nwish her well in the Cotton Bowl against Arkansas, as we in Kansas go \nto the Orange Bowl. I hope she wishes us well.\n  Despite what has been said, I am rising in strong opposition to the \nBrown amendment which I think, bluntly put--and I will say it the way I \nthink it is--would kill the crop insurance program, especially in \ncertain sections of the country and, as a result, endanger a great many \nfarmers. I have often said it is more important to prevent the passage \nof bad legislation--counterproductive legislation, if you will--than it \nis to add more legislation to the books, regardless of the argument. \nThis amendment certainly falls into that category.\n  I am always amazed at the number of people who criticize a program \nthat benefits our farmers and ranchers, some of whom do their speaking \nwith their mouths full. It is truly a paradox of enormous irony: Those \nwho enjoy the safest, most affordable food supply in the world, \ncompliments of America's farmers and ranchers, with good intentions or \nnot, do great harm to the very programs that support our producers in \nproviding the bounty that is the modern miracle of American \nagriculture. It is time to stop. I understand the support for the \nprograms that this amendment alleges by cutting crop insurance or using \ncrop insurance as a bank. Let me go over those programs.\n  Other than the Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program is the most popular conservation program in \nKansas. Obviously, I am for that program. Obviously, I am for \nreasonable funding for that program. I have been one of the strongest \nsupporters in the Senate of the McGovern-Dole, or what we call in \nKansas the Dole-McGovern, international school lunch program. In fact, \nI was the Senator who led efforts to get all 100 Senators serving at \nthe time to sign a letter urging them to keep the program under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. I was the House \nAgriculture Committee chairman who saved the Food Stamp Program when \nmany wanted to block grant it. The Governors wanted the money, but they \ndidn't want to operate the Food Stamp Program. So I have a little blood \npressure, if you will, and heartburn when folks try to tell me my \nproducers don't understand or care about these programs. Just the \nopposite is true. I take offense at saying the\n\n[[Page S15406]]\n\nfunding for these programs should be increased on the backs of our \nfarmers and ranchers which will happen if this amendment passes.\n  I get frustrated when we get amendments that will inflict great harm \nfor the simple fact that some--good intentions aside; I don't question \nthat at all--do not truly understand how a program works, and they \ndon't want to take the time to get their facts straight. We have \nalready increased nutritional spending by $5.5 billion in this bill. We \nhave increased conservation spending by, as the ranking member knows \nand as anybody who represents farmers and ranchers knows, $4 billion, \nall the while cutting $6 billion from traditional commodity programs, \nincluding $4.7 billion from crop insurance. Haven't we already \nextracted our pound of assistance and flesh from our farmers and \nranchers? Note that I say the crop insurance program directly affects \nthe wherewithal of farmers and ranchers. It is inseparable.\n  I will tell my colleagues why I think the authors of this amendment \nhave their facts wrong, but first I want to make it clear what will \nhappen if this amendment passes. This amendment does propose to \nincrease the amount of quota share that companies must cede to the \nGovernment from 5 percent to no less than 15 percent. It could go \nhigher, a lot higher. Quota share, pardon the vocabulary of agriculture \nprogram policy, is the percentage of underwriting earnings that a crop \ninsurance company must cede back to the Federal Government. Currently \nthat is 5 percent of earnings. Put another way, it is an additional 5-\npercent tax companies must pay to the Government prior to expenses \nbeing figured. In addition, if this amendment had been in place for the \n2007 crop year, it would have also reduced the administrative and \noperating expense reimbursement to the companies by an additional 30 \npercent beyond what is already in the committee-passed bill. If we do \nthe proposed changes in underwriting gains in this program, we will be \nceding additional reinsurance risk from the private market, and it will \ngo to the risk management agency of the USDA--that is the outfit that \nruns the crop insurance program--and the U.S. taxpayer. I don't think \nwe want to do that.\n  Additionally, we will make it more expensive for companies to service \nthe program and provide it to producers, so much more expensive and \nrisky that it may well cause some companies to pull out of higher risk \nor underserved States. That is the big issue. You might want to reform \nit in ways that will not affect your home State where basically you get \na lot of rain but don't have a lot of risk and you don't farm--the seed \njust comes up--as opposed to high-risk areas. That means we may have \nStates where crop insurance would not be available or, at the very \nleast, there may be fewer options available from which producers can \npurchase crop insurance. If producers can't get crop insurance, it \nmeans they will be back here asking for ad hoc disaster aid. For \neverybody who votes for this amendment, if it passes, I want you to \nhelp me to come back here in regard to ad hoc disaster aid. Kansas is \nnow frozen over with yet another blizzard.\n  Even if we have a permanent disaster package in this bill, which we \ndo, it also means we would be making it harder for many farmers, \nespecially young ones, to get the operating loans and financing they \nneed for their operation. Why would it be harder for them to get \nfinancing? It will be harder because most lenders and a good number of \nlandlords require crop insurance as part of their business agreement. \nSo if you take away crop insurance, you hit those young farmers who \ndon't have a lot of equity built up in their operations.\n  On the other hand, I am sure there are those who say: Well, look at \nthe GAO study on crop insurance. It is important to go over why this is \na completely flawed study. Personally, if you presented it in the \nprivate business world, I think your job might be in danger. First, it \ntakes into account none of the increases in the participation in the \nprogram that have occurred since the passage of the Agriculture Risk \nProtection Act of 2000, reforms to the crop insurance program that I \nhelped lead in this body, along with our great former Senator Bob \nKerrey. We worked hard, and it took us 18 months. We reformed the \nprogram. Those efforts have led to increased participation, not only in \nthe plains States but all throughout the country, more especially in \nthe South and for specialty crops and everybody involved in \nagriculture. As I said, especially in the southern region, represented \nby our outstanding ranking member, Saxby Chambliss, but also in regions \nthat grow specialty crops or that have been considered underserved by \nthe program in the past. We fixed that. This increased participation \nincreases the ability to make profits for the companies, but it has \nalso led to a significant increase in the amount of risk they are \ninsuring in this program.\n\n  First, the study was ordered in the House--I am talking about the GAO \nstudy--by those who, shall we say, have been less than friendly to the \ncrop insurance program and to our farmers and ranchers. That is \nprobably the understatement of my remarks. Second, the GAO study, I \nbelieve, is counterproductive because everyone here knows you can get a \nGAO study to say whatever you want. I have been committee chairman \nthree times. You ask the questions right, they respond with the answers \nyou want. This GAO study claims that crop insurance companies are \nmaking huge amounts of money--we just heard that from previous \nspeakers--and are much more successful than traditional property and \ncasualty insurance companies. The first flaw in this study is that they \npretty much compared apples and oranges. When looking at the business \nrelationships between crop insurance and traditional property and \ncasualty companies, they compared a 5-year period for the crop \ninsurance program that represented what happens to be 5 of the lowest \ncrop loss years nationally in the history of the program. At the same \ntime they included a time period for looking at the business numbers of \nthe property and casualty industry that included both the 9/11 attacks \nand Katrina--in other words, one of the worst 5-year business periods \nin the history of the traditional property and casualty business. If \nyou take a comparison that shows one of the best 5-year periods in \nhistory in terms of insured losses for one sector of the industry and \nyou take one of the worst 5-year periods for another sector of the \nindustry, what do you think the numbers are going to look like?\n  Additionally, this GAO report claims that the companies are making \nsubstantial underwriting gains on the premiums they collect which the \nGAO then assumes is all complete profit. That is one of the arguments \nthat has just been made. Yes, companies do make underwriting gains on a \nportion of their premium that is collected, if there are not losses. \nThat is the factor that has not been brought up. What the GAO fails to \nmention is that were a major loss to occur this year--i.e., the 1988 \ndrought, what we have been through in Kansas, or the 1993 flood--the \ncompanies would also be responsible for these underwriting losses.\n  In addition, the GAO report makes the assumption that any \nunderwriting gains by the companies are pure profit. This is \nridiculous. There are expenses that are paid out of those underwriting \ngains. The largest of these expenses is for costs to pay private \nreinsurance companies for the amount of risk they underwrite for the \ninsurance companies.\n  Let me explain this in plain English. It is called ``show me'' in \nMissouri. All lines of insurance, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nprotect their investments by insuring their own risk with private \nreinsurers. That is the way it is done. Crop insurance companies do the \nsame thing. If they did not do it, again, the risk management agency of \nthe USDA and U.S. taxpayers would have to act as the reinsurers for the \nprogram, thus greatly increasing the risk for additional cost for \ntaxpayers. We don't want to go down that road. So if you subtract this \nand other expenses to obtain net underwriting gains, which the GAO did \nnot do, the numbers look a heck of a lot different.\n  In addition, the private reinsurance industry has serious concerns \nwith the proposed increase in quota share from 5 percent to a minimum \nof 15 percent that, again, must be ceded back to the Federal \nGovernment. Again, in simple terms, this requirement will force \ncompanies to cede an additional minimum of 10 percent of underwriting \ngains--\n\n[[Page S15407]]\n\nprior to expenses even being calculated--back to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now, the authors of this amendment and the USDA call it a quota \nshare. I simply call it a tax because that is what it is when you force \nany company to provide an additional 10 percent or more of their \nearnings to the Federal Government.\n  Private reinsurers know the crop insurance business can be very \nrisky. Yes, you can have several profitable years if you do not have \nwidespread weather problems. But if you have a major crop loss across a \nbroad area of the Nation--and I can tell you that has happened again \nand again and again.\n  I see Senator Conrad over there on the other side of the aisle. \nSenator Conrad, for Lord knows how many years, had to undergo all sorts \nof bad weather, all sorts of weather-related tragedies. He had the \nfamous chart of the famous cow named Bossy, that was, unfortunately, \nlegs up and had undergone a rather tragic experience. I kept saying to \nthe Senator: My Lord, I cannot understand this. You have had floods, \nyou have had blizzards, you have had drought. I even told him one time: \nYou ought to move.\n  That is not an answer.\n  If you have a major crop loss across a broad area of the Nation--more \nespecially in high-risk Plains States, where we do produce, by the way, \nin Kansas 350 million bushels of wheat every year or 400 million; that \nis the other side of the thing in regards to what we actually \ncontribute to the country--why then, if you are in the crop insurance \nbusiness, you could have a substantial loss in the program, and some \nhave.\n  Now, reinsurers worry that the increased quota share, or the tax, \nwill make it harder for companies to meet the expense of this insurance \nand will make them more susceptible to losses. Thus, some reinsurers \nmay pull out of doing business with the crop insurers.\n  If private reinsurers pull out of crop insurance, then under the \nterms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement between the companies and \nRMA, additional risk will be shifted to the U.S. taxpayer. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  In addition to the quota share, the reduced administrative and \noperating expense reimbursement--yet another reduction--will increase \ncompany costs. The average A reimbursement--again, the administrative \nand operating expense is currently 20 percent. We have several studies \nthat have indicated the actual cost for the companies of administering \nthe program is around 26.5 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, could we have unanimous consent that \nwe get 3 additional minutes on both sides?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, there would be no objection on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator shall have 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Yet this amendment proposes taking that reimbursement down even \nfurther.\n  These companies are businesses. Like any good business, if you make \nthe risk too high or increase the costs too much, you will leave the \nbusiness. Now please listen to this: There are only 16 companies now \nparticipating in the crop insurance program today--16. When I first had \nthe privilege of serving in the House of Representatives and serving on \nthe Agriculture Committee, 20 years ago, the number was 60. It went \nfrom 60 to 16. If this amendment is adopted, I do not know where it is \ngoing. Some companies will not serve certain sections of the country.\n  Perhaps it is not as profitable as some might claim? If this \namendment is adopted, there may well be entire regions of the country \nwhere companies will simply no longer provide this service.\n  If you add additional costs, I think there is a very real risk that \nthe companies will either leave the business completely or at the very \nleast begin to pull out of higher risk States and also those States \nthat are classified as ``underserved'' by the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Bottom line: If you are a Senator representing a higher risk State or \nspecialty crops, I would be very nervous about the impact this \namendment could have on producers being able to get adequate crop \ninsurance service in your State.\n  For those who think companies would not pull out, I would remind you \nthat under the operating contract the companies sign with the \nGovernment, they are not required to sell in all States. They can pick \nwhich States they do business in.\n  I know some are going to say: Well, OK, but then why are we doing \nthese A expense reimbursements when traditional property and casualty \ncompanies do not get them?\n  That is a question with an easy answer. In the traditional property \nand casualty business, companies are not required to do business with \nyou or me. If they do so choose to do business with us, they get to \ndetermine the rates they should be charging on their policies. They get \nto load expenses into those rates. And they can require us to pay \npremiums upfront, premiums that can be reinvested and build the \neconomy.\n  Crop insurance is different. Similar to the property and casualty \nbusiness, crop insurance companies do not have to do business in all \nStates. But once they decide to do business in a State, they have to do \nbusiness with any producer who wants to work with them. They are not \nallowed to cherry-pick.\n  Crop insurance companies do not set their rates. They are all \ncalculated and established by the Risk Management Agency. In addition, \nproducers do not pay their premiums upfront. Depending on the crop they \nraise, and changes in this underlying bill, they will either pay their \npremiums within 30 days after harvest or by September 30 of each year. \nSo the companies float the cost of doing business until these premiums \ncome in. What if a producer fails to pay their premium? The company is \nresponsible.\n  Now, that is a major concern. Out in western Kansas, where we went \nthrough 5 consecutive years of drought, in some places a lot of \nproducers and their lenders have told me if it was not for crop \ninsurance and direct payments, they would not still be in business, \nespecially our young producers and small banks.\n  If you adopt this amendment, you are not punishing the crop insurance \ncompanies, you are punishing all the producers and farm families out \nthere who are operating on the margins, while providing this country \nwith the most affordable and safe food supply in the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment that I truly \nbelieve would kill crop insurance for our young farmers and ranchers.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 21 minutes; and \nthere is 13 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, might I ask unanimous consent by both \nsides to make a unanimous consent request at this time on behalf of the \nleadership of both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nthe combined leadership, that the Senate stand in recess today from 2 \nto 3 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, there was an understanding that \nSenator Grassley would be recognized for up to 5 minutes following \nSenator Roberts.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I reserve my right to object. Rather than \nhave three or four speeches in a row in support of this amendment, I \nwould like to--particularly since I have more time remaining--at least \nuse a couple minutes now. I will not give a long speech, but I would \nlike to use a couple minutes responding to Senator Roberts and then go \nback and forth, if that would be acceptable to the Senator from Iowa, \nor if the Senator from Iowa has somewhere to go, I am fine with him \nspeaking now. But I would like to speak afterwards.\n\n[[Page S15408]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am fine with that. I would like to be \nrecognized after Senator Grassley, if that is OK with the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator is correct. The normal procedure would be \nto go back and forth. After Senator Grassley, Senator Brown will be \nrecognized, and then I ask that Senator Conrad be recognized after \nSenator Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator. I certainly will reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it would be easy to say I associate \nmyself with the remarks of the Senator from Kansas and let it be that \nway. But I was around when we set up the Federal crop insurance \nprogram. I wish to reflect on the rationale behind it and then, \nconsequently, why I am going to vote against Senator Brown's amendment.\n  Remember, for decades of a farm program, we may have had some crop \ninsurance through the Government--and for hail through the private \nsector--that farmers could buy for some protection, but, for the most \npart, against natural disasters people relied upon the political whims \nof Congress to vote for or not to vote for disaster aid.\n  So this crop insurance program was put in place to give farmers the \nability to manage their risk, let the individual farmer make some \ndeterminations so he can take risks out of farming, out of the natural \ndisasters that are connected with it--even now, you can take some of \nthe price questions out that are involved with it--and manage his own \nrisk as opposed to relying upon the Senators and the Congressmen to \nvote or not to vote or when to vote for disaster relief.\n  So we put this in place. In order for it to be successful, you have \nto have a network to carry it out. This network is a private-sector \nnetwork. I think it is working very well. I think it is in jeopardy if \nthe Brown amendment is adopted.\n  So I have some concerns about the amendment. It could have some very \ndetrimental impacts on the crop insurance program that is so valuable \nto rural America. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment \nbecause I do not believe the amendment is reform. It moves us back to a \ntime when there was more of a reliance upon the political whims of \nWashington to devote disaster relief.\n  The amendment seeks to further cut support of the Federal crop \ninsurance program by several billion dollars simply to fund other \nprojects. Additional cuts beyond what the Agriculture Committee has \nalready adopted will prevent the program from providing assistance to \nAmerica's farmers that is so vital to risk management.\n  Over the years, Congress has insisted on having the Federal crop \ninsurance program reach out to all farmers, especially small, \nbeginning, and limited-recourse farmers. This is to be done in a fair, \nequitable, and nondiscriminatory manner, serving as an effective risk-\nmanagement tool that all can use.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, the program is succeeding \nat this objective. Additionally, crop insurance has become essential to \nmany farmers in securing credit from a bank, rental agreements, as well \nas providing confidence to more effectively market their crops through \nthe futures market where they can capture higher prices.\n\n  The farmers in my State and across the country have used this tool \nover and over. It must be effective or they would not be using it and \npaying the premiums each year.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee reported a farm bill that contained \na two-point cut to the administrative and operating reimbursement, a \ncut that represents nearly $750 million in reduced program cost. Any \ncuts to the A reimbursement rate beyond those two points that were \nagreed upon by the committee will likely undermine the program by \nthreatening the service America's farmers both need and deserve.\n  Further cuts could also jeopardize the continued viability of the \nprivate delivery system that is vital to the program's success. This \ncould put private-sector employees out of work and result in the hiring \nof new Federal employees to serve farmers. Private-sector delivery is \nefficient and results in good services.\n  Approximately 30,000 jobs are created by this industry. Those would \nbe in jeopardy, and we would not have small farmers and ranchers \nserviced the way they are now.\n  Further, the amendment's proposal to increase the quota share could \nweaken the crop insurance program and may result in private insurers \nexiting the program.\n  In fact, increasing the quota share is counter to the Federal policy \nof the past 25 years, which successfully has shifted more risk to the \nprivate sector for two primary reasons. First, private companies do a \nbetter job at loss adjustment. Both the Inspector General and the GAO \nhave repeatedly focused on that point. Second, by shifting more risk to \nthe private sector, Federal costs should be lower over time, as \ncompanies have more financial responsibility for indemnities.\n  It has taken more than 25 years, and we do not want to lose that 25 \nyears.\n  As a matter of transparency, I wish to tell everybody in the Senate \nthat I participate in a crop insurance program. My constituents ought \nto know it, and my colleagues voting on it ought to know that as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for adding \nhis knowledge to this debate.\n  After listening to the Senator from Kansas, I think we might think \nthe sky is falling in Kansas or in Ohio or in Iowa or in Georgia, that \nthe sky is falling on the crop insurance companies.\n  But when I hear the opponents of this amendment say crop insurance \ncompanies may go out of business because of this amendment, or a new \nargument today, that the reinsurer might go out of business--\nreinsurance companies that insure the crop insurers--I think you \nshould, again, look at this chart.\n  On this chart is shown the number of dollars per policy that the crop \ninsurance companies are paid. In the last 10 years, it slowly went up, \nuntil about 2004. So a crop insurance company writing a policy would \nget $591, 4 years ago. They would get this A subsidy, this \nadministrative and operating subsidy. Then it went to $700, stayed \naround $700. Then it went up to $800 in 2006, the highest number in \ncrop insurance program history. Then, this year, it is close to $1,200 \nper policy of the subsidy. In addition to everything else with crop \ninsurance, we don't need to get into the inner machinations of the \nsubsidies in other ways. But this over-the-top subsidy--I have been \nvery involved in Medicare issues. Medicare is about 2 percent of \nadministrative costs that the Government pays them to operate the \nMedicare Programs in the 50 States. I don't make the comparison, \ngenerally, because it is a very different program. But we give them \n$1,100 for every policy they write--almost $1,200. Our amendment simply \nsays: Let's go back to the last record-setting year, which is $830 per \npolicy.\n\n  So for Senator Roberts to claim they may go out of business--all we \nare doing is going back to the very profitable year they had when they \nwere getting $830. This is all taxpayer dollars. These are private \ninsurance companies making huge profits--making huge profits from our \ntax dollars. Again, I go back to the profit levels of these Federal \ncrop insurance companies. These are private companies getting financing \nprofits from taxpayers--twice the profits of the average private \ninsurance property and casualty companies.\n  Then I hear my friend from Kansas, Senator Roberts, talk about how \nbusiness is going to be bad for farmers. Understand, no premium \nincrease. This amendment increases no premiums; it doesn't touch \npremiums for farmers. But then he makes the case that--he does the \noldest trick in the book, making the farmers' interests coincident with \nthe insurance company interests. If you buy car insurance as a driver, \nyou don't think your interests are always the same as the car insurance \ncompanies. When you get your health insurance plan, you don't think \nyour interests are exactly identical with your health insurer. So to \nbelieve our taking some of the oversubsidized profits--taxpayer \ndollars--from the private crop insurance companies, that that means we \nare going after the farmers or that is going to hurt the farmers simply \ndoesn't pass the straight-face test, and here is why.\n\n[[Page S15409]]\n\n  We spent, if you recall from my earlier comments, $10 billion in \nsubsidies in the last few years which go to the farmers for crop \ninsurance--a $10 billion benefit for farmers, but it took $19 billion \nof taxpayer dollars to get them those $10 billion. So in other words, a \nmajority of crop insurance spending, this spending is taxpayer dollars. \nA majority of crop insurance spending goes to insurers, not the \nfarmers. The farmers and the insurance companies don't have identical \ninterests. I am very supportive of family farmers in my State. Most of \nthe agriculture in my State is corn and soybeans. Most of the crop \ninsurance premium dollars are insuring corn and soybeans in this \ncountry. Some 75 percent, if I recall, of crop insurance is about corn \nand soybeans. I am very supportive of those farmers. I will continue to \nbe. I don't want to see taxpayers, whether they are taxpayers in rural \nLexington, OH, or whether they are taxpayers in more urban Youngstown, \nOH, I don't want to see them giving all of these subsidies to insurance \ncompanies.\n  Again, more than half the spending on crop insurance--more than half \nthe spending--goes to the crop insurance companies, not the farmers. We \nare not touching the 46 percent that goes to farmers. We are not \ntouching those dollars. We don't want those premiums to increase. We \nare saying, take a little bit away from the crop insurance companies. \nGo back to their 2006 levels of $830 per policy. They had huge profits \nin 2006. The crop insurance companies were thriving. The farmers were \nbenefiting from these programs. Why give them the extra $342 per policy \nwhen that money could go to programs such as conservation for farmers; \nEQIP--an important program in Kansas--or go to McGovern-Dole or go to \nhundreds of millions of dollars in deficit reduction.\n  So we are taking those taxpayers' dollars, giving them to these \nprivate insurance companies so their profits can absolutely go through \nthe roof. Instead, I want those dollars to be used wisely. We are \nstewards of taxpayer dollars, as my farmers are stewards of their land. \nI want to support the farmers. I want to support the conservation \nprograms. I want to support the feeding programs. I want to help reduce \nthe Federal deficit. That is why the Brown-Sununu-McCaskill amendment \nmakes so much sense.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has only 7\\1/2\\ minutes left.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Did that include the additional 3 minutes we got?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes \nfor both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to address the amendment of \nSenator Brown, the Senator from Ohio, proposing further cuts to crop \ninsurance.\n  First, I wish to acknowledge what a valuable Member Senator Brown is \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee. He has made a real contribution to \nthe work of the committee in bringing this bill to the floor. I respect \nhim for this amendment. He has offered this amendment because he thinks \nwe need to beef up other parts of the farm program--nutrition and \nconservation--and at the same time he thinks there is more money going \nto the crop insurance industry than is warranted.\n  Let me give an alternative view. The amendment before us would cut \ncrop insurance by another $1.8 billion, in addition to the substantial \nreductions that have already been made in the committee bill. I would \nlike to caution my colleagues about making even more cuts to crop \ninsurance. As the bill stands now, we have already taken $3.6 billion \nover 5 years, $4.7 billion over 10 years from crop insurance to address \nother priorities in the bill. This amendment would increase those cuts \nby more than 50 percent. It would go well beyond what the House did, \nand it could have a very negative effect on producers' ability to \ninsure their crops.\n  Let's look at the reforms already contained in the committee bill. \nThe committee bill reduces the loss ratio from 1.075 to 1; it reduces \ncatastrophic insurance and noninsurable--or it has fee increases for \ncatastrophic insurance and the noninsurable program; it has reduced \nreimbursement for area plans; it has a 2-percent reduction for \nadministrative and operating expenses; and it has total crop revenue \noffsets of $3.6 billion. That is not insignificant in terms of savings \nout of this program.\n  When I look at the proposals of this amendment, I am concerned about \nthe unintended consequences. Specifically, if we act hastily and \nunwisely without benefit of hearings in the committees of jurisdiction, \nwe could lose participation of private insurance companies, smaller \ncrop insurance companies that rely on reinsurance could exit the \nbusiness, and producers would have fewer choices. Rather than having \ncompeting companies delivering a product, we would be begging them to \nstick around.\n  The loss of participating insurance companies is only one part of the \nstory. Reduced reimbursement for delivery of the program would result \nin agents abandoning the program as well. Where and how far will our \nproducers have to travel to obtain coverage? I don't particularly like \nthe prospect of farmers and ranchers calling my office telling me their \nagent has quit and they can't find someone to explain to them crop \ninsurance. I think that might be the outcome if we adopt this \namendment.\n  Proponents have been quoting the GAO's May report as justification \nfor further reductions. I read the report. I also read a report \ncompleted by the respected accounting firm of Grant Thornton. Frankly, \nI am concerned that when GAO made its comparisons of crop insurance \nprofitability to property and casualty insurers, they were comparing \napples and oranges.\n  The GAO compared profitability over 5 years, showing crop insurance \nat 17.8 percent return compared to 6.4 percent for property and \ncasualty. Of course, that comparison included the only loss year for \nproperty and casualty and relatively good years for multiperil crop \ninsurance. Grant Thornton instead looked at a 14-year period. Their \nanalysis shows something quite different, with crop insurance \nprofitability at 12.2 percent compared to 17.4 percent for property and \ncasualty. Further, Grant Thornton notes that crop insurance expenses \nhave fallen short of administrative and operating reimbursements since \n1997. That is quite a different story.\n  Grant Thornton's report suggests the GAO didn't make fair comparisons \nbecause they chose nonrepresentative years and did not account for \nsignificant differences between property and casualty insurance and \ncrop insurance. Frankly, there is a dramatic difference between crop \ninsurance and what is required in order to provide it and other \ninsurance products. There are more administrative expenses to \nadminister a crop insurance program than most of us understand. Agents \nare constantly being trained and retrained to keep up with the new \nGovernment rules we pass. They need to understand not only government \nregulations but company rules, loss adjustment, and maintain production \nhistory records.\n  In addition, loss adjustments occur on a much greater frequency than \nfor any property and casualty company. I have actually had perhaps the \nmisfortune of studying insurance in college. Crop insurance is a \ntotally different insurance coverage than other insurances that have \nbeen referenced on the floor. It is no wonder Grant Thornton reported \ncrop insurance expenses have exceeded administrative and operating \nreimbursement every year since 1997. I might add, while the GAO \noutlined what they believe are vulnerabilities for fraud, waste, and \nabuse, this amendment doesn't do anything about those questions. In \nfact, because it reduces available resources for administration, I am \ninclined to think this proposal may make the fraud and abuse situation \nworse.\n  While I applaud my colleagues for trying to increase resources for \nconservation and nutrition, I would point out the bill before us \nincreased conservation by over $4 billion above the baseline, increased \nnutrition by $5 billion above the baseline, and we did it largely by \ntaking money from crop insurance already. This is a double hit.\n  We have taken nearly $7.5 billion from the commodity programs. We \nhave taken $4.2 billion directly from\n\n[[Page S15410]]\n\ncommodities, and over $3.6 billion from risk management. Where did the \nmoney go? The money went to nutrition and conservation. They were the \nbig winners. It is like people have completely forgotten what occurred.\n  This is a chart that shows the sources and uses of funds. Thirty-four \npercent of the money--the new money--provided in this bill came out of \ncommodities. Thirty-two percent--almost a third--came out of crop \ninsurance. We have already tapped them. Where did the money go? Forty \npercent of it went to conservation, and 47 percent went to nutrition. \nNow, when is enough enough? When is there a fair balance?\n  I wish to emphasize, we have hit the commodity title for $7 billion \nalready. When does it stop? When is enough enough? When is fair fair? \nSixty-six percent of this bill is going to nutrition. Sixty-six percent \nof this bill is going to nutrition. Nine percent of this bill is going \nto conservation.\n  Commodity programs are less than 14 percent. Let's be clear. When we \nwrote the last farm bill, it was estimated that three-quarters of 1 \npercent of Federal spending would go to commodity programs. But that \nisn't what happened in the real world. We didn't get three-quarters of \n1 percent of Federal spending; we got one-half of 1 percent of Federal \nspending in the current farm bill for commodities. You know how much we \nare going to get in this farm bill? Not three-quarters of 1 percent, \nnot one-half of 1 percent, but one-quarter of 1 percent. That is what \nis going to go for commodities in this bill.\n  This amendment says let's take another $1.8 billion and give it to \nthe parts of the bill that have already been the big beneficiaries, the \npart of the bill that already has had the biggest increases--\nconservation that got 40 percent of the new money, nutrition that got \n47 percent of the new money.\n  This amendment ought to be defeated. There are questions raised by it \nthat are legitimate and they ought to be the focus of a hearing. The \nHouse already agreed to do so. The Senate ought to follow suit, but we \nought not to make a rash, hasty decision that can endanger crop \ninsurance, which is critically important for our producers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, will the Chair let us know how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 17\\1/2\\ minutes, and \nthe Republican side has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  Will Senator Roberts take his last 2 minutes?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am sorry, what is the question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I have a good bit of time left. You have a couple of \nminutes. I want to close, but I want to make some comments first.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator can talk and we will take our 2, and then \nhe can close.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator. I think we should wrap this up.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from North Dakota, who has \nfought more effectively and passionately for his farmers in North \nDakota than perhaps anybody in the Senate. But this debate is not about \nhow much money has gone to conservation, to nutrition, or in or out of \ndirect payments. This amendment is the subsidies, the taxpayer dollars, \nthat go directly into crop insurance, the huge, bloated subsidies, the \ntaxpayer dollars, that go to these companies that, by any measurement, \nare the most profitable insurance companies in America--Federal crop \ninsurance, with 17.8 percent profits; and private property and casualty \ninsurance, with 8.3 percent.\n  I know crop insurance is different; they have Federal rules. But in \nthe end, this profit is all about taxpayer subsidy. This is the same \nkind of profit that a private property and casualty insurance company \nhas. It is taxpayer dollars from taxpayers in Providence, RI; Topeka, \nKS; Columbus, GA; and Mansfield, OH.\n  I heard Senator Conrad's discussion of a Grant Thornton analysis over \nthe last dozen or so years. I don't know who paid for that study. It \ndoesn't matter. I know who paid for the GAO study, and I know about the \nprofessionalism, even though called into question by my friend from \nKansas, when the audits don't come out the way some people want them \nto. I know about their professionalism and what they said about crop \ninsurance, and I know what they said about overpayments and \nprofitability.\n  Most importantly, that study from Grant Thornton looks over a period \nof many years. I probably would not have offered this amendment in \n1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002. But look at where we are today. Look at the \nsubsidies we provide to crop insurance from taxpayer dollars. I repeat \nthat these are taxpayer dollars, the subsidies to these crop insurance \ncompanies: $723, $696, $830 per policy with the subsidy, leading up to \nthis year, when the policy jumps to a $1,172 subsidy.\n  All we are saying is to take this huge overpayment from this year and \ngo back to the already very profitable year in 2006. This is not a \ndebate about what farmers get. Farmers' premiums don't increase. They \nwill get the same services. Farmers will still have the same access, in \nspite of what some people say, to these crop insurance policies. So it \nis a matter of whose side you are on. Are you on the side of the \nfarmers or the taxpayers and the side of conservation and nutrition? Or \nare you on the side of a very small number of crop insurance companies \nthat are reaping huge profits, getting huge subsidies, getting bloated \nnumbers of dollars from taxpayers in their pockets? Whose side will you \nbe on? We should be on the side of the family farmers and taxpayers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I will close after Senator \nChambliss uses his last couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, crop insurance has experienced \ntremendous growth and success since the enactment of the 2000 crop \ninsurance bill, which increased premium subsidies to producers and made \nother program improvements. In my State of Georgia, we were not a big \nuser of crop insurance in years past. In 1994, only 38 percent of \neligible acres were insured; whereby, in 2006, 89 percent of eligible \nacres were insured. This is a valuable tool that our farmers now have \navailable to them, and it saves the taxpayers money by decreasing the \namount of annual emergency disaster programs we have to come and ask \nfor relative to agriculture.\n  In the committee-approved farm bill, over $4.7 billion has been taken \nout of the crop insurance program to fund other farm bill priorities. \nThese savings were achieved to answer criticisms of the program, some \nof which were raised by Senator Brown, and are directed to improve \noperational efficiency. We have tried to manage these funding \nreductions in a way that will not unduly harm the program or the \ndelivery system.\n  Twenty-one agricultural organizations have sent a letter opposing the \nBrown amendment. I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: We urge you to vote ``no'' on the \n     Brown-Sununu-McCaskill amendment that is said to ``reform'' \n     the federal crop insurance program.\n       The Senate Agriculture Committee has already carefully \n     considered the crop insurance program and adopted manageable \n     changes that reduce costs and improve efficiency while \n     capturing nearly $4 billion in savings to fund other farm \n     bill priorities.\n       The public-private partnership responsible for managing and \n     implementing the program has responded very well over the \n     years to Congress' desire to have a federal crop insurance \n     program that reaches out to farmers across the nation, \n     especially small, beginning and limited-resource farmers, in \n     a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory manner to provide \n     effective risk management. There is very tangible evidence \n     the program is achieving this objective. For example, farmer \n     risk protection is projected to reach at least $65 billion in \n     2007, providing protection to more than 80 percent of the \n     insurable acreage.\n       With this magnitude of expansion, crop insurance has become \n     essential not only for individual farmer risk management, but \n     also, in many cases, to borrow money or rent land. Without a \n     crop insurance safety net that is fairly and effectively \n     available, many family farms will not be able to rent land \n     and obtain credit to produce a crop. Furthermore,\n\n[[Page S15411]]\n\n     the crop insurance program helps farmers have the confidence \n     to more effectively market their crops through the futures \n     market where they can capture higher prices and increase \n     their annual income.\n       We are concerned the changes that would be made to the crop \n     insurance program by the Brown amendment have not been \n     thoroughly and effectively analyzed by the Agriculture \n     Committee and will cause unintended harm to the availability \n     and delivery of a vital farm security program.\n       To protect what it has taken Congress more than 25 years to \n     build, we urge you to vote ``no'' on the Brown amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugar Alliance.\n       Corn Producers Association of Texas.\n       Minnesota Corn Growers Association.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Sorghum Producers.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       New Mexico Peanut Growers Association.\n       North Carolina Peanut Growers Association.\n       Oklahoma Peanut Commission.\n       Peanut Growers Cooperative Marketing Association.\n       Southwest Council of Agribusiness.\n       USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n       US Canola Association.\n       US Rice Producers Association.\n       Virginia Peanut Growers Association.\n       Western Peanut Growers.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, these organizations recognize the \nimportance of a solid crop insurance program, and in the letter they \nstate:\n\n       Without a crop insurance safety net that is fairly and \n     effectively available, many family farms will not be able to \n     rent land and obtain credit to produce a crop.\n\n  They express concern that changes proposed by Senator Brown will \ncause unintended harm to the availability and delivery of this vital \nfarm security program.\n  With that, I urge a vote against the Brown amendment.\n  I yield back our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will not use all my time. I have a couple \nof points. Several of the speakers have said that the committee already \nmade substantial cuts in crop insurance subsidies from the Government. \nThat is not quite true. There was a bit of a cut, but the cuts were \nmuch less than the House of Representatives had in their bill. The \nHouse made cuts in the shared risk and the A, the administration and \noperating expenses. They say the crop insurance companies were already \ncut by $3.5 billion. The vast majority of these savings were due to the \nsleight of hand, the shifts in time. The CBO cost estimate indicates \nthat only $700 million were actually cut.\n  According to the CBO, the supplemental disaster package adds an \nadditional $2.1 billion to crop insurance. So they took a little here \nand added more there. It adds up to a net gain of $1.5 billion to crop \ninsurance companies. Their lobby is strong and they are doing well. \nThey have a lot of influence on this body. But the fact is, in the end, \nthis is about one thing: This chart shows that the majority of crop \ninsurance spending goes to insurers, not family farmers or large \nfarmers--not to farmers, period. A majority of this money--the \nunderwriting gains paid to companies was $840 million. Administrative \nsubsidies paid to companies was $960 million. Fifty percent of crop \ninsurance spending goes to crop insurance companies, not to farmers.\n  About $10.5 billion in the last 7 years has gone to farmers \nbenefiting from the crop insurance program, but it took $19 billion \nfrom taxpayers to pay them that $10 billion. What kind of program is \nthat? We get $10 billion in public benefits, but it takes $19 billion \nto provide those public benefits. No other Federal program does it that \nway. If it were Medicare, we would bring them in here and have hearings \nand destroy them if they were spending that much of the services they \nare supposed to provide, with that much in administrative costs. Again, \nover 50 percent--more than half--of crop insurance spending goes to \ninsurers, not farmers.\n  The Brown-Sununu-McCaskill amendment will do what we need to do. It \nwill say no more bloated, oversubsidized spending, no more taxpayer \ndollars of this magnitude will go to the crop insurance companies. \nLet's use that money for nutrition, for conservation--and, again, don't \nforget, hundreds of millions of dollars from the Brown-Sununu-McCaskill \namendment will go to reduce the national debt. Taxpayers save, family \nfarmers are better off, and the natural resources in this country--\nsomething Senator Harkin has worked so effectively on for so many \nyears--will make all of the difference in this. I ask my colleagues to \nvote for the Brown-Sununu-McCaskill amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will yield whatever time I have left to \nSenator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take a back seat to no one in my support \nfor the crop insurance industry. I was here, as Senator Grassley said, \non the House Agriculture Committee when we set up this system. I was on \nthe Conservation and Credit Subcommittee. I remember why we did this. \nWe had a bad system before, with the Government putting these policies \nout, relying upon ad hoc disaster payments. Eventually, we went to all \ncrop insurance delivered through the private sector. I was one of the \ninitial supporters of that. I fought very hard for the private sector \nto get this business, for obvious reasons. No. 1, we had our private \ncompanies out there already insuring houses, cars, and different \nthings, such as equipment, for farmers. Why should they not also \nprovide crop insurance? It made logical sense.\n  I think the years have proven us right. The private crop insurance \nindustry in America has worked well. It has done an outstanding job. It \nhas met all of the things we expected them to do when we created this \nprogram in 1982. So I have followed this all these years, and I have \nsupported this industry and what they have been doing all these years. \nI still do. I take a back seat to no one.\n  I will be frank; when the Senator from Ohio first came up with his \nproposal on crop insurance in my discussions with him, I thought this \nwas too big of a cut. I thought it was a little bit too heavy. I \nthought they were too harsh. But I do think that over the weeks, in \nworking with Senator Brown and in moderating the size of the cuts and \nto shape the message about what needs to be done to reform the \nfinancial incentives provided to crop insurance companies, I think he \nis on the right path. I think the Senator from Ohio makes valid points \nabout the problems with the current mechanism for reimbursing private \ncrop insurance companies for the expenses they incur in delivering the \nFederal crop insurance program for farmers.\n  No one who is knowledgeable about how the program works--and I \nbelieve I am very knowledgeable about it--can deny that the significant \nincrease in total premiums over the last few years has been driven by \nthe increase in commodity prices, especially corn, wheat, and soybeans, \nwhich has resulted in an increase in A reimbursement per policy. That \nsurge generated higher revenues for the companies that have not \nnecessarily had an increase in expenses over the same period.\n  So we have had a system whereby the reimbursements are tied to \ncommodity prices. Well, we have seen this huge increase in commodity \nprices in the last few years. In fact, I penciled out here that we went \nfrom about $3.5 billion to more than $5 billion in just a few years.\n  The insurance companies get, as we know, 21 percent of that amount. \nThat is the reimbursement rate, 21 percent. That is a huge increase. \nThe Senator from Ohio pointed out on his chart the increases in those \nyears.\n  What the Senator is proposing is that we take the average of, I \nbelieve, it is 2004, 2005, and 2006, and we cap it at that level. It \ndoes not apply to the crop-year of 2007, and it would not apply to \n2008, if I am not mistaken. I think it starts in 2009. It does not \napply to 2007 or 2008. It does not start until 2009.\n  I have told some of my friends in this industry that I think this \napproach may be better for them in the long run to base it on those \nlevels rather than to roll the dice. We have seen crop prices go up, \nand we have seen them go down. Obviously, I would like to see them stay \nup. But that is ignoring history.\n  I said to my friends in the industry: Look, this is not a bad deal. \nWe cap the highest levels we have seen, except for\n\n[[Page S15412]]\n\nthis year, obviously, for 2007, and that is the reimbursement rate. I \nthink it might in the long run be better for them.\n  I don't see this as onerous on crop insurance. Some say there is \ngoing to be this big cut, but that does not apply to 2007 and 2008. By \nthe time we get to 2009, there may not be any cuts at all, as a matter \nof fact, depending upon what happens with prices. In fact, it may be \nbetter. It actually may be better.\n  In exchange, what we do get is some more money for conservation, for \nEQIP. We need more money in the EQIP program, the Grasslands Reserve \nProgram, the Farmland Protection Program, as well as the McGovern-Dole \nFood for Education Program. I think it is a pretty fair tradeoff. If I \nthought for 1 minute this was going to devastate, destroy, unduly harm \nthe crop insurance industry, I could not support it. But I believe it \nis a fair and equitable approach and, quite frankly, I think the \nmethodology is much better in the long term. ``Long term,'' what do I \nmean? Five years? Probably 5, 7, 8 years. It may be better for the crop \ninsurance industry than hooking onto commodity prices.\n  Quite frankly, thinking back over the years, I find it hard to argue \nwhy it should be connected to commodity prices. What does that have to \ndo with reimbursement? What does that have to do with policy numbers? \nWe should have something that will protect our insurance people from \nundue happenings and events such as that, and I think that is what this \nmethodology does. We took the average of those 3 years and capped it at \nthat. In conference, we can look at putting in an inflation factor.\n  It seems to me that makes much more sense for the future of the \nprogram. As I said, for that we get more money for the conservation \nprograms, the McGovern-Dole International School Lunch Program, and it \nalso lifts the sunset provision on our nutrition program. Right now the \nincreases we put in the Food Stamp Program with the standard deduction \nand minimum benefit sunset in 5 years.\n  Someone in the Democratic Caucus said recently to me: Why are we sun-\nsetting in 5 years the programs that go to the poorest people in our \ncountry, yet we don't sunset the programs that go to some of the \nwealthiest people in our country? Fair question. So in order to lift \nthis sunset, we need additional money, and the money we would save \nwould go to lift the sunset provisions on both the standard deduction \nand the minimum benefit.\n  For those reasons, I support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield back our time on the amendment. I \nthank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to conclude the debate with respect to the \nKlobuchar amendment No. 3810, and that the previous order with respect \nto the vote threshold remain in effect; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Klobuchar \namendment; that upon disposition of that amendment, the Senate then \nvote in the relation to the amendments listed below in the order \nlisted; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled prior to each vote; that after the first vote, the vote time \nbe limited to 10 minutes; with no second-degree amendment in order to \nany of the amendments covered under this amendment, prior to the vote; \nthat the amendments covered here be subject to a 60-vote threshold; \nthat if any of these amendments achieve an affirmative 60 votes, it be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that if \nit does not achieve that threshold, it be withdrawn: Coburn amendment \nNo. 3530; Tester amendment No. 3666; Brown amendment No. 3819, and that \nthe managers' package of cleared amendments be considered and agreed \nto, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I guess we are going to be in recess for \nan hour, from 2 to 3 p.m. We will come back at 3 p.m. and finish debate \non the Klobuchar amendment. We will have that vote, and at the \nconclusion of that time, we will have three other votes.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here to address my amendment, \nNo. 3810, and I want to talk about the importance of reform to this \nfarm bill.\n  I was disappointed today when the amendment of Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Grassley was defeated. It was a very important amendment. In \nother years, we actually had enough votes for this amendment, before I \nwas here, but we weren't able to muster the votes necessary to block \nthe filibuster. Well, we have one more opportunity, and that \nopportunity is this afternoon.\n  America's farm safety net was created during the Great Depression as \nan essential reform to help support rural communities and protect \nstruggling family farms from the financial shocks of volatile weather \nand volatile prices. I believe after 75 years, the reasons for that \nsafety net still exist, and I believe the farm bill that came through \nour committee has some very good things in it. It is forward thinking; \nit is about cellulosic ethanol. It is about finally having some \npermanent disaster relief. It is about a strong safety net for \nAmerica's farmers. But there is one thing missing from this farm bill, \nMadam President, and that is the kind of reform that we need to move \nforward.\n  I want to demonstrate what we are talking about here with our \namendment, which is cosponsored with Senator Durbin and Senator Brown, \nand why I think it is so important to this bill. As you know, I come \nfrom a farm State. It is sixth in the country for agriculture. I am \nproud of the work our State does and our farmers, and we have diverse \nfarming. I know some of the farmers in my State may not like this, but \nthe vast majority of them support this reform because they know if we \ndon't reform ourselves, someone else will do it for us.\n  What I am talking about is farm subsidies going to people who \nshouldn't have them, such as Maurice Wilder, who is a guy that is very \nwealthy, and who was the No. 1 recipient of commodity payments from \n2003 to 2005. He has collected more than $3.2 million in farm payments \nfor properties in five States, even though his net worth is more than \n$500 million. We also have $3.1 million in farm payments going to \nresidents of the District of Columbia, $4.2 million going to people in \nManhattan, and $1 million of taxpayer money going to Beverly Hills \n90210.\n  Now, what can we do to change this? The first thing we are doing is \nwe are getting rid of the three-entity rule, which cuts down on abuse \nand allows these payments to go to the people they should go to, and \nending the practice of dividing farms into multiple\n\n[[Page S15413]]\n\ncorporations so that they get multiple payments.\n  The second thing we could have done--and sadly we defeated it today--\nwas the Dorgan-Grassley amendment, which would have put a limit on the \nactual payment at $250,000. That is a lot of money where I come from.\n  But there is a third thing that we still have the opportunity to do \ntoday. I ask my colleagues, those who are fiscal conservatives and who \nreally care about fairness in this country, to look at this amendment \nand think about what we are doing. Right now, under existing law, no \nmatter how much you net in income--and I am here talking about \ndeducting expenses because expenses don't count. So when my colleagues \ntalk about farms that might have higher expenses, those are out of it. \nThis is just adjusted gross income.\n  So for full-time farmers who have unlimited incomes, they can be \nmaking millions and millions and millions of dollars. They still \nqualify for subsidies. And because we weren't able to get it passed and \nput a limit on subsidies, they do not have that $250,000 cap. Part-time \nfarmers right now, under existing law, can make $2.5 million, and they \nget subsidies and marketing loans, since we were unable to pass this \nlimitation today.\n  The President's number, which came with the administration's \nsuggested agriculture proposal, was a $200,000 limit--a $200,000 limit \nfor both full and part time. The Agriculture Committee in the House is \nchaired by Collin Peterson of Minnesota, and I wouldn't call him a \nradical guy. He has been a friend of farmers forever. He put the limit \nat $1 million for full-time and $500,000 for part-time farmers. And he \nhas recently been saying publicly that he thinks it should go lower \nthan that, especially since we do not have the total limit on subsidies \nthat was contained in the Dorgan-Grassley amendment.\n  Now, what does the Senate bill do--the bill that came out of our \ncommittee? It has not changed for full-time farmers. No reform for \nfull-time farmers. For part-time farmers, very slowly, it gets to a \n$750,000 limitation in income--for part-time farmers.\n  This amendment says $750,000 for full-time farmers should be the \nlimit--$750,000 in income on top of expenses. Now, if you have a bad \nyear and you are a big farmer, you are still going to qualify. But if \nyou make over $750,000, that is where there is a cutoff. It is great \nyou are making money--you should put it in the bank--but then you don't \nqualify for the subsidies. If you are a part-time farmer, under our \namendment you can make $250,000 or under, and then you will qualify for \nthe subsidies. And here is where we are talking about these investors, \nthe people who aren't full-time farmers, people making less than 66 \npercent of their income from farming.\n  Now, what does this amendment do? Let's consider what it means. If \nyou live in a city, and you have a job as an investment banker and make \n$2 million a year, you don't get the government checks. Right now you \ncan, but under our amendment you won't be able to. And if you are a \nfull-time farmer, meaning more than 75 percent of your income comes \nfrom farming, under current law there is absolutely no limit on your \nincome, and you will still get those government checks. This puts some \nreasonable limits on the income when you qualify for the government \nfarm subsidy checks. That is what it does.\n  I have to tell you this: With the kind of budget battles we have \nahead of us, we have to look at what we are doing and we have to be \nthinking: Is this fair? When we have a limited amount of money, Madam \nPresident, and we are going to have to deal with Social Security and \nMedicare and all these issues, if we can't even say, for farmers making \nover $750,000, we are not going to put some limit on these government \nchecks, I really don't understand how we are going to grapple with \nthese tougher issues. It is a matter of fairness because I believe this \nmoney should be going to family farmers.\n  That is what this system was set up to do. It should be going to the \nhard-working farmers in this country, not to art collectors in San \nFrancisco and not to real estate developers in Florida. That is all we \nare trying to do with this amendment. So I would appeal to my friends \non both sides of the aisle and suggest that this is our opportunity to \nact. We have the chair of the House Agriculture Committee already \nputting in their bill some limits and indicating they may want to go \nlower. We have an opportunity to be part of that change.\n  I am going to give the other side some opportunity to speak and save \nthe rest of my time, but I will end with a little holiday story. I \nthought we needed a little holiday cheer today, on a very difficult \nday.\n  My daughter and I, when she was 9 years old, went to see the movie \n``Polar Express.'' We watched this fanciful movie, and after we came \nout, she said to me: Mom, you know, there was one thing in that movie \nthat wasn't true.\n  And I looked at her and thought, what could it be? Could it be when \nthis big body of water froze over so the train could go over it? Was it \nwhen a million elves suddenly appeared at the North Pole? Was that the \none thing that wasn't true?\n  She said: You know, Mom, at the end, when the conductor--who was \nplayed by Tom Hanks--says to the little boy: Come on, kid, get on the \ntrain. It doesn't matter what direction the train is going, just get on \nthe train. And she looked at me and she said: Mom, it does matter what \ndirection the train is going.\n  Well, that is what I would say to my colleagues today. It matters \nwhat direction the train is going. Are we going to be putting money \ninto the hard-working family farmers in this country or are we going to \nspend it on real estate developers in Florida who have $5 million to \ntheir name or art collectors in San Francisco?\n  Are we willing to say, change is afoot, and then be agents of change. \nPeople in this country want to see change. We heard that in this last \nelection. This is our opportunity; it is our chance to go in the \ndirection of reform. We have done that with so many different parts of \nthis farm bill, and that is why I supported this farm bill in \ncommittee, but this is our chance to go in the direction of change. It \nis a very small incremental step, but it will start us going in the \nright direction with this farm bill--a direction of reform.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I ask how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Klobuchar \namendment.\n  Let me say first that I am disheartened that farm program critics \ncontinue to try to lead the general public and our elected officials \ninto believing that there is a vast army of farm program participants \nwho are receiving benefits to which they are not entitled. Stories \nabout people living on the east and west coasts and everywhere in-\nbetween receiving program benefits continue to make the headlines. They \nare used as the poster children of those who do, but should not receive \nfarm program benefits because they are wealthy landowners or \nmillionaires, but more often than not there is no explanation or \nconcrete definition of either.\n  Home prices have spiraled over the last decade and many families have \nhomes, usually their single largest asset, worth hundreds of thousands \nof dollars. Individuals receiving farm program benefits obviously have \nan interest in an agricultural holding somewhere in the country. \nHopefully, they also have a 401(k) or some other savings plan that will \nallow them to retire one day.\n  More often than not, the type of individual I just described is not a \nwealthy landowner. They have a home, a farm--which by the way, they \nmight have inherited--and hopefully a retirement plan. They also have \njobs and use the income to pay their mortgage, purchase a vehicle, \nraise their family, and save for college and every other imaginable \ncost associated with living. Most of the people I know in these \nsituations don't consider themselves wealthy. Most of them will tell \nyou that the adjusted gross income at the bottom of page 1 on their IRS \nform 1040 doesn't reflect what they would consider to be a wealthy \nlandowner.\n  Another class of individuals that draws a lot of attention is \nmillionaires. It is pretty hard to figure out who\n\n[[Page S15414]]\n\nthose individuals are unless you are their accountant. More \nimportantly, I would hope that we all know there is a significant \ndifference between having a million dollars in assets and having an \nannual income in the millions. In the vast majority of cases, most \nindividuals receiving farm program benefits do not have anywhere near a \nmillion dollars in assets or income.\n  But as I will point out momentarily, it is not about wealthy \nlandowners and millionaires receiving program benefits, it is really \nabout farmers in general, regardless of their economic situation, \nreceiving program benefits.\n  Let me back up for a moment, and provide some historical context to \nwhere we find ourselves today. Prior to the 2002 farm bill there had \nnever been an income test with respect to the eligibility of \nindividuals and entities to receive program benefits. Congress \nacknowledged those concerns and addressed adjusted gross income--AGI--\nin the 2002 farm bill. Beginning with the 2003 crop year, any \nindividual or legal entity with an AGI of $2.5 million or more for the \n3 prior years was not eligible to receive farm program benefits, unless \nat least 75 percent of their income came from farming, ranching and \nforestry operations. We believed that was a good first step and \nrecognized that when it came time to write a new farm bill, as with any \nprovision, we would take another look to see if the limits were \nappropriate.\n  The ink was hardly dry on the 2002 farm bill when the ``reformists'' \nstarted shouting once again that individuals and entities otherwise \neligible for farm program benefits shouldn't receive farm program \nassistance because they were millionaires or wealthy landowners.\n  The bill passed by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry took a positive step to address the issues surrounding AGI. \nThe Committee adopted an AGI provision that reduced the limit to $1 \nmillion dollars in 2009, and to $750,000 in 2010 and beyond, unless at \nleast two- thirds of a person's income came from farming, ranching and \nforestry.\n  The reform minded AGI provisions adopted by the committee directly \nanswered the calls to ensure that payments don't go to millionaires. We \ndidn't go to $750,000 in the first year--not a reflection of resistance \nto change, but rather, recognition that land lease arrangements have \nalready occurred with respect to the 2008 crop payment year because \nhere we are in December of 2007, with farmers and ranchers all across \nAmerica already in the final stages of planning for their 2008 crop \nyear. In some instances--for example winter wheat--they have already \ngot seed in the ground for the 2008 crop year.\n  In the 2002 farm bill we added a provision referred to as ``tracking \nof benefits''. This provision required the Secretary to attribute all \npayments to an individual, a partnership, or another legal entity back \nto a natural person or what some referred to as a ``warm body.'' The \nintent of this provision was to provide transparency and allow the \nagricultural community, general public, media and other interested \nparties to trace benefits paid to entities, partnerships, et cetera, \nback to a ``warm body''.\n  During the committee markup, Senator Klobuchar said she wanted to \nstop millionaires from receiving payments. She mentioned the names of \nseveral persons that had received payments with the obvious reference \nto laws that needed to be revamped. That might be true if you are \nreferring to the 2002 farm bill, but not when compared to the \nprovisions adopted by the committee to keep these individuals from \nreceiving payments.\n\n  I am pleased that there is acknowledgment that the tracking of \nbenefits provision worked as it was intended, as it is obvious she and \nher staff have researched a certain database Web site that is \naccessible to the general public. I am equally pleased that the \nadjusted gross income provision that was included in 2002 also worked \nas intended.\n  What I am not pleased about is the mischaracterization that people \nwho are no longer eligible for payments because of the provisions \ncontained in the 2002 farm bill are somehow skirting the system and \nstill receiving payments.\n  One name that frequently comes up is Scottie Pippen, whom we all know \nto be an outstanding NBA basketball player. When you look through a \ncertain Web site database you will notice that Mr. Pippen received \nConservation Reserve Program payments, CRP as it is commonly referred \nto, for the 2003 through 2005 program years through an entity named \nOlympic Land Company Incorporated.\n  USDA tells me that Scottie Pippen owns 100 percent of Olympic Land \nCompany Inc. Olympic Land Company purchased a farm in 2003 that had an \nexisting CRP contract. Because the contract was in existence prior to \nthe 2002 farm bill, the new AGI limits did not apply. The CRP contract \nexpired on September 30, 2005 and Olympic Land Inc. did not enter into \na new contract with the 2002 farm bill AGI provisions obviously playing \na role in the decision.\n  Another name used frequently is Ted Turner, who has extensive \nagricultural holdings in Montana, New Mexico and other States. Mr. \nTurner bought property in Stanley County, SD, that had several CRP \ncontracts initiated prior to the 2002 farm bill AGI limitations \nbecoming law. Once again because these were multiyear contracts and \nentered into prior to the 2002 act, AGI provisions did not apply to Mr. \nTurner until the contracts expired. These contracts expired on \nSeptember 30, 2007, and Ted Turner did not enter into a new contract \nwith the AGI provisions obviously playing a role in that decision.\n  I believe these are just two of many examples where the AGI \nprovisions contained in the 2002 farm bill worked as intended, and what \nwe have done in this bill is reduce that limit by an additional 70 \npercent. There isn't anyone who can stand before this body today and \nsay that a 70-percent reduction in the AGI test is not real reform.\n\n  Landowners and producers often jointly share in the risk and \nproduction of the crop in a manner that is normal and customary for the \narea. When the landowner shares in the production risk, by covering \ncosts such as fertilizer or harvesting, the producer benefits from: No. \n1, reduced risk in producing the crop, No. 2, reduced capital \nrequirements, and No. 3, a landowner's greater general appreciation of \nthe operation.\n  I can tell you what is going to happen as we continue to lower the \nAGI and it is very simple. Landowners intend to capture a return on \ntheir assets and unless there are special circumstances, the landowner \nis going to change from a share lease to a cash lease. Instead of \nparticipating in the risk of producing the crop this policy will shift \nall of the production risk and input costs onto the back of the \nproducer. The landowner will cash lease the land and walk away with a \nguaranteed lease payment and the producer comes away from the deal with \nhigher production costs and more risk. Do we really want to make it \nmore difficult for the folks who are actually out there getting dirt \nunder their fingernails, driving the tractor and caring for the land?\n  I want to repeat again what I said earlier, this debate is not about \nwealthy landowners and millionaires receiving program benefits. It is \nreally about farmers in general, regardless of their economic \nsituation, receiving program benefits. A few short months ago the \ndebate was about making payments to millionaires and now we are at \n$750,000 and people want to go even further. This amendment is actually \nan assault on everyday farmers; but is disguised as an assault on \nwealthy landowners and millionaires.\n  I am urging my colleagues to vote no on the Klobuchar amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, why are we here today? We are here today \nbecause we are writing a farm bill. We do that every 5 years--1,360 \npages. Why are we doing this? We are doing this because in 1932 a \nPresident named Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the farmers of \nAmerica and said: We have a serious problem. These poor people are \ngoing bankrupt and losing their farms because of circumstances beyond \ntheir control, because of weather, because of terrible prices. He said: \nWe are going to step in as a government and make a difference. We are \ngoing to provide a\n\n[[Page S15415]]\n\nsafety net so that families who are farming do not lose their farms. \nThank God he did it, and thank goodness we continue this tradition \nthrough this farm bill.\n  Every time we argue or debate a bill such as this, we debate it in \nthe poetry of family farms and the heart of American values. But when \nyou take a look inside this bill, you will not find poetry; you will \nfind the prose of corporate farming and people who have decided to use \nthis farm bill to make a fortune. That is the reality.\n  Many of these so-called farmers are more adept at reaping Federal \nchecks than they are reaping and harvesting any crop known to man. Is \nwhat they are doing illegal? No. This bill makes it legal, legal for \nthem to use these Federal farm programs, designed to help the \nstruggling farmers, to make a fortune personally.\n  I listened to Senator Chambliss talk about the struggling farmers \nwith dirt under their fingernails. Listen, many of the people who are \nmaking a fortune off of this farm bill end up at the end of the day \nwith the ink from corporate annual reports on their hands and no dirt \nunder their fingernails--trust me. What Senator Klobuchar and myself \nand Senator Brown are trying to say is, shouldn't there be a bottom \nline where you say: Listen, you are doing quite well in life; the \nFederal Government is no longer going to subsidize you.\n  Here is the bottom line. If your adjusted gross income is over \n$750,000 a year, we say: You are on your own. Good luck. We hope life \ncontinues to be very good to you. And we go on to say that the income \nlimit for those who earn less than 66 percent of that income from \nfarming would be $250,000. We will give no more than a quarter of a \nmillion dollars of hard-earned taxpayers' dollars to those who are \ndoing very well in life.\n  Is that an unreasonable standard? At a time when we are waging a war \nat $14 billion a month, that we do not pay for; at a time that we \ncannot fund our schools under No Child Left Behind; when this President \nwill not increase Federal research to find cures for diseases facing \nAmerican families, is it unreasonable to say we should have limits to \nthe amount of money we should pay those who call themselves farmers \nbut, in fact, are just investors?\n  I do not think it is unreasonable. This amendment is the same as the \nissue I raised this morning. This morning, by one vote, the Senate \ndecided to continue the subsidy to oil companies in America making \nrecord-breaking profits.\n  The question on this amendment is, Will we continue to subsidize the \nrich who are using the farm program to get richer?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Can I ask the Senator to yield me time?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Two minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How about 3.\n  Madam President, I am very proud of our bill. We worked very hard to \ncraft a bill. But, you know, any bill needs to be improved when it \ncomes to the floor. I think this is one item where we need to fix it. \nThe bill that came out of committee, we did not do our job in this \nrespect. I wish to echo what the Senator from Illinois said. I think of \nit this way. If you are a bona fide farmer, more than two-thirds of \nyour income, it could be 70 percent of your income comes from farming, \nyou have no limits. There are no limits. You could have an adjusted \ngross income of $10 million and you will still get Government benefits. \nThere are zero limits.\n  Now, again, if your income from farming is less than that, less than \ntwo-thirds, then you have an income limit of $1 million, then it goes \ndown to $750,000 in 2010.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is on the right track. There is absolutely \nno reason why someone whose bottom-line adjusted gross income, bottom \nline after they have taken all their depreciation, all their expenses \nand everything else, bottom line of $750,000, they do not need free \nGovernment money.\n  But I can understand why they are fighting this amendment. Who wants \nto give up free money? This is free money. Well, if you are going to \ngive free money, then how about giving it to people who deserve it? \nThat is what the Klobuchar amendment does. It takes this savings of \n$355 million and puts it into the Beginning Farmer Development Program, \nthe Individual Development Accounts Pilot Program for beginning \nfarmers, rural broadband grants, organic agriculture research and \nextension, Grasslands Reserve Program, community food projects, things \nthat go to help rural America and help our legitimate small family \nfarmers.\n  So that is why I feel this is one amendment I wish to speak out on as \nchairman of this committee. As I said, I am proud of this bill. We have \nput a good bill together. But there is one hole in it we need to patch \nup, and we need to have at least this amount of reform in this bill, or \nelse people will continue to say: Well, there they go again. They are \ntaking care of the richest and the biggest, the richest and the \nbiggest.\n  Do you know what is happening now with farm programs? It is similar \nto a black hole. Do you know what black holes are in astronomy? Those \nare the things in space where there is so much gravity that nothing \nescapes, not even light. If anything gets near it, it sucks it in and \nnothing gets out.\n  Well, this is akin to what is happening in our farm programs now with \nthis kind of a situation. The bigger you are, the more you get. That is \nwhat is happening here. The bigger you are, the more you get from the \nGovernment.\n  Now the more you get from the Government, the better able you are to \nbid up the price of land around you and buy it. Therefore, you get \nbigger. Now that you are bigger, you get more Government money, and you \ncan buy up more land, and you get more Government money.\n  That is why it is similar to a black hole. We have to stop this. This \nis not in the best interests of rural America. What is in the best \ninterest is the Klobuchar amendment. I mean $750,000, quite frankly, \npersonally I think it ought to be lower. I think if you had an adjusted \ngross income over $500,000 or $300,000, you ought not be able to get \nGovernment programs.\n  But at least $750,000 is a lot better than what is in the bill. \nBecause the bill says there are no limits, none, $10 million, you still \nget Government payments, if two-thirds of your income is from farming. \nThat is why the Klobuchar amendment ought to be adopted.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Illinois. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I have one comment on the statement \nthe Senator from Illinois made. Let me make sure there is no \nmisunderstanding because he misstated something. This amendment has \nnothing to do with amount of payments. This has to do with the \neligibility of payments.\n  I assure you, anyone who has an adjusted gross income of $750,000 \nfrom a farming operation, which is required under the bill that is \nbefore this body, has invested millions and millions of dollars into \ntheir trough in order to be able to achieve that goal, and they \nprobably had a pretty good year to do that.\n  There is nothing in this amendment that says to that farmer, if you \nlose all those millions of dollars, that we are going to do something \nfor your benefit. That is what our safety net is all about. That is why \nthis is such a bad amendment.\n  I yield the balance of the time remaining on this side to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleagues for \nthe work we have done on this farm bill. I come to the floor today to \nurge my colleagues to oppose the Klobuchar amendment.\n  Listening to my colleague from Minnesota, her description about \ndirections being important does matter. That is why it is important for \nus to look at the direction we are going in this farm bill. This \nunderlying farm bill that we brought together in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee has the most substantive reform in the history of a farm \nbill.\n  It stands for farmers, for family farmers. It stands for a safe food \nsupply which is absolutely critical. It is a bill\n\n[[Page S15416]]\n\nthat ensures that in future generations we will have a safe food \nsupply. But we can also go too far in the one direction. I think that \nis important for us to take a look at.\n\n  The Senator from Georgia talked about the fact that these individuals \nhave large operations. Well, if you are farming 1,000 acres of cotton, \nyou are going to have to sign an operating loan at the beginning of \nyour crop year to the tune of about $5 million. That is tremendous \nrisk. How important would it be to have a brother or a son who is going \nto also cosign that note, who is also going to have access to the \nability of allowing the Government to provide those two a safety net, \nof being able to provide that safe and affordable food supply.\n  If those individuals are farming and they are getting payments, it \nmeans they are getting those payments because prices are low. One year \nit may be good, the next year it may be bad. We do not need to go in \nthe wrong direction.\n  The millionaire Senator Klobuchar references from Florida, he should \nnot be out there. If he is worth $500 million, he should have been \ncaught by the last farm bill's initiative. He would certainly be caught \nby the limits that are in the committee bill we bring to the floor.\n  I might suggest that from the GAO study we have seen, much of what \ngets underneath what actually exists is because the existing \nadministration is not implementing the current law. The GAO study tells \nus that. Well, if they are not implementing the current law, why would \nwe go further in that wrong direction? We have gone critically in the \nright direction. We have lowered by 70 percent the AGI means test. That \nis what it is, a means test.\n  As I stated on this floor so many times during the consideration of \nthis legislation, the underlying bill already contains the most \nsignificant farm program reform in the history of a farm bill. We have \nalready included the dramatic reform to this adjusted gross income \nmeans test that unanimously passed the Senate Ag Committee.\n  Prior to the 2003 farm bill, there was no means test that existed for \nfarm programs. However, we knew it was important to eliminate loopholes \nthat nonfarmers used to receive program payments. During the 2002 farm \nbill debate, we instituted a $2.5 million test. Well, I would ask my \ncolleagues from Iowa and Minnesota, the gentleman who was referenced by \nthe Senator from Georgia, he is not going to be caught if he were to \nreinvest.\n  We have not extended this means test to anybody else. The \nconservation programs are not--I hope the chairman will correct me--the \nconservation payments will not be corrected by this, they will still \nremain under the current law at $2.5 million. So they will not even be \nlowered to what we have lowered it in the committee bill, to 750.\n  So if we are going to do this, if we are genuine about wanting to put \nthis strong means test and go down that severe direction, then why are \nwe not doing it across the board? Why are we not making that \ndifference? If what we want to do is to create all those savings, then \nwhy are we not being fair about it and making it across the board?\n  In the underlying bill, we have gone further and lowered the \nthreshold to 750,000, and that is a 70-percent reduction, a 70-percent \nreduction in the AGI test. Before we go further, let's see if that does \nnot work. We went to 2.5 in the last bill, we have gone consistently \nlower now. If the President is not going to implement the law as it \nexists, what good would even taking it more extremely down that road \ndo?\n  I hope we will not forget we have also significantly reformed \nindividual program payment limits on top of which we will sharply \nreduce benefits to producers who remain eligible under the AGI test.\n  This is already historic reform. There is no need to hit these \nfarmers with a double whammy. It is also vitally important to remember \nthe purpose of the AGI test we included in the committee bill is to \nkeep rich nonfarmers, the ones my good friend from Minnesota and others \ncontinually cite, from receiving farm bill benefits.\n  But, unfortunately, the Klobuchar amendment would not just ratchet \ndown the AGI limits to rich nonfarmers, it would also sharply ratchet \ndown the support to family farmers, families who come together to farm \nbecause they want to share the risk, they want to be able to share the \nability to sign that operating loan note or to share the cost of what \nit costs to purchase that equipment, that seed and that fertilizer, the \nenormous expenses that go into a capital intensive farm. They want to \nshare those risks.\n  It would sharply ratchet down their ability to do it. That is not the \npurpose of an AGI test. That is not the purpose of means testing. \nIronically, while the amendment before you would do this to farm \nfamilies, it leaves wide open another loophole that lets rich \nnonfarmers continue to collect those huge conservation payments to the \ntune of $2.5 million, which is the existing law. We do not even correct \nthat.\n  That is right. It is not across the board. The big elephant in the \nroom no one wants to talk about, that while folks hammer away at farm \nfamilies in this country trying to make ends meet, other wealthy \nnonfarmers, such as Scottie Pippen, who was mentioned earlier from my \nState, who often gets cited, will continue to collect conservation \nchecks.\n  I do not know why we continue to talk about how we want to ratchet \ndown on family farmers, but we do not want to talk about it across the \nboard in other programs where we are seeing large payments going to \nvery wealthy millionaire nonfarmers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, vote no on this \namendment which hurts family farms while letting some of those rich \nnonfarmers completely off the hook. If the Senator from Minnesota wants \nto rid the country of all the sensational stories based on half-truths, \nI would advise her to apply her test in this proposal across the board \nto all the commodities and not just target Southern growers yet again.\n  I would advise caution, though, because I do not think we fully \nunderstand the ramifications of true means testing to that degree. On \none hand, once we have set the precedent of implementing a means test \non farmers, who is to say we will not begin tying a means test to other \nsectors of the economy that receive Government subsidies and tax \nbreaks, perhaps those who deliver health care, maybe those who receive \nhealth care, capital investments, the list could go on and on.\n  If we are going shortly to means testing where the Government is \ngoing to investigate, I would suggest we stop for a moment and pay \ncaution and remember these are the hard-working farm families who \nprovide us a safe and abundant supply of food.\n  Senator Durbin continues to talk about unsafe foods coming in. What \nhappens 10 years from now if we put farmers out of business and all of \na sudden we are dependent on foreign food just as we have become \ndependent on foreign oil?\n  Second, we don't know what our neighbors make. I don't want to know \nwhat my neighbors make. If we start seeing our rice and cotton \noutsourced to foreign countries, we will see the full effect of this \nmeans test. The consequences of enacting a means test that is too \nstringent and disqualifies certain farmers' crops is very dangerous to \nour farm families. It is like playing with dynamite and seeing how \nclose you can stand to the blast without getting hurt. I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose the Klobuchar amendment.\n  I do know one thing. If we go too far in the wrong direction without \nbeing given the opportunity to better understand what we have done and \nwhy certain people are not coming under that test, as a country we are \ngoing to regret it. We are going to regret that we have put out of \nbusiness southern growers who provide 85 percent of the rice we consume \nin this country. The American people are going to hold us accountable \nwhen we become dependent on foreign food that comes from countries that \nhave no regulation on how it is grown, on what is used, no regulation \non the water source that may be used, how they fertilize, no \nregulations such as our farmers adhere to, producing the safest, most \nabundant, and affordable food supply in the world.\n  One of the things you can definitely say of the underlying bill that \npassed the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously is that millionaire \nnonfarmers need not apply where this bill is concerned. Going too far \nin the direction that Senator Klobuchar wants\n\n[[Page S15417]]\n\nto take us without understanding what we have already done and how it \nwill have unintended consequences could be dangerous for this country \nand the families of this country who depend on these working farms for \nthe safe and abundant supply of food they so desperately need.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, how much time remains on my side and \nthe other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 3\\1/2\\ minutes. The \nopponents have 2 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, the average farmer in my State makes \n$54,000 a year. I think you see family farmers like that all across \nthis country. That is what this amendment is about. There has been \ndebate about Scottie Pippen and all these people. The USDA has looked \nat this, the Government has looked at this, and this would save about \n$355 million. Where is that $355 million coming from? It is coming from \nfull-time farmers who are grossing $750,000 or more, into the millions \na year, and part-time farm investors who are making over $250,000 a \nyear. That is where this is coming from.\n  There has been discussion, which I think is smoke and mirrors, about \nexpenses. Let me make clear, farmers can deduct their operating \nexpenses such as seed, fertilizer, fuel, and labor from their adjusted \ngross income. When it comes to investment in buildings and equipment, \nthese are capital expenses, and they depreciate over time. That \ndepreciation is deductible. When it comes to land, it works like it \ndoes a home mortgage. Your interest is deductible, but your land is \nsomething you have that you get value from. When it comes to rented \nland, the rental cost of the land is fully deductible from adjusted \ngross income.\n  I didn't come up with these laws. They are in the Tax Code. They are \nthe law. What this is about is making sure we have some real reform. \nBecause if we don't do it in the farm States, it is going to happen to \nus. I have said this before, and I truly believe it will happen.\n  There has been some discussion about what our existing bill does. Let \nme explain again. The House-passed bill sets it at $1 million for full \ntime, $500,000 for part time. My colleagues have been saying: We have a \n70-percent reduction for a part-time farmer. That goes to say, if you \nstart high enough at $2.5 million, anything like 70 percent sounds \ngood. But instead, in fact, the actual Senate bill is only at $750,000 \nfor a part-time farmer.\n  I have visited hard-working farmers all over my State, visited all 87 \ncounties 2 years in a row. I have talked to them and to farm groups \nacross the country. Do they like this? Well, not totally. They get \nconcerned. What does that mean? I think many of them understand--and I \nknow Senator Grassley knows this in Iowa and Senator Dorgan understands \nthis in North Dakota--that at some point the Government has a limited \namount of money. We have to make some decisions. What I am saying is, \nlet's make a decision to help the hard-working farmers of this country \nto move in that new direction, to cellulosic ethanol and energy \nindependence and good conservation and making sure we have a strong \nsafety net that this farm program deserves. Let's go in that direction \nto the future and not stay here where we increasingly, as our economy \nhas changed, are giving a larger amount of money to the wealthiest \ninvestors. Beverly Hills 90210, $1 million in payments.\n  I believe in this safety net. I support this farm bill. I will \nsupport this farm bill, because I believe in a safety net. But I \nbelieve it is time to move to some reform. The people of this country \nare ready for this reform. The people in our rural communities are \nready for this reform. Now, my friends, we have a chance to do it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, as we close this debate, I want to say \nthanks to so many Senators who have worked hard to come up with \nparticularly what we brought out of the Agriculture Committee which was \nan enormously well-balanced bill. We eliminated loopholes that people \nhad complained about. We eliminated the three-entity rule, the generic \ncertificates. We put in transparency that people have been clamoring \nfor in the direct attribution. I remind people that these are all \nthings that apply to the basic commodity programs. Here we go again \nwith going farther in something we have already reformed.\n  Senator Klobuchar wants to go one step farther in lowering that AGI. \nBut you have to ask the question: Why is it we have to cherry-pick \nlowering that means testing and AGI just for the commodity programs, so \nit hits the capital-intensive crops that southern growers grow? Why \ndoes it not apply to the conservation payments that go out that are in \nlarge numbers? Why doesn't it apply to the sugar program or the MILC \nprogram or the ethanol tax credit? It simply cherry-picks those \nindividuals whom they can cherry-pick. That is the commodities program.\n  My argument to my colleagues is, we have lowered the AGI means test \nfrom the 2002 farm bill by 70 percent. Some of the people who were used \nas examples should be caught. I am not sure why they are not. Maybe it \nis the reason the GAO study tells us this administration doesn't \nimplement the existing law. But we should make sure that what we are \ndoing in this bill is working before we begin to take a further step \nand suffer the unintended consequences of putting out of business those \nfarmers who use these programs when prices are low, cherry-picking \nthose commodities that are capital intensive and will suffer the most \nfrom this, and not extending this across the board so that everybody \nfeels the pain, so everybody understands what it means when you start \nputting means testing on programs, when you are dealing with \ncircumstances that are beyond our farmers' control, when you are \ndealing with weather, trade, global competition?\n  I ask my colleagues to think twice before they support this amendment \nand remember that we have done 70 percent in terms of lowering the AGI \ntest. I hope they will oppose the Klobuchar amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, again, trying to work this through and \nget our amendments lined up, I have a unanimous consent request, and \nthen we will be on our way to four votes in a row.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Coburn amendment \nNo. 3530 be modified with the changes at the desk, and that the \namendment then be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that upon disposition of the Brown amendment, the Senate \nthen return to the Craig amendment No. 3640, and that there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote, with the time divided between \nSenators Craig and Leahy, and that the Craig amendment be subject to \nthe same 60-vote threshold as is provided for in the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say \nto the chairman of the committee, I think you alluded to the Craig \namendment as 3640. It is 3630.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is 3640.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3530), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title XI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PAYMENTS TO DECEASED INDIVIDUALS AND ESTATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary shall not provide to any deceased \n     individual or estate of such an individual any agricultural \n     payment under this Act, or an Act amended by this Act, after \n     the date that is 2 program years (as determined by the \n     Secretary with respect to the applicable payment program) \n     after the date of death of the individual.\n\n[[Page S15418]]\n\n       (b) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry of the Senate, and post on the website of the \n     Department of Agriculture, a report that describes, for the \n     period covered by the report--\n       (1) the number and aggregate amount of agricultural \n     payments described in subsection (a) provided to deceased \n     individuals and estates of deceased individuals; and\n       (2) for each such payment, the length of time the estate of \n     the deceased individual that received the payment has been \n     open.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, here is the situation, for all Senators. \nWe are now going to be having a series of votes. The first vote will \noccur on the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. \nThat will be a 15-minute vote. The next three votes will be Senator \nTester's amendment, then Senator Brown's amendment, and then Senator \nCraig's amendment. Those will be 10-minute votes. Each one of these has \na 60-vote threshold.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support the Klobuchar amendment because it \nmoves farm policy in the right direction. It would limit commodity \nprogram payments for those farmers who earn more than two-thirds of \ntheir income from farming, after expenses are deducted, to $750,000.\n  The amendment, however, has a number of problems. For example, rather \nthan applying the savings achieved by tightening the payment \nlimitations to deficit reduction, it applies most of the savings to \nother farm programs. It also does not apply the stricter income test to \nconservation program payments. Nevertheless, the amendment takes a step \nforward in reining Federal spending on farm subsidies and, therefore, \nwarrants my support.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3810\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the \nKlobuchar amendment.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, prior to the vote on the Tester amendment No. \n3666.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, this amendment would prevent \nbusinesses from using legitimate business justifications as a defense \nagainst claims of unlawful practice under the Packers and Stockyards \nAct. This is clearly a determination that should be left to the \ndiscretion of the courts and not summarily decided in advance by \nCongress. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It \nwould stop the meatpackers from using business justifications to create \na monopoly or restrain commerce. That is it.\n  If you want free markets and to support family farmers and ranchers \nand cow/calf operations, you need to vote for this amendment. I ask for \na ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3819\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 3819 offered by the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Brown.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, this amendment threatens to undermine \nand kill the Crop Insurance Program so vital to farmers and ranchers. \nThe amendment does not take into account the real world expenses of \nindustry, including the list of the private reinsurers which ensures \nthat the taxpayers do not pick up the risk.\n  If we endanger this program, many farmers, especially young farmers, \nwill be in danger because their lenders and their landlords demand they \nsign up for crop insurance.\n  This is a genuine Kent Conrad chart, the veracity of which is \nunquestioned. If we look back to 1980, when I first had the privilege \nof coming to Congress, we had 64 crop insurance companies. We can see \nwhat has happened every decade as we further cut investment in crop \ninsurance. We are down to 16. We had a reform with Bob Kerrey in 2000. \nWe expanded it all over the country.\n\n[[Page S15419]]\n\n  If this amendment is adopted, I am telling my colleagues, it isn't \ngoing to be 16, it is going to be 5. Don't support this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nbipartisan Brown-Sununu-McCaskill RESCU amendment.\n  This amendment significantly improves the way we target Federal \nresources to agriculture--eliminating waste and providing additional \ninvestments in important programs. The amendment also redirects \nhundreds of millions of dollars into deficit reduction that would \notherwise subsidize large insurance companies.\n  As my colleague, Senator Brown, points out, in the last 7 years crop \ninsurance companies have received 40 cents out of every dollar that \nCongress has appropriated for the crop insurance program--that is $9 \nbillion out $19 billion for the program. This is billions of dollars \nmeant for farmers that ended up in the pockets of insurance companies. \nThe Brown amendment cuts $2 billion of that spending by lowering the \nsubsidy rate for insurers.\n  Currently, that subsidy is calculated based on crop prices. As crop \nprices rise, so does the subsidy--even though the work burden stays the \nsame. Rising commodity prices have driven up premiums so that these \nsubsidies are now over three times what they were 10 years ago, even \nthough the cost of administering the policies has stayed the same.\n  In other words, it makes no sense.\n  This amendment reduces the reimbursement rate to the 2004-2006 \nnational per policy average. This level is still higher than any year \nprior to 2006 and is quite fair to the companies.\n  A recent GAO report showed that compared to other insurance sectors, \ncrop insurance companies earn profits that are more than double \nindustry averages. I don't have a problem with industry profits, but I \ndon't think those profits should come right out of the pockets of U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  This amendment would require that insurers share a portion of their \nunderwriting gains or losses with Federal taxpayers by increasing the \nFederal share of risk from 5 percent to 15 percent.\n  The $2 billion in savings would fund over $1 billion in improvements \nto the Food Stamp Program, $400 million for conservation programs, $200 \nmillion for the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, and over $600 \nmillion for deficit reduction.\n  Through these changes, we will be able to conserve soil and water \nquality on millions of acres of farmland, provide real food benefits to \na countless number of less fortunate Americans, and make a significant \ninvestment in the lives of millions of children from some of the \npoorest corners of the world.\n  Farmers will not pay more for crop insurance. This amendment does not \nreduce premium subsidies to farmers. Premium subsidies are set by law. \nThis amendment does not change them.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Brown and McCaskill, for their hard \nwork assembling this language.\n  Now, let me just say a few words about the McGovern-Dole Program, \nwhich would enjoy increased funding under this amendment.\n  The amendment would provide enough mandatory money for the McGovern-\nDole International School Feeding Program to provide nutritious meals \nto millions of children each year who would otherwise go hungry.\n  The McGovern-Dole Program is based on a simple idea that I first read \nabout in an op-ed written by former Senator George McGovern in 2000. \nThe op-ed was titled ``Too Many Children Are Hungry. Time for Lunch,'' \nand it argued that the fastest way to alleviate poverty in less \ndeveloped countries is to provide healthy, nutritious meals to children \nattending school. The principle is simple--by linking school attendance \nwith nutritious meals, you provide an incentive for families to send \ntheir children to school to become educated, rather than keeping them \nat home to work. And as children become more educated and better fed, \nthey grow up smarter, stronger, and better able to earn a living and \nmake positive contributions to their societies.\n  The statistics are startling. Since it was founded in 2000 by \nPresident Clinton as the Global Food for Education Initiative, GFEI, \nthe program has provided healthy meals to more than 26 million boys and \ngirls in 41 countries around the world. Through the program, American-\ngrown wheat, rice, peas, corn, and other crops have been provided to \nyoung children in countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Chad, Nicaragua, \nNepal, and Senegal. More than 500,000 metric tons of commodities have \nbeen distributed since the program's inception.\n  In communities that have benefited from the McGovern-Dole Program, \nschool attendance rates have increased 14 percent on average and 17 \npercent for girls compared to similar communities that have not \nbenefited from the program. What is even more amazing than the \nstatistics are the stories about what this program enables in some of \nthe world's poorest communities.\n  Take my friend Paul Tergat. Paul Tergat is the current world record \nholder in the marathon. He ran the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes. \nWhen Paul was a child living in Kenya, he received free lunches through \na World Food Program school feeding program. Without the program, he \nsays he would not have been able to go to school because his parents \nwere too poor. He says it is likely he never would have trained to \nbecome an athlete were it not for the generosity of the program.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have seen school feeding programs like \nthese in person, and I can tell you they have a transformative effect. \nI saw the program when I traveled to Kibera in Kenya--it is one of the \nworld's largest slums. Over 1 million people. It is the slum that you \nsee if you have ever watched the film ``The Constant Gardener.'' When \nyou visit, there are people as far as the eye can see, kids playing in \nthe streets, in railway yards, everywhere.\n  We visited a school in Kibera and saw a feeding program in action. At \nlunch time, the students were provided with what looked like gruel or \nporridge--it was a highly nutritious enriched food provided thanks to \nthe productivity of U.S. farmers and the generosity of U.S. taxpayers. \nThe children stood in line patiently, and you could just tell this was \ngoing to be their one meal of the day. And they were there in school so \nthey could get that meal. It is these types of stories that make you a \nbeliever in the power of school feeding programs. This program is \ntransformative in the lives of vulnerable children around the world. \nAnd it promotes U.S. interests around the world. Delivering bags of \nfood labeled as gifts of the people of the United States is a public \ndiplomacy tool that demonstrates the good will and generosity of the \nAmerican people. It represents the best of our values, and it tells \npeople all over the world who we are and what America stands for. \nImagine the possibilities for shaping perceptions of the United States \nif we significantly increase our investment in the McGovern-Dole \nProgram--the millions more children we could touch at an early, \nimpressionable age and give the most basic gift of a healthy, \nnutritious childhood.\n  The McGovern-Dole Program is also good for American farmers and the \nagriculture industry. In 2005, the program distributed approximately \n120,000 metric tons of U.S. commodities. The McGovern-Dole Program is \nalso good for related industries, including processors, millers, \npackagers, freight forwarders and shippers, as well as U.S. port \nfacilities.\n  The program serves as one more market for U.S. commodities, which is \none reason the program has the support of a wide range of industry \ngroups, including the American Soybean Association, the North American \nMillers Association, and the National Farmers Union.\n  This is a strong amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, the Brown-Sununu-McCaskill-McCain-Durbin-\nSchumer amendment will make the Crop Insurance Program work for family \nfarmers and work for taxpayers. In the last 6 years, $10.5 billion in \nbenefits through the Crop Insurance Program have gone to farmers. It \ntook 19 billion taxpayer dollars to deliver that $10 billion in \nbenefits. Farmers get less than half of the crop insurance money. Of \nthe crop insurance dollars, more money goes to insurers than it does to \nfarmers. We want to take a very small\n\n[[Page S15420]]\n\namount of that and move it to deficit reduction and move it to the \nconservation programs and move it to the McGovern-Dole Program, \nsomething I know Senator Roberts supports.\n  This is not going to mean the Crop Insurance Program is in jeopardy. \nThis will make the Crop Insurance Program work better for family \nfarmers and work better for taxpayers.\n  I ask for my colleagues' support of the Brown-Sununu-McCaskill-\nMcCain-Durbin-Schumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote in relation to amendment No. 3640, offered by \nthe Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, fellow Senators, this is a fundamental \nprivate property rights vote. This is what is happening across America. \nThis is what is happening across America in a post-Kelo decision. \nCounties and cities are oftentimes reaching out into farm country, \ncondemning land, and holding it as open space when it is already open \nspace, and this amendment speaks to that.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor, in her dissent against Kelo v. New London, said \nthis:\n\n       The fallout from this decision will not be random. The \n     beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with \n     disproportionate influence and power in the political \n     process, including large corporations and development firms. \n     As for the victims, the government now has license to \n     transfer property from those with fewer resources to those \n     with more.\n\n  The American Farm Bureau, the American National Cattleman's and Beef \nGrowers, and the National Public Lands Council support this amendment. \nIf the Judiciary Committee had responded, and I hoped they would have, \nwe would have a much broader definition as it relates to Kelo and as it \nrelates to the right for eminent domain.\n  Clearly, the public good is not damaged because entities still have \nthe right for the public good, and that has always been the purpose of \neminent domain. But simply to acquire property through condemnation \nwhen it is open space, to hold it as open space and to deny the private \nproperty owner his or her rights is fundamentally wrong under our \nConstitution.\n  I urge support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I strongly disagreed with the very \nconservative, very activist Supreme Court decision on Kelo, but this is \nnot the place to correct that, on a farm bill. If the Senate, or any \nSenator, wants to introduce legislation to repeal Kelo, then let's take \nit to the committee of jurisdiction, the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nand we will hold hearings on it.\n  There have been no hearings. This amendment does nothing to prevent \nthe Government from seizing private property in order to hand it over \nto private developers. Instead, it allows governments to seize farmland \nfor a prison but not eminent domain for conservation purposes or a \nparkland. It is opposed by all the leading conservation groups--the \nDefenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife Federation, the Wilderness \nSociety, and on and on.\n  Now, my commitment to farming is very strong, but I don't want to say \nlet's grab farmland for a prison because we passed legislation that \nnobody has reviewed, nobody has done anything on. This is a mistake. It \ndoesn't belong in a farm bill.\n  If the Senate, or any Senator, wants to overturn the Kelo decision, \nwhich after all was done by an activist Republican conservative Supreme \nCourt, then we will hold hearings on it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, our Government should not be able to \nconfiscate the land of private citizens in a way that is reckless or \nthat benefits the pecuniary interests of private developers at the \nexpense of the public good. That is why I share the concerns of many \nAmericans about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of \nNew London, where the Court held that eminent domain could be used to \ntransfer private property to other private owners for development \npurposes. However, today, I joined a majority of the Senate in voting \nagainst an amendment that would have unduly limited the power of \neminent domain by State and local governments because the reach of the \namendment was far too broad and its text had not been the subject of \nhearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The proposed \nlegislation would have imposed severe Federal sanctions on State and \nlocal governments seeking to exercise eminent domain over land for \nperfectly legitimate and defensible reasons, including for purposes of \nhistoric preservation, conservation, to create parks, or to promote \nrecreation or community service. I share the view of most Americans \nthat the power of eminent domain must be exercised in a fair, prudent, \nand balanced way. Unfortunately, this amendment would not have \naccomplished that objective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3640.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of the message from the House on H.R. 6, \nthe Energy bill; that the pending motion to concur be withdrawn; that \nthe Senate move to concur in the House amendment with the amendment at \nthe desk; that no other amendments or motions be in order; that there \nbe a time limitation of 30 minutes equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees for debate only on that motion; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate, without intervening \naction, vote on the motion to concur; that if the motion is agreed to, \nthe Senate concur in the House amendment to the title and the motions \nto reconsider be laid on the table; that if the motion to concur is not \nagreed to, it be withdrawn and the message returned to the desk.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I could \nask the distinguished leader to yield, could you amend that to make \nthat 40 minutes instead of 30 minutes because we already have 18 \nminutes of requests.\n  Mr. REID. I would add to that, I say to my distinguished friend, that \nwe would have the final 10 minutes prior to the vote, 5 minutes for \nSenator McConnell and 5 minutes for me, so that will wind up being \nabout 50 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection as amended?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Whitehouse) laid before the Senate the \namendment of the House of Representatives to the bill (H.R. 6) entitled \n``An Act to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil by investing \nin clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, promoting new \nemerging energy technologies, developing greater efficiency, and \ncreating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest \nin alternative energy, and for other purposes, with amendments.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending motion to concur with an amendment \nis withdrawn.\n  The pending motion is a motion to concur in the House amendment to \nthe Senate amendment to the text of the bill with an amendment which is \nat the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3850\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute.)\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There shall be 40 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, out of the minority time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that these times be reserved for specific Members: Senator \nDomenici, 5 minutes; Senator Inhofe, 5 minutes; Senator Stevens, 5 \nminutes; and Senator Hutchison, 3 minutes, out of our allocated 20 \nminutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would ask the Presiding Officer, how \nmuch time exists on each side in connection with this pending bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes on each side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As I understand, 20 minutes and then 5 minutes for each \nof the leaders. So I would just speak for 3 minutes at this point and \nthen yield to my colleague from New Mexico, who I know is planning to \nspeak as well.\n  Mr. President, let me amend my earlier statement. I will take up to 5 \nminutes, please, if the Chair would advise me at the end of the 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senate has a very good energy bill before it. It would take a \nnumber of steps that will be viewed over the long term as very major \nsteps in our energy policy.\n  This is the first increase in CAFE standards in well over 20 years. \nIt has improved efficiency standards for lightbulbs, for lighting \nfixtures, which will eventually save more energy than all of our \nprevious energy efficiency standards combined. This bill contains \npermanent authorization for energy savings performance contracts--the \nsingle most useful tool for increasing energy efficiency in the Federal \nGovernment. It contains a strengthened program for carbon dioxide \ncapture and geological sequestration and a framework for working \nthrough issues associated with geologic storage of carbon dioxide on \nFederal lands. It also contains strong new protections for consumers \nagainst market manipulation in oil markets.\n  The story of this Energy bill is not only one of what we accomplished \nbut also those items we were not able to accomplish.\n  In the case of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the biggest issue on \nwhich we did not make progress was energy efficiency, especially \nincreased vehicle fuel economy. We have rectified that, or we will be \nrectifying that as we go forward and pass this legislation and get it \nsigned into law.\n  For this bill, there were two big challenges we have proven unequal \nto here in the Senate. In my view, one is, of course, dealing with the \nvery real problem of how to further incentivize the development of \nrenewable energy. I hope we will have a chance to revisit the renewable \nelectricity standard in the new Congress. I also hope we can revisit \nthis issue of tax incentives. We failed earlier today to maintain in \nthe legislation a package of tax incentives which I think is very \nimportant for the energy policy of this country.\n  We have an extremely capable staff that has worked long and hard on \nthis legislation.\n  The Senate Energy Committee staff--there are many individuals here: \nBob Simon, Sam Fowler, Allyson Anderson, Angela Becker-Dippmann, Patty \nBeneke, Mia Bennett, Tara Billingsley, Rosemarie Calabro, Michael Carr, \nMike Connor, Jonathan Epstein, Deborah Estes, Alicia Jackson, Amanda \nKelly, Leon Lowery, David Marks, Scott Miller, Rachel Pasternack, \nBritni Rillera, Gina Weinstock, and Bill Wicker. All of them have done \na great job.\n  Senator Domenici's staff has also done a terrific job. Frank \nMacchiarola, Judy Pensabene, Kellie Donnelly, Kathryn Clay, Colin \nHayes, Frank Gladics, and Kara Gleason, among others on his staff I \nknow have done a good job.\n  The Senate owes a particular debt of gratitude to Senator Inouye's \nand Senator Stevens' staff, who developed the CAFE provisions in this \nbill. In particular, David Strickland of the Commerce Committee staff \ndeserves recognition for his leadership, skill, and tenacity in \nnegotiating these historic provisions.\n  Chris Miller, on Senator Reid's staff, deserves our thanks for \nhelping with the overall coordination of the bill in the Senate and \nwith the House of Representatives. His counterparts in Speaker Pelosi's \noffice, Amy Fuerstenau and Lara Levison, also put in countless hours \nattending meetings and helping to coordinate the activities of about 10 \ndifferent House committees with interests in this bill.\n  Special recognition also is due to the hard-working staff of the \nOffice of Senate Legislative Counsel on this bill.\n\n[[Page S15422]]\n\n  Their team leader, Gary Endicott, worked tirelessly to ensure that \nthe provisions of this bill were expressed in clear and correct legal \nform.\n  His partner for the CAFE provisions was Lloyd Ator of the Commerce \nCommittee staff.\n  Other key contributors in the office of Senate Legislative Counsel \nincluded Michelle Johnson-Weider, John Henderson, Matt McGhie, Mark \nMathiesen, Mark McGunagle, and Jim Fransen. They enjoyed the \ncooperation of their colleagues in the House Office of Legislative \nCounsel, including Tim Brown and Pope Barrow. Without the many hours \nthey invested in drafting, redrafting, and assembling this bill, we \nwould not have a finished text to consider today.\n  Finally, staff in the Congressional Budget Office, including Kathy \nGramp, Megan Carroll, Dave Hull, and Matthew Pickford, helped us ensure \nthat the bill was compliant with the complicated scoring rules that \nface every major piece of legislation.\n  All of these staff in Leg Counsel and CBO made themselves available \non evenings and weekends to help ensure that we could finish this bill \nthis year.\n  With that, I will thank my colleagues for their support for this \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote aye on the motion to go ahead with this \nlegislation and send this bill to the President.\n  I know there are others who wish to speak. How much time remains on \nthe majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 20 minutes, including the 5 minutes for \nthe leader.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to support this energy \nlegislation but not without reservation.\n  I will begin by saying that I think there are some very good \nprovisions in this bill. This Congress is taking a major step by \nincreasing the CAFE standards. This increase calls for a 35-mile-per-\ngallon standard in every car by 2020. This is a huge conservation \nvictory. In fact, it is a 40-percent increase from our current \nstandard. I am also pleased that we have included the measures to \nincrease energy efficiency in Federal buildings. The Federal Government \nshould be a leader in promoting and adopting efficiency. We are \naddressing new technologies and emerging science in environmental areas \nsuch as carbon sequestration. We were able to remove the onerous tax \nprovisions that would have made America only more dependent upon \nforeign sources of energy and made high prices even higher.\n  However, I do remain concerned with the renewable fuel standard. The \nproposal before us will increase the renewable fuel standard from the \ncurrent requirement of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012 to 36 billion \ngallons by 2022. This renewable fuel standard is noble in its \nobjective, but it is a reckless way to draft this legislation, and here \nis why. It does not have a safety valve to address shortfalls in \nfeedstocks which will be required to meet the renewable fuel standards \nmandate.\n  I have been working with Texas livestock producers and food \nprocessors for months to try to create a safety valve that would have, \nin conjunction with the waiver provision currently in the bill, a \nprospective protection from harming these industries. I believe the \nexisting waiver provision and the safety valve could function and \ncoexist without resulting in market uncertainty for the RFS increase.\n  I believe livestock and poultry producers and food processors are \ngoing to face uncertainty under these mandates. For this reason, I have \nworked with these industries and my colleagues in the Senate to strike \na balance to provide some level of prospective analysis and relief if \nexperts conclude that there will be a shortfall that leads to price \nspikes in items such as corn, cereal, chicken, and beef. Unfortunately, \nthis bill does not contain this safety valve, and I am very concerned \nthat we are going to have problems down the road and millions of \nAmericans are going to pay higher grocery bills because of \nunanticipated events, such as droughts or floods, which impact crop \nyields.\n  I have tried to be reasonable in creating this safety valve, and we \nmust watch this closely if we pass this bill, and I think we will. We \nmust give relief to the livestock producers and the consumers in this \ncountry if, in fact, we cannot produce this mandate that is in this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to clarify the time because I think time was \nallotted and some Senators who should have gotten time were not here. \nHow much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 21 minutes remaining, \nincluding 5 minutes of leader time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to ask Senator Stevens how much time he wants. \nSenator Stevens wants 3 minutes, but he wants Senator Inouye to speak \nfirst.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inouye for all of his hard \nwork, Senators Stevens, Bingaman, and Domenici. I could go on.\n  I speak as a Senator from California. I also speak as the chairman of \nthe EPW Committee and say this is a very good moment for the Senate. I \nsee my ranking member here, Senator Inhofe. Four of the provisions in \nthis bill we worked on together in the committee. I think we are both \nvery pleased with them. This has been a long and winding road, as the \nsong says. But here we are with a bill that I believe is very strong. I \ncertainly am disappointed, because I think it should have been much \nstronger. To think that we could not get the 60 votes to ensure that \nsolar energy, wind energy, and geothermal had tax incentives makes me \nsad. A simple part of that was also rejected that dealt with the \nrenewable portfolio standard that makes a lot of sense and works in \nCalifornia. I think it would have worked. We are not going to give up \non any of that. But we will fight for those another day.\n  Today we should take a moment to say, good job. Good job to all of us \nto get to this moment.\n  I want to talk a minute about the four provisions of the EPW that are \nin this bill. Green buildings, new Federal buildings will be energy \nefficient, will be green. As part of that we also passed a separate \npiece of legislation to retrofit the older buildings. We did it in a \nvery simple way. We say in all of GSA buildings we want an individual \nresponsible for retrofitting those buildings, and we will give grants \nto local governments to retrofit their government buildings as well.\n  There is also a part in this bill dedicated to funding a solar wall \non the Department of Energy so the Department of Energy becomes a \nsymbol of renewable energy. There is a pilot project for the Capitol \npowerplant so we can get clean energy there as well.\n  I thank Erik Olson, Bettina Poirier from the EPW Committee staff, and \nthe minority staff as well, Andrew Wheeler and his team for all of \ntheir hard work. I have already thanked Senator Inhofe. Very special \nthanks to Senators Feinstein, Snowe, Dorgan, Carper, Cantwell, and to \nour chairman Senator Inouye, again, for their hard work on CAFE.\n  I am also pleased that the Federal fleet of cars will now move to \nfuel efficiency. I don't know how many people are aware, but we buy \n60,000 new cars a year for the Federal fleet, and it makes so much \nsense for us to go out in that marketplace and move toward fuel \nefficiency and fuel economy.\n  In this bill, we have renewable fuels, fuel efficiency, green \nbuildings. It is a great start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Domenici for all his \nhard work. It is one of the few times I can recall that I have \ndisagreed with him on a position. I do so on this particular bill. Let \nme first say while the chairman of the EPW committee is still here, I \nagree with the comments she made. We have some provisions in here that \nare an improvement but, in my mind, not enough of an improvement to \npass this bill. First let me say I what I think is wrong with this. The \nrenewable fuels standard increase is\n\n[[Page S15423]]\n\ngoing to mandate an increase from 7\\1/2\\ to 15. That is of corn \nethanol. Then other bio increases are more than that. But as far as the \ncorn is concerned, in my State of Oklahoma, I have been talking to the \nlivestock people and the poultry people, the meat industry in Oklahoma, \nthe backbone of our economy. They are very distressed because of the \nincrease in the cost of feedstock. This is going to make it that much \nworse. There are other problems with that, too, with ethanol's effect \non food prices: economic sustainability, transportation infrastructure \nneeds, the water usage in this process. It is something I think is a \nbad provision.\n  It is going to pass, probably with 80 votes. Maybe I will be the only \nvote against it. But another thing, I am not as impressed with the CAFE \nstandards. I know everybody is talking about, yes, we have to do this. \nWe have to have these mandates. You have to keep in mind this is still \nAmerica. We have choices in America. In western Europe they don't. Some \nother countries they don't. So we are going to be emulating them. If \nyou will listen to the National Safety Council, the Brookings \nInstitute, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the National \nAcademy of Sciences, all of these groups say this provision is going to \nbe a safety threat for Americans.\n  On the tax provisions, I do appreciate the fact that they were able \nto bring down some of these. There are still some tax increases but \nnothing like it was at one time. I think it is important for people to \nunderstand this does extend a $1.4 billion tax, the FUTA tax. This was \nestablished in 1976 to repay loans from the Federal unemployment trust \nfund. They were all repaid by 1987. So they keep finding a vehicle to \nrenew a $1.4 billion tax increase on the American people. It is right \nhere in this legislation.\n  One of the things I guess that bothered me more than anything else \nwas when we did the highway bill, the highway reauthorization bill was \na good bill. We spent a lot of time on that. We had provisions in there \nto give the States more flexibility with their money to meet the needs \nin their States with the recognition that the States are closer to the \npeople. They know what their needs are more than the Federal Government \ndoes. We got those provisions in there. Because some people in the \nHouse didn't want the States to have that flexibility, we beat them in \nconference so they put it in this bill. So now we have two provisions \nin this bill that are going to make it more difficult for States. In \nfact, it is going to take away their flexibility. We are taking away \nStates rights with this bill. That is what it does.\n  I will tell you what it doesn't do. It has no provisions for nuclear \npower. Everybody understands we have to address that. That was one of \nthe provisions when we first started talking about this. Nothing in \nthere for clean coal technology, for exploration, to promote refinery \nexpansion. We had a bill called the Gas Price Act. No one should have \nbeen opposed to it. I begged to have this as a part of this bill. Those \nwho put it together found it wasn't something that could be acceptable. \nIt would increase our refinery capacity and resolve many other problems \nwith some of our closed military bases. That was not a part of this \nbill and should have been.\n  This bill will mean a profound increase of the cost of fuel at the \npumps. People have to know that. We can talk about how good it is and \nsend out our press releases, but in the final analysis, it is going to \nincrease the price at the pump. It is going to make it more difficult. \nIt is going to exacerbate the problem of what I consider to be an \nenergy crisis.\n  So it is not an energy bill. It is one that I may be the only one \nopposing, but I thought I would share with you why I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, clearly this energy bill points us in a \nnew direction. This is a much greener energy bill than we have seen in \nthe past and certainly is more consumer friendly. It is a greener \nenergy bill because it is nearly a 20-percent reduction in future \nCO2 output by the year 2030. It is a greener energy bill \nbecause it does make mandates on the Federal Government's use of \nenergy. In fact, it is a 30-percent reduction in energy used by Federal \nbuildings, resulting in a $4 billion annual savings to taxpayers by \n2020. I know that may be hard for some people to believe and \nunderstand, but it is a lot of savings considering that there are \n500,000 Federal buildings and that Government is the largest user of \nelectricity in the country. So mandating these energy reductions is \ngoing to make us more efficient and certainly apply the use of those \nsavings to help American taxpayers.\n  It is also a greener energy bill because it sets up new appliance and \nlighting standards. Again, I know people underestimate efficiency. \nToday household appliances, lighting, and electronics use up to two-\nthirds of the energy in households. By requiring these new standards \nfor manufacture of these products, we will save over 40,000 megawatts \nof energy. That is the same amount of electricity used in 19 States \ntoday. It is certainly a greener energy bill because we are putting at \nthe pump for consumers a renewable fuel competition for fossil fuel. We \nare doing that by mandating 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by \n2020. That amount is the same amount we import from the Persian Gulf \ntoday. So swapping that oil out for a greener energy supply for our \nfuture is a tremendous benefit.\n  This also is a great consumer bill. It is a great consumer bill \nbecause of the fuel efficiency standards. The 35 miles per gallon will \nsave American drivers over $200 billion at the gas pump. For my State \nof Washington, we will give consumers an annual $436 million of \nsavings. It is also a consumer-friendly bill because we are reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil. This is a 35-percent reduction in our \nforeign oil consumption, and American consumers view this as one of our \nNation's biggest priorities.\n  And it is a consumer-friendly bill because we have protected \nconsumers by making market manipulation of oil markets a Federal crime. \nI know we have heard stories. I know there are lots of issues about \nspeculation. But by giving the FTC new authority to issue fines per \nviolation, we are giving consumers more protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to Senator Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the chairman for yielding. I commend him and the \nyoung man sitting next to him, David Strickland, who has done great \nwork, as has a member of my staff, Beth Osborne, seated behind me.\n  We can talk about what might have been and how this legislation could \nhave been better, more comprehensive. Six months ago I stood here and \nsaid, there are three things we need to accomplish with respect to fuel \nefficiency for cars, trucks, and vans. No. 1, we ought to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. No. 2, we should reduce the emissions of \nharmful stuff up into the air. No. 3, we should accomplish goals 1 and \n2 without undermining the competitiveness of the domestic auto \nindustry.\n  Tonight as we are on the verge of passing this legislation, we will \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil, we will reduce harmful emissions, \nand we will not undermine the competitive advantage of our domestic \nauto industry. It is not enough for us as a Congress to say to the auto \nindustry, raise fuel efficiency standards, eat your spinach. We have a \nresponsibility to help them. In this legislation we do any number of \nthings to help the industry--major investments in R, new battery \ntechnology--just as we had invested previously Federal dollars in fuel \ncell technology for cars, trucks, and vans. Secondly, using the \nGovernment's purchasing power to help commercialize the new technology \nboth on the civilian side and on the defense side to make a market for \nthese new products. Three, to use tax incentives for hybrids, for low-\nemission diesel in order to encourage people to buy these vehicles.\n  We can lament what might have been. Let me say in graphic terms what \nthis legislation means. Today we import about 2.5 million barrels of \noil per day. By 2020, this legislation will save that much oil or more. \nToday we emit huge amounts of CO2 into the air. We\n\n[[Page S15424]]\n\nwarm our globe and imperil our future. This legislation will reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions by about 20 percent, essentially taking 60 \nmillion cars off the road by 2020.\n  Finally, we are going to say this is based on $3-a-gallon gasoline. \nBut we are going to save consumers close to $100 billion at the pump in \nthe year 2020. Those are huge savings. They are tangible savings. We, \nas Democrats in the majority, have an obligation to lead. We have led. \nWe have worked with the auto industry, the UAW. We have worked with our \nRepublican brethren.\n  The American people want us to get things done. They want us to find \na way to set aside partisan politics and work together. I think in this \ninstance we have done that. I commend Senator Inouye and Senator \nStevens, and I commend Senators Boxer, Bingaman, and Domenici, our \nstaffs who have worked so hard.\n  I thank the auto industry, the UAW, our friends over in the House, \nincluding John Dingell, Speaker Pelosi, and Majority Leader Steny \nHoyer.\n  This a victory not just for the Democratic Party and the Republican \nParty, and not just for the Congress, this is a victory for America. We \ncan be proud of this, and I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. I rise today in \nsupport of the bill before us. After months of constructive \nnegotiations, we have successfully crafted a thoughtful, bipartisan \nagreement, particularly in title I, otherwise known as the Ten-in-Ten \nFuel Economy Act.\n  Title I would mandate an increase in automobile fuel economy to a \nnationwide fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. In addition, \nthe Department of Transportation would adopt fuel economy standards for \nmedium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles for the first time.\n  Today's agreement marks historic progress: This is the first \nstatutory increase in fuel economy standards since 1975. Reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil is of vital importance to our national \nsecurity, economic stability, and consumer welfare. The Ten-in-Ten Fuel \nEconomy Act is a major step toward achieving these goals.\n  Title I of this bill will save approximately 1.1 million barrels of \noil per day in 2020, equal to one-half of what we currently import \ndaily from the Persian Gulf. By the year 2020, this bill will save \nconsumers approximately $22 billion at the pump and prevent \napproximately 200 million metric tons of greenhouse gases from \npolluting our environment each year. By dramatically reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2020, title I would demonstrate to the \nworld that America is a leader in fighting global warming.\n  Legislation of this magnitude could have only been achieved through \nthe hard work of a coalition of Members. In this case, without Senator \nFeinstein, Senators Stevens, Snowe, Kerry, Dorgan, Lott, Carper, Boxer, \nDurbin, Alexander, Corker, and Cantwell, the agreement would not have \nbeen reached.\n  In particular, I congratulate Senator Feinstein on her efforts in \ndeveloping this bill. Her dedication over the years has led to a public \npolicy that very few thought possible. I also praise the efforts of my \ngood friend Senator Stevens, who was instrumental in forging the \ncompromise before us. I also thank Chairman Dingell and Senators Levin \nand Stabenow for their hard work and willingness to achieve an \nagreement that aggressively improves fuel economy while protecting \ndomestic manufacturing and U.S. workers. The American auto worker and \nautomaker have no better champions.\n  Finally, I express my appreciation to all the hard-working members of \nthe staff who worked to make this historic legislation a reality. In \nparticular, I commend David Strickland, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Mia Petrini, \nand Jared Bomberg of my Commerce Committee staff for a job well done.\n  The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated. During \nthe Arab oil embargo in 1973, Americans suffered the first devastating \neffects of our addiction to oil. Born out of this embargo, Congress put \nin place a fuel economy program that nearly doubled the gas mileage of \ncars from 1975 to 1985. Passage of this bill will ensure that our \nNation's energy priorities start moving in the right direction again.\n  Higher fuel economy standards will wean the country of its oil \naddiction, put billions of dollars of savings back into our domestic \neconomy, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  A diverse group of constituencies support the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy \nAct, from environmentalists to automotive workers and automakers. While \nit sets forth aggressive standards, the act also recognizes the \nchallenges faced by the auto industry and ensures that those concerns \nwill be addressed. Providing flexibility to the automotive industry, \nthe sponsors of these fuel economy provisions have worked together in a \nbipartisan manner to ensure that automakers have the tools they need to \nmeet the requirements enumerated in the act. The Ten-in-Ten Fuel \nEconomy Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to create two fuel \neconomy curves, one for passenger cars and one for light trucks. This \nchange from the Senate-passed bill provides the certainty that American \nautomakers, auto workers, and car dealers requested, but the act still \nrequires that the combined car and light truck fleet meet a fuel \neconomy standard of at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.\n  Our actions today will improve national security, create jobs, help \nconsumers, and protect the environment. At times it is the Government's \nresponsibility to balance conflicting interests. Today, I believe we \nfound that balance.\n  Mr. President, I wish to provide 30 seconds to Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I too want to add my thanks to my \nstaff--Amit Ronen and Lauren Bazel--for their hard work, as well as the \nstaff of the Finance, Energy, and Commerce Committees.\n  I commend Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for working so hard to \nget this landmark legislation, which has been 30 years in the making, \nto pass here in the Senate. Everybody from these committees has worked \nvery hard. I thank the staff for their diligence and their perseverance \nin making this happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe I have 3 minutes yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at the beginning of this Congress I \nintroduced a bill to achieve a 40-mile-a-gallon goal by 2020. As I have \nindicated before, I became engaged in the CAFE debate because I believe \nthe only way our Nation will achieve energy independence is through a \ncombination of initiatives. Conservation, domestic production, and the \ndevelopment of alternative sources of energy are all parts of the \nbroader solution. Setting fuel economy standards is one avenue toward \nlimiting our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and significantly \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The Senate passed unanimously a CAFE amendment based upon the \nattribute concept I authored. The fuel economy provision that has been \nplaced in the bill is a good first step toward addressing our energy \ncrisis. I thank Senator Inouye and Senator Feinstein for their \ninsistence that the fuel economy provision be a product of bipartisan \ndiscussions. Their commitment to instituting strong and achievable \npolicy goals was instrumental during the negotiation process of fuel \neconomy standards.\n  The compromise we negotiated mandates the fuel economy of cars and \ntrucks to be evaluated separately based upon this attribute system. The \nmandate ensures reasonable fuel efficiency goals for trucks and cars. \nIn addition, the requirement will guarantee the continued availability \nof various sized trucks and cars in the market, which is important--\nvery important--to our home State of Alaska.\n  Our bill requires annual increases to the nationwide average fleet \nfuel economy standards for cars and light trucks to achieve a fleetwide \naverage standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. As Senator Inouye \nsaid, this will be the first statutory fuel economy increase for \npassenger cars since 1975.\n\n[[Page S15425]]\n\n  The bipartisan fuel economy provision will help save, as Senator \nCantwell has indicated, a significant amount of fuel over the next \ndecade. I thank the Senate for supporting this bipartisan measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of Senate Commerce \nCommittee staff on the Republican side who worked on the fuel economy \ncompromise be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senate Commerce Committee staff on the Republican side who \n     worked on the fuel economy compromise:\n       Chris Bertram.\n       Mimi Braniff.\n       Rebecca Hooks.\n       Christine Kurth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has just under 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is without the leader's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is including leadership time. There is a \nlittle over 9\\1/2\\ minutes without the leadership time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you. I will use 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: Our members URGE you to OPPOSE any \n     increase in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for feed grain \n     ethanol above those levels established by the Energy Policy \n     Act of 2005 (EPAct).\n       On May 2, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \n     held a markup in which several energy bills, including S. \n     987, were merged into one large bio and renewable energy \n     bill. Portions of S. 987 will increase the RFS mandate to 36 \n     billion gallons by 2022 and establish policy that beyond 2016 \n     a certain portion of the RFS must be met with biofuels other \n     than feed grain ethanol. Even with this differentiation, a \n     defacto mandate of 15 billion gallons of renewable fuels from \n     feed grains is established by 2015.\n       If our members can compete on a level playing field with \n     the ethanol industry for each bushel of feed grain, we have \n     no doubt that their businesses can remain profitable. But a \n     rush to increase the RFS for corn ethanol will only serve to \n     undermine their competitiveness.\n       The EPAct of 2005 established a RFS mandate of at least 7.5 \n     billion gallons of renewable fuel to be blended into motor \n     vehicle fuel sold in the United States by 2012. Doubling the \n     RFS mandate to 15 billion gallons for feed grain based \n     ethanol will require record feed grain production each and \n     every year and assumes the unlikely scenario of no adverse \n     weather events.\n       One goal of the EPAct was to lower the United States \n     dependency on foreign oil by promoting the usage of renewable \n     energies. This policy was deemed necessary in order to assure \n     investors and encourage the development of basic production \n     technology. However, with feed grain ethanol production \n     capacity projected to exceed 12.5 billion gallons by year's \n     end, the current incentives have accomplished the objective. \n     A rush to increase the RFS or extend the tax credits for feed \n     grain ethanol will only increase artificial demand for feed \n     grain and further decrease the ability of supply and demand \n     to guide the ethanol industry.\n       We all support our nation's commitment to reduce dependence \n     on foreign energy and develop forms of renewable energy. But, \n     we also believe in the free market, and URGE you to OPPOSE \n     any proposal to increase the RFS for feed grain ethanol. \n     Instead, we respectfully request that you pursue policies \n     which clearly define a transition to a market based approach \n     for the production and usage of feed grain ethanol.\n           Sincerely,\n       Independent Cattlemen's Assn.; Texas Association of \n     Dairymen; Texas Cattle Feeders Association; Texas and \n     Southwestern Cattle Raisers Assn.; Texas Pork Producers \n     Assn.; Texas Poultry Federation; and Texas Sheep and Goat \n     Raisers Assn.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank all of those who participated. \nTheir names have been mentioned, whether they be Senators or staff. I \nwant to say, I include all of those who have already been mentioned.\n  I want to make a couple statements that will make the record true.\n  First of all, this bill was not intended to solve all of America's \nenergy problems.\n  Second, it was not intended to have a huge number of energy proposals \nin it. It was a bill that had two great big core provisions, and we are \nvery grateful they are both here before the Senate--not exactly the way \nthey passed the Senate, but good enough for the kind of work that goes \non between the House and Senate. Because we must--we cannot get \nperfection--get some kind of compromise, we have a great bill.\n  Everybody has said all that can be said about this bill. But the \nCommerce Committee of the Senate, chaired by Senator Inouye, and with \nRanking Member Stevens--while we, the Energy Committee, were debating \none way, and another committee another way--one afternoon decided they \nwere going to alter, amend, and change the fuel standards for American \nautomobiles, and they did it. We have been waiting around for years for \nit. It was the impulse and impact for us to do the rest of this bill.\n  We added to it the RFS, which is ethanol 2--and I will acknowledge \nthat as to those speakers who have said it is not as good as the Senate \nprovision, they are right. But there are two bodies, and it was \ndifficult to negotiate everything we wanted. So there will have to be \nsome ardent observations of what is going on in ethanol and its \nsuccessor to ethanol to see if we need to make some changes. But things \nare not done in legislation to correct all problems. They are done to \ndo the best you can. If the best you can is good, you adopt it. We have \ndone that.\n  It certainly has been a rocky road, but I am thrilled that the Senate \nis finally considering a bill that contains the right priorities and \nstands an excellent chance of becoming law.\n  Today is a historic one for the U.S. Senate. The bill before us takes \nimportant steps to reduce our dependence on oil and improve our energy \nefficiency.\n  For the first time in 32 years, the Senate today will increase fuel \neconomy standards. We will also extend and expand the renewable fuels \nstandard, which will help us diversify our fuel supply. And we will \nimprove the efficiency of our appliances, our lighting, and our \nbuildings.\n  While I was not happy with the process by which we proceeded on this \nbill, it nonetheless reflects a compromise for many of us. And, \nreaching a fair agreement is the way things get done here in the \nSenate.\n  This energy bill contains the right priorities. Although it took us \ntwo tough cloture votes, we have avoided adding costly provisions that \nwould have placed this bill in jeopardy, like a renewable portfolio \nstandard and tax increases on domestic energy production.\n  Instead, we have focused on provisions that will help us save oil and \nsave energy, such as CAFE and energy efficiency. The renewable fuels \nstandard that we enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has already \nhelped farmers and diversified our fuel supply, and that RFS is \nexpanded in this bill.\n  The House of Representatives should pass this bill, and I believe \nthat the President should sign it into law.\n  I am pleased to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass \nit today. We will send the right message and begin the long process of \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I wish to close by saying, everyone did not agree on what would go in \nthis bill along with the energy provisions. There were very difficult \nvotes that were taken, and actually there was no question that as \nbetween the Democrats and Republicans there was truly a big difference \nof opinion. But when it ended up, we had the major energy provisions \nleft in the bill. We had tax provisions mostly out. We had the \nprovision that has to do with mandating alternative fuels, led by wind, \nby every State--we had that provision out.\n  What is left is a very good bill. Senator Bingaman described some of \nthe unheard of and unknown quantities that are good. The other Senators \nhave all sung the praises, so I do not need to do it again. It is \nhistoric, however, to change the automobile standards after 32 years, \nand to do it in a way where our automobile makers think they can \ncomply. That is very unique. They never did that. They think they can \ncomply and keep their businesses manufacturing cars. That is No. 2.\n  No. 3, when you are looking to solve the problem of how much crude \noil you import, you look for someplace you can save on that quantity \nand commodity\n\n[[Page S15426]]\n\nyou are importing. Now, the best experts in America have testified \nthere is no act the Congress could take that will do more to cut our \ndependence upon foreign oil than this measure. Get it? The experts of \nAmerica say you will reduce America's dependence more by the passage of \nthis bill, the Inouye-Stevens bill, than any other single provision you \ncould pass. That is pretty good.\n  The experts are in the records where we have taken testimony as \nSenators. The best experts said that about 2 weeks ago. It shocked \neverybody. They said there is nothing you can do that will save more \nforeign oil that we import that makes us dependent than if you change \nCAFE standards as we have changed them.\n  I think that would have to be hard work. Senators are tired. They \nvoted twice on cloture on this bill in a roundabout way. In both \ninstances, one or two votes was the only difference. That makes \nsometimes for hard feelings. But I do not think it has here. I think we \nhave come out of this OK, friends, ready to go to work on some more \nenergy bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I have worked closely with the staff of \nSenator Inouye and Senator Domenici on an issue with regard to CAFE \nstandards the Senate passed in its version but the House rejected.\n  I thank Senator Inouye and the other members of the Commerce \nCommittee for their work on a corporate average fuel economy, CAFE, \nstandard. As you know, the Senate-passed CAFE bill contained a low-\nvolume manufacturer exemption that would have classified low-volume \nmanufacturers as those that have a U.S. market share of less than 0.4 \npercent and that sell less than about 64,000 cars--at current sales \nrates. While current law allows large multiline manufacturers to \nachieve compliance through averaging across various makes and models--\noffsetting the performance vehicles with economy cars--it denies some \nsmall independent limited-line niche manufacturers the same \nopportunity. Small limited-line companies that manufacture only three \nmodels produce vehicles having superior fuel economy yet pay millions \nin CAFE noncompliance fines. Other automobile manufacturers avoid \npenalties through mergers and acquisitions and the ability to offset \nsports cars with economy cars.\n  The law on automotive fuel economy standards does not require each \npassenger automobile to meet the standard, but instead allows \nmanufacturers to meet the standard through a fleet average, permitting \nmanufacturers to produce vehicles with varying levels of fuel economy. \nThe law, 49 U.S.C. 32902, includes a provision allowing low-volume \nmanufacturers of passenger automobiles to petition for alternative fuel \neconomy standards. Should a petition be granted under section 32902(d), \nthe low-volume manufacturer is required to meet the maximum feasible \nfuel economy standard that the Secretary of Transportation finds that \nthe manufacturer can attain. In the case of a high-performance vehicle, \nthis requirement can lead to greater fuel economy savings than results \nif a similar vehicle is merely averaged into a larger fleet. At the \ntime the law was enacted, the threshold for petitioning for alternative \nstandards was set at annual worldwide production of 10,000 passenger \nautomobiles, which at that time made some 12 companies eligible.\n  Today the structure of the U.S. market for passenger automobiles is \nconsiderably different than it was in 1975. In particular, because of \nconsolidation in the automobile industry, only three independent \nmanufacturers designing for niche markets remain in the United States \nmarket. Most, but not all, niche manufacturers have been acquired by \nmajor manufacturers and so are able to avail themselves of both the \nvastly greater resources and flexibility of fleet averaging of those \nmajor manufacturers. Thus, the few remaining niche manufacturers are at \na distinct disadvantage in meeting fuel economy standards not only in \nan absolute sense, but compared to other manufacturers of comparable \nvehicles.\n  I believe Congress's original intent in enacting the CAFE standards \nwas not to competitively disadvantage small independent manufacturers. \nHowever, the fundamental change in the structure of the passenger \nvehicle marketplace has in fact disadvantaged the remaining low-volume \nmanufacturers without furthering the CAFE goal of increasing fuel \neconomy. I believe that changes in the marketplace have altered what \nshould constitute a low-volume manufacturer, raising serious questions \nabout the reasonableness of the 10,000 threshold for eligibility for \nalternative fuel economy standards. At the same time, I recognize that \nthe threshold must not be so high as to competitively disadvantage \nmajor manufacturers.\n  In order to preserve the original intent of section 32902 to afford \nrelief to low-volume manufacturers, Senator Chambliss and I proposed \nand the Senate accepted a provision to set a new threshold for \neligibility for alternative fuel economy standards for passenger \nautomobiles by setting the threshold as a percentage of the worldwide \nmarket rather than an absolute number. This allows for a threshold that \nwill adapt to changes in the marketplace, unlike the current threshold. \nThis is the same as the language proposed by Senator Smith in 2002 and \nincluded in the Kerry-McCain amendment to the then-pending CAFE bill.\n  The provision the Senate passed set the threshold for eligibility as \na low-volume manufacturer above the current 10,000 but equivalent to \nless than \\1/2\\ percent of the world-wide market.\n  It is my understanding that although the Senate voted on and passed \nthis provision, the House asked that it be removed because they were \nconcerned that a manufacturer who is covered by this new provision \nwould no longer pay fines as a result of it. It is my understanding \nthat under the terms of section 813 as drafted, the Secretary of \nTransportation--through NHTSA, we presume--conducts an investigation \ninto the capabilities of any petitioner for consideration under this \nprovision and decides whether or not to authorize an alternative \nstandard that differs from the established CAFE standard, and if so, by \nhow much. In the case of any manufacturer who petitions for an \nalternative standard, NHTSA may decide not to authorize a different \nstandard or they could set an alternative standard that could still be \nunachievable in that model year. In either scenario above, a company \nwould pay penalties for noncompliance and would not be relieved from \npaying penalties by anything in section 813. Obviously the hope would \nbe that NHTSA would set a standard that could be achieved based on our \nmaximum feasible technological capabilities.\n  I also understand the provision was removed because the House was \nconcerned that the alternative standard for low-volume manufacturers is \nan exemption from meeting CAFE standards. Again, it is my understanding \nthat section 813 is not an exemption because the provision is drafted \nso that it mirrors current law procedurally in that it authorizes the \nSecretary of Transportation--again, through NHTSA--to prescribe an \nalternative fuel economy standard if there is a finding that the \npetitioning manufacturer's ability to meet the standard prescribed by \nlaw is not achievable. Again, there is no provision that allows NHTSA \nto ``exempt'' a manufacturer. As we read it, the alternative standard \nmust be achieved by the manufacturer in order to achieve compliance and \nnot pay a penalty even if the standard exceeds that which the \nmanufacturer claims it can meet. So in short, there is no exemption \nfrom CAFE and the standard established by NHTSA could still result in \npenalties for noncompliance.\n  It is also my understanding that the House is not on record as having \nvoted on this provision, and that the House has not passed a CAFE \nstandard this Congress.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Energy bill \nthat passed with my support. The bill requires that 36 billion gallons \nof biofuels be blended with gasoline by 2022, and it establishes new \nappliance and lighting efficiency standards in government buildings. \nThe bill also includes Federal grants and loan guarantees to promote \nresearch into fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids, advanced \ndiesel and battery technologies.\n  The Energy bill also improves CAFE standards, requiring cars and \nlight\n\n[[Page S15427]]\n\ntrucks to achieve an average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. Increasing \nCAFE standards is a critical step that must be taken to reduce \npollution and curb greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. \nHigher CAFE standards will also benefit our families and our \ncommunities by reducing the burden of high gas prices freeing up more \ndiscretionary income for working families to spend on necessities such \nas food, health care, and housing.\n  I was pleased that the final bill included an amendment I offered \nthat would allow small manufacturers to access awards under the \nadvanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive title. Considering \nthat small manufacturers that employ roughly 75 employees or less \ncontribute 29.5 percent to all value added to automobiles, it made \nsense that they should have the opportunity to get these awards.\n  Taken together, this bill allows the United States to become more \nenergy efficient in a cost effective and responsible way.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for Senate passage of the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007. I voted earlier to invoke \ncloture and to move forward with the bill after receiving assurances \nthat my understanding of congressional intent relative to the fuel \neconomy provisions is correct. I anticipate that the bill will now be \naccepted by the House of Representatives.\n  I regret that it was necessary to drop the energy tax provisions. I \nbelieve it is particularly unfortunate that the energy tax provisions \nwere dropped since many of these are important to continued development \nof biofuels and to development and commercialization of many advanced \nand renewable technologies. Included in these provisions were tax \nincentives for plug-in hybrids which offer potential for significant \nreduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. I hope that \nwe will have another chance to enact these very important provisions.\n  With regard to the renewable electricity mandate, I regret that we \nwere unable to come up with a formula for a renewable electricity \nmandate that could have garnered widespread support. I believe that a \nrenewable electricity mandate is important to provide incentives for \ndevelopment of renewable resources, which could lead to the creation of \nnumerous high-skill jobs and increase our country's energy security and \nindependence. However, I also believe that a renewable energy mandate \nmust be done in a way that does not have economically detrimental \neffects.\n  I also regret that this bill does not include more positive \nincentives for development of advanced vehicle technologies. There are \na number of very important provisions included in the bill--including \nauthorizations for grants, direct loans, and loan guarantees for \nadvanced vehicle technologies and for advanced batteries and battery \nsystems--that will be very helpful but I regret that the bill does not \ninclude tax incentives for retooling of manufacturing facilities to \nproduce alternative technology vehicles and components. that would have \nprovided an immediate economic benefit to the auto manufacturers and \nsuppliers who will bear the burden of meeting the regulatory \nrequirements of this legislation.\n  The fuel economy provisions of H.R. 6 as passed by the House are a \nsignificant improvement over what the Senate passed in June 2007 and \nthat I opposed vigorously. The bill the Senate passed in June would \nhave had a detrimental effect on both U.S. manufacturing and U.S. \nworkers by requiring a combined car-truck standard and by not providing \nadequate flexibility for meeting the standards.\n  During the course of deliberations between the Senate and House, some \nconcessions were obtained on some of the most important issues, \nincluding requiring separate car and truck standards, preserving \ndomestic jobs with an antibacksliding provision, and extending existing \nfuel credits until 2014 to provide flexibility to our domestic \nmanufacturers to make it more practically possible for them to reach \nthe ambitious level of 35 mpg by 2020. Of great significance, the House \nof Representatives was able to maintain a key reform that we were able \nto obtain during Senate consideration of the bill to set fuel economy \nstandards based upon vehicle attributes. By setting standards based on \nvehicle attributes, such as size or weight, rather than having a fleet-\nwide average for each company, we will end the many years of \ndiscriminatory impacts on domestic manufacturers imposed by the \nexisting CAFE system.\n  Because it is essential to manufacturers that they are able to plan \non the 35 mpg standard in 2020, it was important to remove any \nambiguity that could arise in the future if EPA issues new rules to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles pursuant to its \nauthority under the Clean Air Act. Earlier today, I entered into a \ncolloquy with Senator Inouye, chairman of the Commerce Committee, the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, and Senator Feinstein, the primary sponsor \nand author of the 35 mpg in 2020 legislation, confirming our mutual \nunderstanding and interpretation of what the Congress is doing in this \nlegislation and to make clear our mutual understanding that the \nstandard with which all Federal regulations need to be consistent is \nthe 35 m.p.g. in 2020 standard in this bill. The Supreme Court recently \nruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has authority under the \nClean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. It is \nextremely important that we make clear that it is congressional intent \nin this bill that any future regulations issued by the Environmental \nProtection Agency be consistent with the Department of Transportation's \nnew fuel economy regulations that will reach an industry fleet wide \nlevel by 35 mpg by 2020.\n  Logic dictates that we read the law this way--certainly Congress \nwould not knowingly enact new fuel economy standards that could be \nundercut in the future by other federal agencies adopting conflicting \nregulations. I was assured this morning by both Senator Inouye and \nSenator Feinstein that it is indeed the intent of the law they wrote \nthat EPA regulations be consistent with NHTSA. With that understanding, \nI am supporting this legislation today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to talk \nabout the cloture vote on the Energy bill today. I have worked very \nclosely with my good friend, Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, to restructure the energy tax provisions in a way \nthat reflects a more balanced energy policy. I have consistently \nopposed the energy tax package up to this point. I voted against the \nproposal in the Senate Finance Committee because I believed it did not \nreflect a balanced energy policy. Rather, it imposed new taxes on our \nNation's oil companies, while doing too little to address one of our \nNation's most pressing energy needs: our lack of domestic refining \ncapacity.\n  I also voted against cloture on the energy proposal on the Senate \nfloor in June before it was sent to conference, or what should have \nbeen a conference on the proposal. So many of us were not even afforded \nthe courtesy of basic Senate procedure, and that was appalling. Thus, \nwhen the bill came back from the House with a House amendment earlier \nthis month, I voted against cloture once again. It was my understanding \nthat when cloture failed, solid commitments had been made to ensure the \nminority would be included in the formulation of a bill that would \nreally address some of the very real energy problems we have in this \ncountry.\n  Based on this understanding and as a senior Republican on the Senate \nFinance Committee, I worked with my colleagues on the Finance Committee \nto improve the tax package. To the credit of Chairman Baucus and \nseveral members on both sides of the aisle, significant and important \nmodifications were made to the tax portion of the Energy bill.\n  The new tax provisions included in this bill take some important \nsteps toward balancing this bill in a way that will benefit U.S. \nconsumers. The new severance tax on offshore production in the Gulf of \nMexico had been dropped from the revised bill. This move alone restored \nmore than $10 billion toward the effort to increase our domestic \nproduction of oil, provision to extend for 3 years a tax incentive that \nI had originally sponsored to increase refining capacity. Senator \nBaucus also dropped a tax increase on natural gas lines, which restored \nover $500 million to our natural gas infrastructure. Finally, a\n\n[[Page S15428]]\n\nprovision that would provide incentives for the conversion of hybrid \nelectric vehicles to plug-in hybrid vehicles was included. This \nrestored an important aspect of my legislation known as the FREEDOM \nAct, or S. 1617.\n  To say this bill is perfect would be an enormous stretch. I believe \nthe tax package was improved, but it could still be a whole lot better. \nHowever, given the realities of Congress, I believed the more balanced \ntax bill was worthy of my support.\n  Also of great concern, this bill would apply new Davis Bacon \nrequirements to energy production activities. Expansion of Davis Bacon \nis poor public policy and absolutely terrible energy policy. Now that \ncloture has failed and it is apparent the Energy bill cannot proceed, I \nencourage my colleagues to remove these provisions prior to any \nadditional votes on an energy bill. I believe these provisions are one \nof the main reasons this bill is unable to secure enough support to \nproceed.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nmeasures contained in the Energy bill, H.R. 6, designed to spur the \ndesign and construction of high-performance green buildings. After \nreviewing the bill, I am pleased with the approach title IV takes to \ngreen buildings by retaining the balanced provisions from the earlier \nSenate and House versions of the bill.\n  I am also pleased that the provision from the House-passed bill that \nspecifically mentioned the Leadership in Energy and Environmental \nDesign, LEED, Rating System was amended. The LEED Rating System does \nnot recognize the energy and environmental benefits of wood building \nmaterials in its point structure. Wood products are among the most \n``green'' of all building materials.\n  The Energy bill lays out general criteria that allow green building \nrating systems in the marketplace to compete for the Government's \nbusiness. This is a sensible approach that will promote the concept of \ngreen building design without referencing one rating system over \nanother.\n  It is important that the General Services Administration and other \nagencies ensure that the balanced spirit of this legislation is \nembraced. There are at least two green building rating systems being \nused by Federal agencies and the private marketplace now, and the \ncompetition among these two systems has resulted in improvements in \nboth. The best approach is to permit the marketplace to decide which \nrating system is best suited for each project, and this legislation \nwill allow all of rating systems to compete for Government contracts.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today the Senate will approve landmark \ncomprehensive energy legislation that over the next decade will lessen \nour reliance on foreign energy sources and dramatically increase the \nuse of renewable fuels. Today's work is the culmination of a year-long \ndebate on how best to wean Americans from the unhealthy addiction on \nforeign energy sources and record-high gasoline prices. We are going to \naccomplish these twin goals by boosting the role of renewable, \nhomegrown fuel and through a long-term plan to make our cars and trucks \nuse gasoline more efficiently. These two laudable goals will cut fuel \nuse, spur investment into rural economies, decrease greenhouse gas \nemissions, and ultimately make energy more affordable for American \nfamilies.\n  This bipartisan bill builds on the success of the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005, which authorized the first nationwide renewable fuel standard, \nRFS. I am proud to have played a role in passage of that bill through \nmy work on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The \npositive results of that bill are clear: ethanol and biodiesel \nproduction is booming, far outstripping the goals in that bill. Today's \nlegislation builds on that success by realizing the tremendous growth \nin renewable fuels. We are going to dramatically increase the amount of \nrenewable fuels, such as biodiesel and ethanol blended into the \ngasoline supply. In 2008, the United States will have the capacity to \nproduce a minimum of 10 billion gallons of renewable fuels. The bill \nbefore the Senate today will ensure that we capture the promise of this \ntremendous growth by requiring the United States blend a minimum of 9 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuels in the gasoline supply. Furthermore, \nthis bill will ramp up the amount of ethanol and cellulosic ethanol \nproduced in this country so that by 2020 the United States will produce \na minimum of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels. That is enough fuel \nto displace over 15 percent of the gasoline we use to power our trucks \nand cars.\n  South Dakota is prepared to do its part in meeting this ambitious \ngoal. The 13 ethanol plants in South Dakota will produce 1 billion \ngallons of ethanol in 2008 by turning 250 million bushels of corn into \nthe clean-burning fuel. The renewable fuels industry contributes \napproximately $2 billion in total economic benefits annually to my \nState while employing hundreds in all parts of South Dakota. South \nDakota will now become an energy producer providing the energy and food \na growing economy and prosperous nation requires.\n  Working together and placing partisan differences aside, the Congress \nis moving our country forward. We are going to produce more fuel from \nrenewable resources and over the long-term decrease the amount of \nfossil fuels we need to import from unstable regions of the globe. This \nis a great bill for South Dakota and for our country, and I am glad \nthat we will take this step together today.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it hasn't been easy, but the Senate is \nfinally poised to pass H.R. 6, the Renewable Fuels, Consumer \nProtection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007. This bill contains \nimportant provisions to reduce our reliance on imported oil, bolster \nour national security, reduce greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions, and \nprotect the environment.\n  The most important provision in this bill requires an increase in the \naverage fleet fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks from 25 \nmiles per gallon to 35 by 2020. This 40 percent increase is overdue, \nbut most welcome. Maryland drivers will save an estimated $414 million \nat the gas pump annually by 2020 because of the increased fuel economy \nstandards. The average family with two cars will save up to $1,000 a \nyear. By 2020, the new fuel economy standards are expected to save 1.1 \nmillion barrels of oil per day. The standards will remove 192 million \nmetric tons of global warming pollution annually by 2020. That is the \nequivalent of taking approximately 28 million cars off the road.\n  H.R. 6 raises the annual requirement for the amount of renewable \nfuels used in cars and trucks to 36 billion gallons by 2022. H.R. 6 \nmakes a historic commitment to develop cellulosic ethanol by requiring \nthat the United States produce 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels, \nlike cellulosic ethanol. Homegrown renewable fuels will replace the \nequivalent of all the oil we import from the Middle East today.\n  H.R. 6 establishes strong national efficiency standards for \nlightbulbs. Lightbulbs will be 30 percent more efficient by 2012 to \n2014. The near-term savings from the standard are estimated to be $6 \nbillion a year. The first part of the new standard will reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions by about 13 million metric tons, which is equivalent \nto approximately 24 new 500-megawatt coal plants. The second set of \nstandards, effective in 2020, could at least double the initial savings \nof 65 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.\n  H.R. 6 contains provisions reported by the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, EPW, calling for a 30 percent reduction \nin energy consumption by 2015 in Federal buildings. That reduction \nwould save approximately 60 trillion British thermal units, Btus, of \nenergy, 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, and almost $4 billion \nin taxpayers' money. I worked hard with my colleagues on the EPW \nCommittee to ensure that the strongest possible ``green buildings'' \nprovisions would be included in H.R. 6. These provisions include my \namendment that will put the Federal Government in the forefront of \nstorm water management in the Nation. Virtually all Federal building \nprojects will be required to use site planning, design, and \nconstruction techniques that will minimize storm water runoff. These \nstorm water minimization methods are often inexpensive and highly \neffective. In many parts of the country, polluted storm water runoff is \nthe leading cause of water quality problems.\n  So, Mr. President, H.R. 6 is a strong bill. But it is hard not to \nregret what\n\n[[Page S15429]]\n\nhas been negotiated out of the bill. Most important was the provision \nto require a renewable electricity mandate. I also regret the repeal of \nill-advised tax breaks for oil companies that would have paid for tax \nincentives for renewables, including solar energy. The difficulty \nCongress and the administration have had reaching an agreement on this \nbill underscores the need for an amendment I successfully offered to \nestablish an independent, bipartisan commission to monitor our Nation's \nprogress in becoming energy independent and make consensus \nrecommendations on how to achieve that independence. I am disappointed \nthat my amendment did not survive conference committee deliberations.\n  H.R. 6 could have been a better bill if we had the votes, but it is a \ngood bill. I consider it a solid ``downpayment'' on what we need to do \nas a Nation to make energy affordable and reliable, use it efficiently, \ncut GHG emissions, and protect the environment and enhance our \ncompetitiveness and national security.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is considering one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation that I have worked on in my legislative \ncareer--the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.\n  I thank all the Senators who helped to craft this important bill.\n  This energy legislation will move America in a new direction--it will \nmake us more independent as a Nation, strengthen our economy and \nprotect our environment.\n  I am proud to support this legislation which will take meaningful \nsteps to use our energy resources more wisely.\n  Without this legislation we will fail to protect our country, and our \nchildren, from the growing threats of global warming, which is a clear \nand present danger to the national security and the economy of the \nUnited States.\n  The bill we are considering today begins to reduce our dependence on \nfossil fuels and to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  For many years I have advocated for an increase in CAFE standards and \nhave offered amendments to previous energy bills to achieve this \nimportant goal. I am pleased that for the first time in over 2 decades \nwe will be voting on legislation that raises the fuel economy of our \ncars and trucks. After 22 years of allowing vehicles to average 27.5 \nmiles per gallon, cars and trucks will need to average 35 miles per \ngallon by 2020.\n  The provision we are considering today is historic in another way, \nbecause both the auto industry and the auto workers union, as well as \nthe environmental community, have endorsed this key provision in the \nbill and understand the importance of making and driving more fuel \nefficient vehicles here in the U.S.\n  This increase in the CAFE standards will save 18 billion gallons of \ngasoline per year in 2020, and it will help us reduce the greenhouse \ngases that cause global warming. New CAFE standards will help us avoid \n206 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually.\n  This is the equivalent of removing 30 million cars from the road in \nthe year 2020.\n  This legislation will significantly lower our oil consumption and \nwill decrease our dependence on foreign oil. This is one of the most \neffective ways we can reduce national gasoline consumption, extend our \noil supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  To help reduce our dependence on imported oil, and on oil \nconsumption, this bill strengthens the renewable fuels standard. It \nsets clear benchmarks for higher levels of production of biofuels made \nfrom corn as well as other feedstocks, including soybean oil, \nswitchgrass, and other sources of energy that will be developed in the \nfuture.\n  With this bill, we will shift some of our energy reliance from the \noilfields of the Middle East to the corn fields of the Midwest.\n  The bill will ratchet up the schedule for the use of renewable fuels \nin our cars and trucks from the level of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012, \nas passed in the 2005 Energy Bill, to 15 billion gallons by 2015 and 36 \nbillion gallons by 2022.\n  That represents a major advance in our commitment to renewable, home \ngrown fuels that reduce emissions, mitigate global warming, and improve \nfarmer income.\n  This is a strong market signal to ethanol, biodiesel, and other \nrenewable energy investors that the Federal Government supports fuels \nthat are more environmentally friendly and help to reduce our \ndependence on oil.\n  Unfortunately, the package we are considering today does not include \na renewable electricity standard--RES.\n  It does, however, include tax incentives to support the development \nof renewable energy. It is my hope that in future energy legislation, \nwe will be able to pass an RES to ensure that electric utility \ncompanies to use more wind, biomass, geothermal and solar to generate \nelectricity.\n  Another important component of this bill are new standards for energy \nefficiency.\n  The bill will dramatically reduce energy consumption in Federal \nbuildings and improve energy efficiency in appliances. Improving \nefficiency is the best way to use less energy and reduce emissions. And \nAmericans will save billions of dollars on energy bills.\n  Reducing energy use by the Federal Government is not only good for \nthe environment; it is good for the bottom line--our budget.\n  I am pleased to support this important and long over-due bill. This \nbill makes a substantial down payment on our commitment to slow global \nwarming. We will begin to reduce oil consumption and energy use and \npromote research and development and help to promote America's creative \nideas.\n  We want innovation to be the driver of our economy, not oil. We want \nmore American jobs, a stronger economy and a cleaner environment.\n  We want a more secure future for America.\n  The bill that we are considering will go a long way toward achieving \nthis goal.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unequivocal \nsupport for landmark energy legislation before us today that will \nrevive our long dormant energy policy. I want to especially recognize \nSenator Feinstein for her resolve in including momentous, benchmark \nCAFE standards for the first time in three decades--without her \ntenacity this critical component would not be included in this \nlegislation. Furthermore, I want to thank Senators Inouye, Stevens, \nBingaman, and Domenici for crafting this historic legislation. And it \nhas been a pleasure to work with Senator Feinstein for the past 7 years \ntoward this goal and authoring with her the CAFE measure that was the \nbasis for the provision included in this bill, and that is central to \nour environmental well-being.\n  As record energy costs continue to saddle Americans and hamper the \ngrowth of our economy, this legislation is, quite frankly, long \noverdue. Since the Senate passed the Renewable Fuels, Consumer \nProtection and Energy Efficiency Act in June, our failed energy policy \nhas proliferated into a crisis. Currently, in my home State of Maine, \ntrucks remain idle because the prohibitive cost of diesel--an \nastonishing 43 percent higher than last year--has made trucking simply \nunprofitable and untenable for many. And as I speak, residents in \nWashington County in Maine as well as other areas around the State--are \ncontemplating whether to purchase food, medicine or heat.\n  The reality is, our energy policy has ambled aimlessly for decades--\nand Mainers and Americans are quite literally paying the price. As a \nresult, this timely energy legislation could not be more critical as it \nrepresents the initial step toward the boldness of leadership on this \nissue that the American people desire and require. Indeed, the bill \nbefore the Senate represents a departure--finally--from the regressive \npolicies of the 20th century to a sustained long-term energy policy \nthat both challenges and harnesses the U.S. preeminent attribute of \ninnovation.\n  And this change comes not a moment too soon. The fact is, while each \nof us understands the unacceptable cost of gasoline, heating oil, and \nelectricity for our constituents, we must also be cognizant that our \nenergy policy has been a boon to America's adversaries. As Thomas \nFriedman recently remarked, petro-authoritarianism is sweeping the \nglobe. In 2005, Iran earned $44.6 billion from crude oil exports when \noil was $50 a barrel--now it is $90. The reality is, our current energy \npolicy directly shifts America's hard-\n\n[[Page S15430]]\n\nearned money to the least democratic countries and most dangerous in \nthe world including Venezuela and indirectly to Iran.\n  Although this is, in itself, an undeniable reason to change our \nenergy policy, our failed approaches of the past are also manifested in \nthe challenge of global climate change. The release of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change completed in mid-November \nconcluded that climate change is ``unequivocal'' and accelerating. \nIndeed this summer, the Arctic Ocean exposed 1 million square miles of \nopen water, the most that has been determined since measurements have \nbeen taken. Quite frankly, it is beyond dispute that the United States \nmust take immediate action to reduce carbon emissions and stem climate \nchange.\n  That is why this timely legislation is absolutely essential to our \nNation's security and our environment--as well as our pocketbooks and \nwallets. Indeed this body is on the brink of forging an energy policy \nthat would provide dividends to the American consumer, enhance American \nsecurity, and reestablish American leadership on environmental issues \nby confronting climate change. The question now is, Will we?\n  We can't afford to wait and, on that note, I particularly want to \nhighlight the inclusion of the CAFE provisions that will finally place \nthis country on track to substantially improve our Nation's automobile \nfleet from 25.2 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. \nBecause this provision that Senator Feinstein and I authored is the \nmost significant step our Nation can take to address our long-term \nenergy crisis.\n  As the New York Times stated on November 14th, ``The single most \neffective way to address the problem of oil imports and consumption is \nto improve the efficiency of cars and light trucks, which use more than \ntwo-thirds of all the oil burned in the United States.'' This \nlegislation will save Americans 1.1 million barrels of oil per day--\nnearly the same amount imported from Saudi Arabia. And at a time when \nthousands of families are struggling to provide the basic necessity of \nheat in their homes, indisputably we must not squander oil through \ninefficiency.\n  There is no question this is a measure whose time has long since \ncome, given the last time Congress comprehensively adjusted CAFE \nstandards was over 30 years ago, in 1975, when the price of gasoline \nwas 60 cents per gallon. Yet all we have done in 32 years is raise CAFE \nby a measly 5 miles per gallon for light trucks and not at all for \npassenger vehicles. It is like the program that time forgot. That is \nwhy this provision is essential for any comprehensive energy \nlegislation.\n  The legislation significantly before us achieves the goal of 35 miles \nper gallon by 2020 through an attribute-based system, incorporating the \n2001 National Academy of Science's recommendation that ``Consideration \nshould be given to designing and evaluating an approach with fuel \neconomy targets that are dependent on vehicle attributes such as \nvehicle weight.'' Why is this important? Because this concept maintains \na critical component of America's automobile fleet, and that is \nconsumer choice.\n  This is the innovative approach that Senator Feinstein and I \ndeveloped that focuses not on defacto mandates on what type of vehicles \nare built and sold but rather on the end result of overall fuel \nsavings. And I am particularly pleased that the auto companies have \nrecognized the merits in this proposal and support this initiative. \nThis represents a sea change from the previous divisiveness of this \ncentral issue, and I want to applaud my colleagues who worked with \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Inouye, and I to craft this historic \nbreakthrough that represents a new automotive era, ensuring that we \nwill not return to the wasteful gas-guzzling days of the past.\n  Furthermore, this legislation provides critical tax incentives for \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy, to wean ourselves off the \nexpensive foreign petroleum that, as I have said, also serves to line \nthe pockets of some of the world's most dangerous tyrants. This \ncountry, quite frankly, has abrogated its commitment to a substantial \ninvestment in altering our energy policy--a problem encapsulated in a \nspecial report in the Economist, which stated that, regrettably \n``America's incentives for clean energy'' are ``relatively modest \ncompared to Europe's.'' Furthermore, the article illustrates that, \n``what one politician can mandate, another can terminate--and therein \nlies one of the biggest risks for clean energy. American politicians \nhave periodically allowed a tax break for wind generation to expire, \nfor example. This caused the industry to falter several times, before \nthe credit was renewed again.''\n  Accordingly, I am extremely disappointed that this legislation fails \nto extend the vital renewable production tax credit. If we truly want \nto alter our Nation's energy policy we must make substantial \ninvestments and it confounds me why we elected not to make that a \nnational priority.\n  In addition, I want to voice my strong opposition to the inexplicable \nremoval of the renewable portfolio standard to create a market for \nsustainable resources. The State of Maine has demonstrated that this \nprovision stimulates the development of hydropower, wind, solar, tidal, \nand biomass energy with more than 30 percent of our energy flowing from \nthese sources. Enactment of this strong RPS would have promoted fuel \ndiversity and reduced our substantial dependence of natural gas. This \nreliance on natural gas was unfortunately illustrated in Maine last \nweek when a Canadian supply disruption of imported natural gas forced \nto shut down two natural gas plants. Frankly, we must promote energy \ndiversity to ensure energy reliance--and this strong Renewable \nPortfolio Standard that his legislation fails to include would have \nensured that Americans would have received 15 percent of their \nelectricity from renewable energy resources and ensured a basic level \nof diversity while promoting clean energy. I urge my colleagues to \naddress this central issue in the future.\n  On the more positive side, I am pleased to have worked closely with \nSenator Kerry, Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and \nalso House Small Business Committee Chair Velazquez and Ranking Member \nChabot, to fashion a bipartisan small business title to this Energy \nBill. This title includes virtually all of the provisions in the \n``Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007'' (S. 1657), which \nSenator Kerry and I introduced in June.\n  This year, the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, of which I am the ranking member, has paid particular \nattention to the effects of climate change and escalating fuel costs on \nsmall businesses, and the role America's entrepreneurs can play in \naffecting change in these areas. Chairman Kerry and I have already \ndevoted two hearings during the 110th Congress to these subjects as \nclearly rising gas prices and global warming are having a devastating \naffect on the health of small business in this country.\n  As we all recognize, small business is the backbone of our Nation's \neconomy. As the leading Republican on the Small Business Committee and \nas a longstanding steward of the environment, I firmly believe \nthat small business has a pivotal role to play in finding a solution to \nglobal climate change. According to a recent survey conducted by the \nNational Small Business Association, 75 percent of small businesses \nbelieve that energy efficiency can make a significant contribution to \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. And yet, only 33 percent of those \nhad successfully invested in energy efficiency programs for their \nbusinesses.\n\n  We must significantly improve energy efficiency investment by small \nbusinesses. To that end, the small business title in the Energy bill \nwill make the SBA's Express Loan Program available to small businesses \nthat wish to purchase renewable energy systems or make energy \nefficiency improvements to their businesses. I firmly believe that the \nSBA Express Loan will be an attractive option to small business owners \nlooking to make their businesses more energy efficient and \nenvironmentally sound because of the program's quick turnaround time \nand the ability of participating lenders to use their own forms and \nprocedures for fast approval.\n  Another key provision would encourage small business innovation in \nenergy efficiency, by creating a priority under the Small Business \nInnovation\n\n[[Page S15431]]\n\nResearch, SBIR, program for solicitations by small businesses that \nparticipate in or conduct energy efficiency or renewable energy system \nresearch and development.\n  The small business title would also create a pilot, competitive grant \nprogram that would be administered through the national network of \nSmall Business Development Centers, which would provide ``energy \naudits'' to small businesses to enhance their energy efficiency \npractices, as well as offer access to information and resources on \nenergy efficiency practices.\n  Finally, the small business title will ensure that the SBA completes \nits requirements under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Within 6 months \nof enactment, the SBA, through a final rulemaking, would be mandated to \ncomplete all of its requirements under the Energy Policy Act, including \nsetting up a ``Small Business Energy Clearinghouse'' that builds on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program to assist small \nbusiness in becoming more energy efficient. Frankly, I am alarmed by \nthe lack of progress that SBA has made on these requirements, which \nPresident Bush signed into law nearly 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Unfortunately, \nthis may be one more example of the administration's unwillingness to \nlead on actions to address global warming. By contrast, the small \nbusiness title will help to ensure that the SBA finally completes its \nrequirements under the Energy Policy Act and actually play a leading \nrole in combating global climate change.\n  It is my hope that the small business title in the Energy bill will \nspur more small firms to make a smaller carbon ``footprint'' and play a \nleading role in the actions that are essential in combating global \nwarming. Assisting small firms in this regard will not only help the \nenvironment but will also significantly lower the energy costs for \ncash-strapped small businesses.\n  Given our Nation's energy crisis, we must pursue every opportunity to \npursue energy savings, and I therefore must express my strong \ndisappointment that the issue of truck weights was not considered in \nthis legislation. This is a timely issue that has unnecessarily placed \nthe Maine trucking industry and the safety of our residents in \njeopardy.\n  The issue, quite frankly, defies even the most elementary logic. \nCurrently, arbitrary rules create two distinct truck weight limits that \ncapriciously bisect the State at Augusta. Specifically, from the New \nHampshire/Maine border to Augusta trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds \nare allowed to travel on Interstate 95. However, beyond this point all \nthe way from Augusta to Houlton--a distance of 200 miles--the \nregulation recedes to 80,000 pounds.\n  As a result, north of Augusta, heavy trucks are forced onto smaller, \nsecondary roads that pass through our cities, towns, and villages and \nthey fail to use the Federal highway system. This mosaic of Federal \nregulations unnecessarily costs our Nation energy by requiring \nadditional truck trips to meet the needless 80,000 limitation. Truckers \nmust make additional trips for the transportation of fish, lumber, \nblueberries, and potatoes, which increases the costs of these goods and \nregrettably has become a major safety issue on the secondary roads of \nMaine with these massive trucks speeding through Maine's communities. \nWith diesel prices upwards of $3.70, the problem has burgeoned into a \nfull crisis and this Federal medley of regulations must end and I urge \nmy colleagues to support me in creating a uniform 100,000-limit \nrestriction on Maine's Federal highways.\n  Overall, I am pleased that this legislation is reflective of the \nbroad ramifications of our energy plan and provides the beginning of a \ncommensurate response to our energy crisis. The manifestations of our \ncurrent strategy are discernible in some of the greatest issues facing \nAmerica. The critical issues of climate change, the trade imbalance, \nand a restricted foreign diplomacy in the Middle East are all directly \nrelated to our failed energy strategy. We are realizing, with \nincreasing clarity, the consequences of an oil-based energy policy.\n  Now, with this Energy bill before us, this is a critical initial step \nbut is only the first. A glaring absence in this bill is the preeminent \nissue of climate change. It is incumbent on this Congress to build \nmomentum from the recent G8 meeting and pass legislation that \nreestablishes American leadership on this critical environmental issue. \nCurrently, the entire world is meeting in Bali, Indonesia, waiting for \nan answer from America. The Environment and Public Work's Committee \npassage of the first comprehensive climate change legislation, coupled \nwith the action today, resoundingly declares that American leadership \nis hopefully on its way. As I have worked with Senators McCain and \nLieberman for 4 years on the Climate Stewardship Act, as well as \nSenator Kerry on Global Warming Reduction Act, I remain absolutely \ncommitted to passing climate change legislation. The legislation before \nthe Senate does not replace the need for comprehensive climate \nlegislation, and I look forward to bringing this fundamental energy and \nenvironmental issue to the floor of the Senate when we return after the \nNew Year.\n  Again, this bill represents critical progress toward a comprehensive \nenergy policy. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nadditional components to finally achieve American energy independence.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe we are out of time except for \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3 minutes 54 seconds, not \nincluding the leader; and the majority has 1 minute 17 seconds, not \nincluding the leader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no other Senators who want to be heard on my \nside.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time, reserving the full leader's \ntime at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I particularly want to say how pleased \nI am Senator Domenici is still on the Senate floor. This is an \nextraordinary accomplishment for him. I congratulate him on his \npersistence and tenacity. Senator Stevens has been deeply involved in \nthis issue from the very beginning and has done an extraordinary job, \nand I want to congratulate both of these outstanding Senators for what \nis going to be an accomplishment that all of us can be proud of. I also \ncommend Senator Inouye and Senator Bingaman for their hard work as \nwell. The final product is not perfect, but it is vastly better than \nthe version that was sent to us by the House of Representatives.\n  We recognized in the Senate that the House bill couldn't pass the \nSenate and wouldn't be signed into law, so we fixed it, and now it \nwill. The new fuel economy standards and the increase in renewable \nfuels represent a step forward in our common effort to make America \nmore energy independent. This is something we can all be proud of as we \nleave to go home for the holiday recess.\n  This is a good accomplishment. It was achieved--as every good thing \nin the Senate always is--by cooperation between the parties. What we \nhave done on this bill we have done together. In a year that has seen \nits fair share of partisan tensions, that is no small accomplishment \neither.\n  So, again, I congratulate the managers of the bill. I also thank my \ngood friend, the majority leader, for bringing it back to the floor in \na form that guarantees not only that it will pass the Senate but that \nit will be signed into law.\n  I am extremely pleased about this bipartisan accomplishment. I am \nextremely happy that we are about to show the American people we still \nhave it in us to come together as a body and to achieve consensus on an \nissue that affects all of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a note of information for all of the \nSenators: We are trying to work out something on the farm bill to \ncomplete it, and we are going to complete it this week. Right now, we \nhave one obstacle, and it is an amendment dealing with firefighters. \nThere is bipartisan support for it. I have told those people who like \nit and don't like it that we can do a number of things. We can have a \nvoice vote on it; we can have side-by-sides. If the opponents of the \nlegislation want a couple of second-degree amendments that relate to \nthat, they can have that. If\n\n[[Page S15432]]\n\nthat doesn't work, I have no alternative but to file cloture on that \namendment. If I do that tonight, there will be a cloture vote on \nSaturday. I don't want a cloture vote on Saturday--no one does--but we \nhave no alternative. We have to finish what we have to do here.\n  Now, if I file cloture on it, maybe they would agree to allow us to \nhave the cloture vote tomorrow.\n  We have some other things we need to do. Everyone should be alerted. \nWith the permission of the--well, I don't need to say the \n``permission.'' Whenever we finish the firefighters amendment sometime \ntomorrow, cloture will be sought on the bill. We still have Republican \nand Democratic amendments out there floating around. Some people don't \ncome and offer them; some people won't debate their amendments. Once \nthe firefighter issue is out of the way, we are going to see if we can \ninvoke cloture on the bill.\n  I think there is general consensus that, as with immigration, we have \nhad enough of farm legislation this year. We have all been very \npatient. It has been a very distressing issue on occasion. We have done \na lot of finger-pointing. It is time now that we pass the farm bill. So \nthe issue relating to firefighting is on the bill. It was one of the \nRepublicans' amendments, and now it is a Democratic amendment.\n  That is where we are. That has nothing to do with some real good \nnews. I just wanted to alert everyone as to what we are doing.\n  Mr. President, we had a little going away party sponsored by the \nRepublican leader and me yesterday in the Mansfield Room. It was a \nwonderful occasion. It was the farewell to Senator Trent Lott. I said \nsomething there that I am saying again here today. Edmund Burke, the \nfamous Irish statesman and philosopher, said:\n\n       All government, every virtue and every prudent act, is \n     founded on compromise.\n\n  Listen to what this brilliant man said:\n\n       All government, every virtue and every prudent act, is \n     founded on compromise.\n\n  ``Compromise'' is not a dirty word. Consensus building is what we \nhave to do. It can be frustrating. It can be exasperating. It can be \nmaddening. But at the end of the day, compromise leads to progress. \nThat is what we have today. Progress. The last time America raised fuel \neconomy standards was 30 years ago. We didn't have airbags, the \nInternet was a science fiction fantasy, and the closest thing to GPS \nwas a map. You went to a service station and they gave it to you. Today \nwe have hybrid cars, hydrogen cars, ethanol cars, fully electric cars.\n  Now, after 30 years, we are going to pass a new fuel economy \nstandard. This is not only important, it is historic. This is a good \nenergy bill. There are so many heroes. One just walked past me: Dianne \nFeinstein. There is lots of credit to go around. It will save consumers \nmoney. It will begin to reverse our addiction to oil. It will take a \nsmall first step in our fight to turn the tide of global warming. Could \nthis bill have been better? Of course it could have been better. \nAbsolutely. But we are not going to talk today about what could have \nbeen in it to make it better. We have been through that. What we want \nto talk about today is this bill will be a win for the American people.\n\n  It may be a split decision, as we have in boxing matches, but if you \nhave a split decision in a boxing match, there are still winners, and \nwe have winners in this matter today. Who are the winners? Not me, not \nthe Republican leader, none of the 98 other Senators are winners. It is \na partnership. We have worked together. All Senators and all House \nMembers are going to be able to walk out and hold their chests out, \nhold their heads high, and say: We passed an energy bill. Not only does \nCongress get credit for this, the White House gets credit for it. It \nsets new fuel economy standards for the first time in 30 years: 36 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuel will replace oil by 2022. It creates \nnew energy efficiency standards, everything from light bulbs, to \nrefrigerators, to the construction of new buildings. Because of the \nEnergy bill we will pass in just a few minutes, Americans will save \nmoney every day.\n  I say to the Senate, to the House of Representatives, to the \nPresident of the United States: Congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15432-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2008\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a \ncouple of minutes on the subject of the bill that passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, many years ago, exactly 6, Senator \nSnowe and I began this effort. Prior to that time--and I give credit to \nSenators Dick Bryan and Slade Gorton, who began this effort back in \n1993 with me. We tried to do a sense of the Senate. We didn't succeed. \nThen Senator Snowe and I did the SUV loophole closer, and we didn't \nsucceed. Then suddenly the times changed and we had introduced this \nbill in committee. Both the chairman, Senator Inouye, the ranking \nmember, Senator Stevens, and the Commerce Committee allowed us to come \nbefore them and ply our troth of this bill. And we did. The Commerce \nCommittee unanimously passed out the bill. That was in itself a stellar \nmoment.\n  Then there was the House and there was the negotiation with \nRepresentative Dingell and others. A bill finally\n\n[[Page S15433]]\n\nemerged--a lot of trial, a lot of tribulation. But I owe a great deal \nto Senator Snowe. I want her to know that. I thank her for her \nsolidarity, for her intelligence, for working with me over these past 6 \nyears. It has been a wonderful bipartisan relationship and one I will \ntreasure.\n  I also thank Senator Inouye as chairman of the committee and Senator \nStevens, Senators Cantwell, Kerry, Carper, Dorgan, and my pal and \nfriend, Senator Boxer.\n  We had some great staff from my office. I thank them: John Watts, \nMatt Nelson, my LD, Chris Thompson, who participated in much of the \nnegotiations. But I also give kudos to a member of Senator Inouye's \nCommerce Committee staff, and his name is David Strickland. David \nStrickland knows more about automobiles than most people all put \ntogether in this Chamber. There may be a few exceptions, but I have \nnever met anyone who knows more about the automobile. He conducted the \nnegotiations with the House and worked very late hours. I want him to \nknow how much his talent, his technical expertise is appreciated.\n  I see Senator Carper. I think I mentioned him. We had many \nconversations over the recess on the bill. I thank him for his support \nand for his commitment to this bill.\n  This is not an easy bill to do because we know we have automobile \nproducers in this country, and we know these companies have problems. \nYet we also know time is marching on and the need to move fuel \nefficiency, which has not happened for 32 years, is important if we are \ngoing to solve the problems of climate change. This is a first big \nstep.\n  Transportation is about a third of our greenhouse gas emissions. By \n2025, this bill will reduce these emission from automobiles by about 18 \npercent from projected levels. It is about, by 2020, a 40-percent \nincrease in mileage of automobiles. So it is important.\n  Oh, there is so much we do in this Chamber that is minutiae and often \nunrewarded. Once in a great while, you participate in the making of a \nbill which can change how things are done in the country. Once in a \nwhile, we all together can make a difference, and that happens when it \nis bipartisan. This bill was bipartisan. For that, I am very grateful.\n  So for all those who fought the good fight, who talked and walked the \nmarch, I say thank you. I think we have achieved something that is \nmajor, that is real, and that will greatly improve the situation. It \nmay not be perfect, but the perfect, as they say, should not be the \nenemy of the good.\n  I also pay tribute and thank Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow. I \nknow this is difficult, and I know how I would feel. I also believe the \ngreater good of the United States is served by this legislation and, \nafter all, that is all of our objectives.\n  I look forward to working with everyone in the future. It is a very \nhappy evening for me. I thank everyone very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They are in the back coming up with something in writing to \nproceed through these amendments.\n  Go ahead. Regular order, Mr. President, fine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3823\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. The Senator from \nIowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, amendment No. 3823 deals with \nagricultural competition and increased consolidation in the \nagricultural industry. The amendment is cosponsored by me, Senator \nGrassley, and two Democrats--Senator Kohl and Senator Harkin.\n  I wish to make it very clear--and I will get into some detail--there \nmay be some people who feel the amendment I have put before the Senate \nis exactly the same as a bill Senator Kohl and I had introduced \npreviously. It is very slimmed down from that bill. So any staff who is \nwatching the debate and getting nervous about an amendment coming up \nthat every big industry in the United States may find fault with, we \nare talking about a very slimmed-down version of it. I will explain all \nthat shortly.\n  I have been concerned with competition in the agricultural \nmarketplace and increased competition in the agricultural industry for \nquite some time now. You have heard me speak about it on the floor. We \nhave had hearings on it. I had hearings in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, as well as hearings I participated in under both Republican \nand Democratic chairmanships of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Agriculture, as you know, is a fairly risky business. I know that \nfrom personal experience because I have lived and worked on a farm all \nmy life. But for some time, working in agriculture has become even more \ndifficult for the little guy. The trend has been for companies in the \nagricultural sector to consolidate. I am talking about businesses that \nserve agriculture with input. I am talking about industry that \nprocesses agriculture. So there has been consolidation in that \nindustry. I am not talking about the consolidation of farms. There has \nbeen that as well. That has been going on since 1790, when 90 percent \nof the people in this country were farmers. Today, 2 percent of the \npeople in this country are farmers. I am talking about the impact of \nagriculture agribusiness consolidation and the impact upon the 2 \npercent of the people in this country who are farmers.\n  This consolidation has created new business giants impacting \ncompetition in the marketplace for the family farmers, for producers, \nand for consumers. Family farms and independent producers are feeling \nthe pressure of concentration in agriculture. Small and independent \nproducers are seeing fewer choices--who the farmer can buy from and to \nwhom the farmer can sell.\n  All this consolidation in industry at both the horizontal and \nvertical levels leads to the very real possibility of fewer product \nchoices and higher prices for consumers.\n  I don't believe all mergers are, per se, bad, and I don't believe all \nare wrong and all lead to unfairness. But I think at the same time we \nneed to make sure--we need to make very sure--open and fair access to \nthe marketplace is preserved for everyone. We need to make sure large \nbusinesses are not acting in a predatory or anticompetitive manner. We \nneed to make sure family farmers and independent producers can compete \non a level playing field. We need to make sure consumers have as many \nchoices as possible.\n  So I am not talking just about mergers and lack of competition being \nharmful just to farmers, I am talking about the impact that might have \non consumers paying more. The antitrust laws are all about protecting \nconsumers, not about protecting producers. But in the case of family \nfarmers, they are purchasers of input, and so they are consumers. But \nthey also have to make sure that the marketplace is protected for the \nultimate end-consumer, the consumer of our agricultural products.\n\n  By looking out for these things, you know what we end up doing, Mr. \nPresident? We keep our economy strong because of competition. We keep \nour agricultural community vibrant. We keep it competitive. And \nhopefully, in the end, we keep our consumers happy, with quality food \nat a relatively inexpensive price. American consumers don't know that, \nbut they already have that environment from our farmers. We take too \nmuch for granted in America, so I am not so sure consumers know that, \nand I like to remind them from time to time.\n\n[[Page S15434]]\n\n  So we have this amendment before us. It is an amendment cosponsored, \nas I said, by Senator Kohl and Senator Harkin. The language of this \namendment draws from a bill that Senator Kohl, Senator Thune, and I \nintroduced earlier this year--S. 1759. It is called the Agriculture \nCompetition Enhancement Act, ACE for short. We call it the ACE Act. \nHowever--and this is the point I started out with--I wish to make clear \nthat this amendment which is being offered to the farm bill is quite \ndifferent from the ACE Act as originally introduced earlier this year. \nAmendment No. 3823, which I have called up here under regular order, \ndoes not include all the provisions of S. 1759 and either eliminates \nprovisions in that bill or incorporates many changes to address \nconcerns raised by members of the agricultural industry, by the \nadministration, as well as Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  I also worked with the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee because this bill, S. 1759, was referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee. Because we are offering it as an amendment to this bill, I \nalso worked with the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee to \naddress issues that were in that original S. 1759, which I was hoping \nto offer here, to take care of some opposition to this bill coming up \nand yet still accomplishing quite a bit about the problems I see with \nlack of competition. So the amendment I have called up under regular \norder is the product of these discussions we had with business, with \nagricultural leaders, with the White House--or I should say with the \nadministration generally, not necessarily the White House--and, of \ncourse, with the Judiciary Committee members and the ranking member of \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n  Now, I want to explain what this bill does after having explained to \nyou, as I just did, that it is not what we had introduced as a bill.\n  First, the amendment would create an Agriculture Competition Task \nForce to study problems in agricultural competition, establish ways to \ncoordinate Federal and State activities to address competition problems \nin agriculture, and make recommendations to Congress. In particular, \nthe task force would establish a smaller working group on buyer power \nto study the effects of concentration, the effects of monopsony, and \nthe effects of oligopsony in agriculture, and make recommendations to \nthe Department of Justice and to the Federal Trade Commission on and \nfor agricultural guidelines. The task force will help give our \nantitrust regulators real insight and expertise specific to the farm \ncommunity that I believe is currently lacking when they address \ncompetition issues in agriculture.\n  Second, the amendment would require the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission to issue agricultural guidelines, taking into \naccount the special conditions of the agriculture industry, and require \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to report to \nCongress on the guidelines.\n  Both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Agriculture Committee \nheard witnesses in several hearings testify that there is a need for \nagriculture-specific guidelines when the Department of Justice and the \nFederal Trade Commission look at agriculture mergers.\n  Currently, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission \nhave guidelines for specific industries and issues, such as health care \nand intellectual property, but not for agriculture. So it makes sense--\nnot just to me but to these many experts in agriculture and antitrust \nlaw that we heard in these several hearings before our committees--that \nour Federal regulators should have agricultural guidelines because of \nthe special circumstances and special characteristics particular to the \nagriculture industry and particularly because there tends to be, in \nWashington, DC, outside of the Agriculture Department, little \nconsideration and understanding of the unique industry of agriculture. \nSome people would say that even within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture there is a lack of understanding in Washington, DC, of what \nthe problems of agriculture are all about.\n  I don't pretend that even with the adoption of this amendment we are \nnecessarily going to bring about the total understanding that there \nought to be for the 2 percent of the people in this country who produce \nfood for the other 98 percent, as well as a lot of surplus that is \nexported beyond. But whatever we can do to help, and particularly when \nthere are policy decisions made dealing with agriculture when it is not \nfully understood, if we can just get some attention on agriculture in \nthose areas, I think we will be taking a giant step forward.\n\n  Those characteristics I am talking about include monopsony, which is \na situation where there is a single purchaser of goods, and oligopsony, \nwhich is a situation where there are few buyers who, at the same time, \nhave a disproportionate amount of market power.\n  Third, the amendment would formalize the Department of Agriculture's \nreview of agriculture mergers with the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission, requiring the Department of Agriculture to \nprovide comments on larger mergers in the industry--mergers that \nsubmitted second requests for information under the Clayton Act. That \nis already a process that is in law.\n  Currently, the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission \ninformally consults with the Department of Agriculture when they \nanalyze ag mergers. These agencies have what we call a memorandum of \nunderstanding to consult with each other. But I believe, following on \nthe advice of experts who have testified on this matter before the \nAgriculture Committee, that the current process--meaning the current \nprocess of the memorandum of understanding--does not sufficiently \nensure that farm community concerns are adequately considered.\n  Far more than the Justice Department and far more than the Federal \nTrade Commission, the Department of Agriculture has extraordinary \nknowledge and expertise in agricultural matters. The Department of \nAgriculture formulates agricultural policy for our great Nation and \nworks closely with the farm community and agricultural industry about \nvarious concerns. They have experts and economists who know and work \nwith the data on a daily basis. The Department of Agriculture is the \noffice that can best assess the true impact of ag mergers and other \nbusiness transactions for farmers, ranchers, and independent producers, \nas well as the trickle-down effect on the consumer. So that is why it \nmakes sense that the role the Department of Agriculture plays presently \nin antitrust review of ag mergers be more than just a memorandum of \nunderstanding; that, in fact, it be permanent and a formal role, not \none that is informal and loosely contained in the memorandums.\n  Moreover, having such a requirement of formal participation or \nconsultation is not some new novel idea. I wish I could claim a new \nnovel idea. Other agencies, such as the Federal Communication \nCommission or the Department of Transportation, formally participate in \nthe review of mergers in their industries. They render formal decisions \nthat are then shared with the FTC or the Department of Justice. So \nalong the lines of the precedent set by the FCC and the Department of \nTransportation, I am asking that we do the same thing with the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the FTC and the Department of Justice.\n  I hope I have described to you what is a very modest approach, much \nmore modest than the ideas Senator Kohl and I had in the bill that I am \nsaying I am offering a stripped-down version of here. I basically put \nin statute what the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission are allegedly already supposed to be doing with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. The approach we advocate in this amendment \nwill ensure that all of agriculture's concerns and needs are fully \ndiscussed when Federal agencies examine proposed ag business mergers. \nBy guaranteeing inclusion and openness, we will go a long way toward \nalleviating understandable anxiety about an increasingly concentrated \nindustry.\n  Finally, the amendment would provide for additional resources to the \nDepartment of Justice and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's GIPSA \ndivision to enhance their ability to look at agricultural transactions \nand competition issues.\n  I want my colleagues to know that we worked very closely with several\n\n[[Page S15435]]\n\nagricultural and antitrust experts on the language contained in this \nvery amendment, as we did in the original bill. The amendment is \nsupported by a number of farm groups, and I would like to read these to \nyou: the Organization for Competitive Markets, the Campaign for \nContract Agriculture Reform, the Center for Rural Affairs, Food and \nWater Watch, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, R-CALF \nUSA--and just in case people don't understand that acronym, those are \npeople who are cattle producers but who aren't necessarily affiliated \nwith the National Cattlemen's Association. They could have dual \nmemberships, but they do have some different points of view. Then \nanother organization is the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, and \nlastly the Western Organization of Resource Councils.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na December 10, 2007, letter in support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 10, 2007.\n     Re Agricultural Competition Enhancement Act.\n\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Kohl: We would like to thank you \n     and express our support for the Agricultural Competition \n     Enhancement Act, Amendments 3717, 3823 and 3631, proposed for \n     inclusion in the Farm Bill. Agricultural producers face buyer \n     power when selling their products--and seller power when \n     buying. This market power scissors effect has devastated the \n     economy of rural America. These Amendments can begin to \n     reverse the process.\n       Congress created antitrust law in 1890. This body of law \n     did not exist previously, except through a patchwork of \n     common law doctrines and state statutes. The courts weakened \n     the Sherman Act. Congress responded by enacting the Clayton \n     Act. Then the Federal Trade Commission Act was passed. Some \n     updating occurred in the 1970's. However, the last 30 years \n     has seen competition falter in agriculture as antitrust law \n     has been incrementally neutered. Powerful companies have \n     opposed antitrust law for decades, with substantial recent \n     success.\n\n\n                        Amendments 3717 and 3823\n\n       This Amendment will create the Agriculture Competition Task \n     Force. The Task Force is necessary to focus on the \n     agricultural concentration problem and solutions. We can no \n     longer pretend that unfair and deceptive practices do not \n     exist in the U.S. food industry, America's biggest industry.\n       New guidelines are needed at the Department of Justice \n     specific to agriculture. DOJ admits that antitrust laws apply \n     unaltered across the economy--thereby conceding the problem \n     that must be solved. The current economywide guidelines are \n     of only passing relevance to farmers, ranchers and growers. \n     Those guidelines may apply to an industry dominated by five \n     firms dealing vertically with an industry dominated by three \n     firms. But the guidelines do not tackle the real problems of \n     disparate farmers with no market power doing business with \n     sophisticated, multinational firms.\n       Better methods must be developed to establish geographic \n     and product markets. Black and white concentration thresholds \n     must be devised to provide certainty and concentration. \n     Neither judges nor Department of Justice officials have \n     sufficiently grasped these issues in the recent past.\n       Rather they accept pleasing theories of competition that \n     work in textbooks, but not on the ground.\n       The failures have been astounding. In this year alone, the \n     Department of Justice approved a Southeast U.S. hog packing \n     monopoly by allowing Smithfield Foods to acquire Premium \n     Standard Farms. And DOJ also allowed Monsanto to acquire a \n     near monopoly in the cotton seed market when acquiring Delta \n     & Pine Land Company. Legislation is clearly needed.\n\n\n                             Amendment 3631\n\n       We also support Amendment 3631. The Post Merger Review \n     provisions are needed to correct the past mistakes of DOJ \n     that have harmed the agricultural economy by extracting \n     wealth from farmers, ranchers and rural communities. We \n     cannot continue protecting those accumulating market power. \n     Studying those past mergers will reveal the worst past \n     mistakes, and enable correction when warranted.\n       The Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition is also \n     needed at the USDA. The Grain Inspection, Packers & \n     Stockyards Administration has not been up to the task. \n     GIPSA's competition activities should be transferred to more \n     professional, accountable and well-funded staff.\n       We strongly support the Amendment's clarifications \n     regarding the burden of proof in a merger case. Congress can \n     and should make the policy decision that competition is often \n     harmed by concentration. It is sensible to exempt mergers \n     that are not problematic by allowing a defendant to prove the \n     deal does not substantially lessen competition or create a \n     monopoly.\n       This Amendment could be improved if it clarified that the \n     benefits of any alleged efficiencies created by an \n     acquisition must be passed on to consumers or producers, not \n     merely maintained by the merged entities. Efficiencies \n     benefiting the merged entities are emblematic of market \n     power, not competition. Those efficiencies should be proved \n     by clear and convincing evidence to dissuade judges from \n     lazily accepting mere theories and arguments rather than \n     factual proof.\n\n\n                    Department of Justice Opposition\n\n       We note the surprisingly strident opposition of the \n     Department of Justice in a November 15, 2007 letter to \n     Chairman Leahy. That opposition is ideological and turf-\n     based, not substantive. Indeed, the letter is akin to an \n     industry association press release.\n       Both DOJ and USDA have repeatedly failed their charge to \n     enforce the law, protect competition, and eliminate ideology \n     from decision making. Congress should not enable further \n     failure.\n       DOJ makes some fairly large leaps of logic, stating that \n     the Amendments would actually harm competition in \n     agriculture. No sound basis exists for such a claim, and \n     doubt is thus cast on the entire submission. Bureaucratic \n     distaste for legislation does not beget economic harm.\n       The Constitutional concerns expressed by the Department are \n     consistent with its new Unitary Executive theory that \n     relegates Congress to a minor governmental role. Congress \n     should be assertive in maintaining its authority, including \n     the ability to establish Task Forces that assist the \n     formation of merger review guidelines and enforcement policy.\n       DOJ also claims a Special Counsel for Competition at USDA \n     ``would harm American agriculture.'' This again is a leap of \n     logic, sprung from ideology and bureaucratic turf protection \n     rather than law or fact. DOJ's defense of USDA's Grain \n     Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration fails to \n     acknowledge the repeated GAO and USDA-OIG investigations \n     showing incompetence at best, and falsifying reports to \n     Congress at worst.\n       Indeed, the protestations prove the point--that change must \n     be imposed from outside the agencies.\n       We commend you for taking this modest first step in \n     antitrust improvement for production agriculture.\n           Signatory organizations,\n         Organization for Competitive Markets; Campaign for \n           Contract Agriculture Reform; Center for Rural Affairs; \n           Food & Water Watch; Institute for Agriculture and Trade \n           Policy; R-CALF USA; Sustainable Agriculture Coalition; \n           Western Organization of Resource Councils.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So my colleagues are clear, once again to repeat, \nSenator Kohl and I listened very carefully to the concerns expressed by \ncompanies and groups that contacted us about S. 1759, the original \nAgriculture Competition Enhancement Act--we call that ACE for short--\nand in response to those concerns, we made significant changes and \nelimination to the language which has been incorporated in this \namendment. This amendment does not make any substantive changes in \nantitrust laws. I am going to address that a little more specifically \nbecause that is one of the things we have heard against this amendment. \nMaybe it would be an applicable criticism of the bill but not of this \namendment.\n\n  Also, there is no mandatory adoption of the task force \nrecommendations on the guidelines to which I have referred. The \nconstitutional issues raised have been taken care of and more \ncontentious provisions have been eliminated. The bottom line is the \nconcerns that were raised by certain companies, as well as the Justice \nDepartment and the FTC, about our previous iterations of the ACE bill \nhave been taken care of in the amendment. The bottom line is, this \namendment is very much an attempt to address everyone's concerns and to \nreach a fair compromise because I think we could have gone a lot \nfurther and been even a lot more aggressive in dealing with \nagricultural competition issues. I had a hard time convincing Senator \nKohl we ought to make these changes, but he has agreed as well.\n  There is a real need for this amendment. We need it to beef up our \nability to address competition issues in agriculture and to address \nconcerns with consolidation in the industry. My amendment is an itty-\nbitty step in the right direction; maybe some would say too small of a \nstep but still a good first step at getting something done.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Grassley-Kohl-Harkin amendment.\n  I do have some other things I want to say, but I do not want to take \nall the time right now. I do want to speak about some of the \ndifferences between what was in our bill and what is in our\n\n[[Page S15436]]\n\namendment. I am willing to yield the floor if other people want to \nspeak on the amendment that I have before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the Grassley \namendment. I am certainly willing to yield to the Senator from Iowa, if \nhe wants to have his colleague from Wisconsin speak right with him or \nif he wants to go afterwards.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Grassley in \nsupport of amendment No. 3823. Our amendment will significantly enhance \nthe antitrust review given to mergers and acquisitions in the \nagricultural sector.\n  Concentration and consolidation in agriculture is a major concern for \nour hard working farmers. Due to the wave of mergers and acquisitions \nthat have occurred throughout the agricultural sector in recent years, \nfewer and fewer food processors have captured a greater and greater \nshare of the market for purchasing agricultural goods. Farmers have \nless choice of where to sell their products, and as a result the prices \nthey receive continue to decline.\n  Our Nation's farmers--who comprise less than 2 percent of the \npopulation--produce the most abundant, wholesome, and by far the \ncheapest supply of food on the face of the Earth. However, the way in \nwhich that food is produced is rapidly changing, creating significant \nnew challenges. We have witnessed a massive reorganization in our food \nchain due to the increasing numbers of mergers in the dairy, livestock, \ngrain, rail, and biotechnology industries. In fact, the top four beef \npackers control 71 percent of the market, the top four pork processors \ncontrol 63 percent of the market and the top four poultry processors \ncontrol 50 percent of the market. During this period of enormous \ntransformation in the agricultural industry, disparity in market power \nbetween family farmers and the large conglomerates all too often leaves \nthe individual farmer with little choice regarding who will buy their \nproducts and under what terms.\n  The effects of this increasing consolidation are felt throughout the \nagricultural sector. Rather than buying on the open market, processors \nof farm commodities are relying more and more on contractual \narrangements with farmers which bind farmers to sell a specified amount \nof product, for prices specified by the processors. In many cases, \nthere is no longer a significant open market to which farmers and \nranchers can turn. These contractual arrangements damage the \nindependence of family farmers, leaving them little choice regarding \nwhat to grow and the terms on which to sell their products.\n  Agricultural consolidation has also been pronounced in the dairy \nsector. Mergers among milk processors have greatly concentrated the \nindustry, and resulted in lower prices for dairy farmers. There have \nbeen serious allegations of anticompetitive conduct by one large dairy \nprocessor in Florida and elsewhere resulting from this highly \nconcentrated market.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years our antitrust regulators at the \nDepartment of Justice have done little to stem the tide of ever \nincreasing agricultural consolidation. This is why we are today \noffering this amendment to the farm bill.\n  Our amendment will significantly enhance the scrutiny given to \nagricultural mergers under the antitrust laws. It will establish an \nAgricultural Competition Task Force--made up of representatives of \nantitrust enforcement officials, State and Federal agriculture \nregulatory officials, State attorneys generals, industry experts, and \nrepresentatives of small family farmers and ranchers--charged to \ninvestigate problems of competition in agriculture and make \nrecommendations to Congress and enforcement agencies on ways to enhance \ncompetition.\n  Our amendment will also direct the Justice Department and Federal \nTrade Commission to develop, within 2 years, new guidelines for \nantitrust enforcement in the agricultural sector. These guidelines are \nto be written to prevent anticompetitive mergers in the agricultural \nindustry. These guidelines will require the antitrust enforcement \nagencies to challenge any merger or acquisition in the agricultural \nsector, if the effect of that merger or acquisition may be to \nsubstantially lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly. The \ndevelopment of such strong guidelines should deter anticompetitive \nmergers from even being attempted in the first place.\n  Our amendment will also provide a procedure for comments by the \nSecretary of Agriculture regarding proposed mergers and acquisitions in \nthe agricultural sector. These comments should provide important \nexpertise and enhance the merger review process of the antitrust \nagencies when reviewing agricultural mergers.\n  In sum, our amendment is a significant measure to combat the ever \nrising tide of consolidation in agriculture which threatens to swamp \nour Nation's hard working family farmers. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport amendment No. 3823.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak in opposition to the \nGrassley amendment. I appreciate the heart of the Senator from Iowa, \nand his intent. He has been consistent. He has been longstanding and \nheartfelt on this issue. I have been in the meetings he has called with \nthe head of packing and stockyard compensation about concerns of \nconcentration in the agricultural industry. I have seen him press on \nthis issue. I agree with his heart on this amendment and his effort and \nhis desire.\n  I absolutely disagree with this amendment. I agree with the \nsentiment, what he is trying to get done. This is not the way. I would \nlike to express to this body what I believe, clearly, will take place \nin my State were this amendment to pass.\n  The cattle industry is a major industry in my State. We are third in \nthe number of cattle on ranches and feed yards--6.4 million. There are \nmore than twice as many cattle than people in my State. It is big \nbusiness. It is a feed yard business where a lot of cattle from all \nover the country come to be fed out and processed. It is a very big \nbusiness. It is $6.25 billion in cash receipts a year in my State, my \nrural State.\n  This is a business where there are a lot of contractual engagements \nand obligations back and forth. A man may have cattle from Alabama, and \nhe puts them on a feed yard near Dodge City, KS. The processing plant \nis near Dodge City and the feed yard may have a contractual arrangement \nwith the processor, saying: I am going to deliver you a thousand head \nof cattle a day for every working day. That keeps your processing plant \norderly and organized. In exchange for that, I am going to get a higher \nvalue of cattle that he then passes on to that Alabama cattleman who \nowns the cattle there.\n  It is an arrangement that has worked to produce a very highly \neffective system. Some people do not like the scale of it. In many \nrespects I do not. I would rather it be dispersed to a huge number of \nfamily farms across the country the way it used to be, like the farm \nwhere I grew up where we had chickens and pigs and cattle. Instead, we \nhave much more integrated operating units. But this would go right at \nthe heart of this industry, as far as changing the burden of proof and \nchanging it on one specific industry. It will not have the intended \neffect of recreating the family farm system. That is not what is going \nto be the spill-out of this.\n  What will end up taking place is the Alabama cattleman is going to \nend up getting less money for his cattle, and the consumer is going to \nget less of a directed product they want. I want to develop that for \nthe body, to explain why I like the heart of the people proposing this, \nbut this will not produce the results they want.\n  The amendment creates an Agricultural Competition Task Force with the \nstated purpose to examine problems in agricultural competition. The \ntask force has virtually unlimited authority to investigate \ntransactions and business arrangements in the livestock industry--read \nspecial counsel for agriculture. It puts in several millions of dollars \nin that area. The task force is unaccountable to anyone. It is not \nrequired to hold public meetings nor abide by the Administrative \nProcedure Act nor acquire evidence from all parties. Under this \namendment, the livestock industry and entire agricultural industry \ncould be subject to limitless reviews of transactions.\n  I think the biggest piece I have concern about--and I have concerns \nabout\n\n[[Page S15437]]\n\nthis as a lawyer, and as an agricultural lawyer I have concerns about \nthis. This is the area that I taught in. This is the area I have \nwritten in. I have written on the Packers and Stockyards Act. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation that this Government passed in the \n1920s, when we had a very diffuse agriculture with a very monopolistic \npacking industry. We said this is not fair, so we are creating the \nPackers and Stockyards Act to oversee this structure. That is what they \nhave been charged with doing.\n  In this particular amendment they would shift the burden of proof in \nthe justice system and say this is a guilty transaction, monopolistic \nin nature, and then you prove your way out of it. To support that, I \nwant to quote from the Department of Justice letter they wrote on the \nparticular provisions. I understand my colleague from Iowa has changed \nsome of the provisions but not this piece of it.\n  This would change the standards of certain mergers, acquisitions, and \nactions under the Clayton Act. That is the base bill. In particular, in \nall agricultural merger cases brought by the Government, Federal and \nState, and all private cases where the merging parties' combined market \nshare is 20 percent or more--this is the DOJ letter--it puts the burden \nof proof on the defendant to show the transaction would not \nsubstantially impact or lessen competition or tend to create problems \nin the marketplace.\n  I am paraphrasing monopoly in the marketplace at the end.\n  The current setting is, no, we have to prove that against the \nindividual or the group. To date, the Federal antitrust laws apply \nunaltered to mergers across virtually all industries, with the \noverriding objective to protect competition to the benefit of consumers \nbecause the Department has not been prevented from challenging \nanticompetitive mergers. They can challenge, and do now, in agriculture \nunder the current legal standards. Shifting the burden of proof is \nunnecessary. This is a big deal, to shift the burden of proof on one \nparticular industry, and then also to put in industry-specific \nguidelines.\n  Let me tell you what is taking place now. I described the situation \nof an Alabama cattle producer who puts cattle on feed in Kansas, who \ngets more money for his cattle because they are on feed there and \nbecause that feed yard guarantees a certain flow of cattle. If you put \nthis in place, it has lawyers paid for by the Government to go out and \nexamine any contract that is taking place. It can go, pick a feed yard, \na Kansas feed yard, and it can go out and say: You have a contractual \narrangement with this packer, and we are going to examine that.\n  Now, you pay for lawyers to say this is not a noncompetitive \ntransaction--and they are going to have to hire lawyers to do that. \nThey are going to end up having a big legal bill on a shifted burden, \nwhere the guilt is assumed, not innocence is assumed. It is going to be \ndifferent from any other industry around. You are going to then have \npeople driving down the price of the commodity. And you have a number \nof groups that are in these innovative market mechanisms. I described \none earlier, a group of people at the Knight Feedyard that have \ncertified hormone-free, antibiotic-free beef. It is a group \nof producers. They formed an association. They go to a big packer and \nsay: Will you process our cattle and deliver it to the shelves in \nConnecticut and New York as hormone-free, additive-free, antibiotic-\nfree beef? The packer agrees to do so. That is a contractual \narrangement that will be subject to investigation, that will be \npresumed guilty under this.\n\n  My Kansas producers, under this innovative marketing approach that \nthey initiated, get a substantial benefit by being able to market this \nsort of product that the consumer wants, and they have to go to a major \npacker to do it because he is the person--that is the group that can \nprocess cattle and get it to the shelf in a good quality state.\n  But my guys are the ones who get the money out of the system. They \nwill be presumed guilty. It will be presumed to violate this. It will \nbe subject to a great deal of legal investigation taking place, and my \nbelief is it will not happen. Then my producers get less money for \ntheir cattle, and the consumers do not get the product they want. This \nis a specialty product that people want. It costs more to produce this \ntype of beef and the consumer is not going to get that product and my \ncattlemen are going to get less money for their product.\n  I appreciate the heart of the proposal. What it is going to end up \ndoing is getting less money to cattlemen in particular. I can't speak \nfor other agricultural or livestock industries as well as I can for \nbusiness that is in my State. The National Cattleman's Beef Association \nis strongly opposed to this amendment. The Department of Justice is \nopposed to this amendment for reasons of shifting standards for one \nindustry but not for any others; for having different standards for \nthat industry. The cattlemen believe it is going to hurt them \nsubstantially, subject them to a number of legal costs that they do not \ncurrently have and that they cannot afford to deal with. It is going to \nhurt the consumer as well.\n  While I appreciate the intent, I appreciate the presentation of it--\nmy family farms. My brother is a farmer. This is not going to take us \nin the right direction. I believe the route to go is what we have been \ndoing in the Packers and Stockyards Administration and having industry \nstandards that are similar across all industries, and that we should \nsupport the Packers and Stockyards Administration, support the laws \nthat are there, fund those entities--which I support doing--maintaining \nthose standards but allowing these innovative approaches to take place \nfor a major industry in my State and for my producers and cattle \nproducers across the country.\n  I know others want to speak on this issue. I may speak on it again in \na while.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Kansas. I \nam a farmer. I am not a lawyer like he is. He is a lawyer and farmer, \nso he might have some intuition. But I would just like to have him \ncome, and I will deliver it to his desk--he needs to read my amendment. \nWhat he has said is an analysis of the bill that Senator Kohl and I \nintroduced, but that is not the amendment. Maybe he missed my opening \nremarks, but I went to great length in those opening remarks to explain \nhow my amendment differs from the bill. I want to point that out to the \nSenator from Kansas because I think I have addressed every concern he \nhas presented to the Senate in his very good speech.\n  I have taken care of his concerns, and I am going to mention those \nconcerns he has brought up, and then I am going to go to some length to \ntell you how I have taken care of that. But there is no special counsel \namendment in this bill, as the Senator from Kansas has said. There are \nno additional reviews of transactions that have already taken place. \nThat was in the original bill. It is not in this amendment.\n  He spoke two or three times about changing the burden of proof. That \nwas in the original bill. It is not in this slimmed-down amendment. \nThere is no burden of proof shifting in the amendment.\n  The task force that we provided for has no review or study provisions \nin the amendment, as indicated by the Senator from Kansas.\n  Now I am going to go into some detail, because obviously people are \nnot listening to anything I have said. I want to state in a more \nelaborate way how this bill differs--this amendment differs from the \nbill that I said Senator Kohl and I first introduced, and the length we \nwent to take care of concerns that the White House, the administration \nhas raised, concerns that both the ranking member and the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee raised, because this bill was referred to \nJudiciary, and then lastly, working with the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee, to address concerns he had.\n  There has been a lot of smoke and mirrors--I think you heard some of \nthat--about the provision of the bill, and most of those charges are \nnot factual, as I have indicated.\n  The fact is, this amendment is very different from the bill Senator \nKohl and I introduced earlier this year. This amendment is also \ndifferent from another amendment I had already filed to this bill. Let \nme list some of the things\n\n[[Page S15438]]\n\nthat are not in our amendment that are before us in 3823.\n  I am hearing that people are concerned about the shifting of the \nburden of proof in the amendment. The burden-of-proof shifting \nprovision that was in the prior iteration has been eliminated. It is \nnot in this amendment. There are no substantive changes to antitrust \nlaws at all.\n  I am hearing concerns about reviews that will be done after mergers \nhave been approved. The provisions that allow the task force to do a \nstudy of agricultural mergers that were approved within the past 10 \nyears have been eliminated, not in this amendment.\n  In addition, the provisions requiring the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission to review ag mergers 5 years after they have \nbeen approved have been eliminated as well.\n  The provision creating an Assistant Attorney General for Agricultural \nAntitrust at the Justice Department has been eliminated. In other \nwords, it is not in the amendment pending before the Senate.\n  The constitutional concerns raised by the administration, not by \nSenator Brownback, about the agricultural competition task force are \ngone, the constitutional concerns.\n  We changed the provisions requiring adoption by the Justice \nDepartment of task force working group recommendations on agricultural \nguidelines. The amendment now has the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission consulting with the task force working group \non the guidelines.\n  Any so-called constitutional concerns have been eliminated. We have \nmade other changes to the prior writings of this amendment and/or the \nbill, all of which were incorporated in amendment 3823. We made these \nchanges to address concerns that we agreed with, and we made changes in \norder to reach a fair compromise.\n  The fact is, big business and the agricultural giants do not want \nanything that might put up any sort of review by people who know \nsomething about agriculture, of their expansion and concentration \nefforts. The fact is, our Federal antitrust regulators refuse to \nrecognize that agriculture is unique and should have industry-specific \nguidelines to make sure that special circumstances of the agricultural \nlandscape are considered.\n  This brings about consideration, this does not bring about any \nchange. Any movement to them, no matter how small, to try to address \nconcentration and competition issues in agriculture is going to be \ndecried by the powerful interest groups and their lobbyists. So when \nsomething reasonable is suggested, such as the Grassley-Kohl-Harkin \namendment No. 3823, we still are going to get the outrageous claims \nthat this is a bad amendment. The reality is the sky is not falling.\n  I advise my colleagues, particularly the Senator from Kansas, to read \nthe amendment. Forget about the bill he has been referring to. Instead, \nlisten, and stop listening to those sensational cries being made by \nagribusiness and their allies. We need to pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my good friend if he would yield 1 minute to me to \ntalk about an amendment that is coming later this evening.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will probably do that. Let me make an inquiry. Can I \ndo that, Mr. President, without setting aside or yielding my right to \ncontinue discussion of this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may address another amendment \nwithout prejudice to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3771\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much. I thank the chairman very \nmuch as well.\n  Senator Bond has filed an amendment to the farm bill that I hope the \nPresident sitting in the chair will listen to me about, because it \nwould undercut crucial food safety, health, environment, consumer \nprotection, and other laws, most of which come out of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  I am not going to go into it now, because it will be gone into later. \nBut it would stop agencies such as the EPA from adopting or retaining \nsafeguards for the American public.\n  It is opposed by the following: AFL-CIO, the American Lung \nAssociation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Consumer \nFederation, the Sierra Club, the Alliance for Justice, the National \nAudubon Society, the United Food and Commercial Workers, Humane \nSociety, and many others.\n  It would require a complex, burdensome, and unnecessary regulatory \nanalysis by Federal agencies. It would impose a maze of ``regulatory \nflexibility,'' and all kinds of analyses so that it would stop us from \nmoving forward to ensure our laws such as Clean Air, Safe Drinking \nWater, Clean Water, and Wholesome Meat and the Wholesome Poultry \nProducts Act.\n  I simply flag this for colleagues who care about food safety, who \ncare about clean water and safe drinking water, and hope we will have a \nresounding ``no'' vote or perhaps Senator Bond might rethink his \namendment.\n  It gives special treatment to virtually any industry with even \ntenuous connections to agriculture in rulemakings. It gives special \ntreatment to all ``agricultural entities,'' defined so broadly as to \ninclude virtually any industry with any arguable connection to \nagriculture or forestry, such as the food processing corporations, \npesticide companies, railroads, paper mills, shipping companies, and \ntruck and tractor manufacturers.\n  It gives agribusiness corporations a special private right to \nprivately comment on and seek to weaken Federal protections.\n  The amendment creates a special process, only applicable to EPA and \nthe Department of the Interior rules in which only agricultural \nindustry representatives get inside information and a private chance to \nlobby against potential new agency rules before the proposal becomes \npublic. This could allow large corporations to delay or kill vital \nenvironmental and health protections against toxic pesticides, water or \nair pollution, and other important threats.\n  It creates a new lobbying/litigation shop at USDA to advocate for \nagribusiness. This new ``Chief Council for Advocacy'' would lobby \nagencies and even file amicus briefs in litigation challenging agency \nrules.\n  It provides special new special judicial review provisions that only \n``agricultural entities'' can use, which would delay or undercut \nFederal safeguards. It gives special standing to ``agricultural \nentities'' to sue agencies for failing to comply with most of these \nrequirements.\n  It requires Federal agencies to consider weakening all of its current \nrules. Every agency must review any rule it has on the books which has, \nor will have, a ``significant economic impact upon a substantial number \nof agricultural entities'' to see if ``such rules should be continued \nwithout change, or should be amended or rescinded.''\n  The Bond amendment would keep EPA and other agencies from doing their \njob to protect the American public. I urge all of my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on the Bond amendment, SA 3771. It is bad for America's health \nand bad for our environment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the good Senator \nfrom Iowa and a couple of his comments about the amendment. But first I \nask unanimous consent to insert in the Record after my statement a \nletter from the Department of Justice opposing the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we just received this from the \nDepartment of Justice. They state in the first paragraph:\n\n       The Department of Justice strongly opposes the amendment.\n\n  To read their summation sentence, which I do not think is fair, given \nthe detail and the work the Senator from Iowa has gone into on this, \nand substantial changes that he has made--we have been reviewing his \namendment. I have the amendment.\n  But in the DOJ summary sentence, they state this:\n\n       However, DOJ believes certain provisions included in the \n     amendment would not accomplish its stated goal of protecting \n     rural communities and family farms and ranches, but instead \n     would unnecessarily duplicate\n\n[[Page S15439]]\n\n     existing collaboration efforts, increase costs and \n     uncertainty and may hinder effective antitrust enforcement \n     and harm competition in agriculture and other industries. \n     Therefore DOJ strongly opposes the amendment.\n\n  Then they go on further to develop the points they have here. As I \nsaid, I appreciate the modifications the Senator from Iowa has made. I \ncan tell you in my State, and in the cattle industry, they view this as \nhurting the price that they are going to be able to get for cattle is \nthe bottom line issue. They view this as driving up substantially their \nlegal costs, and most farmers do not like to have any legal costs, let \nalone having a number of legal costs.\n  They believe this is going to do it, and that is not--that is coming \nfrom the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, it is coming from the \nKansas Livestock Association, where I was a couple of weeks ago at \ntheir annual meeting. This was one of their lead concerns, and the \nreason it was one of their lead concerns is they are looking at that \nand saying: Look, we are going into a number of different marketing \ntransactions now, and we feed cattle for a lot of people around the \ncountry.\n  My guess is a fair number of Iowa's cattle are on feed in my State in \nKansas, and that that is taking place is a good thing. We invite more \nfarms to come there because of the efficiency, of our feeding \noperations, because of the weather conditions for those, because of the \npackers that are located there, and the efficiency of being able to do \nthat, and then of these innovative marketing arrangements so that they \ncan get a premium price for Angus cattle that come out of Iowa or \nAlabama or California or somewhere else. They are able to get a premium \nprice for those because they do special things. They say we are going \nto keep these Angus fed separately here, and we are going to track them \nthrough the whole system. Then we are going to make sure they are \nhormone free, if that is what the group wants, or we are going to do \nsomething else to have premium beef that is going to be marketed only \nin certain high-end restaurants.\n  All of that segments the marketplace, but those segmented \nmarketplaces are through contractual arrangements, and they get a \npremium to the producer that will be under investigation with this. \nThat is why DOJ opposes it. That is why the Kansas Livestock \nAssociation, when I was meeting with them, was very fearful of this.\n  I appreciate some of the changes that were made and were noted here. \nThe base concerns remain what was stated here by the Department of \nJustice and by the Kansas livestock producers.\n  Now, different people look at this different ways. A lot of us are \ndeeply concerned, and have been for some time, about the concentration \nthat has taken place in the agriculture business. How do you go at it \ndifferently? I spent 6 years as agriculture secretary in Kansas, and \nmany times was trying to come up with innovative, different market \nsegments, whether we could do it on a small scale, farmers' markets, \nand getting products closer to consumers, whether we can do different \nproducts which are coming out now.\n  We are a big cotton producer in Kansas, looking at canola oil--some \nof it got going; some of it did not--or confection of sunflower seeds \nwhich are under contract, I might point out as well.\n  So we went through a period we are not making enough money off of the \ncommodity-based business, and we have got to segment this. But when you \nsegment it, that generally requires some sort of identity being \npreserved and some sort of contractual relationship. And, yes, you get \na benefit for that, you get paid more than someone who just has a \ncommodity product.\n  Well, now, if you say: You cannot do that, or if you do that, we are \ngoing to presume you are guilty and you are going to have to pay a \nlawyer to fight your way out of it. With all due respect to the people \nwhose intent is pure on this, this is going to hurt producers in my \nState.\n  That is why many of them--not all, some--support this approach, but \nmany would be strongly opposed to this, as the Department of Justice \nis.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington. DC, December 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of Justice (DOJ) has \n     reviewed Senate Amendment 3823 to H.R. 2419. DOJ works \n     vigorously to ensure that the benefits of competition are \n     maintained in all markets, including agricultural markets, to \n     the benefit of American consumers. However, DOJ believes that \n     certain provisions included in the amendment would not \n     accomplish its stated goal of protecting rural communities \n     and family farms and ranches, but instead would unnecessarily \n     duplicate existing collaboration efforts, increase costs and \n     uncertainty, and may hinder effective antitrust enforcement \n     and harm competition in agriculture and other industries. \n     Therefore, DOJ strongly opposes the Amendment.\n       Senate Amendment 3823 to H.R. 2419 calls on DOJ and the \n     Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue agriculture merger \n     guidelines. To date, the Federal antitrust laws apply \n     unaltered to mergers across virtually all industries, with \n     the overriding objective to protect competition to the \n     benefit of consumers. As such, there is no need for any \n     industry-specific merger guidelines. The Horizontal Merger \n     Guidelines (Guidelines) issued by the DOJ and FTC apply \n     consistently to mergers across the entire economy, and no \n     need has been demonstrated to depart from that generally \n     applicable approach. DOJ has not been prevented from \n     challenging anti competitive mergers in agriculture under the \n     current legal standards. To the extent that there is a \n     suggestion that monopsony is a problem particularly \n     significant to agriculture, the guidelines address monopsony \n     and thus no industry specific guideline is warranted for that \n     concern.\n       DOJ believes that current merger policy is sufficiently \n     flexible to address market conditions that may be unique to \n     agricultural markets. For example, DOJ and FTC recently \n     issued a Commentary to the Horizontal Merger Guidelines \n     (2006), which provides several examples of how agricultural \n     matters are reviewed. This commentary, DOJ's merger \n     challenges in matters such as General Mills/Pillsbury (2001), \n     Archer-Daniels-Midland/Minnesota Corn Processors (2002), \n     Syngenta/Advanta (2004). and Monsanto/DPt (2007), competitive \n     impact statements issued as part of those challenges, and the \n     closing statements DOJ has issued for certain agricultural \n     matters, demonstrate that merger policy under the Guidelines \n     is effective at protecting consumers and maintaining \n     competition in agriculture industries. Changing the well-\n     established policy is not necessary and could deter \n     efficiency enhancing transactions that would benefit \n     consumers by resulting in lower prices.\n       Subsection (c) of Senate Amendment 3823 creates an \n     Agriculture Competition Task Force (Task Force), made up of \n     representatives from DOJ, FTC, United States Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA), State governments and attorneys general, \n     small and independent farming interests, and academics or \n     other experts. The Task Force is charged with devoting \n     additional resources focused solely on agriculture industries \n     to study competition issues, coordinate Federal and State \n     activities to address ``unfair and deceptive practices'' and \n     concentration, and work with representatives from rural \n     communities to ``identify abusive practices.'' In addition, \n     the Task Force shall report on the state of family farmers \n     and ranchers. DOJ believes such a task force would at best \n     duplicate existing enforcement activities, and at worst could \n     impede existing coordination between DOJ, USDA, and state \n     governments by creating a bureaucratic structure that would \n     increase the cost to the American taxpayer without any \n     benefit to competition or independent farmers. Furthermore, \n     to the extent the amendment requires consideration of the \n     effects on ``rural communities'' there is no clear \n     explanation regarding how this factor should be considered, \n     and such consideration could be inconsistent with overall \n     antitrust objectives.\n       Subsection (e) of this amendment requires notification to \n     the USDA of Hart Scott Rodino (HSR) filings with the FTC and \n     DOJ as well as the sharing with the Secretary of Agriculture \n     of any second request materials obtained under such merger \n     reviews. Under this section, USDA may submit and publish \n     comments on whether mergers ``present significant competition \n     and buyer power concerns,'' such that further review by DOJ \n     or the FTC is warranted. Congress provided essential \n     confidentiality for HSR filings and for productions of \n     documents under that process, and no need has been shown to \n     change that important protection. Through the existing \n     Memorandum of Understanding between DOJ, the FTC and USDA, \n     the antitrust agencies seek expertise and information from \n     USDA on agriculture matters, and as part of that cooperative \n     relationship, USDA expresses its views regarding antitrust \n     merger enforcement matters, and thus no need for radical \n     change has been shown. In addition, concurrent jurisdiction \n     likely would increase costs and time delays inherent in \n     duplicative review and has the potential for inconsistent \n     standards and outcomes.\n       DOJ shares the concern of the amendment's sponsors that \n     agriculture, as a key part of our economy, should maintain \n     its competitive nature so that producers and consumers alike \n     benefit from adequate supply and choice of agricultural \n     products at competitive prices. Moreover, we take seriously \n     concerns expressed in the agriculture community about \n     competitiveness in the agriculture sector. However, because \n     Senate\n\n[[Page S15440]]\n\n     Amendment 3823 has several provisions that raise concerns for \n     DOJ, both about unintended consequences as well as about \n     competition and public policy, DOJ strongly opposes these \n     provisions.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide our views on this \n     proposed legislation. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised us that there is no objection to this letter from the \n     perspective of the Administration's program.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             Brian A. Benczkowski,\n                      Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not have a whole lot more to say about this bill \nif you want to move on. But I do want to continue to correct a couple \nof things the Senator from Kansas has spoken about.\n  First, I was listening as he was quoting from the Department of \nJustice letter. And he may have a later letter, but those exact words \nthat he was reading from appear in a November 15 letter that Senator \nLeahy received as chairman of the Judiciary Committee with objections \nfrom the Department of Justice.\n  But those objections are about the bill S. 1759, the bill that I said \nwe have modified considerably as an amendment here, so that it does not \ndo all of the things that have been attributed to it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague will yield, my letter is dated today, \nDecember 13. It is a subsequent letter to the letter the Senator is \nquoting from.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is on the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. But in the paragraph you were quoting, it says exactly \nthe same thing in the letter I got of November 15 in which they were \ncommenting on 1759, and they surely can't find the same fault with the \namendment that they found with the bill because we met with them and \nmade changes according to what they asked us to do.\n  My staff corrects me that we didn't actually meet with the Department \nof Justice, but we were well aware of the changes they were demanding, \nand those changes are taken into consideration in this legislation.\n  Then we keep hearing from the Senator from Kansas about \ninvestigations and reviews. Get that out of your system. I have spoken \ntwice on that issue--no reviews, no investigation.\n  Then when you hear all of these faults the bill is going to bring \nabout--you are going to increase the cost of food to the consumer or \nmaybe decrease profitability to the farmer--I don't see that anything \nlike that is a result of a task force that is going to help the Justice \nDepartment and the FTC in determining whether mergers are \nanticompetitive. These are guidelines. They are not making decisions. \nThe Department of Justice and the FTC will be making those decisions. \nBut is there anything wrong with having a little bit of input into \nagricultural issues before those two agencies from experts in this town \nin the Department of Agriculture who may have some understanding of \nagriculture? I don't think the sky is going to fall if you have that \nsort of input.\n  I hope we can vote on my amendment and move on. I will only speak to \nthe extent I have to to continue to defend misunderstandings of what \nthe amendment does as opposed to what the original bill did.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend, the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Our Nation has been blessed with a judicial system dedicated to the \nprinciple of the rule of law. Each one of us no matter how: rich or \npoor; strong or weak; big or small; receive equal justice under the \nlaw.\n  In part, that is one of the reasons why our national competition \npolicy is framed in general, universal terms. Specifically, the Sherman \nAct prohibits every ``contract, combination or conspiracy, in restraint \nof trade;'' and the Clayton Act prohibits all acquisitions whose effect \n``may be substantially to lessen competition.''\n  There are many instances, where we have diverged from these \nprinciples, even for good cause. However, in many of these instances we \nhave encountered numerous difficulties and our economy harmed by \nunexpected consequences.\n  One need only look at correcting legislation that the chairman of the \nAntitrust Subcommittee, Senator Kohl, recently offered eliminating \nrailroad antitrust exemptions.\n  Senator Kohl believes, with a great deal of merit, that many shippers \nare being charged exorbitant prices to transport their goods by the \nrailroads. In fact, the Antitrust Subcommittee, of which I am ranking \nRepublican member, received a letter, as part of the subcommittee's \nhearing into railroad antitrust exemptions, from several States' \nattorneys general that discussed how foreign corporations are very \nreluctant to invest in new American manufacturing facilities if the \nproposed location of these facilities is serviced by only one railroad.\n  Senator Kohl's solution to this problem is to eliminate the special \nantitrust exemptions granted to railroad mergers.\n  Indeed, many Senators have argued for the repeal of the McCarran-\nFerguson Act. As my colleagues know the McCarran-Ferguson Act exempts \nthe business of insurance from Federal antitrust laws when and to the \nextent that business is regulated by State law.\n  These Senators believe that certain insurers took advantage of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson exemption to implement a collective agreement to \nraise insurance prices on gulf coast residents still recovering from \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Clearly, there is evidence of unattended consequences when special \nprovisions are permitted in antitrust law.\n  That being said, there is a substantial difference between railroad \nantitrust exemptions, McCarran-Ferguson exemptions and creating new \nagriculture antitrust guidelines as called for by the Grassley \namendment. I thoroughly recognize that the market relationship between \nthe producer and the food packer desires special attention. However, \nthe underlining concern is well founded: special antitrust rules for \nspecific industries can have profound undesirable consequences and \nviolate one of our national competition policies fundamental tenants: \nthat antitrust law should be framed in general, universal terms. So the \nquestion I believe that we should be asking is if the remedy to this \nsituation is additional, special legislation, or greater enforcement? \nCurrently, the Department of Justice has devoted considerable effort to \ninvestigate agricultural mergers but the time might be coming where we \nneed to increase those resources for the Department. Perhaps the \ncreation of a new Deputy Assistant Attorney General, whose \nresponsibilities are solely to investigate agriculture mergers, is the \ncorrect path.\n  My trepidations of industry-specific rules, such as those called for \nby the Grassley amendment, are that they are likely to create legal \ndifficulties. First, industry-specific rules add to the danger of \ninconsistent enforcement across industries. Second, industry-specific \nrules introduce additional uncertainty, since it will not always be \nclear in which industry a particular product should be classified, and \nthus not clear which legal standard will apply. Finally, has shown that \nonce you enact industry-specific rules other industries and \nconstituency groups will request there own special antitrust rules.\n  So what should we do? Do we maintain our national competition policy \nwhich is framed in general, universal terms, or should we embrace \nthrough industry-specific enactments.\n  Well let's look at the record. During a period of ever increasing \ncomplex laws and regulations having general and simple rules makes \nantitrust law more understandable to both the legal and business \ncommunity. The general language of current statutes provides courts and \nenforcement agencies valuable flexibility to incorporate the latest \ndevelopments in business and economic learning. It should also be noted \nthat, where industry-specific factors are important to reaching a \ncorrect decision in a particular case, the agencies and the courts are \nalready fully authorized to consider those factors under current law. \nIn particular, current antitrust principles can address issues of buyer \npower that have concerned some observers of agricultural mergers.\n  One should also remember that congressionally created Antitrust \nModernization Commission concluded that ``the basic framework for \nanalyzing mergers followed by the U.S. enforcement agencies and courts \nis sound.''\n\n[[Page S15441]]\n\n  Therefore, I oppose Senator Grassley's amendment. Senator Grassley \nhas a well-deserved reputation for standing up for and defending the \nAmerican farmer. I agree that we must be vigilant in ensuring that the \nDepartment of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are diligent in \nenforcing antitrust laws--but those laws should be for all American \neconomic endeavors, not fragmented as all too many of our laws have \nbecome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for offering \nthis amendment. I am a cosponsor and a proud supporter.\n  I have been listening to the debate taking place, and quite frankly I \ndo not understand the opposition by the Senator from Kansas. After all, \nas Senator Grassley pointed out, this is not the original bill. It was \nmodified quite a bit.\n  All this amendment really does is create an Agriculture Competition \nTask Force to study problems in agricultural competition, establish \nways to coordinate Federal and State activities, address unfair and \ndeceptive practices in concentration, create a working group on buyer \npower to study effects of concentration in agriculture, and make \nrecommendations to assist the Department of Justice and the Federal \nTrade Commission in drafting agricultural guidelines. I don't know that \nanything could be more advisory than that. All we are doing is saying, \nuse the expertise they have at the Department of Agriculture to look at \nthese issues and advise and inform DOJ. It doesn't say that DOJ has to \ndo what they say. It doesn't say they have to follow everything they \nsay. It is advisory. I don't see why there would be such an objection \nto this kind of advice which would be given to DOJ and the Federal \nTrade Commission. There are some other things in there, but that is \nsort of basically the essence.\n  Again, as many times as we have seen decisions come down from the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, you wonder if \nthey have anybody over there who understands anything at all about \nrural America. You wonder how many of these lawyers over there at the \nDepartment of Justice--I don't want to pick on any schools; we always \nsay Harvard-trained lawyers and Yale-trained lawyers--have had any dirt \nunder their fingernails from a farm or how many of them know anything \nabout livestock issues.\n  This is a good amendment. Quite frankly, I am surprised there is this \nkind of opposition.\n  Having said that, I wonder if the Senator from Iowa--if we could ask \nto set the amendment aside temporarily so we can move on to a couple \nother amendments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I consent to that, and I probably will, as the \nmanager of the amendment, is there any determination you can give me \nwhen we can vote on this or are we going to stack votes and vote all at \nonce?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are working out a unanimous consent agreement now. It \nis bouncing back and forth. Hopefully within a few minutes or so, we \nwill have that. I have a feeling these votes might be stacked. I can't \nsay right now. I have a feeling they will probably be stacked.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not object.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Iowa, \nif this is voted on, will this require a 60-vote threshold?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I asked my ranking member about that. He would insist on \n60 votes. I am not insisting on 60 votes. He informed me that it would \nrequire 60 votes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3851 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n (Purpose: To promote legal certainty, enhance competition, and reduce \nsystemic risk in markets for futures and over-the-counter derivatives, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Chambliss, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Levin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Crapo, \n     Mr. Conrad, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3851 to amendment No. 3500.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize for interrupting. We have been \nwaiting for a lull in the debate. I will send a cloture motion to the \ndesk.\n  I ask for the regular order with respect to amendment No. 3830.\n  While the staff is looking for the amendment, let me just say this is \na motion I will file for cloture in regard to the firefighters \namendment. We have tried almost all day to work out something. I \nthought we could work out something--side by sides, a couple of second-\ndegree amendments. We have been unable to do so. We had a suggestion \nfrom the Republicans that we would have a voice vote. That didn't work \nout. We had a suggestion that maybe what we should do is try to do a \nfreestanding bill at some later time. We were unable to get agreement \nto do that.\n  What we are going to have to do now, which is really too bad, is we \nare going to send this cloture motion to the desk. That will ripen 1 \nhour after we come in on Saturday. If Senators are willing to advance \nthe vote, we can do it tomorrow, of course. That not being the case, we \nhave no choice but to do it on Saturday. We have so many important \nthings to do. We can't be stepping on ourselves with 30 hours \npostcloture.\n  I have told everyone, as soon as we finish this vote on this \nfirefighting thing, we will have cloture on the bill. It doesn't matter \nwhat is pending, what is going on; we are going to have cloture on the \nbill. Then, when that is over, we have to have a vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the FISA legislation that has been reported by the \nIntelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee. We have to finish \nthat. The law expires on February 4 or 5. Senator Feingold and Senator \nDodd have indicated to me on more than one occasion that they will not \nlet us go to the bill without a 60-vote margin. So that is where we \nare. We need to get to that sometime early Monday to get through all \nthe other things we have to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, would the Chair please state what the \namendment is before the Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3851.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, that is the amendment I had sent to the \ndesk prior to the quorum call being established?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  This is basically an extension of the Commodity Exchange Act of 2013. \nI wish to state for the record we would not ordinarily include the \nCommodity Exchange Act in the farm bill, but for various reasons we \nwere unable to reauthorize the CEA in the last Congress.\n  This amendment further regulates energy transactions that perform a \nsignificant price discovery function. This is an issue Senators \nFeinstein and Levin have been working hard on.\n  The amendment also addresses fraud and retail transactions in foreign \nexchange markets. It gives the CFTC broader authority to prosecute \nfraud in other commodities such as heating oil. I am very pleased we \nare able to work through the reauthorization issues with the ranking \nmember, Senator Crapo, and numerous cosponsors of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman for this \nand thank Senator Feinstein, Senator Crapo, and Senator Levin. All of \nus have been working on this issue for literally 3 years now. This is \nthe culmination of an awful lot of sweat on the part of not only those \nindividuals but the industry as a whole. This is a huge day for the \nfutures industry. I thank the chairman.\n\n[[Page S15442]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Chambliss. It is a great effort, a great \nproduct.\n  I see one of the main architects of the provisions of this bill, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to indicate my full \nsupport for this. This effort actually began 6 years ago. Some of us \nwere here then, including Senator Cantwell who is here tonight, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Levin, Senator Snowe, Senator Conrad, when we began \nthis effort. It looks like opportunity and timing are once again coming \ntogether.\n  We have a bill that today has the general support of the Commodities \nFutures Trading Commission, the electronic exchange known as ICE, the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange known as NYMEX, the Chicago Mercantile, \nand the President's Working Group. This legislation, supported by \nmyself, Senator Levin, Senator Snowe, as well as Senator Cantwell--I \nhave a list here--Senator Conrad, obviously Senator Chambliss, and \nSenator Crapo would accomplish that. I would like to point out that \nunder Senator Levin's leadership and his Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which did an investigation into the absence of \noversight and transparency on some of these markets, became a guide for \nthis push and effort.\n  I would like to very briefly say what this legislation does. It \nincreases transparency in energy markets to deter traders from \nmanipulating the price of oil and natural gas futures traded on \nelectronic markets. Here is what it would do. First, it requires energy \ntraders to keep records for a minimum of 5 years so there is \ntransparency and an audit trail. Second, it requires electronic energy \ntraders to report trading in significant price discovery contracts to \nthe Commodities Futures Trading Commission so they would have the \ninformation to effectively oversee the energy futures market. \nManipulators could then be identified and punished by the CFTC, and in \nthe past there have been plenty of those. It cost the State of \nWashington--wounded them deeply--and it cost my State $40 billion in \nfraud and manipulation.\n  Third, the amendment gives the Commodities Futures Trading Commission \nnew authority to punish manipulation, fraud, and price distortion.\n  Fourth, it requires electronic trading platforms to actively monitor \ntheir markets to prevent manipulation and price distortion of contracts \nthat are significant in determining the price of the market.\n  These are the factors CFTC will consider in making that \ndetermination. The trading volume, whether significant volumes of a \ncommodity are traded on a daily basis. Price referencing, if the \ncontract is used by traders to help determine the price of subsequent \ncontracts. Price linkage, if the contract is equivalent to a NYMEX \ncontract and used the same way by traders.\n  For example, when Amaranth was directed to reduce their positions in \nregulated natural gas contracts, they simply moved their positions to \nthe unregulated electronic natural gas contracts. The bottom line: This \nrequirement would essentially say similar contracts on ICE and NYMEX \nwill be regulated the same way.\n  In October, the four CFTC Commissioners released a report \nunderscoring the critical need for increased oversight in U.S. energy \nmarkets. This bill includes what they asked for. We are very pleased. I \nam delighted the CFTC reauthorization is included in this package. Once \nagain, this is a bipartisan bill. I wish to thank my main cosponsors: \nSenator Levin, Senator Snowe, Senator Cantwell, Senator Conrad, and \nothers who have been very helpful in this area. I believe we can pass \nthis legislation, hopefully unanimously, tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maine wishes \nto speak for 3 minutes on this matter, and then I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized following her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nSenator from California for spearheading this initiative that is so \nessential and so critical, particularly at this time as we have seen \nexorbitant increases and historical in energy prices. I also wish to \nthank Chairman Harkin for his support and his leadership, as well as \nSenator Chambliss and Senator Crapo for their work on this essential \nissue and for their cooperation in working to help adopt this component \nas part of the pending farm bill.\n  Americans have lost confidence in our energy markets--particularly in \nthe futures market. I have heard from numerous constituents who have \nlong been skeptical about the price of gasoline and heating oil prices. \nParticularly in recent months, we have seen historical increases. Our \ntrucking industry has held numerous meetings across the State because \nof the rising price of diesel fuel to $3.73 a gallon. These savvy \nconsumers strongly suspect these prices are being manipulated. Frankly, \ntheir analysis is supported by a Senate subcommittee report, leading \neconomists, the GAO and most recently the CFTC.\n  How can a market fundamentally change to such a degree that prices \nare skyrocketing by 43 percent in less than a year? That question is \nomnipresent in American society today. It is being asked by Mainers who \nare struggling with heating bills, the industrial sector struggling \nwith electricity prices, and the transportation industry, which is \nconcerned about how long they can sustain these prices.\n  The answer is certainly complex, but it is becoming patently clear \nthat speculation in the unregulated exempt commodities market is \nexacerbating energy prices. Providing transparency to these dark \nmarkets is, bluntly, long overdue, and I ask my colleagues to support \nthis legislation which, as Senator Feinstein indicated, will provide \ntransparency and accountability to these exempt security markets.\n  On October 25, a coalition of more than 80 national, regional, and \nState organizations came together to form the Energy Market Oversight \nCoalition and wrote each Member of the Senate asking them to finally \nclose the Enron loophole. As the coalition stated in their letter to \nthe Senate: To restore public confidence, all energy markets must be \nfair, orderly, and transparent so the prices paid by consumers reflect \nthe true supply and demand.\n  In 2005, I requested a report from the Government Accountability \nOffice on the issue of futures market manipulation. That report \nreleased on October 24 outlined three fundamental components to a \nfunctional futures market. One is access to current information; \nsecondly, a large number of participants in the market; and third, \ntransparency. It is this last piece that is sorely lacking in our \nmarkets today.\n  The current system with respect to exempt commercial markets lacks \ntransparency and fails to provide an essential tenet to any futures \nmarket. Traders are able to avoid revelations of their identity within \nthese exempt commercial markets. In fact, based on one of the \ninvestigations that took place by a Senate subcommittee, they \ndiscovered the Amaranth hedge fund had excessively traded natural gas \ncontracts to such a degree that in 2006, it controlled 40 percent of \nall natural gas contracts in the New York Mercantile. One hedge fund \ncontrolled 40 percent of all the natural gas deliveries in the United \nStates. The positions were so substantial the company could \nunilaterally alter the prices for natural gas. The New York Mercantile, \nwhich is subject to the CFTC regulation, required Amaranth in August of \n2006 to reduce their holdings of natural gas contracts. Their response, \nthe hedge fund's response, was simply to move its dealings to the \nexempt commodity market, thereby defeating the entire purpose of the \nCFTC regulation and cloaking its potentially manipulative market power \nfor further regulation.\n  This is an unacceptable gap in the law, and that is why the \nlegislation we are presenting tonight will address that, because it is \nlong overdue. Even the CFTC reversed their decision and unanimously \nsupported including this oversight as part of their jurisdiction and \nresponsibility.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the primary \nsponsors of this amendment on achieving a hard-won compromise on an \nissue\n\n[[Page S15443]]\n\nthat has been intensely debated by Members of this body for a number of \nyears. As I understand the purpose of the amendment, it would \nessentially close what is come to be known as the ``Enron Loophole'' in \nthe Commodity Exchange Act, CEA.\n  This loophole in the law, included in the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act, CFMA, of 2000, has allowed large volumes of energy \nderivatives contracts to be traded over-the-counter, OTC, and on \nelectronic platforms, without the federal oversight necessary to \nprotect both the integrity of the market and our nation's energy \nconsumers.\n  Mr. President, my Committee--the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources--first heard testimony on this issue on January 29, \n2002. At that hearing, Mr. James Newsome, then the chairman of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, described the impacts of the CFMA \nthusly:\n\n       With respect to the energy markets, the CFMA exempts two \n     types of markets from much of the CFTC's oversight. Such \n     markets are described in Section 2(h) of the CEA, as amended \n     by the CFMA. The Act defines exempt commodities as, roughly \n     speaking, all commodities except agricultural and financial \n     products. This category, which for the most part represents \n     futures contracts based on metals and energy products may be \n     traded on the two types of markets covered by Section 2(h). \n     The first is bilateral, principal-to-principal trading \n     between two eligible contract participants . . . The second \n     is electronic multilateral trading among eligible commercial \n     entities, which include, among others, eligible contract \n     participants that can also demonstrate an ability to either \n     make or take delivery of the underlying commodity and dealers \n     that regularly provide hedging services to those with such \n     ability.\n\n  It is my understanding that the amendment before us would address the \ncurrent lack of regulatory authority governing the second category of \ntrading that Mr. Newsome described back in 2002. It would grant the \nCFTC new authority to impose important requirements on electronic, OTC \ntransactions that rely on the current exemption contained in Section \n2(h)(3) of the CEA, but serve a significant price discovery function. \nThese requirements include the implementation of market monitoring, the \nestablishment of position limitations or accountability levels, the \ndaily publication of trading information, and a number of other \nstandards key to restoring transparency to this important corner of our \nenergy markets.\n  Ensuring that proper oversight exists in these markets is of critical \nimportance to our nation's energy consumers, and to the efficient \noperation of the physical, or cash, energy markets that fall under the \npurview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--FERC--and my \ncommittee's jurisdiction. To illustrate why, I would like to once again \ngo back to the testimony we heard at our January 2002 hearing. As \ndescribed by Mr. Vincent Viola, the then-chairman of the NYMEX:\n\n       [In] the energy marketplace, there is a very substantial \n     interaction between NYMEX and the unregulated, physical and \n     over-the-counter energy markets. The interaction was clearly \n     apparent in the case of Enron.\n\n  Indeed, subsequent to that hearing, FERC, CFTC and the Department of \nJustice conducted investigations of the various aspects of what became \nperhaps one of the largest scandals in American corporate history. In \nits March 2003 ``Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western \nMarkets,'' the FERC staff reported the following:\n\n       FERC Staff obtained information indicating that Enron \n     traders potentially manipulated the price of natural gas at \n     the Henry Hub in Louisiana to profit from positions taken in \n     the over-the-counter--OTC--financial derivatives markets--OTC \n     markets. It is staff's opinion that Enron traders, through \n     transactions falling within the commission's jurisdiction and \n     authorized through a blanket certificate, successfully \n     manipulated the physical natural gas markets. The \n     manipulation yielded profits in the financial OTC markets.\n\n  It was findings like these that motivated a number of Members of my \nCommittee to work together to ensure FERC had the proper tools at its \ndisposal, to stamp out the kind of manipulation that occurred during \nthe Western energy crisis of 2000-2001. During consideration of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005, EPACT 2005, Public Law 109-58, I was pleased \nto work with Senators Cantwell, Feinstein and Wyden on these \nprovisions, along with Senator Domenici, who then chaired the Energy \nCommittee, and Senators Craig and Smith.\n  Indeed, sections 315 and 1283 of EPACT 2005 added anti-manipulation \nprovisions to both the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act, \nrespectively. Both make it unlawful for anyone to use ``any \nmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance . . . in contravention \nof'' the rules of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Both \nclosely track the language used in section 10(b) of the Securities and \nExchange Act and define ``any manipulative or deceptive device or \ncontrivance'' by reference to section 10(b). The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission issued a final rule implementing the two anti-\nmanipulation provisions in January 2006.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided FERC these much-needed, new \nauthorities in response to the Western energy crisis. However, it is \nalso clear that further regulatory authority is needed, to ensure the \nCFTC has the tools at its disposal to ensure the integrity of financial \nenergy markets. The present circumstance is one in which the CFTC has \nessentially been blind to a large portion of these markets for a number \nof years. This is of critical concern to me, and to my committee, \nbecause--as Mr. Viola observed in 2002, and as Enron demonstrated--all \nof these markets are linked.\n  In fact, there is also significant reason to believe that these \nmarkets have become more fully intertwined since that hearing 5 years \nago. In its 2006 State of the Markets Report, FERC devoted an entire \nsection, section 7, to the ``Growing Influence of Futures and Financial \nEnergy Markets'' on physical energy prices. The report notes that this \nimpact is particularly acute as it relates to natural gas prices--but \neffects electricity prices as well, to the extent that a growing \npercentage of our nation's electric generating capacity is gas-fired. \nThe FERC report details the link between prices set in the financial \nderivatives market, and the physical natural gas contracts that \nultimately dictate the prices paid by American consumers.\n  Overall, I believe the current situation was most recently and \naccurately described by FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher in December 12, \n2007, testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations \nof the House Committee on Energy and Commerce:\n\n       [It] is important to understand that price formation in \n     sophisticated energy markets has become increasingly complex. \n     Regulators must understand and consider the interplay between \n     financial and futures energy markets, on the one hand, and \n     physical energy markets, on the other hand. While FERC has \n     jurisdiction over physical wholesale gas sales, and the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has jurisdiction \n     over futures, the link between futures and physical markets \n     cannot be overstated. In a sense, these markets have \n     effectively converged. Manipulation does not recognize \n     jurisdictional boundaries and we must be vigilant in \n     monitoring the interplay of these markets if we are to \n     adequately protect consumers.\n\n  For these reasons, I support the amendment being offered today. It \nwould enhance the CFTC's authority to protect the integrity of \nfinancial energy markets, which in turn play an increasingly important \nprice discovery role in physical energy markets. And it would do so in \na manner that also preserves FERC's important role in guarding against \nmarket manipulation and protecting American natural gas and electricity \nconsumers. For that, I congratulate the sponsors. In addition, I will \nenter into a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, along with Senators Feinstein \nand Levin, regarding the intent of this amendment with respect to its \njurisdictional implications for FERC and the CFTC.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the past five years, I have been \nworking with my colleagues to close the Enron loophole that, since \n2000, has exempted electronic energy markets for large traders from \ngovernment oversight. This loophole opened the door to price \nmanipulation and excessive speculation, and American consumers have \nbeen paying the price ever since with sky-high prices for crude oil, \nnatural gas, gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, propane, and \nother energy commodities vital to a functioning U.S.\n\n[[Page S15444]]\n\neconomy. That is why I am pleased to stand before the Senate today in \nsupport of bipartisan legislation, sponsored by Senator Feinstein, \nmyself, Senator Snowe and others, that will close the Enron loophole \nand put the cop back on the beat in all U.S. energy markets in an \neffort to stop price manipulation and excessive speculation.\n  I would like to thank a number of my colleagues for not only making \nthis bipartisan legislation possible, but also agreeing to include it \nin the farm bill today. Senator Harkin, chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, played a key role in getting us together and encouraging \nus to resolve our differences. Senator Chambliss, the committee's \nranking republican, agreed to address the problems we identified and \nhelped work through our differences. Senator Feinstein of California \nprovided unending determination needed to get this problem solved. \nThere are many more who played a critical role in this legislation as \nwell, including Senator Bingaman, Senator Snowe, Senator Dorgan who \ncosponsored our original bill, S. 2058, the Close the Enron Loophole \nAct, and Senator Crapo who helped us produce a bipartisan product.\n  I thank not only the Senators, but also their staffs who put in many \nhours on this legislation, provided invaluable expertise, and \nrepeatedly came up with creative solutions to tough problems. I would \nlike to thank in particular Dan Berkovitz of my subcommittee staff who \nhas lived with this issue for the last 5 years and devoted so much \ntime, work, and expertise to it.\n  A stable and affordable supply of energy is, of course, vital to the \nnational and economic security of the United States. We need energy to \nheat and cool our homes and offices, to generate electricity for \nlighting, manufacturing, and vital services, and to power our \ntransportation sector--automobiles, trucks, boats, and airplanes.\n  Over 80 percent of our energy comes from fossil fuels--oil, natural \ngas, and coal. About 50 percent is from oil and natural gas. The U.S. \nconsumes around 20 million barrels of crude oil each day, over half of \nwhich is imported. About 90 percent of this oil is refined into \nproducts such as gasoline, home heating oil, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.\n  The crude oil market is the largest commodity market in the world, \nand hundreds of millions of barrels are traded daily in the various \ncrude oil futures, over-the-counter, and spot markets. The world's \nleading exchanges for crude oil futures contracts are the New York \nMercantile Exchange--NYMEX--and the Intercontinental Exchange, known as \nICE Futures in London.\n  Natural gas heats the majority of American homes, is used to harvest \ncrops, powers 20 percent of our electrical plants, and plays a critical \nrole in many industries, including manufacturers of fertilizers, \npaints, medicines, and chemicals. It is one of the cleanest fuels we \nhave, and we produce most of it ourselves with only 15 percent being \nimported, primarily from Canada. In 2005 alone, U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses spent about $200 billion on natural gas.\n  Today, only part of the natural gas futures market is regulated. \nNatural gas produced in the United States is traded on NYMEX and on an \nunregulated ICE electronic trading platform headquartered in Atlanta, \nGA. The price of natural gas in both the futures market and in the spot \nor physical market depends on the prices on both of these U.S. \nexchanges.\n  The ``Enron loophole'' is a provision that was inserted at the last \nminute, without opportunity for debate, into commodity legislation that \nwas attached to an omnibus appropriations bill and passed by Congress \nin late December 2000, in the waning hours of the 106th Congress. This \nloophole exempted from U.S. government oversight the electronic trading \nof energy commodities by large traders. The loophole has helped foster \nthe explosive growth of trading on unregulated electronic energy \nexchanges. It has also rendered U.S. energy markets more vulnerable to \nprice manipulation and excessive speculation, with resulting price \ndistortions.\n  Since 2001, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, has been examining the vulnerability of U.S. energy commodity \nmarkets to price manipulation and excessive speculation. Beginning in \n2002, we have held 6 days of hearings and issued 4 reports on issues \nrelated to inflated energy prices.\n  The subcommittee first documented some of the weaknesses in U.S. \ncrude oil markets in a 2003 staff report I released which found that \ncrude oil prices were\n\n     Affected by trading not only on regulated exchanges like the \n     NYMEX, but also on unregulated ``over-the-counter'' (OTC) \n     markets which have become major trading centers for energy \n     contracts and derivatives. The lack of information on prices \n     and large positions in these OTC markets makes it difficult \n     in many instances, if not impossible in practice, to \n     determine whether traders have manipulated crude oil prices.\n\n  In June 2006, the subcommittee issued a staff report entitled, ``The \nRole of Market Speculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put \nthe Cop Back on the Beat.'' This bipartisan staff report analyzed the \nextent to which the increasing amount of financial speculation in \nenergy markets had contributed to the steep rise in energy prices over \nthe past few years. The report concluded that: ``[s]peculation has \ncontributed to rising U.S. energy prices,'' and endorsed the estimate \nof various analysts that the influx of speculative investments into \ncrude oil futures accounted for approximately $20 of the then-\nprevailing crude oil price of approximately $70 per barrel.\n  The 2006 report recommended that the CFTC be provided with the same \nauthority to regulate and monitor electronic energy exchanges, such as \nICE, as it has with respect to the fully regulated futures markets, \nsuch as NYMEX, to ensure that excessive speculation in the energy \nmarkets did not adversely effect the availability and affordability of \nvital energy commodities through unwarranted price increases.\n  In June 2007, the subcommittee released another bipartisan report--\n``Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market.'' Our report found \nthat a single hedge fund named Amaranth had dominated the U.S. natural \ngas market during the spring and summer of 2006, and Amaranth's large-\nscale trading significantly distorted natural gas prices from their \nfundamental values based on supply and demand.\n  The report concluded that the current regulatory system was unable to \nprevent these distortions because much of Amaranth's trading took place \non an unregulated electronic market and recommended that Congress close \nthe ``Enron loophole'' that exempted such markets from regulation.\n  The report describes in detail how Amaranth used the major \nunregulated electronic market, ICE, to amass huge positions in natural \ngas contracts, outside regulatory scrutiny, and beyond any regulatory \nauthority. During the spring and summer of 2006, Amaranth held by far \nthe largest positions of any trader in the natural gas market. \nAccording to traders interviewed by the subcommittee, during this \nperiod natural gas prices for the following winter were ``clearly out \nof whack,'' at ``ridiculous levels,'' and unrelated to supply and \ndemand. At the subcommittee's hearing in June of this year, natural gas \npurchasers, such as the American Public Gas Association and the \nIndustrial Energy Consumers of America, explained how these price \ndistortions increased the cost of hedging for natural gas consumers, \nwhich ultimately led to increased costs for American industries and \nhouseholds. The Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia calculated that \nAmaranth's excesses increased the cost of their winter gas purchases by \n$18 million. Also at the hearing the New England Fuel Institute and the \nPetroleum Marketers Association of America made clear how rampant \nspeculation in energy trading harms the smaller businesses that trade \nin energy commodities.\n  Finally, when Amaranth's positions on the regulated futures market, \nNYMEX, became so large that NYMEX directed Amaranth to reduce the size \nof its positions on NYMEX, Amaranth simply switched those positions to \nICE, an unregulated market that is beyond the reach of the CFTC. In \nother words, in response to NYMEX's order, Amaranth did not reduce its \nsize; it merely moved it from a regulated market to an unregulated \nmarket.\n  This regulatory system makes no sense. It is as if a cop on the beat \ntells a liquor store owner that he must obey the law and stop selling \nliquor to minors, yet the store owner is allowed to move his store \nacross the street and\n\n[[Page S15445]]\n\nsell to whomever he wants because the cop has no jurisdiction on the \nother side of the street and none of the same laws apply. The Amaranth \ncase history shows it is clearly time to put the cop on the beat in all \nof our energy exchanges.\n  At the subcommittee's 2007 hearings, both of the major energy \nexchanges, NYMEX and ICE, testified that they would support a change in \nthe law to eliminate the current exemption from regulation for \nelectronic energy markets, in order to reduce the potential for \nmanipulation and excessive speculation. Consumers and users of natural \ngas and other energy commodities--the American Public Gas Association, \nthe New England Fuel Institute, the Petroleum Marketers Association of \nAmerica, and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America--also testified \nin favor of closing the Enron loophole. That testimony helped galvanize \nthe current effort to produce legislation in this area.\n  Just last week, my subcommittee teamed up with Senator Dorgan's \nSubcommittee on Energy to hold still another hearing examining how \nexcessive speculation is continuing to add to crude oil prices, harming \nconsumers and the American economy as a whole. During that hearing, \nSenators from both sides of the aisle expressed the need to develop new \ntools to address this problem.\n  The legislation being added to the farm bill today will do just that. \nIt will help fix a number of the problems identified in the \nsubcommittee's hearings and reports. Most importantly, it will put an \nend to the Enron-inspired exemption from government oversight now \nprovided to electronic energy trading markets set up for large traders. \nBy ending that exemption, this legislation will restore the ability of \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission--CFTC--to police all U.S. \nenergy exchanges to prevent price manipulation and excessive \nspeculation.\n  The legislation would do more than require CFTC oversight; it would \nalso require electronic exchanges, for the first time, to begin \npolicing their own trading operations and become self-regulatory \norganizations in the same manner as futures exchanges like NYMEX. \nSpecifically, the legislation would establish 5 ``core principles'' to \nwhich electronic exchanges must adhere, each of which parallels core \nprinciples already applicable to other CFTC-regulated exchanges and \nclearing facilities. Implementing these core principles would require \nan electronic exchange to monitor the trading of contracts which the \nCFTC has determined affect energy prices, ensure these contracts are \nnot susceptible to manipulation, require traders to supply information \nabout these contracts when necessary, supply large trader reports to \nthe CFTC related to these contracts, and publish daily trading data on \nthe price, trading volume, opening and closing ranges, and open \ninterest for these contracts.\n  In addition, the electronic exchanges would have to establish \nposition limits and accountability levels for individual traders buying \nor selling these contracts in order to prevent price manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. Electronic exchanges are intended to implement \nthese position limits and accountability levels in the same way as \nfutures exchanges like NYMEX. Moreover, it is intended that the CFTC \nwill take steps to ensure that the position limits and accountability \nlevels on all exchanges are comparable to prevent traders from playing \none exchange off another.\n  In implementing these core principles, electronic exchanges are given \nthe same flexibility accorded to other CFTC regulated entities, subject \nto CFTC approval. In addition, the legislation states explicitly that, \nwhen implementing the requirements for position limits, accountability \nlevels, and emergency authority to require reductions of positions, the \nelectronic exchanges are allowed to take into account differences \nbetween trades which are cleared and not cleared, and the CFTC would \npolice implementation of those core principles in an appropriate manner \nrecognizing those differences.\n  Although the legislation provides an electronic trading facility with \nflexibility to implement the core principles, in the same manner as \nfutures exchanges have with respect to the core principles applicable \nto them, and the flexibility to take into account the differences \nbetween cleared and uncleared trades in certain circumstances, in all \ninstances the CFTC has the ultimate responsibility and authority to \ninterpret the core principles, establish rules or guidance as to how \nthey should be applied, and determine whether a facility or exchange is \ncomplying with the core principles.\n  The legislation would also require electronic exchanges to establish \nprocedures to prevent conflicts of interest and anti-trust violations \nin their operations. These provisions parallel core principles already \napplicable to other CFTC-regulated exchanges and clearing facilities \nand are intended to function in a similar manner. These provisions are \nnot restricted to trades involving contracts that affect energy prices, \nbut apply to the entire exchange to ensure it operates in a fair \nmanner.\n  In addition to requiring electronic exchanges to become self-\nregulatory organizations, the legislation would require the CFTC to \noversee these exchanges in the same general way that it currently \noversees futures exchanges like NYMEX. The legislation also, however, \nassigns the CFTC a unique responsibility not present in its oversight \nof other types of exchanges and clearing facilities. The legislation \nwould require the CFTC to review the contracts on each electronic \nexchange to identify those which ``perform a significant price \ndiscovery function'' or, in other words, have a significant effect on \nenergy prices. The CFTC would make this determination by looking at \nsuch factors as whether the electronic exchange's contract is \nexplicitly linked to a contract used on a futures exchange; whether the \nelectronic exchange's contract price is used by traders to set prices \nin other contracts; whether traders take positions in the contract and \nuse those positions to arbitrage prices in other energy markets; and \nwhether the contract is traded in sufficient volume to affect market \nprices. The CFTC can also look at other factors to determine if a \ncontract is affecting energy prices. Contracts designated by the CFTC \nas performing a significant price discovery function are those that \nwould be policed by both the exchange and the CFTC.\n  The legislation directs the CFTC to conduct a rulemaking to implement \nthis requirement. The legislation also states clearly that a CFTC \ndetermination that a contract performs a significant price discovery \nfunction is a determination that is within the Commission's discretion; \nthis determination is not intended to be subject to formal challenge \nthrough administrative proceedings. The legislation would also require \nthe CFTC to review the contracts at an electronic exchange on at least \nan annual basis to determine which perform significant price discovery \nfunctions. This review is not intended to require the CFTC to conduct \nan exhaustive examination of every contract traded on an electronic \nexchange, but instead to concentrate on those contracts that are most \nlikely to meet the criteria for performing a significant price \ndiscovery function. The legislation also directs the electronic \nexchange to bring to the CFTC's attention any contract which it \nbelieves is affecting energy prices.\n  To enable the CFTC to conduct oversight of its operations, in \nparticular to prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation, \nelectronic exchanges are required to file large trader reports with the \nCFTC for trades involving contracts that perform a significant price \ndiscovery function. These are the same large trader reports already \nfiled by other CFTC-regulated exchanges and clearing facilities. In \naddition, electronic exchanges found to be trading contracts that \nperform a significant price discovery function are treated as a \n``registered entity'' under the Commodity Exchange Act. This \ndesignation ensures that the CFTC has the same enforcement authority \nover electronic exchanges as it has with respect to other exchanges and \nclearing facilities to ensure compliance with its regulatory and \nstatutory requirements.\n  One last issue. Another provision in the legislation states that its \nprovisions are not intended to limit or affect the jurisdiction of the \nCFTC or any other agency involved with protecting our markets from \nprice manipulation and excessive speculation. A legal battle is going \non in the courts right now over enforcement actions by the CFTC\n\n[[Page S15446]]\n\nand the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accusing Amaranth of \nmanipulating or attempting to manipulate natural gas prices. This \nlegislation is not intended to affect that court battle in any way. We \nare all waiting to see how it plays out and how the courts will \ninterpret the law. This legislation is intended to play an absolutely \nneutral role in those enforcement actions, and should not be \ninterpreted as changing the status quo in any way.\n  The provisions I have just discussed are the product of lengthy \nnegotiations and compromises over the best way to close the Enron \nloophole. They seek to provide stronger government oversight of U.S. \nenergy markets, while preserving the legitimate trading operations of \nelectronic exchanges like ICE. Senator Feinstein and I have introduced \na number of bills over the years to tackle this problem, each of which \ntook a somewhat different approach to strike the right balance. My \nlatest effort, introduced a few months ago with Senator Dorgan and \nothers, was S. 2058, the Close the Enron Loophole Act. While that bill \nis more comprehensive than the legislation being added to the farm bill \ntoday, the combined legislation before us now preserves our bill's \nintent and ensures that both the exchanges and the CFTC can enforce \nprohibitions against price manipulation and excessive speculation. \nThat, to me, is the most important aspect of the legislation and why I \nsupport it today.\n  The legislation reflects input from the CFTC, industry, consumer \ngroups, and a wide range of Senators. Some compromises were made, but \nagain, those compromises did not weaken the ability of the CFTC to \npolice out energy markets--in fact, if this legislation is enacted into \nlaw, the CFTC will be in a stronger position since 2000 to protect our \nmarkets from trading abuses.\n  The House is working on similar legislation, so I am hopeful that we \ncan get something enacted into law as part of the farm bill early next \nyear. I will be working to ensure that the enforcement provisions we \nhave worked so hard to include in this legislation are preserved.\n  In addition to these provisions closing the Enron loophole, the farm \nbill will include a host of other provisions to reauthorize and \nstrengthen the Commodity Exchange Act. Those provisions include \nstronger civil and criminal penalties for manipulation, better \nenforcement authority for currency exchange trading abuses, among \nothers, all of which I support. I thank my colleagues for including \nthem in the farm bill as well.\n  Preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation in U.S. \nenergy markets is not an easy undertaking. I thank my colleagues, \nindustry, consumers and others for their good-faith suggestions to \nimprove the legislation that is now before the Senate. Recent cases \nhave shown that market abuses and failures did not stop with the fall \nof Enron. They are still with us. We cannot afford to let the current \nsituation continue, allowing energy traders to use unregulated markets \nto avoid regulated markets. It is time to put the cop back on the beat \nin all U.S. energy markets. The stakes for our energy security and for \ncompetition in the market place are too high to do otherwise.\n\n\n                  Intent of the Commodity Exchange Act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the primary sponsors of this \namendment, as well as the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, share my desire for the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, FERC, and Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, CFTC, to coordinate seamlessly in their efforts to oversee \nthe increasingly interdependent energy markets under their respective \njurisdictions. Moreover, it is important to clarify that nothing \nincluded in this amendment would interfere or prejudice the respective \nCommissions' ongoing, enforcement-related proceedings and litigation.\n  I would like to inquire of the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Harkin, do you concur in my assessment that nothing in this \namendment would prejudice or interfere with ongoing, energy market \nenforcement-related litigation or administrative proceedings currently \ninvolving FERC and the CFTC?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I agree with the assessment of the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Likewise, I believe we have taken pains in this \namendment to ensure that the current jurisdictional boundaries between \nthe two Commissions are maintained, with respect to the authorities of \nFERC under the Federal Power and Natural Gas Acts, and the CFTC under \nthe Commodity Exchange Act. How do you view this matter?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I concur with the Senator from New Mexico. Nothing \nin this amendment would erode either Commission's authorities under the \nstatutes that you have cited.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Finally, I ask if, in your view, anything contained in \nthis amendment would limit FERC's existing ability to gain information \nfrom market participants?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, this amendment would not infringe on FERC's current \nability to gain information from market participants.\n  Mr. BINGMAN. Thank you. I would like to now ask a few questions of \nthe senior senator from California, Senator Feinstein, one of the \nprimary authors of this amendment, as well as one of the coauthors of \nsections 315 and 1283 in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58), \nwhich gave FERC additional antimanipulation authorities under the \nFederal Power and Natural Gas Acts. In your view, does anything \ncontained in this amendment undermine or alter those authorities?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. In my view, nothing contained in this amendment \nwould or is intended to undermine or alter those important, new \nauthorities. We have sought to make this clear, with the inclusion in \nsection 13203 of paragraph (c)(2), which preserves FERC's existing \nauthorities.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would also like to make an inquiry of the senior \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin, another primary author of the \namendment now before the Senate. As I understand this amendment, it \nexpands the CFTC's authorities with respect to the requirements it may \nimpose on transactions it deems ``significant price discovery \ncontracts.'' This ``significant price discovery contract'' \ndetermination may be applied to contracts, agreements, and transactions \nthat are conducted in reliance on the exemption included in section \n2(h)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act. As a conforming matter, \nparagraph (c)(1) of section 13203 extends the CFTC's exclusive \njurisdiction over these ``significant price discovery contracts.''\n  As the Senator from Michigan knows, the meaning and expanse of CFTC's \nexclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of futures markets is \ncurrently the subject of litigation. As we have heard from the chairman \nof the Agriculture Committee and Senator Feinstein, another one of the \namendment's authors, this amendment was written to ensure it would not \ninterfere with any such ongoing litigation; and further, to maintain \nthe current jurisdictional division between FERC and the CFTC. I am \nsatisfied with those assurances.\n  But in addition, as a forward-looking matter, it is important to \nclarify the intent of the amendment with respect to this new class of \n``significant price discovery contracts.'' I am aware of the fact that \ncertain electronic trading facilities that currently operate under the \nexemption included in section 2(h)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act for \npurposes of trading energy swaps also trade physical--or cash--\ncontracts in electricity and natural gas. For oversight and enforcement \npurposes, it is crucial that FERC retain its jurisdiction over these \nphysical energy transactions. In your view, how would the amendment \nimpact FERC's jurisdiction over these transactions?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from New Mexico raises an interesting and \nimportant question, on which I have conferred with the CFTC. In \naddition to the savings clause in section 13203(c)(2) that preserves \nFERC's jurisdiction under its statutes as a threshold matter, I believe \nthat FERC's jurisdiction over these transactions would, in any event, \nbe preserved. It is my view that the kinds of cash transactions that \nyou cite would not be captured within the amendment's ``significant \nprice discovery contract'' test. The test is reserved for those \ntransactions conducted ``in reliance'' on the exemption\n\n[[Page S15447]]\n\nin paragraph 2(h)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act. Because the CEA \ndoes not apply to cash transactions for purposes of regulation, these \ntransactions cannot, by definition, be conducted ``in reliance'' on \nthis exemption. As such, FERC's authority in this area is preserved on \nall accounts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have a similar question as it relates to the status \nand functions of regional transmission organizations, RTOs, under this \nlanguage. RTOs often deal in the auction of financial transmission \nrights and ancillary services associated with the orderly operation of \nelectricity markets. Do you believe this ``significant price discovery \ncontract'' provision would impact FERC's authority in this area?\n  Mr. LEVIN. For many of the same reasons I have cited in relation to \nnatural gas markets, I believe--and it is certainly my intention, as \none of the amendment's authors--that FERC's authority over RTOs would \nbe unaffected. To my knowledge, no RTO operates pursuant to the \nexemption in paragraph 2(h)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act. Moreover, \nthe savings clause in section 13203(c)(2) makes abundantly clear that \nFERC's existing authorities are preserved.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators for their assurances in this \nregard, and congratulate them on their amendment.\n\n\n                         rolling spot contracts\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This bill includes reauthorization of the Commodity \nExchange Act. One of the issues addressed in the reauthorization is the \nproblem of so-called ``rolling spot'' contracts, a type of contract \nthat unscrupulous criminals use to defraud retail customers while \navoiding the jurisdiction of the Commission. Because of several adverse \ncourt decisions addressing rolling spot contracts used in retail \nforeign exchange fraud, the Commission has been severely hampered in \nits efforts to protect consumers.\n  This reauthorization clarifies the jurisdiction of the Commission \nover these ``rolling spot'' contracts. In addition, because these \n``rolling spot'' contracts have begun to be used in other commodities \nsuch as metals, this reauthorization clarifies the Commission's \nauthority to address ``rolling spot'' contracts should they spread to \nother agricultural or exempt commodities.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the gentleman yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it the intent of the provision to imply or provide \nthat agricultural or exempt futures contracts that are not currently \nlegal futures contracts, are somehow legal because of these new \nprovisions?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. The provisions explicitly say that they have no \neffect on whether contracts are considered legal futures contracts or \nnot.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is with some consternation that I rise \nthis evening. We have an amendment that is very important to working \nmen and women in this country. Basically, what it allows is \nfirefighters and police to organize collectively. It is very important \nthat they have that opportunity. That is the legislation before this \nbody, the amendment dealing with firefighters.\n  The pleasant thing about this amendment is that it is bipartisan. We \nhave 64 Senators who would have voted for this amendment. We have tried \nvery hard. Everybody knows that I have four Democratic Senators running \nfor President. They are all wonderful, good legislators, and wonderful \nhuman beings. One of them is going to be President of the United \nStates, more than likely, next year. But we have tried all day to get a \nvote. As I indicated a little while ago, we will take a 60-vote margin, \na side-by-side or a second-degree amendment, a freestanding bill or \nwhatever other variation I can think of.\n  My friends are very good--the opponents of this legislation. There \nare not a lot of them, but there are a few. They know the rules, and \nthey know how difficult it is when we are less than 3 weeks before the \nfirst primary, the caucus in Iowa, to get these four Senators here. \nThey were here this morning. There were two important bills, one on \nenergy and one on a farm issue. They were scheduled to come back here. \nOne of them is on a plane coming back here for a morning vote. The word \ngot out that we needed them here. So there has been this stalling. We \nhave no alternative but to come back and fight another day. I say to \nall Senators that this is a bipartisan bill.\n  I see my friend on the floor, Judd Gregg. We would not be where we \nare tonight but for him. It is true. I mean, it is not often that on a \nlabor issue you have someone of his stature on the other side of the \naisle supporting this legislation. But I respect those few Senators who \nobject to this. They have the legal rights and procedural rights that \nthey do, and getting my Presidentials back here on Saturday would be \nhard. We know it is a difficult time for everybody on a Saturday.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3830, withdrawn\n\n  Without belaboring the issue, I ask unanimous consent to now withdraw \namendment No. 3830.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject, but I want to, first of all, thank our majority leader for his \ncomments. Just before the request is agreed to, I want to remind the \nMembers of the Senate that private workers have the opportunity under \nthe labor laws to get the kinds of protections and rights we are \ntalking about; public workers do not. The public workers, who have been \non the front lines of so many of the challenges we are facing in our \nsociety, deserve these rights.\n  Public safety workers put their lives on the line every day they go \nto work. They are on the frontlines of our effort to keep America safe.\n  We ask much from them. When the California wildfires threatened lives \nand property, we asked that they battle those blazes. When natural \ndisasters strike, we expect them to be the first on the scene. And on \nSeptember 11th, they were the heroes that restored our hope.\n  These heroic men and women have earned our thanks and respect. All \nthey asked of this body was the right to enjoy the same basic rights \nthat private sector workers enjoy. The right to have a voice at the \ntable when decisions are made that are critical to their safety and \ntheir livelihood.\n  The bipartisan amendment that we offered would have guaranteed every \nfirst responder the right to collective bargaining. Many of our first \nresponders already have this fundamental right. This amendment would \nhave provided these basic rights for those who don't and it would have \ndone so in a reasonable manner. For States that currently accord public \nsafety officers these rights, the amendment would have no affect. For \nStates that don't currently provide these rights, the amendment would \nnot trample on their rights. They would have ample opportunity to \nestablish their own collective bargaining systems, or ask the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority for help. The choice would belong to the \nstate.\n  The public safety officers came to us with a modest request. Tonight, \na minority of the Senate said no to their request. Despite the broad \nbipartisan support we had for this amendment, we could not get past the \nobstructions of those who were determined to deny our Nation's first \nresponders their basic rights.\n  This fight is not over. I pledge to our Nation's brave firefighters, \npolice officers, and emergency medical technicians, that we will bring \nthis legislation back to the Senate again and again until the Senate \nsays ``yes'' to them. Each day they face hazards that put their lives \nat risk, and as we enjoy the security that their sacrifice provides, \nthey should know that they have allies in the Senate that will keep \nfighting for them.\n  While we may not have succeeded today, we will bring this legislation \nback to the floor of the U.S. Senate soon and we will pass it.\n  Our public safety officers deserve no less.\n  I thank the leader for all of his strong support for this \nlegislation, and I indicate that I, for one--and there are many \nothers--will come back and revisit this issue at an early time. So I \ndon't object to the request, but I do want to state that this issue is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S15448]]\n\nbe front and center before the Senate in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, the amendment \nis withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3851\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Feinstein \namendment is ready to be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3851) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add onto that \namendment Senators Dorgan, Durbin, and Conrad as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair, under the order now before the Senate--\n  Mr. SANDERS. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I haven't said anything yet. Mr. President, I ask that the \nChair inform the Senator from Nevada if I am right, that under a \npreviously entered order I have a right, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, to ask that there be cloture right now or whatever \ntime I choose?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the substitute amendment to the bill, \nthat is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So, Mr. President, under the order that is before the \nSenate, we are going to have a cloture vote on the farm bill after \nweeks and weeks. Now, I understand there are people who are \ndisappointed. We still have a significant number of amendments. After \nadding up those that have been objected to, there are 15 by one \nSenator. So we have 15 plus 11--a lot of amendments.\n  The time has come that we stop this. We need the farm bill. We need \nto get a conference. I believe, after conversations I have had with the \nRepublican leader, that this is a bill we can go to conference on. So \nthe time is here. We don't have time for 26 more amendments.\n  We had a briefing in S-407 today. I don't know how people are going \nto vote on domestic surveillance and other types of surveillance, but \nit is an important issue that we have an obligation as Senators to \nresolve. We had the head of the national intelligence agency there, \nJudge Mukasey. We have to do that. I am going to move to that bill \ntomorrow.\n  As I have stated on the floor, Senator Feingold and Senator Dodd are \nnot going to let us move to that. I have filed cloture on that bill. I \nknow people are disappointed, but we have no alternative. I guess there \nis an alternative, but I don't think people want to be around here in \nthe middle of next week to finish the farm bill. We will have cloture \non it tonight and, as far as I am concerned, we can have final passage \nas soon as we finish the cloture vote.\n  For all Senators, the cloture vote will take place at 9 o'clock \ntonight on the farm bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about an event \nthat happened earlier this evening, and that is the passage of the \nEnergy bill with a great bipartisan vote in the Senate.\n  In my view, this is the signature agenda of the 21st century. I am \nvery proud of the work that went into fashioning that bill by the \nEnergy Committee, the Commerce Committee, as well as a package we \nattempted to get in there by the Finance Committee.\n  At the end of the day, this package which moves on to the House and \nthen to the President for his signature will do some historic things \nfor the clean energy economy for America.\n  The first thing it will do is make sure CAFE standards are up to \nwhere they should have been a long time ago, with much more highly \nefficient vehicles in our country as our national fleet will be in a \nposition to have the kind of oil savings that will lead us to energy \nindependence and help get rid of the addiction on foreign oil that \ncurrently compromises the foreign policy of the United States.\n  Second, we will start addressing the issue of global warming by \nmaking sure we look at a national carbon assessment, the sequestration \nprogram that will help us capture and store carbon as part of the \nremedy to deal with the problem of global warming.\n  Finally, moving forward with renewable fuels, many of us recognize it \nis rural America that is going to help us grow our way to energy \nindependence, and the 25-25 resolution that is included in the energy \nlegislation sets out a national vision for us to get to 25 percent of \nour energy coming from renewable energy resources.\n  I know there were many people who worked on this legislation. I thank \nand commend all of those who were involved in putting it together. On \nmy staff, in particular: Steve Black, who had been very involved in the \ncrafting of the 2005 Energy Policy Act; Suzanne Wells, who has been a \nfellow in my office and worked on this issue for almost as long as \nSteve Black; Ben Brown, a new fellow in my office; Tracy Ross, a young \nemployee in my office who was part of this energy team, along with \nBrendan McGuire, Grant Leslie--a whole host of others--Jeff Lane in my \noffice also was involved.\n  I also thank the staff of the committees because I know the staff \nmembers of both the Energy and Commerce Committees worked day and night \nto get us a good energy package.\n  I would be remiss if I did not say something about Russ Sullivan and \nthe great staff of the Finance Committee, headed by our chair, Max \nBaucus. The Finance Committee functions completely on every cylinder \nand is a stellar committee, a group of staff members that makes us very \nproud and serves as a role model for the rest of the committees in the \nSenate.\n  It is a historic night for us with the passage of the energy \nlegislation.\n  As we move closer toward the passage of the 2007 farm bill, I also \ncommend all of my colleagues who have worked so hard in trying to get \nus to a procedural way forward to get us to the completion of this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on the practical \nimplications of what we are about to do. I appreciate the positions the \nleaders of the bill are in. They worked hard to get this bill through.\n  Obviously, I don't support the bill, but I feel they have every right \nto finish it. They have the votes to pass it, and there is no reason \nthere should be dilatory delays. But there are three major events that \nare going to be impacted by this exercise.\n  The first is an amendment which I had pending which would have given \npeople relief when their homes are foreclosed on so they would not get \nhit with a tax bill. It appears that amendment, on which there was \ngeneral consensus, will not be brought up and voted on. That is \nunfortunate. I hope we can come to this from another angle.\n  I spoke with the chairman of the Finance Committee. He and the \nFinance Committee members are trying to find some way to accomplish \nthat. I think it is wrong, when people have their home foreclosed, that \nthey have the IRS follow them to wherever they are going, the apartment \nthey have to move to, to hit them with a tax bill for that foreclosure.\n  The second issue is a proposal I had--the Senator in the chair also \nhad a proposal on this issue--which was to get some funds in LIHEAP. \nAll of us who live in the colder regions of this country have seen our \noil bills go up dramatically. There is a lot of pressure on low-income \npeople, and the LIHEAP\n\n[[Page S15449]]\n\nfunds, which help low-income people deal with that pressure, are simply \nnot going to be adequate. They are just not going to be adequate.\n  The Senator from Vermont had an amendment in this area. I had an \namendment in this area. Unfortunately, they both will fall.\n  The third issue is the firefighters, fully explained by Senator Reid, \nthe majority leader. I appreciate his kind words relative to my efforts \nin this area. I am sorry we will not be able to accomplish this effort \nat this time. This is an important issue. I do hope we will come back \nto it. I know it is high on the list of the majority leader and also \nhigh on my list.\n  I regret the procedure that has to take place. Obviously, it is the \nprerogative of the leadership to do this. I can understand why they are \ndoing it. They have been on the bill a number of weeks. The first \ncouple of weeks we could not offer amendments. That was not our fault. \nAs a practical matter, this session is coming to a close, and they want \nto wrap up the bill. And as a practical matter, the bill should be \nwrapped up.\n  I regret some of these amendments that I think are very important to \nAmericans, especially those in cold climates having to deal with \nheating bills and those who have had homes foreclosed, and Americans \nwho protect us through fighting fires, those amendments will not be \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to thank the leadership for taking \nthis bull by the horns and dealing with a circumstance that changed \nrather dramatically in the last several hours.\n  I know there are colleagues who are disappointed that they are not \ngoing to be able to offer amendments that are unrelated to the farm \nbill to this legislation. But if you put yourself in the position of \nthe leadership, they were faced with an impossible situation, a \nsituation that was made more difficult by the way events unfolded.\n  We had 20 amendments on a side that were in order, 40 amendments in \ntotal. That could include amendments that were related to the farm bill \nas well as those unrelated. Amendments were filed. Not all 40 had been \nfiled. There were still, I believe, at least eight slots. So when the \nleadership looked at the time--and the fact is, here we are, almost 9 \no'clock on Thursday night--and they looked at the other business that \nhas to be done, it didn't fit together.\n  We could be in a circumstance in which things that must be done for \nus to conclude business for the year could not be concluded because it \nwould take unanimous consent to go off the farm bill now that we are on \nit. Anybody could object. So they had to find a way to reach \nconclusion. The rules of the Senate required this circumstance. I know \nthere is disappointment, but our leaders face a very difficult set of \nchoices, and if they wanted to get the business of the Congress done \nthis year by next Friday, they had no alternative but to do what the \nleaders collectively decided to do tonight.\n  I know there is disappointment, but there was no choice, if the \nbusiness of the Senate was to get concluded.\n  I salute the leadership. I thank Senator Reid for his strong \nleadership. I thank Senator McConnell. I especially thank the bill \nmanagers, Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, who have worked \ntirelessly to get this bill done and under extremely difficult \ncircumstances where they have had the bill interrupted every few hours \nto handle other legislation, and we have Presidential candidates on \nboth sides who are not here. So these managers are told: You can't vote \nnow, you can't vote then, you have an event here, you have an event \nthere. They were put in an absolutely unbelievably difficult situation, \nand they have handled it with grace. We should thank them for how well \nthey have done to clear amendments. But they had no choice if this work \nwas to get done.\n  So thanks to the leaders. I know there are people who are upset, but \nI say thanks to the leaders.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments, and \nI thank him for all his help throughout a long year in the Agriculture \nCommittee, helping us with our budget problems and getting us to this \npoint.\n  I appreciated the fact that the Senator said the managers had handled \nthis bill with grace. The Senator doesn't see what I do when I go home. \nI act out my frustrations later.\n  I say to the Senator, it has been frustrating, but that is the \nprocess of the Senate. The Senator is absolutely right, our leader is \ncorrect in calling for cloture. I am not disappointed. I am managing \nthe bill under the rules we had, which was to try to accommodate as \nmany amendments as possible, to move them as rapidly as possible, to \nget votes on them. Let's face it, we have had enough, and we have had \nenough amendments and we debated them.\n  This is a good bill. Some of the amendments that were not adopted \nmaybe I wish were, and some that were adopted maybe I wish were not. \nThat is the process. It is a good bill with which to go to conference. \nIt is a bill that does a lot, as the Senator knows, in energy, it does \na lot in conservation, and it provides a great safety net for our \nfarmers, and what we do for specialty crops that we have never done \nbefore in any farm bill, and what we do for nutrition. We answer the \ncall of church groups and people around the country who said we had to \ndo more to take care of low-income people in the Nation and to meet our \nobligations to the poorest among our society. We have done that in this \nbill. We have done great work in the food stamp and nutrition programs.\n  It is a good bill. All of us worked very hard on it. We will go to \ncloture this evening. Quite frankly, I am not disappointed. I am happy \nwe are bringing this to a close so we can get to conference. I hope we \ncan get the conference concluded by the time we get back in January so \nwe can have a conference report sometime toward the end of January.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his many kindnesses, for \nall of the hard work he has done, and his staff through this long \nprocess in getting us here. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his vision and \nhis leadership. This is a bill of which we can all be proud. This is a \nbill that strengthens the safety net. This is a bill that increases \nresources for conservation by $4 billion. This increases the resources \nover the so-called base line for nutrition by $5 billion. This \nincreases the resources for speciality crops by $2.5 billion, an \nunprecedented commitment of resources for that purpose. This is a bill \nthat has permanent disaster assistance. This is a bill that is paid for \nand paid for honestly. This is a bill that does not add a dime to the \ndeficit or the debt. It deserves our vote for cloture tonight.\n  All of those who are concerned about farm and ranch families, this is \ntheir opportunity to demonstrate that support and that concern by \nsupporting cloture on this bill.\n  I especially thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Harkin, the \nranking member, Senator Chambliss, and again the strong leadership of \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid, for bringing cloture before the body \ntonight. This bill needed to end for the Senate to conclude its \nbusiness for the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is time for the vote to take place in a \nminute or two. I inform all Members that we will have this cloture vote \ntonight, and then we are under the rules that there will be 30 hours \nfollowing completion of that vote. It is my intention, and I think \neveryone's intention here, to finish this bill and not have it spill \ninto Saturday. We are going to deal with germane amendments pursuant to \nthe rules of the Senate. The managers will work on those during the \nevening and hopefully early tomorrow we can finish this bill.\n  Remember, tomorrow we have to finish FHA modernization, and we have \nto finish the Defense authorization bill. We have a limited time \nagreement on both of those, an hour each at this time. There may be \nother issues we are going to try to do. At least that is what we need \nto do.\n  Also, as I indicated, before we close business tomorrow, we are going \nto file cloture on the FISA legislation.\n\n[[Page S15450]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I, too, wish to urge my colleagues to vote \nfor cloture this evening on the farm bill. This is bringing a long \ndebate to its finality and to a close that is good for American \nagriculture.\n  Actually, the American people today are going to get an energy bill \nto promote renewable energy, and they are going to get a farm bill that \nstrengthens the safety net and makes a strong commitment to \nconservation. Many of the programs funded in this bill do an awful lot \nto support conservation across this country. In many respects, the \nconservation title of the farm bill, I would argue, is probably one of \nthe best environmental stewardship policies we have put in place in the \nCongress.\n  It also adds an energy policy that will complement what was done \ntoday in the Energy bill--the renewable fuels standard--which will \nincrease the amount of renewable energy that will be used in this \ncountry. In order to reach that standard, we are going to have to use \nmore and more cellulosic ethanol, which is the next generation of \nbiofuels in this country, and the farm bill has in its energy title \nsome incentives for energy-dedicated crops that can be used in the \nproduction of cellulosic ethanol.\n  I think this energy policy and the energy title, the conservation \ntitle, the commodity title of this bill, and many of the other \nprovisions are good for American agriculture. It has been a long \nbattle, and we still have a long ways ahead of us. We have to go to \nconference with the House and get a bill the President will sign, but \nthis will help move this process forward, and it is high time we got an \nopportunity to push to a final vote and final passage.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture this evening.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Harkin \n     substitute amendment No. 3500 to H.R. 2419, the farm bill.\n         Tom Harkin, Russell D.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 3500, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, to \nH.R. 2419, farm bill, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from New York \n(Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

On this vote, the yeas are 78, the nays are \n12. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now operating postcloture on the \nfarm bill. As we know, there are 30 hours. And germane amendments are \nobviously acceptable postcloture.\n  Right now I am working with Senator Chambliss to try to come up with \na roadmap on how we proceed on this yet this evening and tomorrow. We \nhad basically a kind of a finite list. Since there were only 20 \namendments allowed on either side, we kind of know what that universe \nis.\n  Prior to the cloture vote, we were down to about 11--if the Chair \nwill indulge me, 11 votes that could be held. Now some of those, it is \njust my own observation, without being the Parliamentarian, are \nnongermane.\n  For example, one of my own amendments I can truthfully say is not \ngermane. The others I do not know, and those will have to be decided by \nthe Parliamentarian. I would say, however, if there is anyone here who \nhas a germane amendment--and I do believe perhaps the Feingold-Menendez \namendment appears to be fully germane.\n  Now, again, there may be an objection raised to that, and the \nParliamentarian will have to decide it, but that seems to me--that \nseems to be one in front of us now that is germane. I would say if the \nauthors of that amendment, either Mr. Feingold or Mr. Menendez, were \nwilling to debate that amendment this evening, under some reasonable \ntime limit, we would like to do that.\n  So I hope that is at least one we might get to tonight that looks to \nbe thoroughly germane to the bill. There is the Grassley-Kohl \namendment. I am not certain about that one. That one is maybe a little \nbit more uncertain. But, again, that is up to the Parliamentarian to \ndecide. But at least that decision could be made, and we might be able \nto move ahead.\n  So with the concurrence of my ranking member----\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I believe the Coburn amendment is also germane.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right. The Coburn amendment is probably germane.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the Chair would agree, I think we probably ought to \nmaybe go into a quorum call and let the Parliamentarian decide what is \ngermane and what is not. If we find one that is germane, let's go ahead \nwith that one while they are making a decision on the rest of them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree. The only reason I was saying this is, keep in \nmind there is a limited amount of time. So I am saying, anyone who \nbelieves they have a germane amendment in this list, they ought to \nprobably want to debate it tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3736 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Wyden amendment No. 3736 \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     CALIFORNIA'S SUGAR ALLOCATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin for joining me to \ndiscuss the important issue of California's sugar allocation. I \nappreciate his leadership in bringing a farm bill forward for the \nSenate's consideration.\n\n[[Page S15451]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. It is my understanding that she \nwould like to speak about an issue facing the sugar beet industry in \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. The sugar marketing allocation formula \nin the 2002 farm bill took 2.5 percent of the total national allocation \naway from California because of the closure of sugar refineries in \nWoodland, CA, and Tracy, CA, between 1998 and 2000.\n  Since that time, there have been numerous other closures, including \nBayrd, NE; Greeley, CO; Moses Lake, WA; Carrollton, MI; Nyssa, OR; and \nHereford, TX. However, under the current farm bill structure, only \nCalifornia was penalized by downward allocation adjustments due to \nrefinery closures. Refinery closures in California fell within an \narbitrary base period in the 2002 farm bill that penalized States that \nhad refinery closures by reducing their allocation. The six other \nStates that have seen refineries close since the arbitrary period ended \nhave not had any allocation taken away.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator, how has this decrease in California's \nportion of the national allocation impacted growers and other sugar \nbeet refineries in your State?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sugar beets are an important crop for many growers \nthroughout California's San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys. Growers in \nCalifornia want to keep producing sugar beets, but processing \nrefineries in California are in danger of closing if they do not \nrecover the marketing allocation they lost in the last farm bill.\n  If the allocation formula is not corrected to provide California with \nits fair share, the entire sugar beet industry in my State, with the \nhundreds of jobs it supports, will be in serious jeopardy.\n  California's sugar beet industry is an important contributor to the \neconomies of the rural communities where they are located. The city of \nMendota, located in western Fresno County, has one of the highest \nunemployment rates in the State, a problem that will certainly be \nexacerbated by the possible closure of the refinery. The Mendota \nfacility employs 300 full-time workers and as many as 500 to 600 \nworkers when running at full capacity.\n  The importance of the refinery to the local economy becomes clearer \nwhen you consider that according to the city's estimate there are 1,767 \njobs available in Mendota. At full capacity the refinery accounts for \nmore than one-third of the city's employment base.\n  The farm gate value of sugar beets in California is approximately \n$66.7 million, and when sugar and the value of its byproducts are \nincluded, sugar beets in California contribute $130.8 million annually \nto the California economy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much more in allocation would California need to keep \nthe facility in Mendota open?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My growers have assured me that if the allocation is \nthere, they will be able to grow the sugar beets necessary to meet the \nneed. They have told me that under the 2002 farm bill, they lost \n133,750 tons raw value in allocation and would need near that amount to \nkeep the Mendota refinery open.\n  Senator Harkin, as much as 74,900 tons raw value in allocation is \nbeing reassigned this year from sugar cane growers, and another 6,800 \ntons raw value in allocation is being reassigned from growers in Puerto \nRico.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator providing that information. Can \nshe suggest a possible solution that would allow the Mendota refinery \nto remain open?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My growers tell me that they would be willing to purchase \nthe plant from the Southern Minnesota Company. Southern Minnesota would \ninclude 64,200 tons raw value of sugar allotment in selling the plant \nto California sugar beet growers. With a guarantee that Congress would \nprovide 53,500 tons raw value in additional sugar allotment for \nCalifornia equaling a total allocation of approximately 117,000 tons \nraw value, the purchase of the Mendota refinery by California's sugar \nbeet growers would be economically viable.\n  Since it will take approximately 53,500 tons raw value in additional \nsugar allotment in California to keep the Mendota refinery in \noperation, and 81,700 tons raw value is being reassigned from sugarcane \ngrowers this year, perhaps it would be possible to assign the necessary \namount of excess sugarcane allocation to California in order to keep \nthe Mendota refinery operating.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will raise this issue when the Senate and House meet to \nfinalize a farm bill conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the amendment that \nSenator Harkin and I offered to make some modifications to the \nbioenergy crop transition program in the committee bill. First, \nhowever, I want to thank the Republican manager of the bill, Senator \nChambliss, and his staff for working with me and my staff, and with \nSenator Harkin and his staff to address this issue.\n  As I said the other evening, we are importing $1 billion worth of oil \na day from other countries. Bioenergy crops provide a real opportunity \nto spend that money here at home and help our farmers and rural \ncommunities in the process.\n  The bill that was reported by the Agriculture Committee proposed a \nprogram to help make this a reality by making payments to farmers to \ntransition to these new energy crops. This was a good idea, but Senator \nHarkin and I were concerned that the program would lead to unintended \nconsequences. We have now reached agreement on a managers' amendment \nthat goes a very long way toward addressing our concerns.\n  The agreement that we have reached improves the program in ways that \nwill protect the environment and make it a more cost-effective program.\n  The program will now include eligibility criteria for bioenergy crops \nto ensure that crops that are invasive species or could become invasive \nspecies are not eligible for the program.\n  The program will now ensure that only lands that have already been \nfarmed are eligible and that we are not promoting the conversion of \nnative grasslands or forests to production of bioenergy crops.\n  The program will now have a formal application and selection process \nso that we can be sure that the limited amount of funds available is \nspent in the most productive way.\n  In deciding how these transition assistance payments are made, the \nSecretary of Agriculture will now have to consider the likelihood that \nthe proposed establishment of the crop will, in fact, be viable in the \nproposed location.\n  The Secretary will also need to consider the impact that the proposed \nbioenergy crop, and the process of turning it into fuel or energy, will \nhave on wildlife, air, soil, and water quality and availability.\n  And the Secretary will have to consider the potential for economic \nbenefits to farmers and ranchers and impacts on their communities.\n  We have also added planning grants to help farmers and ranchers make \nthe decision to grow these new bioenergy crops and to assemble enough \nacreage that can support the development of bioenergy facilities to use \nthem.\n  Finally, we have added an additional requirement that participants in \nthe program agree to implement a plan to protect land, water, soil and \nwildlife.\n  I think these are real improvements in the bill. I again want to \nthank Senator Chambliss and his staff for working with us to make this \nprogram that truly will help move us toward a new energy future that \nwill benefit our farmers, our rural communities, and the environment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nan amendment to the farm bill that I have cosponsored which will \nprovide needed tax relief to homeowners facing foreclosure as a result \nof the sub-prime mortgage crisis.\n  The Gregg amendment No. 3674, will allow foreclosed homeowners to \navoid the additional hardship of being taxed on cancelled debt income. \nUnder current law, if a homeowner has an obligation to a bank of \n$150,000 and the home is foreclosed on and sold for $100,000, the \n$50,000 difference is treated as personal income and the IRS sends that \nindividual a tax bill. With the rate of foreclosures and mortgage \ndefaults rising to new levels, now is not the time for the Federal \nGovernment to be kicking homeowners when they are down. In addition, as \nsome lenders are renegotiating loans with borrowers to keep them in \ntheir home, the exclusion\n\n[[Page S15452]]\n\nof cancelled mortgage debt income is a necessary step to ensure that \nhomeowner retention efforts are not thwarted by tax policy.\n  This amendment provides a targeted exclusion from taxation for \ncanceled mortgage debt for those individuals most in need of \nassistance. It covers discharges of indebtedness between January 1, \n2007, and January 1, 2010. In addition, the amendment would only apply \nif the home facing foreclosure is the taxpayer's principal residence \nand the exclusion is only available on mortgage indebtedness of up to \n$1 million.\n  On a related note, I have introduced S. 2133, the Home Owners \n``Mortgage and Equity Savings Act,'' to help distressed homeowners who \nfile for bankruptcy. The amount of a debt forgiven or discharged in \nbankruptcy is not deemed income. This amendment is important companion \nlegislation in that it would help those who are able to renegotiate \ntheir mortgages, or who face foreclosure, but do not go into \nbankruptcy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, over the past years Congress has wrestled \nwith the question of what was the appropriate level of regulation of \nfutures exchanges and derivative markets. I have been very concerned \nabout the potential efforts to change the manner in which we regulate \nderivatives or to impact the manner in which derivatives operate in the \neconomy. It is critical that we strike the appropriate balance between \nprotecting consumers and markets from trading abuse while ensuring \ncontinued growth and innovation in the U.S. markets.\n  The President's Working Group on Financial Markets, PWG, has played \nan important role in this debate by explaining why proposals that we \nhave faced in the last few years for additional regulation of energy \nderivatives were not warranted, and has urged Congress to be aware of \nthe potential for unintended consequences that would harm America's \nfinancial markets.\n  I have been repeatedly warned by our federal financial regulators \nthat the importance of derivative markets in the U.S. economy should \nnot be taken lightly, as businesses, financial institutions, and \ninvestors throughout the economy rely on these risk management tools. \nDerivatives markets have contributed significantly to our economy's \nability to withstand and respond to various market stresses and \nimbalances.\n  In September of 2007, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, \nheld a hearing to examine the oversight of trading on regulated futures \nexchanges or exempt commercial markets. Based on this hearing, the CFTC \nreported that the current risk-based, tiered regulatory structure has \nsuccessfully encouraged financial innovation, competition, and \nmodernization. However, the CFTC also found that additional oversight \nwas warranted for certain contracts traded on an ECM that serve a \nsignificant price discovery function in order to detect and prevent \nmanipulation. The CFTC proposed four legislative recommendations that \nwere endorsed by the PWG.\n  In September of 2007, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission held a \nhearing to examine the oversight of trading on regulated futures \nexchanges and exempt commercial markets.

However, the CFTC also found that additional oversight \nwas warranted for certain contracts traded on an ECM that serves a \nsignificant price discovery function in order to detect and prevent \nmanipulation. The CFTC proposed four legislative recommendations that \nwere endorsed by the PWG.\n  It is for this reason that I decided to work with a bipartisan group \nof Senators who also wanted to address the appropriate level of \nregulation of futures exchanges and over-the-counter derivative \ntransactions. I want to thank Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman \nHarkin, Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Chambliss, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Snowe, Senator Levin, and Senator Coleman for all \ntheir work.\n  I appreciate their willingness to work off the framework that was \nendorsed by the PWG and believe this allowed all of us to reach a deal. \nThis was a significant concession to some Senators who have supported \nan alternative approach, and I would like to thank them for doing so.\n  In addition, this amendment extends the reauthorization of the CFTC, \nclarifies the CFTC authority over off-exchange retail foreign currency \ntransactions, clarifies the antifraud authority over principal-to-\nprincipal transactions, increases civil and criminal penalties, and \nmakes technical and conforming amendments. These provisions were also \nlargely based off the framework that was endorsed by the PWG letter of \nNovember of 2007.\n  Earlier this week the House Agriculture Committee approved by voice \nvote a similar measure to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. It is my hope that in a conference the House and Senate \nwill reconcile their differences over the reauthorization period and \nZelener related issues.\n  I strongly believe that Congress needs to reauthorize the CFTC and \nfrankly, so that we can give this agency all the tools it needs to \nprotect investors and promote the futures industry and preserve the \nintegrity of our markets. Moreover, the Senate must act to confirm Walt \nLukken as Chairman of the CFTC. He has demonstrated throughout this \nreauthorization process the strong leadership that is essential to \nmanaging an agency. I want to commend him, his fellow commissioners, \nand staff for all their tremendous work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15452-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, it seems that every week there is a new \nrevelation about how this administration has engaged in activity that \nis not consistent with American laws or values when it comes to the \nissue of torture. Last week, CIA Director Michael Hayden acknowledged \nthat Central Intelligence Agency officials destroyed videotapes of \ndetainees being subjected to so-called ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques.'' These techniques reportedly include forms of torture like \nwaterboarding. The New York Times reported, ``The tapes were destroyed \nin part because officers were concerned that video showing harsh \ninterrogation methods could expose agency officials to legal risks.''\n  The CIA apparently withheld information about the existence of \ninterrogation videotapes from official proceedings, including the 9/11 \nCommission and the Federal court hearing the case of Zacarias \nMoussaoui. General Hayden asserts that the videotapes were destroyed \n``in line with the law,'' but it is the Justice Department's role to \ndetermine whether the law was broken.\n  Last week I asked Attorney General Mukasey to investigate whether CIA \nofficials who covered up the existence of these videotapes violated the \nlaw. To his credit, the Attorney General has begun a preliminary \ninquiry.\n  This week there is a new revelation. The CIA has already acknowledged \nvideotaping interrogations of detainees in CIA custody. Now it appears \nthat there may be videotapes of detainees who the CIA transferred or \nrendered to other countries to be interrogated.\n  According to the Chicago Tribune, in February 2003, the CIA detained \na man named Abu Omar in Italy. The CIA then took Abu Omar to Egypt and \nturned him over to the Egyptian government. Abu Omar claims he was \ntortured and that his Egyptian interrogators recorded, ``the sounds of \nmy torture and my cries.''\n  In response to this story, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said he \ncould not ``speak to the taping practices of other intelligence \nservices.'' Notice what he did not say. He did not say whether the CIA \nis aware of foreign countries recording interrogations of detainees who \nwere transferred to them by the CIA. In fact, if the CIA sends a \ndetainee\n\n[[Page S15453]]\n\nto a foreign country for the purpose of interrogation, it seems \nreasonable to expect that we would monitor the interrogation by video \nor audio recording or by some other means.\n  Why are we sending detainees to other countries to be interrogated in \nthe first place? Under the Bush administration, the CIA has reportedly \ntransferred detainees to countries that routinely engage in torture so \nthat these detainees can be interrogated using torture techniques that \nwould not be permissible under U.S. law. The administration calls this \npractice rendition. Others call it by a different name outsourcing \ntorture.\n  The Torture Convention, which the United States has ratified, makes \nit illegal to transfer individuals to countries where they are likely \nto be tortured. The administration has said that it stands by this \nlegal prohibition.\n  However, the administration has said that it will transfer a detainee \nto a country that routinely engages in torture if the State Department \nreceives so-called ``diplomatic assurances'' that the detainee will not \nbe tortured. Based on diplomatic assurances, the administration has \nreportedly sent detainees to countries that systematically engage in \ntorture, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. Some of these \ndetainees, like Abu Omar, say that they were then tortured in these \ncountries. Now there may be video or audio taped evidence of that.\n  Even with diplomatic assurances, should we be sending people to \ncountries like Egypt to be interrogated? Every year, our State \nDepartment issues Country Reports on the human rights practices of \ncountries around the world. Here is what the most recent Country Report \non Egypt says:\n\n       Principal methods of torture . . . included stripping and \n     blindfolding victims; suspending victims from a ceiling or \n     doorframe with feet just touching the floor; beating victims \n     with fists, whips, metal rods, or other objects; using \n     electrical shocks; and dousing victims with cold water.\n\n  The State Department claims that it monitors compliance with \ndiplomatic assurances. Experts point out that it is very difficult to \nmonitor whether a country has kept its promise not to torture someone. \nNow it appears that there may be recordings to help the State \nDepartment make this determination.\n  This week's news raises many questions:\n\n       Have recordings been made of interrogations of detainees \n     who were rendered by the CIA to foreign countries?\n       Were these recordings made at the request of the CIA?\n       Are these recordings in the possession of the CIA?\n       Have these recordings been destroyed by or at the request \n     of the CIA?\n       Do these recordings contain evidence that detainees were \n     tortured?\n       Has the State Department reviewed these recordings to \n     determine whether foreign countries have complied with their \n     ``diplomatic assurances'' not to torture detainees who we \n     transfer to them?\n\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to CIA Director Michael Hayden to ask him \nabout the CIA's involvement in these recordings. I also sent a letter \nto Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking her whether the State \nDepartment has reviewed these recordings to determine whether detainees \nwe have transferred to foreign countries were tortured. And, finally, I \nsent a letter to Attorney General Mukasey asking him to expand the \nJustice Department's inquiry into the CIA torture tapes to cover \nrecordings of detainees who the CIA sent to foreign countries for the \npurposes of interrogation.\n  I am glad that Attorney General has opened a preliminary inquiry into \nthis issue. Now comes the difficult part getting to ground truth. \nUnfortunately, there certainly will be more revelations to come. It \nwill be a long time before we get to the bottom of this torture \nscandal. I fear it will be even longer before we undo the damage done \nto America's image and our values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15453-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S.

Section 307 \nauthorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, \nincluding that amounts provided in the legislation for the above \npurposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that Senate amendment No. 3819 offered by Senator Brown to \nSenate amendment No. 3500, an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nto H.R. 2419, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve \nfund for the farm bill. Therefore, pursuant to section 307, I am \nadjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the \nallocation provided to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n21 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008--S.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember a great \nArkansan, SFC James D. Doster, of White Hall, AR, who was killed on \nSeptember 29, 2007, in Baghdad, Iraq. A soldier in the B Company, 2nd \nBattalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division based in Fort \nRiley, KS, Sergeant First Class Doster died from injuries sustained \nwhen an improvised explosive device, IED, detonated near his vehicle. \nHe was 38 years old at the time of his death.\n  Sergeant First Class Doster graduated from White Hall High School and \nattended Hendrix College in Conway for 1 year before joining the Army. \nHe served for nearly 17 years, including a tour during Operation Desert \nStorm in Iraq. When that conflict ended, he continued to serve, mostly \nas a recruiter.\n  A devoted husband and father, Sergeant First Class Doster is survived \nby his wife Amanda and two young girls, Kathryn and Grace. He is also \nsurvived by his mother, Billie K. Doster of White Hall, and brother, \nRobert Doster of Albuquerque, NM. His father, the late Charles C. \nDoster, Jr., passed away last year.\n  Mr. President, it is truly a sad day that our Nation has lost another \ngreat patriot. Sergeant First Class Doster served our Nation proudly \nfor so many years, and his loss will be felt throughout the Jefferson \nCounty community. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during \ntheir time of grief.\n\n\n                       Specialist Todd A. Motley\n\n  Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to pay \ntribute to a citizen with family roots in Arkansas who served his \ncountry with honor, Specialist Todd A. Motley of Clare, MI. In support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom, Specialist Motley was one of four soldiers \nwho lost their lives during combat operations outside Baghdad on \nSeptember 14, 2007. Specialist Motley, along with SSG Terry Wagoner of \nPiedmont, SC, SPC Jonathan Rivandeneira of Jackson Heights, NY, and PVT \nChristopher McCloud of Malakoff, TX, suffered mortal wounds upon the \ndetonation of an improvised explosive device near their vehicle. Each \nof the men was assigned to B Troop, 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, \n1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, TX.\n  Motley joined the Army in March 2005 after graduating Clare Pioneer \nHigh School in 2003. ``Todd was one of your `once-in-a-lifetime' \nkids,'' says Pioneer principal Lori Enos. Enos described Motley as \ncreative, loyal and ``outgoing but not obnoxious.''\n\n[[Page S15455]]\n\n  As a testament to Motley's character, hundreds of residents and \nschoolchildren in and around the community of Harrison, MI, lined the \nstreets and waved small American flags as the funeral procession drove \npast.\n  ``He came in to talk about serving in the military, and about his \nexperiences. He was promoting finishing school, hanging in there, and \nnot giving up. If you have a goal, keep pushing to reach that goal,'' \nsays Principal Enos about Motley's speech he gave at the Alternative \nHigh School in the Clare Public School District only 1 year earlier. \n``He emphasized that.''\n  SPC Todd Motley is survived in Arkansas by his wife Karen, of Clare, \nhis two daughters Hannah and Kaylee, also of Clare, his brothers Ian \nand Nickolas, his maternal grandmother Marcia Dolin, and his mother \nRenee, all of Hoxie, AR.\n\n\n                      Specialist Tyler R. Seideman\n\n  Mr. President, the town of Lincoln, AR, in the northwest part of my \nState, lost its first casualty to the war in Iraq on August 22, 2007, \nwhen SPC Tyler R. Seideman was killed in a helicopter crash. He was \nonly 20 years old.\n  Specialist Seideman joined the Army after his best friend, Logan \nBiswell, enlisted a few years ago. Although they were assigned to \ndifferent units, both were sent to Iraq, and Specialist Seideman served \nwith the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division \nbased in Schofield Barracks, HI.\n  Specialist Seideman was one of 14 other Americans killed aboard a \nBlackhawk helicopter that suffered mechanical problems and crashed in \nnorthern Iraq. There were no survivors.\n  Tyler was always a popular young man in his town of Lincoln. He was \nconsidered a good athlete and played both football and baseball for his \nhometown team, the Lincoln High School Wolves. His former coach \nremembered him as a leader known for his fighting spirit. In an \ninterview with the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, former Lincoln High coach \nMike Guthrie said that he ``was a hard worker and a good kid. He stuck \nwith it during lean times when we weren't very good, but he was a good \nathlete who played both ways and gave it everything he had.''\n  At his funeral, friends remembered him as the kind of guy who ``would \ngive you the shirt off his back if you needed it.'' Others mentioned \nthat he would always joke around or would be quick with a smile. \nAnother high school friend called him ``a gentleman and a great role \nmodel.''\n  Specialist Seideman was given a full military funeral and was buried \nat the National Cemetery in Fayetteville. He is survived by his parents \nWilliam and Lee Ann Seideman of Lincoln and his sisters Kiera and \nKristen. Our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with the \nSeidemans and the community of Lincoln during this difficult time.\n\n\n                       Private Nathan Z. Thacker\n\n  Mr. President, Arkansas lost another young man last week when 18-\nyear-old Army PVT Nathan Thacker from Greenbrier was killed on October \n13 by a roadside bomb in Kirkuk, Iraq. Three other soldiers were \ninjured, one seriously.\n  He had been in Iraq less than 2 weeks and was assigned to the 2nd \nBattalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division out of Fort \nDrum, NY.\n  Private Thacker's parents, Stephen and Darlene, remembered him as a \nson who felt obligated to serve his country. ``He believed in doing his \nduty,'' his father said in an interview with the Arkansas Democrat \nGazette. Although he was nervous about going to Iraq, his father noted \nthat Nathan told him `` `It's my job now, and I need to do it.' He was \nvery duty conscious, a good boy.''\n  Private Thacker attended Guy-Perkins High School in Guy, AR. Although \nhe left school early, he received his general education development \ndiploma last year. His former principal, David Westenhover, recalled \nthat he was one of the first students he met when he became principal. \n``He was just one you could count on to be in class and do his work. He \nwas not disruptive. Citizenship was definitely a plus for him.''\n  One of his teachers, Stacy Ralls, taught Nate, as they called him, in \nscience classes. She told a local TV station that Private Thacker \n``liked to have fun, he always had a smile for you.'' She said that he \nwas great at building friendships with a wide variety of other \nstudents. ``It's not every kid you encounter, seems to have these \nqualities, he had those qualities.'' She felt that he died a hero and \nwill miss him greatly.\n  His father has said that he will receive a full military-honor \nfuneral in Greenbrier. Private Thacker was the third youngest of seven \nchildren.\n\n\n                       Specialist David L. Watson\n\n  Mr. President, Arkansas lost another great patriot when SPC David L. \nWatson of Newport, AR, died on September 22, 2007, in Baqubah, Iraq, \nfrom a noncombat accident in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nSpecialist Watson was a combat medic assigned to Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nInfantry Division, based out of Fort Lewis, WA. His brigade deployed to \nIraq in April 2007.\n  ``He was an excellent student. He never complained, and he was easy \nto get along with,'' recalls Ruth Jones, a retired Tuckerman High \nSchool teacher of Specialist Watson's past.\n  Cathy Platt, a friend of Watson's, said, ``Some go to Iraq because \nthey have to, David went because he wanted to. [Watson's death] is a \nshock to the whole community.''\n  These quotes give us great insight about a man held in the highest \nstandards by all those who knew him. ``He went to Iraq not to take \nlives, but to save them,'' said his wife Lisa. Pictures of Watson and \nhis family reflect his shining light of care, love, and devotion not \nonly to his family but to everyone he met. His wife Lisa recalls, \n``David never met a stranger.''\n  SPC David Watson is survived in Arkansas by his mother Linda Watson, \nof Newport; his wife Lisa Watson and two children, Dayton, 4, and \nCaelan, 8, also of Newport; two brothers, Bryant and Derek, of \nTuckerman and Newport; two sisters, Christal Hill and Nikki Moore, of \nConway and Little Rock; grandmother Ernestine Watson, of Tuckerman; \ngrandparents O.C. and Velma Bobo, of Tuckerman; and father- and mother-\nin-law Johnny and Brenda Powell, both of Newport.\n\n\n                      Specialist Donovan D. Witham\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SPC Donovan D. \nWitham of Malvern, AR. Specialist Witham was killed by an improvised \nexplosive device that detonated near his vehicle outside Baghdad, Iraq. \nThe blast killed a second soldier, SSG Sandy R. Britt of Apopka, FL. \nBoth men were assigned to the 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 82nd \nAirborne Division based in Fort Bragg, NC.\n  Specialist Witham graduated from Glen Rose High School in Malvern \nwhere he excelled in football and track. He was also active in other \nactivities such as student council, choir, and the Drama Club.\n  When Specialist Witham joined the Army in November 2005, he became a \nmilitary police officer and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne in that \nrole. However, he soon took on the additional role of a paratrooper. \nHis troop commander, MAJ Mark Lastoria, described Specialist Witham as \na soldier who ``represented everything good about our paratroopers. He \nwas a volunteer amongst volunteers by not only becoming a military \npolice officer, but also a paratrooper. He always strived to be the \nbest at everything he did. He will be deeply missed and always \nremembered by those of us who had the honor to serve with him.''\n  He was a decorated solider who received the Bronze Star Medal, the \nPurple Heart, the National Defense Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the \nCombat Action Badge, and the Parachutist's Medal.\n  At this time of mourning, our thoughts and prayers are with his \nfamily and friends. He is survived by his mother and stepfather, Martha \nand Richard Lanius of Malvern, and three sisters, Amber Sharp and \nhusband Steve of Magnolia; Jamie Witham of Benton; and Virginia Bennett \nof Magnolia. He is also survived by Julie DeBoer of Michigan, to whom \nhis mother said he planned to propose marriage in December. The loss of \nthis young man will be felt by us all.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Michael Yarbrough\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to honor a selfless soldier who gave his life \nin Iraq last month, Sgt Michael J. Yarbrough\n\n[[Page S15456]]\n\nof Malvern. On September 6, Sergeant Yarbrough was killed by a roadside \nbomb in Iraq's Anbar Province. Also killed in the blast were SSgt John \nStock, Cpl Bryan Scripsick, and Cpl Christopher Poole. The death of \nthese four young men brought the total number of Marine deaths in \nAfghanistan and Iraq over 1,000. All four men were assigned to the 3rd \nAssault Amphibious Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine \nExpeditionary Force based at Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  Sergeant Yarbrough was also the second graduate of Glen Rose High \nSchool in Malvern killed in action within a month's time. Spc Donovan \nWitham, also of Malvern, died on August 21 from a roadside bomb near \nBaghdad. In an interview with the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Glen Rose \nMiddle School principal Tim Holicer somberly noted, ``We are still \ngrieving the loss of one, and here we have another one of our young men \nto be killed in Iraq. That's as hard on everybody around here as \nanything.''\n  According to Sergeant Yarbrough's mother, Rhonda Fain-Yarbrough, her \nson wasn't scheduled to be in Iraq. He volunteered to return for a \nthird tour after he heard that another soldier's wife was expecting a \nbaby. ``Michael didn't want to see him go, so he took his place.'' He \ntold her that ``as long as my men are there, I'm going to be there with \nthem.''\n  As the Yarbrough family and Malvern community grieve, we grieve with \nthem. He will be remembered by those who loved him as a young man who \nwas destined to be a soldier. ``Ever since he was a little boy, he \nwould march around with a stick on his shoulder, saying `I'm going to \nbe in the Army, Mom, I'm going to be in the Army,''' Mrs. Fain-\nYarbrough told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. True to his word, he \nenlisted after September 11, 2001.\n  For his efforts, Sergeant Yarbrough was awarded a Purple Heart, \nCombat Action Ribbon, The National Defense Service Medal, and the Iraqi \nCampaign Medal, among others. He is survived by his wife Mary Ann \nYarbrough; his mother Rhonda Fain-Yarbrough of Benton; and father Jerry \nYarbrough of Gurdon. In addition, his grandmother Dolline Fain, and two \nsisters, Christy Smith of Arkadelphia and Misty Hutcheson of Traskwood, \nas well as their families will most certainly miss him. A grateful \nnation's thoughts and prayers go out to you at this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15456-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, is currently considering the renewal of the \nCalifornia Department of Water Resources, DWR, license for the Oroville \nFacilities hydroelectric project in Butte County, CA.\n  DWR is exempt from paying State, local, or a Federal tax associated \nwith the Oroville Project and has not compensated Butte County for the \nservices it provides for the project and its visitors. Butte County \nbelieves the relicensing is an opportunity to mitigate the county's \nrevenue losses, which are estimated at nearly $6.9 million per year.\n  FERC's Final Environmental Impact Statement also acknowledges that \nthe Oroville Project has a negative fiscal impact on Butte County.\n  I have sent a letter to FERC asking that they consider efforts to \nmitigate Butte County's revenue loss and treat all parties equitably \nduring the Oroville Project relicensing proceedings, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have text of this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2007.\n     Chairman Joseph T.

Kelly,\n     Commissioner Philip Moeller,\n     Commissioner Marc Spitzer,\n     Commissioner John Wellinghoff,\n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kelliher and Commissioners: I am writing in \n     regards to the relicensing proceedings for the Oroville \n     Facilities hydroelectric project (Project P-2100) currently \n     before the Commission. As you know, Butte County is required \n     to provide services associated with the Oroville Facilities \n     Project and its visitors, including law enforcement, fire and \n     rescue, and road maintenance services.\n       The Commission's Final Environmental Impact Statement \n     acknowledges the negative net fiscal impact the Oroville \n     Facilities Project may impose on Butte County.

I am hopeful that all parties involved with the \n     relicensing of the Oroville Facilities will be regarded \n     equitably. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15456-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Steven Domer, an Oklahoma City, OK, resident, went missing on October \n26, 2007. The following day, police found his torched car and his body \nwas found in a nearby ravine days later. On November 7, 2007, Darrell \nMadden was arrested for the shooting death of his friend Bradley \nQualls. Both men were seen with the 62-year-old Domer the day of his \ndisappearance and are believed to have been involved in his murder. \nMadden has been charged with murder for allegedly strangling Domer to \ndeath. Investigations have uncovered that Madden was a sergeant in a \nWhite supremacist group and targeted Domer because he was gay. Domer's \nmurder was allegedly a rite of passage for Qualls to rise to the next \nlevel within the organization. The district attorney prosecuting the \ncase will present evidence to prove that Domer was targeted because he \nwas gay. Oklahoma is one of seventeen States whose hate crime laws do \nnot cover those targeted based on sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15456-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15456-S15457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LAUNCH OF USASPENDING.GOV\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am very pleased to celebrate today's \nlaunch of USAspending.gov. This is an important day, an important \nmilestone on the path to greater openness and transparency in the \nFederal Government. This site helps us to achieve a very simple and \npowerful vision: a vision that, in a democracy, the people ought to \nknow what their Government is doing: how the Government is raising and \nspending money, how it is making and enforcing law, how it is \nsupporting projects, how decisions are being made, and how results are \nbeing evaluated.\n  It is not a Democratic vision or a Republican vision. It is a \ncommonsense vision of Government transparency and accessibility. It is \na vision that rejects the idea that Government actions and decisions \nshould be kept secret or classified. It is a vision that believes that \ninformation is at the heart of democracy and that we all must resist \nthe dangerous trend of withholding or classifying or burying \ninformation that the American people have a right to know and need to \nknow if they are to hold their leaders accountable.\n  I have been very troubled by the extent to which America has become a \nnation of government secrets. More and more information is kept secret \nor made intolerably complicated and inaccessible. More and more \ndecisions are made behind closed doors with access limited to insiders \nand lobbyists.\n  USAspending.gov along with watchdog groups will give us all tools to \nhelp buck that trend. It will help by opening Government processes up \nto public view. It will provide a window into the Federal budget so all \nAmericans can see how their tax dollars are being spent--how their \nNation's resources are being used and obligated, where money is going \nas well as where it is not going. We will be able to see which grantees \nand contractors are receiving\n\n[[Page S15457]]\n\nmoney and the congressional district where the contract's services are \nperformed. We will see which agencies are purchasing what, from whom, \nand where. Technology makes it possible for every American to know what \nis happening and to hold elected officials accountable.\n  If Government spending can't withstand public scrutiny, then the \nmoney shouldn't be spent. If a Government agency isn't willing to be \nheld accountable for the grants or contracts it awards, then that \nagency shouldn't have control over Federal resources. Whether you \nbelieve the Government ought to spend more money or spend less, you \nshould certainly be able to agree that the Government ought to spend \nevery penny efficiently and transparently. Democrats and Republicans \ncan all agree that wasteful spending is unacceptable, whether it is by \nFEMA, HUD, DOD, or any other Federal agency.\n  Transparency by itself is not enough, but transparency is the first \nstep to holding Government accountable for its actions. Transparency is \na prerequisite to oversight and financial control. We can't reduce \nwaste, fraud, and abuse without knowing how, where, and why Federal \nmoney is flowing out the door.\n  USAspending.gov is a very good beginning. The Web site does not yet \ndeliver everything that it is required to under the law, but its \nlimitations and shortcomings are transparent, and it will get better \nand more complete week after week. I am also confident that people will \nuse the site and will provide feedback directly on the site's community \n``Wiki'' function for collecting and sharing public comments. This will \nraise the expectations of all Americans for greater transparency, \naccess, and accountability. Now it will be up to us elected officials \nto meet those expectations.\n  It is important to point out that this site would not have been \npossible without the grassroots efforts of watchdog groups across the \npolitical spectrum who lobbied for passage of the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act, which Senator Coburn and I like to \ncall the Transparency Act. The story behind the Transparency Act \nembodies the best of our democratic traditions--a bipartisan effort \nfueled by ordinary people who refused to accept that the Government \ncouldn't make public information freely and simply available. \nThroughout this process, it has been an honor to work with Senator \nCoburn and to witness the dedicated work of the staff at OMB.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15457-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO COACH SONNY LUBICK\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a legend \nin the Colorado State University and Fort Collins, CO, community: Coach \nSonny Lubick. For 15 seasons, he led the CSU Rams to a record of 108-\n74, six conference titles, and nine bowl games.\n  Originally from Butte, MT, Coach Lubick graduated from the University \nof Montana-Western in 1960 and began his coaching career 10 years later \nat Montana State University. After eight seasons as an assistant coach, \nhe was promoted to head coach. His hard work and early success served \nas the foundation for what would become a remarkable coaching career.\n  After serving as an assistant coach for various other programs, Coach \nLubick accepted the head coaching position at Colorado State University \nprior to the 1993 season. He began by implementing an aggressive effort \nto recruit players and expand the program beyond anything previously \nachieved. With new recruits and under new leadership, the CSU Rams \nreached new heights during Coach Lubick's second year with CSU. During \nthat remarkable season, the Rams finished with a 10-2 record, clinching \nthe university's first ever WAC Championship and a trip to the Holiday \nBowl. The 1994 season was the beginning of a new era in Colorado State \nfootball, earning Sonny Lubick National Coach of the Year honors from \nSports Illustrated magazine. Lubick also joined an elite list of \ncoaches in 2005, as active Division IA coaches with 100 or more career \nwins with their current institution. This group includes only nine \nmembers.\n  The success Coach Lubick's program achieved led to the construction \nof the McGraw Athletic Center in 1999, and recently the university has \nannounced its intention to build indoor practice facilities and an \nacademic and training center, both of which are attributed to Sonny \nLubick's leadership and efforts. Coach Lubick's personal philosophy of \nresponsibility, character, respect, and perspective has been the \ndriving force behind the success of both the football team and the \nsurrounding community.\n  Sonny Lubick's family-oriented approach to coaching and life has \nearned a multitude of accolades. In 2003 he was recognized as ``Father \nof the Year'' by the American Diabetes Association--Colorado Chapter. \nThat same year he was also named one of the four national finalists for \nthe Eddie Robinson Coach of Distinction Award for his community \nservice. Coach Lubick regularly gives his time to St. Jude's Children's \nHospital and several other local charities. In 2005 the Fort Collins \nBoard of Realtors named Coach Lubick ``Citizen of the Year,'' and most \nrecently the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce awarded him the Collins \nAward, given to local figures that exemplify leadership and service to \nthe community.\n  Coach Sonny Lubick's charisma and good nature have made him an icon \namong students, fans, friends, and Coloradans. This popularity was \ncemented when a large donation was made to renovate CSU's stadium under \nthe condition that the field would be named for Coach Lubick. Today, \nthe Colorado State Rams meet their opponents in Hughes Stadium, rushing \nout on to Sonny Lubick Field.\n  As an alumnus of Colorado State University, I want to thank Coach \nLubick for his dedicated service and leadership to the football team, \nthe university, and the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15457-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LODICE GRANT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on October 9, 2007, a beloved \nIdahoan passed away. Lodice Grant was raised in Nampa and, after moving \nout of State for a number of years, moved back to Nampa for the \nremainder of her life. She was small in stature but strong in her \ndirection and devotion. She was a friend of mine and, together with her \nhusband of 51 years, Fred Kelly Grant, worked closely with me in recent \nyears on the Owyhee Initiative. Before her children were born, Lodice \nworked as the assistant sales manager for the University of Chicago \nPress and the Johns Hopkins University Press. Prior to her move back to \nNampa, Lodice became the sales manager for Johns Hopkins University \nPress, earning such an outstanding reputation that noted authors \nrefused to have anyone but her serve as their principal assistant and \nadviser as they were publishing their works. In Nampa, Lodice raised \ntwo boys and dedicated much of her time to working for and supporting \nthe Roman Catholic Church in Caldwell and then for the Diocese of \nIdaho.\n  When Lodice retired from the church in 2003, she continued her \nstaunch support of her husband's work as legal counsel for Owyhee \nCounty; they both made improving Owyhee County the capstone of their \nlabor and life's work over the past few years. Lodice was a pillar of \nstrength for her entire family. Her influence for good and her acts of \nservice benefited countless people who loved her and will miss her \nenergy, friendship, and spirit. She tended people in the same way she \nlovingly tended her beautiful yard and garden--with tenderness, careful \nattention, and tireless devotion. I was blessed to know her, and I \noffer my heartfelt condolences to Fred, their children Andy and Jon, \nfive grandchildren, and family and friends during this difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15457-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15457-S15458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING DR. WALTER BRYZIK\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Dr. Walter \nBryzik as he retires after 40 years of service to the men and women of \nour Armed Forces and our Nation. Since 1968, Dr. Bryzik has held a \nvariety of positions at the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, \nDevelopment and Engineering Center, TARDEC, in Warren, MI, and is \nretiring early next year as its chief scientist. His career is one to \nbe admired and he will be surely missed\n\n[[Page S15458]]\n\nby all of us who are fortunate enough to have worked closely with him.\n  As he rose to become the Army's senior technical leader in ground \nsystem technology, Dr. Bryzik established a legacy of accomplishment \nthat will be difficult to equal. Ten years ago, he was promoted to the \nhighest scientific professional rank in the Army. In 2004, he was \npresented with the Distinguished Presidential Rank Award for his \nleadership and technical contributions to the U.S. Government.\n  Dr. Bryzik's generation of scientists and engineers, and the \ntechnologies and systems they developed, are the forgotten part of \nAmerica's success in winning the Cold War. I often worry that we aren't \ndoing enough to replace this generation of innovators--especially with \nthe quality of individuals like Dr. Bryzik. However, Dr. Bryzik is \nmaking an important contribution to this effort. Outside of TARDEC, he \nhas served on the faculty of Wayne State University as a professor in \nthe Department of Engineering, another example of his commitment to the \ndevelopment of the next generation of our Nation's engineers and to the \nservice of his community.\n  However, most important among his accomplishments are the \ntechnologies that Dr. Bryzik helped develop and transition to soldiers \nin the field. His efforts have helped give our service men and women \nthe most cutting-edge, effective technology possible, and that has been \na critical advantage for our Armed Forces as they engage our \nadversaries around the world. Most importantly, the technological \nadvancements that Dr. Bryzik has overseen have saved lives.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Bryzik has been an invaluable resource to \nme and my staff. In addition to his insight and expert counsel, he has \na remarkable ability to convert highly technical subjects into language \nthat the rest of us can understand! I am told he has mentored at least \nfive generations of my staff and helped them navigate the complexities \nof the work done at TARDEC and throughout the Army.\n  I am sure my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. Bryzik on \nan extraordinary career and thanking him for his decades of service to \nour Nation, the Army and TARDEC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15458-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. M. President, it is no surprise why Arkansas is \ncalled the Natural State. That is because we have been blessed with a \ntremendous abundance of mountains, hills, streams, rivers, and lakes \nthat contribute to the beauty of our great State. For generations, \nnational parks and outdoor recreation have played a big part in the \nlives of Arkansans. They also have been the source of our large tourism \nindustry, attracting tens of thousands of visitors to our State to \nenjoy all that nature offers.\n  One of the crown jewels of our National Forest System is the Ouachita \nNational Forest. Encompassing 1.8 million acres and stretching from \nwestern Arkansas to southeastern Oklahoma, the Ouachita National Forest \nis the largest and oldest national forest in the South. In fact, on \nDecember 18, 2007, the Ouachita National Forest will celebrate its \n100th anniversary.\n  Originally named the Arkansas National Forest, the Ouachita National \nForest was created from public lands south of the Arkansas River by \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt on December 18, 1907. In 1926, President \nCalvin Coolidge renamed the forest the Ouachita National Forest to \nreflect the name of the mountains and river that run primarily through \nit.\n  Home to breathtaking mountain views and picturesque streams and \nlakes, outdoor enthusiasts enjoy recreational activities like camping, \nboating, biking, and hiking on some of the 37 trails that run \nthroughout the national forest. Its thriving wilderness areas provide \nample grounds for fisherman and hunters, including nine different \nturkey hunting areas throughout the park. The forest also supplies \nample timber resources to meet the needs of our Nation.\n  As the 100th anniversary of the Ouachita National Forest approaches, \nI wish to express my appreciation for the lasting impact that the \nnational forest has made for the people of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and our \ngreat Nation. Ouachita Forest supervisor Norman Wagoner has encouraged \ncitizens to join the park staff in celebrating this historic \nanniversary at any of the forest's 11 district offices on December 18. \nThe meet and greet will be a wonderful time to reflect on the past \ncontributions of the park and the tremendous role it has played in \nArkansas' heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15458-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CASIMIR LENARD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nthe life and legacy of a great American who passed away last week--\nCasimir Lenard.\n  Cas Lenard was an American patriot, who also made a tremendous \ncontribution to strengthening the friendship between the United States \nand Poland. He served bravely in three U.S. wars. He was a leader in \nthe Polish American Community. He was also a beloved husband to the \nlate Myra Lenard, his partner in life and his partner in his work on \nbehalf of the Polish American community.\n  Cas Lenard was born in Chicago to a family of Polish immigrants. Like \nso many children of immigrants, Cas Lenard embraced his country while \nnever forgetting his homeland.\n  After hearing that the Nazis had invaded Poland in 1939, Cas joined \nthe Chicago Black Horse Troop, 106th Cavalry, Illinois National Guard. \nTwo years later, he requested and was assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry \nDivision--the first U.S. Army unit to go overseas. From 1942-1945, Cas \nwas engaged in overseas combat duty, participating in the Operation \nTorch landing at Oran, North Africa, the invasion of Sicily, and in the \nD-Day amphibious landing at Omaha Beach, Normandy.\n  After his discharge from the Army in 1945, Cas married his beloved \nwife, Myra, and began working in the family restaurant business in \nChicago. Again heeding the call to service, Cas volunteered for active \nduty and served for 6 years during the Korean War. In 1962, he was \nselected for a 5-year tour of active duty with the General Staff at the \nPentagon, where he became Chief of the Army Intelligence Reserve \nOffice. Cas then went on to serve in Vietnam and at the U.S. Army \nInstitute of Land Combat at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.\n  After 30 years of distinguished service, Cas retired from the \nmilitary and was awarded many citations, including the Silver Star \nMedal with Cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' for Valor, the French Croix de Guerre \nwith Palm, seven overseas campaign ribbons, and the Normandy Medal of \nthe Jubilee of Liberty.\n  I got to know Cas and Myra Lenard because of their work with the \nPolish American Congress--where Cas served as its first executive \ndirector in Washington.\n  Cas and Myra worked tirelessly to support the Solidarity movement in \nPoland. And when the wall came down, Cas and Myra Lenard were strong \nadvocates for Poland's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, NATO. The Lenards were there every step of the way--\norganizing the Polish American community to educate their Senators \nabout how Poland's membership in NATO would strengthen America's \nsecurity.\n  For all of his efforts on behalf of Polish Americans and for \nimproving Poland's position in the world, Cas received many awards, \nincluding the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic \nof Poland, the Founders Award by the Polish American Congress, and the \nPolish American Congress Medal of Freedom.\n  Cas Lenard's life was a triumph. His legacy is a deep friendship and \nalliance between the United States and a free, democratic Poland. His \nchildren and grandchildren are in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15458-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15458-S15459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FIVE VERMONT COMMUNITY LEADERS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I would like to make you \naware of five individuals who were recently recognized at the Central \nVermont Community Action Council's annual meeting.\n  Sergio Colon moved to White River Junction with his two adopted sons \nafter his community in Port Charlotte, FL, was devastated by Hurricane \nCharlie in 2004. A single father working hard to make ends meet, Sergio \nat one\n\n[[Page S15459]]\n\npoint was forced to move his family to a homeless shelter in Vermont. \nYet, even while his family relied on social services to get by, he \nvolunteered for multiple organizations just as he had always done in \nFlorida. Sergio has since returned to college to work on his psychology \ndegree and is currently looking for a job in human services so he can \ncontinue to help people who are struggling.\n  Borgi von Trapp has been a leader in her community for many years. In \n1993, Borgi, a mother of six children, founded Children First, an \norganization devoted to designing and implementing creative educational \nenvironments for children. A year later, she helped develop the Mad \nRiver Green Farmers' Market, a successful incubator for locally owned, \ninnovative, healthy, and creative businesses. Since then it has grown \nto include more than 50 full time vendors and over 12,000 customers per \nseason. Borgi is a model of community leadership and creative learning.\n  Sherrie Pomainville was a single mother for 22 years, raising four \nchildren on a minimum-wage salary. She knew the value of education and \nworked to obtain it. With the help of the Reach Up Program, she was one \nof the first clients to successfully complete the postsecondary \nEducation program and earn a bachelor's degree in social work. In 2002, \nSherrie graduated cum laude and was on the National Association for \nSocial Workers Board for 3 years. This has allowed her to make a better \nlife for herself and her children, while at the same time giving back \nto the community that helped her. She currently works for various \ncommunity organizations in southwestern Vermont.\n  Jessica Kelley has been actively involved as a parent volunteer in \nHead Start and an important advocate for children and families in her \ncommunity. She has served on the Head Start Policy Council for the past \n2 years and last year was elected the parent representative of the \nVermont Head Start Association. In this role, Jessica attends statewide \nmeetings and participates in policy discussions and initiatives, such \nas parent leadership, Head Start reauthorization, and No Child Left \nBehind legislation.\n  Lydia Chartier is a tireless community leader in the Northeast \nKingdom of Vermont. Presently, she donates most of her time to Lincoln \nCenter Child Care, where she uses her own vast experience to assist \nsupport staff and other volunteers. She also serves as an invaluable \nresource to the Lincoln Center's staff. In addition, Lydia volunteers \nat her church, her son's school, and on many other community projects. \nIf there is a good community event happening, there can be little doubt \nthat Lydia is aware of it and promoting it. But most of all, Lydia is \ndedicated to ending poverty and doing whatever it takes to help those \nin need.\n  The quality of life in Vermont, and in our Nation, is strengthened by \nindividuals like these five community leaders, men and women who work \nto improve our communities and who strive to give back to the places in \nwhich they live. I commend their great contributions and the \ncontributions of many like them across the nation to our American \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15459-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) announced that on today, \nDecember 13, 2007, he had signed the following enrolled bills, \npreviously signed by the Speaker of the House:\n\n       H.R. 365.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture (acting \nthrough the Chief of the Forest Service) to enter into a cooperative \nagreement with the State of Wyoming to allow the State of Wyoming to \nconduct certain forest and watershed restoration services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am proud to introduce the Wyoming Forest and \nWatershed Restoration Act of 2007. This legislation authorizes \ncooperative action between the U.S. Forest Service and the State of \nWyoming to complete forest health projects on private, State and \nFederal lands.\n  Almost half of Wyoming's lands are controlled by Federal agencies. We \nhave over 9 million acres of National Forest lands in Wyoming, \nincluding seven National Forests. Our State has a long history of \nforestry, grazing and multiple use of public lands. Recreation and \ntourism on our public lands is a pillar of our economy. The people of \nWyoming are stewards of our public lands and our State depends on the \npublic lands for our future.\n  It is my goal to enact common-sense policies that address the needs \nof Wyoming and sustainable management of our Federal lands. Our \nforests, like those of all States across the West, are facing \nmanagement challenges. We have an opportunity to set policies that will \nencourage forest health.\n  We face an urgent problem with bark beetle infestation. Forests \nbetween Interstate 70 in Colorado and Interstate 80 in Wyoming are \nbeing killed by these beetles. We have thousands upon thousands of \nacres that are dying. On the Medicine-Bow Forest, for instance, over \n75,000 acres of trees are infected by bark beetles. Forest Service \nanalysis shows the epidemic could grow to 350,000 acres and cover \napproximately \\1/3\\ of the forest in the next few years.\n  We can stem the spread of this infestation and save our forests, with \nquick action on thousands of acres. That kind of response will take \ncoordinated management among all partners private, State, and Federal. \nPreventing forest fires, addressing watershed health and conserving \nwildlife habitat require the same ``big picture'' thinking. We have to \naddress threats like bark beetles by taking on forest health projects \non a landscape level.\n  Resource issues don't stop at fencelines, and neither should our \npolicy.\n  The Wyoming Forest and Watershed Restoration Act of 2007 would set in \nplace a comprehensive management policy. This act would allow the State \nof Wyoming to go forward with forest health projects as agreed to by \nthe Forest Service. The agencies can cooperatively pursue projects that \naddress our landscape needs. Private, State, and Federal lands can get \nthe on-the-ground management they desperately need.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation today. It is of great \nimportance to the people of Wyoming. I hope my colleagues will proceed \nquickly with its passage to enhance our State's response to the growing \nforest health problems. The people of Wyoming demand on-the-ground \nresults. This legislation can deliver those results. I hope we can pass \nit expediently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nenforcement of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \nRights Act of 1994, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, more \nthan 1.5 million of our servicemen and women have been sent to Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other nations. We have mobilized more than 630,000 \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves, including 92,000 who are on \nactive duty right now.\n  These service men and women have courageously defended our country \noverseas, but tens of thousands of them have come home to find that \nthey have lost their employment benefits or even their jobs, and the \nGovernment has failed to defend their rights.\n  Today, Senator Daniel Akaka and I are introducing legislation to \nguarantee that veterans won't have to wait years for the Government to \nact to restore their benefits or return to work.\n  Thirteen years ago, Congress enacted the Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act, specifically to protect our \nservicemembers when they return home. We understood that, to maintain \nstrong focus and a strong National Guard and Reserves, servicemembers \nneeded confidence that they could return to their civilian jobs when \nthey came home from their tours of duty. That legislation was a clear \npromise that the Federal Government would step in and defend \nservicemembers who were wrongly denied their jobs or benefits. We \npledged that the Department of Labor would investigate violations of \nthe act, and that if employers refused to follow the law, the Attorney \nGeneral would take employers to court to protect our servicemembers' \nrights.\n  Today, however, the administration has clearly broken that promise to \nenforce the law and get our veterans back to work.\n  Last month, during a Senate Committee hearing, I released a \nDepartment of Defense survey showing that for tens of thousands of \nveterans, their service to our country has cost them the salary they \ndeserve, their health care, their pensions, or even their jobs. Among \nmembers of the Reserves and National Guard, nearly 11,000 were denied \nprompt reemployment. More than 22,000 lost seniority and rightful pay. \nNearly 20,000 had their pensions reduced. More than 15,000 did not \nreceive the training they needed to resume their former jobs. Nearly \n11,000 did not get their health insurance back.\n  The problem is that employers aren't following the law, and Federal \nagencies aren't effectively enforcing it. Mr. President, 38 percent of \nservicemembers who asked the Department of Labor to defend their rights \ndid not receive a prompt response. Servicemembers are forced to wait \nmonths or years even to find out whether the Government will agree to \nrepresent them and defend their rights. One veteran waited 7 years \nbefore the Department of Labor told him whether it would take his case \nto court. No veteran can afford to wait seven months to return to work \nor have his health insurance reinstated, let alone wait 7 years.\n  With these unbelievable delays, it is not surprising that 44 percent \nof servicemembers who asked the Department of Labor for help said that \nthey were dissatisfied with the assistance they received. When \nservicemen and women hear about these delays, they ask themselves, \n``Why should I even bother to ask for help.''\n  In fact, the Pentagon tells us that 77 percent of servicemembers \nwhose rights are violated don't contact anyone to defend their rights. \nThey simply give up. Nearly half of them say that they have no \nconfidence that the Government will resolve their problems, or that it \nis just not worth the effort.\n  Even worse, a quarter of them don't even know where they can go for \nhelp. It is beyond dispute that the administration has broken its \npromise to help them.\n  Our veterans deserve better than this. They deserve to know that \ntheir Government is working as quickly as possible to get them back to \nwork and restore their benefits.\n  The current law needs reform as well. It makes no sense to have four \ndifferent agencies tracking the problems of our servicemembers in four \ndifferent ways. We also need to know whether disabled veterans are \nbeing properly assisted in making their own difficult transition back \nto work.\n  It is time for the administration to keep its promise, and end the \nlong delays for veterans who need help in defending their rights. The \nbill that Senator Akaka and I are introducing imposes timely and \nreasonable deadlines on Federal agencies to investigate complaints, to \nattempt to resolve them, and, if necessary, to refer them for \nlitigation.\n  The legislation also makes the Federal enforcement of the law more \ntransparent and responsive to the needs of veterans. It assures \nveterans that they won't have to wait years for an answer about whether \nthey will receive the help they deserve.\n  By imposing timely deadlines on the Federal agencies, we are also \nstepping up the pressure on employers that violate the rights of our \nbrave soldiers. With these new deadlines, employers won't be able to \ndrag their heels as the Department of Labor spends months or years \ninvestigating violations. They will know that they have to settle each \nveteran's case quickly and fairly, or else face the U.S. Government in \ncourt.\n  The legislation also implements a number of reforms recommended by \nthe Government Accountability Office--reforms that have received \nbipartisan support in the House of Representatives. In particular, our \nbill requires agencies to gather and report information on these cases \nin a uniform manner, so that we can understand trends and better \naddress the needs of each servicemember. Agencies will also be required \nto report on cases involving veterans with disabilities, so that we \nhave accurate information on the reemployment problems of our wounded \nsoldiers.\n  Enacting this legislation alone obviously won't end the job \ndiscrimination that too many servicemembers face when they come home. \nBut it will certainly improve the assistance they receive in obtaining \nthe help they have earned and deserve.\n  Our legislation has the support of the Nation's largest veterans' \norganization, the American Legion, which emphasizes that the \n``enforcement of veterans' employment and reemployment rights . . . can \nonly be achieved through aggressive oversight and timely \ninvestigation.'' This legislation, the American Legion says, will \n``strengthen veterans' employment and reemployment rights'' by imposing \n``timely, realistic deadlines on Federal agencies to process'' their \nclaims. We are proud to have the American Legion's support for this \nlegislation.\n  We know we can never truly repay our veterans for their immense \nsacrifices. They have fought hard for our country, and it is up to us \nto fight just as hard for them when they return home to the heroes' \nwelcome they so justly deserve. An important part of that welcome is \nkeeping the promise that we made to them to protect their employment \nrights when they return.\n\n[[Page S15464]]\n\nThat is what this legislation seeks to do, and I urge my colleagues to \nenact it as soon as possible.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good friend \nand distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in \nintroducing S. 2471, the proposed USERRA Enforcement Improvement Act of \n2007. This measure is intended to make substantial improvements in the \nmanner in which claims made under the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act of 1994--USERRA--are processed and to help \nensure that individuals' complaints are addressed in a prompt and \nefficient manner.\n  Our troops are returning home from battle, and many of them seek to \nreturn to the jobs that they held prior to their military service, \nparticularly those serving in Guard and Reserve units. USERRA, which is \nset forth in chapter 43 of title 38, U.S. Code, provides these \nservicemembers with certain protections. USERRA also sets out certain \nresponsibilities for employers, including to reemploy returning \nveterans in their previous jobs.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I held two \nhearings earlier this year on issues relating to veterans' employment, \nincluding one focusing exclusively on the pilot project for processing \nUSERRA claims in the Federal sector and the jurisdictional questions \ninvolving the Department of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel. I \nmust admit to being particularly upset with the volume of USERRA claims \nrelated to Federal service. It is simply wrong that individuals who \nwere sent to war by their Government should, upon their return, be put \nin the position of having to do battle with that same Government in \norder to regain their jobs and benefits.\n  Out of those hearings, and an oversight hearing held by the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, chaired by Senator \nKennedy, we have learned a great deal about the manner in which USERRA \nclaims are investigated, resolved, or referred to other appropriate \nentities for enforcement actions. By and large, the process is seamless \nand frequently involves employer education in terms of helping them \nunderstand their obligations under the law. Still too often, many \nclaims are quite complicated and involve what are sometimes called \n``escalator claims,'' where an individual is seeking to be re-instated \nin a position with quite complicated benefits, seniority, health care \nand fiduciary issues. I believe that anytime an individual is denied \ntheir USERRA rights is one time too many. However, I understand that \nthe confusion and misunderstanding that can exist for the employer--\nparticularly a small employer or one who may only have one employee who \nis a member of the Guard or reserve--can be frustrating.\n  The legislation we are introducing today seeks to establish \nreasonable time frames for the USERRA process. When veterans turn to \nthe government to protect their employment rights, they deserve \nsolutions, not delays. It is my hope that this legislation will assist \nthe federal government in protecting the employment rights of veterans.\n  Our legislation would, in brief, require those filing complaints to \nbe notified within 5 days of the establishment of a claim, require that \ncomplaints be investigated and a decision made with respect to the need \nfor further referral within 90 days, and require prompt referral to \nother agencies. The Government Accountability Office would be required \nto submit quarterly reports on the processing of claims. Finally, data \ncollected by the Employers' Support of the Guard and Reserve, a \nvoluntary organization within the Department of Defense, would be \nrequired to be included in the Secretary of Labor's annual report on \nUSERRA. With respect to this ESRG reporting requirement, it should be \nnoted that this provision has already passed both bodies in the context \nof the pending conference agreement on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2008, and it is included here in the \nevent that legislation is not enacted.\n  I stress that our goal is to improve the current process. We want in \nno way to place strictures on the program that might result in less \nthan satisfactory consideration and pursuit of claims. I intend to \npursue the concerns of all of those involved in these claims--the \nDepartments of Labor, Defense, and Justice, the Office of Personnel \nManagement and the Office of the Special Counsel--through the \nlegislative process in the next session. Should the need for \nrefinements in the measure as it is introduced today become apparent, \nthey will be carefully considered. I know that the Senator from \nMassachusetts will join me in that endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 2472. A bill to amend the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my colleague \nSenator Gordon Smith to introduce the Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS \nPrevention and Treatment Act. Millions across the world recently \nobserved the 20th World AIDS Day on December 1, a day of mourning, \nsolidarity, and hope: mourning for the more than 25 million killed \nalready in the AIDS pandemic; solidarity with the 33.2 million living \nwith HIV today; and hope that this plague will be conquered in our \ntime--with an achievable goal of realizing the birth of an HIV-free \ngeneration.\n  In the U.S., we have reached a point where a child living with HIV/\nAIDS no longer faces certain death. Thanks to anti-retroviral, ARV, \ntherapy, many children born infected with HIV/AIDS now have the \nopportunity to grow up healthy. However, long-term survival is a dream \nthat eludes most of the 2.5 million HIV-infected children around the \nworld.\n  Of the more than 2.5 million new HIV infections in 2007, more than \n420,000 were in children. But while children account for almost 16 \npercent of all new HIV infections, they make up only 9 percent of those \non treatment under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, \nPEPFAR. Without proper care and treatment, half of these newly-infected \nchildren will die before their second birthday and 75 percent will die \nbefore their fifth.\n  Every day, approximately 1,100 children across the globe are infected \nwith HIV, the vast majority through mother-to-child transmission during \npregnancy, labor or delivery or soon after through breastfeeding. \nApproximately 90 percent of these infections occur in Africa. With no \nmedical intervention, HIV-positive mothers have a 25 to 30 percent \nchance of passing the virus to their babies during pregnancy and \nchildbirth. Yet, a single dose of an ARV drug given once to the mother \nat the onset of labor and once to the baby during the first three days \nof life reduces transmission of HIV by approximately 50 percent. \nProviding the full range of interventions, as is the standard of care \nin the U.S., can further reduce the rate of mother-to-child \ntransmission of HIV to as little as 2 percent. However, according to \nUNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, less than 10 \npercent of pregnant women with HIV in resource-poor countries have \naccess to prevention of mother-to-child transmission, PMTCT, services.\n  Significant barriers to PMTCT and the equal care and treatment of \nHIV-infected children continue to exist. Among the barriers to PMTCT \nservices is their poor integration into the healthcare system, the lack \nof infrastructure and poor quality health facilities, low utilization \nof pre-natal services, and a high percentage of unattended at-home \nbirths. Because children are not just small adults, providing care and \ntreatment presents special challenges such as limited access to \nreliable HIV testing for the youngest children, a shortage of providers \ntrained in delivering pediatric care, weak linkages between services to \nprevent mother-to-child transmission and care and treatment programs, \nand the need for additional, low-cost formulations of HIV/AIDS \nmedications.\n  The unfortunate reality of current HIV/AIDS treatment programs is \nthat they will become unsustainable in the long-term unless the number \nof new HIV infections is reduced globally. The importance of PMTCT for \nthe prevention of the spread of HIV cannot be overstated. According to \nUNAIDS, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission requires a \ncomprehensive package of services that includes preventing primary HIV \ninfection in\n\n[[Page S15465]]\n\nwomen, preventing unintended pregnancies in women with HIV infection, \npreventing transmission from HIV-infected pregnant women to their \ninfants, and providing care, treatment and support for HIV-infected \nwomen and their families. A 2003 study found that by adding family \nplanning through PMTCT services in 14 high prevalence countries, more \nthan 150,000 unintended pregnancies were averted, child infections \naverted nearly doubled, and child deaths averted nearly quadrupled. \nStudies also show that current levels of contraceptive use in sub-\nSaharan Africa are already preventing an estimated 22 percent of HIV-\npositive births.\n  For many pregnant mothers, PMTCT services may be the only entry point \nfor health care services for themselves and their families. That is why \nit is essential that PMTCT services be integrated with prevention, care \nand treatment services. With adequate integration of those services and \nstrategies to ensure successful follow-up and continuity of care, we \ncan significantly improve the outcomes for HIV-affected women and \nfamilies.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS \nPrevention and Treatment Act, will help prevent thousands of new \npediatric HIV infections in the years to come and improve the treatment \nof children living with HIV/AIDS throughout the world. The legislation \nwill bring our international HIV/AIDS efforts in line with the \ninfection rate of children, by establishing a target that, within 5 \nyears, 15 percent of those receiving care and treatment under PEPFAR \nshould be children.\n  The legislation establishes another 5-year target to help prevent \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV. In those countries most affected, \n80 percent of pregnant women should receive HIV counseling and testing, \nwith all those testing positive receiving anti-retroviral medication \nfor the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n  Under the legislation, the U.S. comprehensive, 5-year global strategy \nto combat global HIV/AIDS must also integrate prevention, care and \ntreatment with prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, as \nsoon as feasible and consistent with the national government policies \nof the foreign countries of PEPFAR countries in order to improve \noutcomes for HIV-affected women and families and to promote follow-up \nand continuity of care.\n  Lastly, the legislation authorizes the creation of a Prevention of \nMother-to-Child Transmission Expert Panel to provide an objective \nreview of PMTCT activities funded under PEPFAR and to provide \nrecommendations to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator for scale-\nup of mother-to-child transmission prevention services under PEPFAR in \norder to reach the newly-established target for PTMCT. The Panel \nconsists of no more than 15 members, to be appointed by the \ncoordinator, and will terminate once it submits its report containing \nrecommendations, findings and conclusions to the coordinator, Congress, \nand is made public.\n  To be clear, this legislation does not establish any earmarks within \nPEPFAR. It does not dictate how much money should be spent on specific \nactivities. I, for one, oppose the current policy under PEPFAR which \ndictates that one-third of all prevention funds be reserved for \nabstinence-until-marriage programs, to the detriment of other more \neffective programs that are producing better results. Certainly \nabstinence programs have a role to play in PEPFAR, but they should not \ndraw funding away from other, more effective programs. Therefore, it is \nmy hope that Congress does away with that earmark when it reauthorizes \nPEPFAR, and instead allows for flexibility within PEPFAR.\n  Instead, the legislation sets 5-year targets that are focused on \nthose receiving services without specifying how much money any given \ncountry should spend on specific services to reach the target. I \nbelieve this approach is consistent with the April 2007 Institute of \nMedicine report on PEPFAR which called on Congress to replace arbitrary \nbudget directives with specific targets accounting for the unique \nepidemics in specific countries, as well as existing available \nresources. Removal of budget restrictions and the implementation of \nprogram targets, such as those authorized under this legislation, would \nallow local providers to invest in the services and activities most \nneeded to achieve national goals for prevention, care, and treatment.\n  The struggle against this disease continues on all fronts. Just \nrecently, a report showed that right here in Washington, D.C., the city \nis in the grip of a ``modern epidemic,'' with one in 20 residents HIV-\ninfected, a rate ten times the national average. In my own State of \nConnecticut, the need for care and treatment services is at an all time \nhigh, while the funding to meet this increased need has declined.\n  As we take stock of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and our progress against \nit, we must bear in mind the special vulnerability of the world's \nchildren. With this legislation we can increase the number of children \nreceiving care and treatment under PEPFAR and expand access to PMTCT \nservices in order to prevent thousands of new pediatric HIV infections.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS \n     Prevention and Treatment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 2 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (26 U.S.C. 7601) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) In 2007, the rate at which children accessed \n     treatment failed to keep pace with new pediatric infections. \n     While children account for almost 16 percent of all new HIV \n     infections, they make up only 9 percent of those receiving \n     treatment under this Act.'';\n       (2) by amending paragraph (16) to read as follows:\n       ``(16) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections \n     and to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, \n     such as voluntary counseling and testing, are achieving \n     meaningful results and are cost-effective. The challenge is \n     to expand these interventions to a national basis in a \n     coherent and sustainable manner.''; and\n       (3) by amending paragraph (20) to read as follows:\n       ``(20) With no medical intervention, mothers infected with \n     HIV have a 25 to 30 percent chance of passing the virus to \n     their babies during pregnancy and childbirth. A simple and \n     effective intervention can significantly reduce mother to \n     child transmission of HIV. A single dose of an anti-\n     retroviral drug given once to the mother at the onset of \n     labor, and once to the baby during the first 3 days of life \n     reduces transmission by approximately 50 percent. Other more \n     complex drug regimens can further reduce transmission from \n     mother-to-child. A dramatic expansion of access to prevention \n     of mother-to-child transmission services is critical to \n     preventing thousands of new pediatric HIV infections.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Every day, approximately 1,100 children around the \n     world are infected with HIV, the vast majority through \n     mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, labor or \n     delivery or soon after through breast-feeding. Approximately \n     90 percent of these infections occur in Africa.\n       ``(2) With no medical intervention, mothers infected with \n     HIV have a 25 to 30 percent chance of passing the virus to \n     their babies during pregnancy and childbirth.

The Joint \n     United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reports that \n     fewer than 10 percent of pregnant women with HIV in resource-\n     poor countries have access to prevention of mother-to-child \n     transmission services.\n       ``(5) Prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs \n     provide health benefits for women and children beyond \n     preventing the vertical transmission of HIV. They serve as an \n     entry point for mothers to access treatment for their own HIV \n     infection, allowing them to stay healthy and to care for \n     their children. Efforts to connect and integrate prevention \n     of mother-to-child transmission and HIV care, treatment and \n     prevention programs are crucial to achieving improved \n     outcomes for HIV-affected and HIV-infected women and \n     families.\n       ``(6) Access to comprehensive HIV prevention services must \n     be drastically scaled-up among pregnant women infected with \n     HIV and pregnant women not infected with HIV to further \n     protect themselves and their partners against the sexual \n     transmission of HIV/AIDS.\n       ``(7) Preventing unintended pregnancy among HIV-infected \n     women is recognized by the World Health Organization and the \n     Office of the United States Global AIDS Coordinator to be an \n     integral component of prevention of mother-to-child \n     transmission programs. To further reduce infection rates, \n     women accessing prevention of mother-to-child transmission \n     services must have access to a range of high-quality family \n     planning and reproductive health care, so they can make \n     informed decisions about future pregnancies and \n     contraception.\n       ``(8) In 2007, the rate at which children were accessing \n     treatment failed to keep pace with new pediatric infections. \n     While children account for almost 16 percent of all new HIV \n     infections, they make up only 9 percent of those on treatment \n     under this Act.\n       ``(9) Of the more than 2,500,000 people who were newly \n     infected with HIV in 2007, more than 420,000 were children.\n       ``(10) Without proper care and treatment, half of newly \n     HIV-infected children will die before they reach 2 years of \n     age, and 75 percent will die before 5 years of age.\n       ``(11) Because children are not just small adults, \n     providing HIV care and treatment presents special challenges, \n     including--\n       ``(A) limited access to reliable HIV testing for the \n     youngest children;\n       ``(B) a shortage of providers trained in delivering \n     pediatric care;\n       ``(C) weak linkages between services to prevent mother-to-\n     child transmission and care and treatment programs; and\n       ``(D) the need for low-cost pediatric formulations of HIV/\n     AIDS medications.\n\n     ``SEC. 312.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to provide special reporting and disclosure rules for \nindividual account plans and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce, along with \nSenator Kohl, the Defined Contribution Fee Disclosure Act. This \nlegislation is designed to address what may seem at first glance like a \nsmall issue, but in fact has a dramatic impact on the retirement \nsecurity of millions of Americans who have 401(k) plans. Not many \npeople realize this, but the Employee Retirement Income Security act, \nERISA, does not require plan sponsors to provide participants with \ninformation on the level of fees that participants are charged by the \nvarious plans they have to choose between.\n  The number of people participating in defined contribution plans \ngrows every year, and unfortunately, these plans are a bigger part of \ntheir nest egg as employers freeze their defined benefit plans. One of \nthe key challenges as we move away from guaranteed benefits is making \nsure people have all the relevant information to help them decide which \nplan will best serve their needs. Recently, AARP conducted a survey in \nwhich it asked individuals with 401(k) plans if they even knew what \nthey paid each year in fees. Only 17 percent of people asked said that \nthey know what their fee levels were.\n  This is far from an academic matter. In fact, this could be \ndisastrous for folks when they reach retirement. One person--who wishes \nto remain anonymous--recently shared with me a story that highlights \nwhat's at stake. She noticed one day that her 401(k) wasn't actually \nearning anything at all. After some examination, she found that the \nagent who set up the plan for the company received a fee of 2 percent \nannually for the first five years, reduced to .25 percent after that, \npaid by the employees and not the company. The investment firm charged \na fee of 1.25 percent which they said was standard for companies with \nunder $1 million in their 401ks. So, last year, she was paying 3.25 \npercent in fees and earning less than 4 percent from her money market \nfund. She didn't have a clue about the fees until she inquired after \nshe realized she wasn't making any money on the fund.\n  So looking back at this AARP survey, of those 17 percent who said \nthey knew what their fees were, 33 percent thought they weren't being \ncharged any fees at all. Some companies will even tell people they are \nnot being charged fees. While it is true that in some cases, employers \npay fees, that is hardly the norm. And investment managers don't do \ntheir jobs for charity. These fees that people don't know about can \nhave a big effect on what they end up with at retirement.\n  The U.S. Government Accountability Office recently estimated that a \n45 year old with $20,000 in his 401(k) would have $70,555 at age 65 for \nhis retirement, assuming he was getting a 6.5 percent return and only \npaying 0.5 percent in fees. But that figure decreases dramatically if \nthe fees are increased by just a single percentage point, to 1.5 \npercent. At that figure the same individual, investing the same amount \nof money, would have only $58,400 for his retirement, or more than \n$12,000 less.\n  AARP took the GAO assumptions and created some additional examples. \nConsider this case: if a 35 year old invested $20,000 in a 401(k) plan \nover 30 years, paying 0.5 percent in fees, that individual would have \n$132,287 for retirement. But increase the fees to 1.5 percent, and the \namount available for retirement is only $99,679--that is a 25 percent \nreduction in the account balance. Even if the fee only increased from \n0.5 percent to 1 percent, the value of the retirement account would be \nreduced by $17,417, or a little over 13 percent over the 30-year \nperiod.\n  If you awoke one day to find that your bank account, or your \nretirement account, had declined in value by 25 percent, you would \nunderstandably be alarmed, and you would act quickly to fix the \nproblem. But with high 401(k) fees, the reduction in benefits isn't \nimmediately obvious. It happens slowly, over time, and often flies \nunder people's radar screens because they are not told the level of \nfees they are paying, or they don't understand that some 401(k) plans \ncharge far lower fees for providing the same amount of services. It is \nthat problem--that information gap--that the Defined Contribution Fee \nDisclosure Act is designed to fix.\n  My bill would provide participants with easily understandable \ninformation about the fees that they are paying. This information will \nbe provided to them before they pick which plans they want to invest \nin, and again, regularly, on their quarterly statements.\n  In addition, this bill does something even more important: it would \nrequire companies to disclose more information to plan sponsors. Right \nnow, if you provide your workers with a 401(k) plan, you are required \nto act prudently and in their sole interest in your fiduciary duties. \nHowever, there are hidden fees that are sometimes not disclosed even to \nplan sponsors, and sometimes those sponsors also are not told about \nbusiness arrangements between service providers to steer participants \ninto investment options in which they have a stake, a classic conflict \nof interest.\n  To fix this, the bill would require 401(k) plan providers to disclose \nall fees and relationships between service providers to the people \nselecting the plan a company will ultimately offer. The bottom line is \nthat we want to create a situation where companies are picking several \ngood options for their employees that all have decent reliable returns \nand fair fees.\n  One thing my bill does not do is set a limit on fees that can be \ncharged. As I have noted, high fees can make a real difference in \naccount balances at retirement, but so can high returns, in a more \npositive direction, obviously. Sometimes, it is well worth paying \nhigher fees if a small increase in fees will have a big effect on \nreturns. In addition, some people want to purchase insurance products \nso that every month, they are buying a more secure piece of retirement. \nThat is just fine, and my bill doesn't touch that. People who fully \nunderstand the real cost of a guaranteed return at retirement are the \nkind of people who appreciate, and will push for, more defined benefit \nplans. But they can't do that if they don't know what it costs.\n  The bottom line is that people need to be investing more, and more \nconfidently, in the 401(k) plans they are being offered. This is \nespecially critical in a world where defined benefit plans are \nincreasingly being slashed and frozen. For a growing number of workers, \ntheir only source of retirement income is their 401(k).\n  Congress needs to focus more squarely on how we get workers to \nparticipate in the plans they have available, and what we can do to \nmake sure the savings they grow in them are adequate. When people know \nthey are being given all the facts in an easy-to-understand manner, \nthey are more likely to contribute. And when the fiduciaries who are \nsupposed to be looking out for them make sure all of their\n\n[[Page S15468]]\n\noptions are good, they end up saving more money at the end of the day.\n  This bill is a win for companies who want to provide their workers \nwith a secure retirement, it is a win for 401(k) providers who have \nbeen providing reasonable fees all along, and it is a win for every \nAmerican who has one of these plans. My colleagues and I introducing \nthis measure have worked with interested parties on every side of this \nissue to make sure we're taking into account everyone's views. We also \nintend to work closely with the Department of Labor on their proposed \nregulations on this issue. While we believe that Congress has an \nobligation to address this issue, if we can all work together to \ndevelop regulations that address this issue in a way that will truly \nhelp participants and beneficiaries get a good deal, I am certainly not \nopposed to getting this done administratively. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this measure.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nhidden fees associated with 401(k) plans, an important issue affecting \nthe retirement security of millions of Americans. These fees, currently \nnot disclosed to plan participants, can have a drastic effect on one's \nretirement savings.\n  More and more Americans are relying on defined contribution plans, \nsuch as 401(k) plans, to provide their retirement income. Although \nthese plans have only been in existence since the 1980s, they now cover \nover 50 million people and exceed $2.5 trillion in total assets. Of \nthose private sector workers with any type of retirement benefit; two \nthirds have only their 401(k) savings to secure their financial \nwellbeing in retirement.\n  Although 401(k)s have become the primary pension fund for most \nAmericans, there are few requirements for fee disclosure to fund \nmanagers, and there are absolutely no regulations requiring that plan \nparticipants be notified about how much they are paying in fees. Most \nfees are either absent or obscured in participant statements and \ninvestment reports. Not surprisingly, studies have shown that fewer \nthan one in five participants know the fees they are paying. \nUnfortunately, this lack of disclosure and lack of understanding can \nhave serious consequences on an individual's retirement savings.\n  The slightest difference in fees can translate into a staggering \ndepletion in savings, greatly affecting one's ability to build a secure \nretirement. According to the Congressional Research Service, families \nwho save their retirement funds in high-fee accounts could have one-\nquarter less in retirement than those who work for employers who offer \nlow-fee accounts. For couples who save over their entire lifetime, the \nCRS study found that an annual fee of 2 percent could reduce savings by \nnearly $130,000, compared to a more reasonable fee of 0.4 percent.\n  Today, Senators Harkin and I are introducing the Defined Contribution \nFee Disclosure Act of 2007. We believe consumers have the right to \nclearly know how much products and services are costing them. Our bill \nwill help shed some light on these fees by requiring complete \ntransparency to both employers and participants. This will allow \nemployers to negotiate with pension fund managers, in order to get the \nlowest possible fees for their employees. Participants will be able to \nmake informed choices between investment options and potentially \nincrease their retirement savings by thousands of dollars. Ultimately, \nthis legislation will help lower costs for everyone by fostering \ncompetition among pension managers.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 2475. A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to provide an exception for certain States with respect to \nthe distribution of amounts by the Secretary of the Interior from the \nAbandoned Mine Reclamation Fund; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nallow seven States to more aggressively address the health and safety \nissues that threaten the citizens in their State, and do so \nimmediately. I commend my fellow Kansas colleague, Congresswoman Nancy \nBoyda, for introducing similar legislation in the House.\n  Last December, Congress passed amendments to the Surface Mining \nControl and Reclamation Act in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n2006 to extend the Abandoned Mines Land Trust Fund for 15 additional \nyears. These amendments established a new distribution formula that \nworks through a 4 year,program that phases in funding. Unfortunately, \nthere are currently seven States that do not meet the active mining \nthreshold to meet the minimum funding threshold. Today, I offer \nlegislation that would allow ``minimum program states'' like Kansas to \nreceive their full funding levels of $3 million starting in the fiscal \nyear 2008, instead of requiring the minimum States to follow the \npercentage distribution formula. This legislation will assist several \nother States including Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alaska, and \nMaryland. With this funding, States can begin to protect their \nresidents from the dangers of abandoned mines sooner rather than later.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SUNUNU (for himself and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 2478. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 59 Colby Corner in East Hampstead, New Hampshire, as \nthe ``Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh Post Office''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, on behalf of Hampstead, NH, middle school \nstudents, school board officials, board of selectmen, and residents, I \nrise to honor a fallen hero, U.S. Army Ranger CAPT Jonathan David \nGrassbaugh, by introducing a bill to designate the United States Postal \nService facility at 59 Colby Corner in East Hampstead, NH, as the \nCaptain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh Post Office.\n  Jon, as he was called by his family and friends, moved to East \nHampstead, NH, from St. Marys, OH, in 1989. He attended Hampstead \nCentral Elementary School and Hampstead Middle School, where his \nmother, Patricia, is principal.\n  Jon graduated high school from Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, \nNH, where he was a 4-year honor student in the Class of 1999. Jon left \na remarkable impression on the Phillips Exeter community; remembered \nfor his manifestation of the motto ``Non Sibi'' or ``Not for Oneself,'' \na Latin phrase inscribed on the Academy's seal. Jon exemplified his \npassion for life through his persistent dedication to his studies, \ntireless volunteer efforts in school and the local community, \ncommitment to the academy's radio station, Grainger Observatory, and \nthe school's Washington internship program.\n  Jon's illustrious high school years were prologue to a promising \nfuture, full of infinite potential. Jon enrolled at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, where he graduated in 2003, earning a bachelors degree in \ncomputer science from the renowned Whiting School of Engineering.\n  At a young age, Jon's family instilled in him the importance of \nvolunteerism and service to the U.S. Jon's father, Mark, proudly served \n3\\1/2\\ years as an Army Ranger during Vietnam, and his older brother, \nWest Point alum and Dartmouth Medical School graduate, Army Captain Dr. \nJason Grassbaugh, is currently serving as an orthopedic surgeon in Fort \nLewis, WA. Jon continued this family tradition of service, joining the \nJohns Hopkins Army ROTC program, and eventually becoming battalion \ncommander his senior year. He also became a proud member of the \nPershing Rifles fraternal organization, captained the Ranger Challenge \nTeam, and won the national two-man duet drill team competition.\n  In a storybook setting, Jon met Jenna Parkinson, a freshman ROTC \ncadet from Boxborough MA, during his senior year. Jon and Jenna slowly \ngrew closer, watching movies together during spring break, sharing \nflights to and from school, and attending the military ball. A few \nshort years later, Jon proposed to Jenna on April 30, 2005, and the \nyoung couple subsequently married on June 9, 2006, in a Cape Cod \nceremony. Prior to their wedding day, Jon and Jenna filled out a \nquestionnaire for their officiate, which asked, ``Where is a sacred \nspot, a place where you feel most connected, most at peace and most \ninspired?'' Jon's answer came in three loving words: ``With my wife.''\n\n[[Page S15469]]\n\n  Following graduation, Jon completed U.S. Army Ranger School in April \n2004 and served his country both at home and abroad. He was assigned to \nthe 7th Cavalry in the Republic of South Korea and served as a member \nof the Army Hurricane Katrina Relief Team. Later, Jon was assigned to \nthe 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd \nAirborne Division in Fort Bragg, NC, where he and the now U.S. Army 2nd \nLieutenant Jenna Grassbaugh would reside.\n  Shortly after Jon and Jenna were married, he was deployed for a \nsecond tour of duty, in Iraq. Tragically, on April 7, 2007, Jon was one \nof four soldiers who died while conducting a combat logistics patrol in \nZaganiyah, Iraq. Throughout Jon's distinguished military service, he \nreceived a number of accolades and commendations, including: the Bronze \nStar Medal, Purple Heart Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Army \nCommendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Army Achievement \nMedal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, Korean Defense Service Medal, Humanitarian \nService Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Ranger Tab, Combat Action Badge, \nand Parachutist Badge.\n  Jon is remembered as a confident and mentally strong leader, whose \npoise under pressure, intelligence, compassion, and love for God, \ncountry and family transcends his passing. His valor on the field of \nbattle was equally as impressive as his undying loyalty to and love for \nhis squadron. One well-known anecdote recalls a combat operation in \nwhich Jon had pizza flown by helicopter from 100 kilometers away to \nwhere his troops were conducting combat operations in an effort to lift \nmorale. Jon left a legacy that continues to inspire our Nation's future \nleaders from Hampstead and Exeter, NH, Johns Hopkins, and those he \nproudly served beside in Iraq.\n  On a deep and personal note, for those who had the sincere privilege \nand honor to meet Jon, it was evident his exuberance for life and new \nexperiences, ingenuity, and academic acumen destined him for greatness. \nBy the time of his death, Jon had achieved more than most individuals \ndo in a lifetime, a testimonial to his family's love and guidance \nthrough his young life, and Jenna's warmth and support as he fought for \nour Nation.\n  Today, Jonathan Grassbaugh rests in peace at one of our Nation's most \nhallowed and sacred grounds, Arlington National Cemetery--his rightful \nplace among generations of brave Americans who sacrificed their lives \nin defense of this country. His loved ones will forever remember him as \na loving husband, son, brother, and friend. Let it be known, the \ncitizens of New Hampshire and our Nation are eternally in debt to \nJonathan David Grassbaugh, an honorable son of New Hampshire, an \nAmerican Patriot, and a guardian of liberty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Town of Hampstead,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Selectmen,\n\n                                    Hampstead, NH, December, 2007.\n     Re Petition of dedication.\n\n     Office of U.S. Senator John E.

A bill to catalyze change in the care and treatment of \ndiabetes in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing, along with Senator \nCornyn, an important bill--the Catalyst for Better Diabetes Care Act--\nthat will enhance and better coordinate our Nation's fight against \ndiabetes.\n  It is estimated that one out of every three Americans born after the \nyear 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime. This startling \nstatistic should be reason enough for this body to act swiftly and \ndecisively on this issue. We must increase our investment into this \ndeadly and costly disease before the epidemic reaches overwhelming \nproportions. The Catalyst for Better Diabetes Care Act marks an \nimportant step in this effort by focusing the government's attention on \nspecific areas in diabetes care that can and must be improved.\n  First, we must ensure that all Americans are aware of the importance \nand availability of diabetes screening. Like any preventable and \nmanageable disease, early diagnosis of diabetes is key. Yet millions of \nAmericans--nearly a third of the 20-plus million Americans with \ndiabetes--have diabetes but don't know it. Recognizing the enormity of \nthis problem, many of us in Congress fought hard in recent years to \ninclude a diabetes screening benefit in Medicare, a program that \nalready spends a third of its total budget on diabetes patients. Now \nthe challenge is to ensure that Americans are fully utilizing this and \nother screening opportunities, which is exactly what this bill aims to \ndo. By establishing a collaboration and outreach program within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, this act would help \nreduce the number of Americans with diabetes who remain undiagnosed.\n  The private sector also has a role to play in this fight. Thankfully, \nmany companies have already started investing in employee wellness \nprograms that reward pro-active, preventative care. With chronic \ndiseases like diabetes driving up health insurance costs for \nindividuals and employers, it is critical that new, pre-emptive \napproaches to health care are encouraged. This bill would create an \nadvisory group in HHS to determine which wellness programs work and \nwhich do not, information that will encourage employers to provide \neffective diabetes prevention programs.\n  It is also critical to carefully monitor our effectiveness in \ncombating diabetes and the impact of this disabling and deadly \ncondition on our nation. With that information in hand, we will be far \nbetter equipped to determine the nature and scope of diabetes \nprevention and treatment strategies. The bill includes two key \nprovisions to address this need. It would create a National Diabetes \nReport Card that provides crucial information on diabetes' impact on \nthe nation. The report card would be published every 2 years. It would \nalso take steps to ensure accurate data on diabetes morbidity and \nmortality. Diabetes is often not listed anywhere on death certificates \nas a cause of death. This bill would ensure the training of physicians \non properly completing birth and death certificates and improving the \ncollection of diabetes data.\n  Finally, this act would commission an Institute of Medicine study on \ndiabetes medical education to ensure that physician training--which \ncurrently requires less than four hours of diabetes education--is \nkeeping pace with the growing threat diabetes poses to the public's \nhealth. The study would make a recommendation as to the appropriate \nlevel of diabetes medical education that should be required prior to \nlicensure, board certification, and board recertification.\n  Our country faces a tremendously challenging fight against diabetes, \nbut it is one we can and will win. The Catalyst for Better Diabetes \nCare Act is a targeted and cost-effective bill that will push us toward \nvictory. Let us act quickly and pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Durbin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Obama, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brown, and \n        Mr. Cardin):\n\n[[Page S15470]]\n\n  S. 2481. A bill to prohibit racial profiling; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce the End Racial \nProfiling Act of 2007.\n  Ending racial profiling in America has been a priority for me for \nmany years. I worked with the senior Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, back in 1999 on a bill to collect statistics on traffic \nstops, which is where the problem of racial profiling was first \nrevealed. Many studies from around the country now confirm that racial \nprofiling is indeed a real problem that wastes police resources and \ndiminishes trust between police departments and the communities they \nprotect.\n  In 2001, in his first State of the Union address, President Bush told \nthe American people that ``racial profiling is wrong and we will end it \nin America.'' He asked the Attorney General to implement a policy to \nend racial profiling. The Department of Justice released a Fact Sheet \nand Policy Guidance addressing racial profiling in 2003, stating that \nracial profiling is wrong and ineffective and perpetuates negative \nracial stereotypes in our country. Though these guidelines are helpful, \nthey do not end racial profiling and they do not have the force of law. \nUnfortunately, more than 6 years after the President's promise to the \ncountry, we have not yet ended racial profiling in this country.\n  The End Racial Profiling Act of 2007 will do what the President \npromised; it will help America achieve the goal of bringing an end to \nracial profiling. This bill bans racial profiling and requires Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officers to take steps to end this \npractice.\n  Racial profiling is the practice by which some law enforcement agents \ntreat differently African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Arab \nAmericans and others simply because of their race, ethnicity, national \norigin, or perceived religion. I have the utmost respect for law \nenforcement agents, and I believe that most of them do not engage in \nthis practice. Nonetheless, reports in States from New Jersey to \nFlorida, and Maryland to Texas all show that African Americans, \nHispanics, and members of other minority groups were stopped by some \npolice far more often than their share of the population and the crime \nrates for those racial categories.\n  Passing this bill is even more urgent after 9/11, as we have seen \nracial profiling used against Arab and Muslim Americans or Americans \nperceived to be Arab or Muslim. The 9/11 attacks were horrific, and I \nshare the determination of many Americans that finding those \nresponsible and preventing future attacks should be this Nation's top \npriority. This is a challenge that our country can and must meet. But \nto do that we need improved intelligence and law enforcement. Making \nassumptions based on racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes will not \nprotect our nation from crime or from future terrorist attacks.\n  A report released in May by the Department of Justice's Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, covering 2005 data, found that while an African \nAmerican person is now almost equally likely to be stopped as a white \nperson, he or she is more than two and a half times more likely to be \nsearched, more than twice as likely to be arrested, and more than three \nand a half times more likely to experience the use of force. Yet, \naccording to studies from multiple police jurisdictions, these \nencounters with law enforcement are less likely to reveal criminal \nactivity on the part of African Americans than whites. The flagrancy of \nthis flawed and irrational practice has led Harvard Law School \nprofessor Charles Ogletree to observe, ``If I'm dressed in a knit cap \nand hooded jacket, I'm probable cause.''\n  The disparities outlined above, which also apply to other ethnic \ngroups, have led the International Association of Chiefs of Police to \ncall for an end to racial profiling. In addition, police departments \naround the country have independently developed programs and policies \nto prevent racial profiling and comply with the Department of Justice's \npolicy guidance. In my own State of Wisconsin, law enforcement \nofficials have taken steps to train police officers, improve academy \ntraining, establish model policies prohibiting racial profiling, and \nimprove relations with our State's diverse communities. I applaud the \nefforts of Wisconsin law enforcement. This is excellent progress and \nshows widespread recognition that racial profiling harms our society. \nBut like the DOJ policy guidance, local programs don't have the force \nof law behind them. The Federal government must step up, as President \nBush promised. It must play a vital role in protecting civil rights and \nacting as a model for State and local law enforcement.\n  Now, perhaps more than ever before, our Nation cannot afford to waste \nprecious law enforcement resources or alienate Americans by tolerating \ndiscriminatory practices. The mass detention of hundreds of Middle \nEastern and Arab men on minor violations after 9/11, for example, \nresulted in not a single terrorism charge. These detentions did, \nhowever, shatter the lives of many people with no connection to \nterrorism whatsoever through lengthy disappearances, detentions, and \ndeportations.\n  Similarly, when the Federal Government required the registration of \nindividuals from Arab or Muslim countries in 2002, between 500 and \n1,000 registrants who voluntarily complied were detained in the Los \nAngeles/Orange County area alone. Such heavy-handed tactics do not help \nus in fighting terrorism--they shut off dialogue and make good people \nunwilling to risk interaction with their Government. Treating \nsympathetic communities as suspicious ones is counterproductive, and it \nis wrong.\n  It is past time for Congress and the President to enact comprehensive \nFederal legislation that will end racial profiling once and for all. In \nclear language, the End Racial Profiling Act of 2007 bans racial \nprofiling. It defines racial profiling in terms that are consistent \nwith the Department of Justice's Policy Guidance. But this bill does \nmore than prohibit and define racial profiling--it gives law \nenforcement agencies and officers the tools necessary to end the \nharmful practice. For that reason, the End Racial Profiling Act of 2007 \nis a pro-law enforcement bill.\n  This bill would allow the Justice Department or individuals to \nenforce the prohibition by filing a suit for injunctive relief. The \nbill would also require Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies to adopt policies prohibiting racial profiling, implement \neffective complaint procedures or create independent auditor programs, \nimplement disciplinary procedures for officers who engage in the \npractice, and collect data on routine and spontaneous investigatory \nactivities. In addition, it requires the Attorney General to report to \nCongress so Congress and the American people can monitor whether the \nsteps outlined in the bill to prevent and end racial profiling have \nbeen effective.\n  This bill also authorizes the Attorney General to provide incentive \ngrants to help law enforcement comply with the ban on racial profiling, \nincluding funds to conduct training of police officers or purchase in-\ncar video cameras.\n  Like the bill I introduced in 2005, this year's bill contains a \nsignificant improvement over previous versions. In some early \nproposals, DOJ grants for State and local law enforcement agencies were \ntied to the agency having some kind of procedure for handling \ncomplaints of racial profiling. At the suggestion of experts in the \nfield, the bill now requires law enforcement agencies to adopt either \nan administrative complaint procedure or an independent auditor program \nto be eligible for DOJ grants. The Attorney General must promulgate \nregulations that set out the types of procedures and audit programs \nthat will be sufficient. We believe that the independent auditor option \nwill be preferable for many local law enforcement agencies, and such \nprograms have proven to be an effective way to discourage racial \nprofiling. Also, the Attorney General is required to conduct a 2-year \ndemonstration project to help law enforcement agencies with data \ncollection.\n  Let me emphasize that local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagents play a vital role in protecting the public from crime and \nprotecting the Nation from terrorism. The vast majority of law \nenforcement agents nationwide discharge their duties professionally and \nwithout bias and we are all indebted to them for their courage and \ndedication. This bill should not be misinterpreted as a criticism of \nthose who\n\n[[Page S15471]]\n\nput their lives on the line for the rest of us each and every day. \nRather, it is a statement that the use of race, ethnicity, religion, or \nnational origin in deciding which persons should be subject to traffic \nstops, stops and frisks, questioning, searches, and seizures is wrong \nand ineffective, except where there is specific information linking \npersons of a particular race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin \nto a crime.\n  The provisions in this bill will help restore the trust and \nconfidence of the communities that our law enforcement have pledged to \nserve and protect. That confidence is crucial to our success in \nstopping crime and in stopping terrorism. The End Racial Profiling Act \nof 2007 is good for law enforcement and good for America.\n  I urge the President to make good on his pledge to end racial \nprofiling, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the End \nRacial Profiling Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND INTENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement agents play a \n     vital role in protecting the public from crime and protecting \n     the Nation from terrorism. The vast majority of law \n     enforcement agents nationwide discharge their duties \n     professionally and without bias.\n       (2) The use by police officers of race, ethnicity, national \n     origin, or religion in deciding which persons should be \n     subject to traffic stops, stops and frisks, questioning, \n     searches, and seizures is improper.\n       (3) In his address to a joint session of Congress on \n     February 27, 2001, President George W. Bush declared that \n     ``racial profiling is wrong and we will end it in America.''. \n     He directed the Attorney General to implement this policy.\n       (4) In June 2003, the Department of Justice issued a Policy \n     Guidance regarding racial profiling by Federal law \n     enforcement agencies which stated: ``Racial profiling in law \n     enforcement is not merely wrong, but also ineffective. Race-\n     based assumptions in law enforcement perpetuate negative \n     racial stereotypes that are harmful to our rich and diverse \n     democracy, and materially impair our efforts to maintain a \n     fair and just society.''.\n       (5) The Department of Justice Guidance is a useful first \n     step, but does not achieve the President's stated goal of \n     ending racial profiling in America, as--\n       (A) it does not apply to State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (B) it does not contain a meaningful enforcement mechanism;\n       (C) it does not require data collection; and\n       (D) it contains an overbroad exception for immigration and \n     national security matters.\n       (6) Current efforts by State and local governments to \n     eradicate racial profiling and redress the harms it causes, \n     while also laudable, have been limited in scope and \n     insufficient to address this national problem. Therefore, \n     Federal legislation is needed.\n       (7) Statistical evidence from across the country \n     demonstrates that racial profiling is a real and measurable \n     phenomenon.\n       (8) As of November 15, 2000, the Department of Justice had \n     14 publicly noticed, ongoing, pattern or practice \n     investigations involving allegations of racial profiling and \n     had filed 5 pattern or practice lawsuits involving \n     allegations of racial profiling, with 4 of those cases \n     resolved through consent decrees.\n       (9) A large majority of individuals subjected to stops and \n     other enforcement activities based on race, ethnicity, \n     national origin, or religion are found to be law abiding and \n     therefore racial profiling is not an effective means to \n     uncover criminal activity.\n       (10) A 2001 Department of Justice report on citizen-police \n     contacts that occurred in 1999, found that, although Blacks \n     and Hispanics were more likely to be stopped and searched, \n     they were less likely to be in possession of contraband. On \n     average, searches and seizures of Black drivers yielded \n     evidence only 8 percent of the time, searches and seizures of \n     Hispanic drivers yielded evidence only 10 percent of the \n     time, and searches and seizures of White drivers yielded \n     evidence 17 percent of the time.\n       (11) A 2000 General Accounting Office report on the \n     activities of the United States Customs Service during fiscal \n     year 1998 found that--\n       (A) Black women who were United States citizens were 9 \n     times more likely than White women who were United States \n     citizens to be x-rayed after being frisked or patted down;\n       (B) Black women who were United States citizens were less \n     than half as likely as White women who were United States \n     citizens to be found carrying contraband; and\n       (C) in general, the patterns used to select passengers for \n     more intrusive searches resulted in women and minorities \n     being selected at rates that were not consistent with the \n     rates of finding contraband.\n       (12) A 2005 report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics of \n     the Department of Justice on citizen-police contacts that \n     occurred in 2002, found that, although Whites, Blacks, and \n     Hispanics were stopped by the police at the same rate--\n       (A) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to be \n     arrested than Whites;\n       (B) Hispanics were much more likely to be ticketed than \n     Blacks or Whites;\n       (C) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to report \n     the use or threatened use of force by a police officer;\n       (D) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to be \n     handcuffed than Whites; and\n       (E) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to have \n     their vehicles searched than Whites.\n       (13) In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement \n     practices, such as ticket and arrest quotas and similar \n     management practices, may have the unintended effect of \n     encouraging law enforcement agents to engage in racial \n     profiling.\n       (14) Racial profiling harms individuals subjected to it \n     because they experience fear, anxiety, humiliation, anger, \n     resentment, and cynicism when they are unjustifiably treated \n     as criminal suspects. By discouraging individuals from \n     traveling freely, racial profiling impairs both interstate \n     and intrastate commerce.\n       (15) Racial profiling damages law enforcement and the \n     criminal justice system as a whole by undermining public \n     confidence and trust in the police, the courts, and the \n     criminal law.\n       (16) In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, many Arabs, Muslims, Central and South Asians, and \n     Sikhs, as well as other immigrants and Americans of foreign \n     descent, were treated with generalized suspicion and \n     subjected to searches and seizures based upon religion and \n     national origin, without trustworthy information linking \n     specific individuals to criminal conduct. Such profiling has \n     failed to produce tangible benefits, yet has created a fear \n     and mistrust of law enforcement agencies in these \n     communities.\n       (17) Racial profiling violates the equal protection clause \n     of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States. Using race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin \n     as a proxy for criminal suspicion violates the constitutional \n     requirement that police and other government officials accord \n     to all citizens the equal protection of the law. Batson v. \n     Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429 \n     (1984).\n       (18) Racial profiling is not adequately addressed through \n     suppression motions in criminal cases for 2 reasons. First, \n     the Supreme Court held, in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. \n     806 (1996), that the racially discriminatory motive of a \n     police officer in making an otherwise valid traffic stop does \n     not warrant the suppression of evidence under the fourth \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Second, \n     since most stops do not result in the discovery of \n     contraband, there is no criminal prosecution and no evidence \n     to suppress.\n       (19) A comprehensive national solution is needed to address \n     racial profiling at the Federal, State, and local levels. \n     Federal support is needed to combat racial profiling through \n     specialized training of law enforcement agents, improved \n     management systems, and the acquisition of technology such as \n     in-car video cameras.\n\n[[Page S15472]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enforce the constitutional right to equal protection \n     of the laws, pursuant to the fifth amendment and section 5 of \n     the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       (2) to enforce the constitutional right to protection \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, pursuant to the \n     fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       (3) to enforce the constitutional right to interstate \n     travel, pursuant to section 2 of article IV of the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       (4) to regulate interstate commerce, pursuant to clause 3 \n     of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Intent.--This Act is not intended to and should not \n     impede the ability of Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement to protect the country and its people from any \n     threat, be it foreign or domestic.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 404\n\n       Whereas, for the past 62 years, until November 28, 2007, \n     the International Tracing Service (ITS) archives located in \n     Bad Arolsen, Germany remained the largest closed Holocaust-\n     era archives in the world;\n       Whereas, while Holocaust survivors and their descendants \n     have had limited access to individual records, reports \n     suggest that they faced long delays, incomplete information, \n     and even unresponsiveness when they tried to access the \n     materials in the archives;\n       Whereas the 1955 Bonn Accords established the International \n     Commission (on which 11 member nations sit: Belgium, France, \n     Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \n     Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States) \n     responsible for overseeing the administration of the ITS \n     Holocaust archives, which includes 17,500,000 individual \n     names and 50,000,000 documents;\n       Whereas, until ITC received the ratification of the 2006 \n     amendments to the Bonn Accords from the last remaining member \n     nation on November 28, 2007, the materials remained \n     inaccessible to researchers and research institutions;\n       Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) \n     and the Director of the ITS, who is an ICRC employee, oversee \n     the day-to-day operations of the ITS and report to the \n     International Commission for the ITS at its annual meetings;\n       Whereas the new International Committee of the Red Cross \n     leadership at the ITS should be commended for their \n     commitment to providing expedited and comprehensive responses \n     to Holocaust survivor requests for information, and for their \n     efforts to complete the digitization of all archives as soon \n     as possible;\n       Whereas, since the inception of the ITS, the Government of \n     Germany has financed its operations;\n       Whereas, beginning in the late 1990s, the United States \n     Holocaust Memorial Museum (Holocaust Museum), Holocaust \n     survivor organizations, and others began exerting pressure on \n     International Commission members to allow unfettered access \n     to the ITS archives;\n       Whereas, following years of delay, in May 2006 in \n     Luxembourg the International Commission of the ITS agreed \n     upon amendments to the Bonn Accords which would grant \n     researchers access to the archives and would allow each \n     Commission member country to receive a digitized copy of the \n     archives and make them available to researchers, consistent \n     with their own country's respective archival and privacy laws \n     and practices;\n       Whereas the first 3 Commission member states to ratify the \n     amendments were the United States, Israel, and Poland, all 3 \n     of which are home to hundreds of thousands of survivors of \n     Nazi brutality;\n       Whereas the Holocaust Museum has worked assiduously for \n     years to ensure the timely release of the archives to \n     survivors and the public;\n       Whereas the Department of State has been engaged in \n     diplomatic efforts with other Commission member nations to \n     provide open access to the archives;\n       Whereas the House of Representatives unanimously passed H. \n     Res. 240 on April 25, 2007, and the United States Senate \n     passed S. Res. 141 on May 1, 2007, urging all member \n     countries of the International Commission of the ITS who have \n     yet to ratify the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn \n     Accords to expedite the ratification process, to allow for \n     open access to the archives;\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2007, the International Commission \n     voted in favor of a United States proposal to allow immediate \n     transfer of a digital copy of archived materials to any of \n     the 11 member states that have adopted the May 2006 \n     amendments to the Bonn Accords, and thereafter, transfer of \n     materials to both the Holocaust Museum and to Yad Vashem, the \n     Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in \n     Israel, was initiated;\n       Whereas, while it is not possible to fully compensate \n     Holocaust survivors for the pain, suffering, and loss of \n     loved ones they have experienced, it is a moral and \n     justifiable imperative for Holocaust survivors and their \n     families to be offered expedited open access to these \n     archives;\n       Whereas time is of the essence in order for Holocaust \n     researchers to access the archives while eyewitnesses to the \n     horrific atrocities of Nazi Germany are still alive;\n       Whereas opening the historic record is a vital contribution \n     to the world's collective memory and understanding of the \n     Holocaust and ensures that unchecked anti-Semitism and \n     complete disrespect for the value of human life--including \n     the crimes committed against non-Jewish victims--which made \n     such horrors possible are never again permitted to take hold;\n       Whereas, despite overwhelming international recognition of \n     the unconscionable horrors of the Holocaust and its \n     devastating impact on world Jewry, there has been a sharp \n     increase in anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial across the \n     globe in recent years; and\n       Whereas it is critical that the international community \n     continue to heed the lessons of the Holocaust, one of the \n     darkest periods in the history of humankind, and take \n     immediate and decisive measures to combat the scourge of \n     anti-Semitism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends in the strongest terms all nations that worked \n     expeditiously to ratify the amendments to the Bonn Accords to \n     allow for open access to the Holocaust Archives located at \n     Bad Arolsen, Germany;\n       (2) congratulates the dedication, commitment, and \n     collaborative efforts of the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum, the Department of State, and the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross to open the archives;\n       (3) encourages the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum \n     and the International Committee of the Red Cross to act with \n     all possible urgency to create appropriate conditions to \n     ensure that survivors, their families, and researchers have \n     direct access to the archives and are offered effective \n     assistance in navigating and interpreting these archives;\n       (4) remembers and pays tribute to the murder of 6,000,000 \n     innocent Jews and more than 5,000,000 other innocent victims \n     during the Holocaust by Nazi perpetrators and their \n     collaborators; and\n       (5) must remain vigilant in combating global anti-Semitism, \n     intolerance, and bigotry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15475-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15475-S15476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 405--RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF HENRY \n                               JOHN HYDE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nDeMint, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sununu, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Allard, Mr. \nBunning, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \nColeman, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Thune, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Craig, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Smith, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nInhofe, and Mr. Corker) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 405\n\n       Whereas Representative Henry John Hyde of Illinois was born \n     in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, on April 18, 1924;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde excelled as a student both at Georgetown \n     University, at which he helped take the Hoyas basketball team \n     to the National Collegiate Athletic Association semifinals in \n     1943 and from which he graduated with a bachelor of science \n     degree in 1947, and at Loyola University Chicago School of \n     Law, from which he graduated in 1949;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde served his country for his entire adult \n     life, as an officer of the United States Navy from 1944 to \n     1946, where he served in combat in the Philippines during \n     World War II, in the United States Navy Reserve from 1946 to \n     1968, from which he retired at the rank of Commander, as a \n     member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1967 to \n     1974 and Majority Leader of that body from 1971 to 1972, as a \n     delegate to the Illinois Republican State Conventions from \n     1958 to 1974, and as a Republican Member of the United States \n     House of Representatives for 16 Congresses, over 3 decades \n     from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 2007;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde served as the Ranking Member on the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives from 1985 to 1991, in the 99th through 101st\n\n[[Page S15476]]\n\n     Congresses, and as chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary \n     of the House of Representatives from the 104th through 106th \n     Congresses and the Committee on International Relations from \n     the 107th through 109th Congresses;\n       Whereas, in his capacity as a United States Representative, \n     Henry Hyde tirelessly served as a champion for children, both \n     born and unborn, and relentlessly defended the rule of law;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde demonstrated his commitment to the rule \n     of law during his tenure in the House of Representatives, \n     once stating, ``The rule of law is no pious aspiration from a \n     civics textbook. The rule of law is what stands between us \n     and the arbitrary exercise of power by the state. The rule of \n     law is the safeguard of our liberties. The rule of law is \n     what allows us to live our freedom in ways that honor the \n     freedom of others while strengthening the common good. . . If \n     across the river in Arlington Cemetery there are American \n     heroes who died in defense of the rule of law, can we give \n     less than the full measure of our devotion to that great \n     cause?'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde was a key player in some of the highest \n     level debates concerning the response to the terrorist \n     attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde received the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, on November 5, \n     2007, at a ceremony at which President George W. Bush \n     explained about Representative Hyde, ``He used his persuasive \n     powers for noble causes. He stood for a strong and purposeful \n     America--confident in freedom's advance, and firm in \n     freedom's defense. He stood for limited, accountable \n     government, and the equality of every person before the law. \n     He was a gallant champion of the weak and forgotten, and a \n     fearless defender of life in all its seasons.'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde's greatest legacy is as the author, \n     during his freshman term in the House of Representatives, of \n     an amendment to the 1976 Departments of Labor and Health, \n     Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act--commonly referred \n     to as the Hyde Amendment--that prohibits Federal dollars from \n     being used to pay for the abortion of unborn babies, which \n     conservative figures estimate has saved at least 1,000,000 \n     lives;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde lived by the belief that we will all be \n     judged by our Creator in the end for our actions here on \n     Earth, which he once explained on the floor of the House of \n     Representatives by saying, ``Our moment in history is marked \n     by a mortal conflict between a culture of life and a culture \n     of death. God put us in the world to do noble things, to love \n     and to cherish our fellow human beings, not to destroy them. \n     Today we must choose sides.'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde selflessly battled for the causes that \n     formed the core of his beliefs until the end of his life, and \n     was greatly respected by his friends and adversaries alike \n     for his dedication and will remain a role model for advocates \n     of those causes by virtue of his conviction, passion, wisdom, \n     and character; and\n       Whereas Henry Hyde was preceded in death by his first wife, \n     Jeanne, and his son Hank, and is survived by his second wife, \n     Judy, his sons Robert and Anthony and daughter Laura, 3 \n     stepchildren, Susan, Mitch, and Stephen, 7 grandchildren, and \n     7 step-grandchildren: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) notes with deep sorrow the death of Henry John Hyde on \n     November 29, 2007, in Chicago;\n       (2) extends its heartfelt sympathy to the family of Henry \n     Hyde;\n       (3) recognizes the life of service and the outstanding \n     contributions of Henry Hyde; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the family of Henry Hyde.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15476-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3849.

CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR \n                   NUCLEAR DAMAGE CONTINGENT COST ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210) (commonly known as the ``Price-Anderson Act'')--\n       (i) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear projects; and\n       (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event \n     of a nuclear incident in the United States;\n       (B) the Price-Anderson Act, in effect, provides operators \n     of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out \n     of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily \n     through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each \n     operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;\n       (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \n     Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will \n     establish a global system--\n       (i) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear energy projects; and\n       (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the \n     event of a nuclear incident;\n       (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers \n     that face potentially unlimited liability for nuclear \n     incidents that are not covered by the Price-Anderson Act by \n     replacing a potentially open-ended liability with a \n     predictable liability regime that, in effect, provides \n     nuclear suppliers with insurance for damage arising out of \n     such an incident;\n       (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear \n     facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-\n     Anderson incident by providing an additional early source of \n     funds to compensate damage arising out of the Price-Anderson \n     incident;\n       (F) the combined operation of the Convention, the Price-\n     Anderson Act, and this section will augment the quantity of \n     assured funds available for victims in a wider variety of \n     nuclear incidents while reducing the potential liability of \n     United States suppliers without increasing potential costs to \n     United States operators;\n       (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the \n     United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation \n     fund established by the Convention;\n       (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that \n     does not--\n       (i) upset settled expectations based on the liability \n     regime established under the Price-Anderson Act; or\n       (ii) shift to Federal taxpayers liability risks for nuclear \n     incidents at foreign installations;\n       (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds \n     already available under the Price-Anderson Act should be \n     used; and\n       (J) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United \n     States not covered by the Price-Anderson Act, a retrospective \n     premium should be prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved \n     from potential liability for which insurance is not \n     available.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to allocate \n     the contingent costs associated with participation by the \n     United States in the international nuclear liability \n     compensation system established by the Convention on \n     Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna \n     on September 12, 1997--\n       (A) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using \n     funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in \n     a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the \n     benefits under section 170 of that Act; and\n       (B) with respect to a covered incident outside the United \n     States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by allocating \n     the contingent costs equitably, on the basis of risk, among \n     the class of nuclear suppliers relieved by the Convention \n     from the risk of potential liability resulting from any \n     covered incident outside the United States.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission.\n       (2) Contingent cost.--The term ``contingent cost'' means \n     the cost to the United States in the event of a covered \n     incident the amount of which is equal to the amount of funds \n     the United States is obligated to make available under \n     paragraph 1(b) of Article III of the Convention.\n       (3) Convention.--The term ``Convention'' means the \n     Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, \n     done at Vienna on September 12, 1997.\n       (4) Covered incident.--The term ``covered incident'' means \n     a nuclear incident the occurrence of which results in a \n     request for funds pursuant to Article VII of the Convention.\n       (5) Covered installation.--The term ``covered \n     installation'' means a nuclear installation at which the \n     occurrence of a nuclear incident could result in a request \n     for funds under Article VII of the Convention.\n       (6) Covered person.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``covered person'' means--\n       (i) a United States person;

Thapar\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate continues, as we have all year, \nto make progress filling judicial vacancies by considering yet another \nnomination reported out of committee this month. The nomination before \nus today for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench is Amul R. \nThapar, to the Eastern District of Kentucky. He has the support of both \nhome State Senators. I acknowledge the support of Senators McConnell \nand Bunning, and want to thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the \nhearing on this nomination.\n  In November, the Judiciary Committee reached a milestone by voting to \nreport our 40th judicial nominee this year. That exceeds the totals \nreported in each of the previous 2 years, when a Republican-led \nJudiciary Committee was considering this President's nominees.\n  I am delighted to promptly consider the nomination of Mr. Thapar. The \nNational Asian Pacific American Bar Association wrote to us in support \nof his nomination, which is the first of a South Asian American to be \nan Article III judge by this President. When confirmed, he would become \nonly the seventh Asian Pacific American Article III judge in our \nNation's history.\n  Amul R. Thapar is the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nKentucky in Lexington, KY. Before that, he served as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney in the Southern District of Ohio and in the District of \nColumbia. He worked in private practice at the law firms of Squire, \nSanders & Dempsey and Williams & Connolly LLP and worked as a general \ncounsel for Equalfooting.com. Mr. Thapar served as a law clerk for \nJudge Nathaniel R. Jones on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit and for Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on the District Court for the \nSouthern District of Ohio. He graduated from Boston College and the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law.\n  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 37 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench this session alone. That exceeds the totals confirmed in all of \n2004, 2005, and 2006 when a Republican-led Senate was considering this \nPresident's nominees; all of 1989; all of 1993, when a Democratic-led \nSenate was considering President Clinton's nominees; all of 1997 and \n1999, when a Republican-led Senate was considering President Clinton's \nnominees; and all of 1996, when the Republican-led Senate did not \nconfirm a single one of President Clinton's circuit nominees.\n  When this nomination is confirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 137 \ntotal Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as Judiciary chairman. \nDuring the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges--\nmore total judges--were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served \nas Judiciary chairman than during the 2-year tenures of either of the \ntwo Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 45 judicial \nvacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmations. \nCompare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th Congress, when the \ntotal vacancies under a Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee were \n51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies. That means that \ndespite the additional vacancies that arose at the beginning of the \n110th Congress and throughout this year, the current vacancy totals \nunder my chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee are below where they \nwere under a Republican led-Judiciary Committee. They are almost half \nof what they were at the end of President Clinton's term, when \nRepublican pocket filibusters allowed judicial vacancies to rise above \n100 before settling at 80. Twenty-six of them were for circuit courts.\n  When the President consults and sends the Senate well-qualified, \nconsensus nominations, we can work together and continue to make \nprogress as we are today.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/13/senate-section/article/S15568-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The rule of law is what stands between us \n     and the arbitrary exercise of power by the state. The rule of \n     law is the safeguard of our liberties. The rule of law is \n     what allows us to live our freedom in ways that honor the \n     freedom of others while strengthening the common good. . . If \n     across the river in Arlington Cemetery there are American \n     heroes who died in defense of the rule of law, can we give \n     less than the full measure of our devotion to that great \n     cause?'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde was a key player in some of the highest \n     level debates concerning the response to the terrorist \n     attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde received the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, on November 5, \n     2007, at a ceremony at which President George W. Bush \n     explained about Representative Hyde, ``He used his persuasive \n     powers for noble causes. He stood for a strong and purposeful \n     America--confident in freedom's advance, and firm in \n     freedom's defense. He stood for limited, accountable \n     government, and the equality of every person before the law. \n     He was a gallant champion of the weak and forgotten, and a \n     fearless defender of life in all its seasons.'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde's greatest legacy is as the author, \n     during his freshman term in the House of Representatives, of \n     an amendment to the 1976 Departments of Labor and Health, \n     Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act--commonly referred \n     to as the Hyde Amendment--that prohibits Federal dollars from \n     being used to pay for the abortion of unborn babies, which \n     conservative figures estimate has saved at least 1,000,000 \n     lives;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde lived by the belief that we will all be \n     judged by our Creator in the end for our actions here on \n     Earth, which he once explained on the floor of the House of \n     Representatives by saying, ``Our moment in history is marked \n     by a mortal conflict between a culture of life and a culture \n     of death.

Mr. President, I am hopeful we will approve tonight a bill \nI have authored with Senators Mikulski, Enzi and Harkin, The Eunice \nKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development Act. \nThis act will change the name of the National Institute of Child Health \nand Development to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \nChild Health and Development.\n  Our bill honors a truly great American who has played a unique role \nin advancing children's health, and particularly in shaping how we \ntreat individuals with intellectual disabilities. Few Americans have \never played such a profound role as Ms. Shriver has played in her life \nand it is entirely fitting that we rename NICHD on her behalf.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Mr. Hatch for introducing this \nlegislation, which I have joined as an original cosponsor. Ms. \nShriver's contribution stands alone, both in terms of what she has done \nin terms of individuals with intellectual disabilities and their \nmeaningful contribution in society as well as in advancing basic \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health. The National Institute \nof Child Health and Development was launched in the beginning of the \nKennedy Administration and Ms. Shriver and her husband Sargent \nadvocated for the institute when many knowledgeable scientists were \nwilling to write off these individuals and advocated that the money \nspent at the NICHD would be better spent studying adult diseases. Ms. \nShriver advocated for this research and I think it is fair to say \nwithout her advocacy the Institute would not be what it is today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleagues for their support of this \nlegislation. I also thank Senators Mikulski and Harkin, who were other \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. I will speak at a later time \non the extraordinary difference that my sister, Eunice, has made in the \nlives of millions of Americans, but for now, I wish to comment on an \naspect of the legislation before us. As we enact this legislation, I \ndid want to make clear, that it is my understanding that nothing in \nthis bill changes any authorities that we provided NIH and its director \nin the NIH Reform Act that we passed last Congress. Specifically, this \ndoes not change any of the authorities of the Scientific Management \nReview Board or any other provisions provided in section 401 of that \nact.\n  Is that the intent and understanding of my colleagues as well?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, this legislation is only meant to change the name of \nthe single institute within NIH and to have no other effect on the NIH \nor its organization.\n  Mr. ENZI. I agree. We do not intend this to change or signal any \nother change at NIH.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nbefore us, S. 2484. This bill renames the National Institute of Child \nHealth and Development at the NIH as the ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver \nNational Institute of Child Health and Development''.\n  This renaming bill was added during the HELP Committee markup to S. \n1011, given that S. 1011 renamed two other Institutes at the National \nInstitutes of Health. Senator Hatch, Senator Mikulski, and I sponsored \nthis amendment, and it was unanimously accepted by the HELP Committee. \nThen, S. 1011 was unanimously voted out of Committee. We would like to \nhave moved the entire bill, but unfortunately, we are not able to do \nthat today due to some objections. Therefore, we are trying to get done \nwhat we can get done at the end of this session and simply moving the \namendment that does not raise concerns with other members of this body.\n  I understand that it is unusual to rename an institute at NIH after \nan individual, but this is an unusual case. Ms. Shriver has long been \nassociated with the National Institute of Child Health and Development, \nNICHD, and was an early champion of it.\n  NICHD was established in the 1960s by President Kennedy when he \nushered in a ``New Frontier'' focusing on science and its potential for \nimproving everyone's life. During the 1960s, we also learned of the \nbiological causes of intellectual disabilities. At the same time, Ms. \nShriver was an advocate for people with intellectual disabilities. With \nthe help of her husband, Sargent, Ms. Shriver took on the challenge of \nimproving the lives of people with intellectual disabilities and \npursued that goal as a senior adviser to the President.\n       I suspect other Members will note her work with the Special \n     Olympics. That is only a small portion of what she has done \n     for individuals with intellectual disabilities. At the time \n     of NICHD's creation, many leaders in the scientific community \n     felt that money spent to research topics related to human \n     development and intellectual disability would be better spent \n     elsewhere. Ms. Shriver played a seminal role helping the \n     scientific community, policymakers, and the general public \n     recognize the importance of such research. She recognized \n     that it was not just important for those with intellectual \n     disabilities, but the research was a bridge to understanding \n     broader, more general aspects of human development. \n     Therefore, it would not be an overstatement to say that, \n     without Ms. Shriver's contribution, this institute would not \n     exist.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I rise today and ask for the support of my \ncolleagues in recognizing the contributions of Ms. Shriver through \nquick enactment of this legislation, S. 2484.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Kennedy, the National Institute \n     of Child Health and Human Development has achieved an \n     outstanding record of achievement in catalyzing a \n     concentrated attack on the unsolved health problems of \n     children and of mother-infant relationships by fulfilling its \n     mission to--\n       (A) ensure that every individual is born healthy and \n     wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from \n     reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance \n     to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive \n     lives, free from disease or disability; and\n       (B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, and \n     well-being of all individuals through optimal rehabilitation.\n       (2) The National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development has made unparalleled contributions to the \n     advancement of child health and human development, including \n     significant efforts to--\n       (A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant Death \n     Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV transmission;\n       (B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) vaccine, \n     credited with nearly eliminating the incidence of mental \n     retardation; and\n       (C) conduct intramural research, support extramural \n     research, and train thousands of child health and human \n     development researchers who have contributed greatly to \n     dramatic gains in child health throughout the world.\n       (3) The vision, drive, and tenacity of one woman, Eunice \n     Kennedy Shriver, was instrumental in proposing, passing, and \n     enacting legislation to establish the National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development (Public Law 87-838) on \n     October 17, 1962.\n       (4) It is befitting and appropriate to recognize the \n     substantial achievements of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a \n     tireless advocate for children with special needs, whose \n     foresight in creating the National Institute of Child Health \n     and Human Development gave life to the words of President \n     Kennedy, who wished to ``encourage imaginative research into \n     the complex processes of human development from conception to \n     old age.''.\n       (b) Amendments to the Public Health Service Act.--The \n     Public Health Service Act is amended--\n\n[[Page S15571]]\n\n       (1) in section 401(b)(7) (42 U.S.C. 281(b)(7)), by striking \n     ``National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' \n     and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (2) in section 404B (42 U.S.C. 283d), by striking \n     ``National Institute for Child Health and Human Development'' \n     and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (3) in section 404E(a) (42 U.S.C. 283g(a)), by striking \n     ``National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' \n     and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (4) in section 409D(c)(1) (42 U.S.C. 284h(c)(1)), by \n     striking ``National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (5) in section 424(c)(3)(B)(vi) (42 U.S.C. 285b-\n     7(c)(3)(B)(vi)), by striking ``National Institute of Child \n     Health and Human Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy \n     Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development'';\n       (6) in section 430(b)(2)(B) (42 U.S.C. 285c-4(b)(2)(B)), by \n     striking ``National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (7) in the heading of subpart 7 of part C of title IV (42 \n     U.S.C. 285g et seq.), by striking the term ``National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development'' each place \n     such term appears and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver \n     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (8) in section 487B(a) (42 U.S.C. 288-2(a)), by striking \n     ``National Institute on Child Health and Human Development'' \n     and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development'';\n       (9) in section 519C(g)(2) (42 U.S.C. 290bb-25c(g)(2)), by \n     striking ``National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development'' and inserting ``Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development'';
