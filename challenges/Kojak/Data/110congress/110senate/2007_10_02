That will be led by Senators Inouye and \nStevens. The Senate will recess today from 12:30 to 2:15 for the \nregularly scheduled party conference meetings. We want to finish this \nbill as quickly as possible and move to Commerce-State-Justice, which \nis also important, dealing with law enforcement. We also have some \njudges we would like to get rid of this week, if at all possible. We \nhave a circuit court judge and a number of district court judges. We \nneed to finish these items this week so that we can come back and start \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill, which is extremely important. If we \nfinish these two bills, we would have half of them done this year, \nwhich is good.\n  We have received tremendous cooperation from both sides to move \nthrough the bills. I hope we can continue to get that cooperation on \nthis bill. I am confident there will be some amendments offered. Some \nof them will have points of order against them because of too much \nmoney and they are legislating on appropriations bills. Maybe those \nSenators won't offer them if they check with the Parliamentarian first. \nBut we hope we can move through this bill very quickly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the British statesman Edmund Burke once \nwrote: ``When bad men combine, the good must associate.'' Such vivid \nmoral clarity is nowhere better reflected than in the recent events \ninvolving Burma.\n  In Burma, we have indeed witnessed the combination of bad men--a \ncombination of corrupt military junta leaders and compliant thugs in \nthe Burmese security forces.\n  This combination recently carried out the brutal suppression of \npeaceful protests in Burma, killing and imprisoning untold numbers of \nnonviolent demonstrators, including scores of Buddhist monks.\n  What is now needed is for the good to associate.\n\n[[Page S12390]]\n\n  The global struggle against terrorism has compelled us to increase \nour foreign policy engagement in places such as the Horn of Africa, \nIndonesia, and the Philippines.\n  In the coming decades, we must realize that China and India are two \ncountries that will play a larger role on the world stage.\n  One would have hoped that as India takes on a greater role as a \nregional power, and as a growing economic power, that pro-democracy \nelements within Burma could look to associate with its next-door \nneighbor, the largest democracy on the planet.\n  Our Nation is pursuing a closer relationship with India in terms of \nmilitary-to-military contacts and in the development of nuclear energy. \nIndia should be wary of coddling the junta in Burma.\n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, recently put out a \nstrong statement condemning the brutality in Burma. Instead of echoing \nthe sentiments of Burma's ASEAN neighbors, the Indian Government has \nonly issued tepid statements at best.\n  In so doing, India has put itself in league with China and Russia.\n  This is all the more troubling since India had been supportive of \nBurmese reformers in the early 1990s.\n  As India assumes a greater role on the world stage, more will be \nasked of it, and this is just such a case. India needs to recognize \nthat responsibility and abstain from supporting the military junta in \nBurma.\n  India needs to use its influence as Asia's longest-lived democracy to \nassociate with the pro-democracy forces of Burma and press for reforms.\n  Understandably, India has important interests in its neighbor to the \neast. For one, India wants to counter the influence of China in Burma. \nThat said, it should look beyond its near-term interests.\n  What better way to blunt Chinese influence in Burma than to work to \nbring about a Burma that reflects the Indian values of democracy and \nopenness, rather than a Burma that reflects the antidemocratic values \nof the Chinese Government?\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the Indian Government to reconsider \nits position on Burma; to speak directly to the regime's recent \nactions; and to work for the cause of democracy and reconciliation in \nBurma.\n  Only then can the combination of bad men leading Burma be checked.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the beginning of a new \nfiscal year, when all of our projected spending for the next year ought \nto have been budgeted and allocated to the appropriate programs and \nFederal agencies. Unfortunately, we have yet to see a single \nappropriations bill be sent to the President. Four appropriations bills \nthat have been passed are still in conference: the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, the Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs \nappropriations bill, the State and Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill, and the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. But those are stuck in conference and none have \nbeen sent to the President for his signature.\n  What is worse, the remaining eight were never even brought to the \nfloor for consideration by the Senate majority leadership before the \nend of 2007. One, of course, will be taken up this week--the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Any business leader or small business owner in America can tell you \nthat entering the fiscal year without an approved budget plan is \ndisastrous policy. But in Washington, we have grown to accept that the \nFederal Government can basically hold the American taxpayer to a double \nstandard: Do what we say and not as we do. In Washington, we have come \nto accept that we don't have to budget or pay our bills on time to keep \nthe lights on. Instead, we can pass a law saying it is OK--which we did \nlast week, a continuing resolution, which keeps Government basically on \nautopilot until November 16 and, as I said, that is a double standard \nthe rest of America is not allowed to meet. Only Congress, only \nWashington, can do that.\n  This mentality of fiscal irresponsibility is a disturbing trend. \nAmericans rightly expect us to keep the country running, but to keep it \nrunning efficiently and keep it running well, and to be good stewards \nof the taxpayers' dollars. We can't do that when we legislate on \nborrowed time and fail to pass any appropriations bills by the end of \nthe fiscal year. Zero for twelve is a dismal average, even for the \nSenate.\n  Despite harsh criticisms for failing to pass all appropriations bills \nlast year, the new majority has failed to pass a single appropriations \nbill when given the chance this year. Passing appropriations bills is \n``the most fundamental job Congress is expected to do.'' That is a \nquote from our colleague, majority whip Dick Durbin, December 2006 in \nthe New York Times.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the current majority leader, said in May of 2007: \n``The `Do-Nothing' Republican Congress failed to pass the \nappropriations bills.''\n  Now we find that notwithstanding their promise of new leadership and \nchange, that situation bears all too similar a comparison to what they \ncomplained about last year.\n  But the lack of urgency in passing these bills is only a part of the \nproblem. My colleagues in the majority have used a few appropriations \nbills that have been brought forward as a vehicle for their political \nagenda, and increased spending on expanded social programs and pet \nprojects.\n  As we debated the Defense authorization bill week after week, the \nmajority party delayed the bill's approval by trying to add and, in \nfact, successfully adding, in some instances, unrelated amendments--\namendments dealing with Federal hate crimes legislation, and \nimmigration was even considered during the debate. Ultimately, these \ntactics wasted valuable time and delayed essential resources our \nmilitary is counting on.\n  As each minute, each day, and each week passes by, we come closer and \ncloser to what is known as an omnibus appropriations bill. For those \noutside the Washington bubble, let me say that ``omnibus'' is sometimes \ntranslated as ``grab your wallet.'' An omnibus appropriations bill \ntends to be loaded down with a lot of excess spending and unrelated \npork.\n  If the appropriations bills we have debated thus far are any measure, \nwe are in for major trouble. The spending proposals--an extra $205 \nbillion on top of the President's budget request over the next 5 \nyears--will force American taxpayers to send even more of their hard-\nearned pay to the Federal Government. We should instead be working to \nreturn their hard-earned money to the American people, or rather allow \nthem to keep it in the first place as much as possible.\n  Now that we have already missed our own deadline for appropriations, \nit is time we get serious about these spending bills. I encourage all \nof my colleagues to join me and vote to pass timely and responsible \nappropriations bills and reverse this trend of fiscal apathy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12391]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, a colleague and friend of mine on the \nother side of the aisle spoke a few minutes ago about the budget \nprocess. I come today to specifically talk about children's health \ncare, but I think it is important to respond to what was said as it \nrelates to the budget process and adopting a budget by October 1.\n  I was thinking as he was speaking, I have been here now--this is my \nseventh year, my seventh budget process. We have never met the October \n1 deadline--never. In fact, I am not sure I remember having done it in \nthe House when I was there for 4 years, either. We all know it is a \nnice political argument to make on the floor of the Senate, but it has \nno credibility because the reality is the October 1 deadline is \nsomething that is difficult to meet and we usually work through the \nfall on the budget. Everybody knows that.\n  What I think is significant, though, is the fact that if we are going \nto hold to that test as the test of responsible leadership, 6 of the \nlast 7 years the Republican majority was in charge and 6 times they did \nnot meet an October 1 deadline. In fact, last year, they never got a \nbudget passed at all--at all. We came in as the new majority and had to \npick up the pieces and figure out how to keep the Government going for \nthe last half of the year. So I find it disingenuous--and I would say \nthis to my friend if he were here--to come to the floor and make great \npolitical speeches and great theater. The reality is we all on both \nsides of the aisle know that the appropriators are working together \nnow, coming to the floor on a bipartisan basis, to do what we do every \nsingle year--every single year in October and November and, \nunfortunately, at times into December.\n  But what I am very proud of is the fact that our leader, Senator \nReid, and our leadership in our caucus take very seriously our \nresponsibilities on the budget; not only putting a budget in place, but \na budget with the right values, the right priorities. We are changing \nthe priorities on behalf of the people of this country. We are changing \nthe priorities as they relate to funding the troops and pay raises and \nmaking sure our troops have what they need. We are changing the \npriorities. We will be dealing with a bill later this week as it \nrelates to the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations where we are \ngoing to stop the cuts the President has made in law enforcement, in \nthe COPS program, in the FBI, and in juvenile justice and drug \nenforcement. We will work to reinstate that and refocus us on those \nthings that keep our communities safe, keep America safe.\n  I am very proud of that. I am very proud of the priorities we have \nbeen putting in place as relates to this budget. On top of that, we are \nnot digging a bigger hole as it relates to the deficit of this country, \nbecause we have returned to a policy that was in place under the former \nadministration, under President Clinton, that simply says if you are \ngoing to spend dollars, you have to pay for it. You either have to cut \nsome place in order to increase another or you have to raise revenue. \nIt is a basic principle. It ought to be a no-brainer. But that has been \nsuspended in the last 6 years, creating the largest deficits in the \nhistory of the country.\n  I am happy to come to the floor and talk about budgets and process, \nand I am very proud of the direction we are going in.\n  I am also very proud of what we have done as it relates to another \nabsolutely critical priority, and that is children's health care. We \nhave a health care system for low-income individuals called Medicaid. \nIf you work, two parents or a mom may be working two jobs, maybe three \nminimum-wage jobs to try to make sure she pays the bills and has a roof \nover her children's heads and food on the table, chances are she is a \nlow-income working parent, or a couple working together, a dad working \nfor his children. Chances are health care is going to be too \nexpensive--just too expensive to buy in the individual market if you \ndon't have it through the place where you work.\n  Ten years ago this Congress came together in a bipartisan way under a \ndifferent President to say: We want to help families who are working \nhard every single day, who care about their children and who are doing \neverything they can to do the right thing--the values we should be \nsupporting in this country, of hard work, family, and caring about our \nkids.\n  We want to help them by putting in place a children's insurance \nprogram so that at least the children of low-income working families \nare able to get the health care they need. It has been a huge success. \nWe have overwhelming support from Governors, Republicans and Democrats, \nand State legislatures. In fact, this is the ultimate in strange \nbedfellows. We have the U.S. Chamber and the business community, the \nlabor community, health care providers, children's advocates, and \nconsumer advocates; we have the broadest possible group of Americans \nwith the broadest possible interests that have come together to work \nwith us to be able to design an extension of children's health care \nand, in fact, to be able to include additional children who qualify \nunder that program for working families. We passed that on a huge \nbipartisan vote in this Senate--enough to override a Presidential veto. \nThe House of Representatives passed it with a very large bipartisan \nvote.\n  Today, the President, we assume, will be getting this bill. There is \nonly one thing standing between 10 million children getting health \ninsurance in this country, the parents of 10 million children being \nable to sleep a little easier tonight--there is only one thing standing \nbetween that happening and those families and that is the signature of \nthe President of the United States.\n  So I am here today, as colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \ndone, to thank our leadership--Senator Reid and the bipartisan \nleadership of Senator Max Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Orrin \nHatch, and Senator Rockefeller. They have done a magnificent job of \ndoing what we are supposed to do: bring people's diverse interests \ntogether, develop a true compromise, and get things done.\n  I urge this President to look deep inside his heart, take a few \nmoments to talk to some of these families before he puts his veto on \nthis bill. This is one of the most significant things we will do in \nthis Congress. It is one of the most significant moments for this \nPresident. He asked us, again, to fund a war that is not paid for. For \n41 days of funding of that war, we could pay for 10 million children \ngetting health insurance over the next 5 years. This is about values \nand priorities. It always has been.\n  In my home State, I can tell you we have 90,000 children and \nparents--families who are waiting and hoping and praying that this \nPresident will join with all of us in doing the right thing. Too many \nfamilies are struggling. Health care is skyrocketing. These same \nfamilies are being squeezed on all sides. Gas prices going up, health \ncare costs are going up, they have challenges in keeping their \nmortgages, and what will happen to their jobs? Will they be shipped \noverseas? Will they get a pay cut? What is happening in terms of \npreparing to send their children to college? Middle-class families are \nbeing squeezed on all sides.\n  For a group of parents who are working very hard but don't have \nhealth insurance through their job, this Congress has done the right \nthing by passing a children's health care bill that will say at least \nyour children will be able to get the health insurance they need and \ndeserve.\n  When this President was at the Republican convention in 2004 \naccepting his nomination for reelection for his second term, President \nBush said:\n\n       In the new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to \n     enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not \n     signed up for Government health insurance programs. We will \n     not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand \n     between these children and the health care they need.\n\n  Since that time, President Bush sent to us a budget that, in fact, as \nhe funded it, would eliminate well over a million children who \ncurrently receive\n\n[[Page S12392]]\n\nhealth care under the Children's Health Care Program. We have rejected \nthat, and we have turned to see how the program was working and found \nthere were millions more children eligible for this very same program \nas the economy gets tougher and tougher for families, but the funding \nwasn't there to make sure those children receive children's health care \nas well. So we worked together, and we are now including an additional \n4 million children whose families are working but have not been able to \nget health insurance. That, all together, equals 10 million children \nunder the legislation we passed.\n  There is nothing more important we could do than to guarantee that \nchildren get a healthy start in life--whether it is the general \npractitioner they need to see, the dentist or whether they need mental \nhealth help. We have said the children of this country are a priority \nfor our majority, for the Senate, for the House of Representatives.\n  I simply ask today at this critical moment: President Bush, please \njoin us and sign this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, 2 months ago, I traveled to Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Kuwait, and Jordan. I also traveled to Iraq with my colleague \nSenator Casey of Pennsylvania. We went to talk to and listen to our top \ngenerals and diplomats but, equally important, the soldiers and marines \non the front lines of this war.\n  This was the third time for me visiting Iraq, the first time for \nSenator Casey. Two impressions really struck me. More than either of my \nearlier visits, I felt overwhelmed by the tragedy that has been created \nin that country for Iraq, for its neighbors, for America's image around \nthe world, and, sadly, for our troops.\n  I was also awed and deeply moved by the skill and bravery of our \ntroops and their love for this Nation. In a time when sacrifice seems \noutdated to some people, our troops are willing to endure almost \ninconceivable hardship and risk everything to protect us and our \nNation.\n  When I visited Iraq, it was 120 degrees. Soldiers wore heavy body \narmor and backpacks and carried their ammunition, their weapons, had \nhelmets on, drinking water every chance they had to try to stay \nhydrated and not suffer from heat exhaustion which had claimed the life \nof one of our soldiers just the day before.\n  Soldiers who knew who I was asked me occasionally when the \npoliticians in Washington were going to start voting so they could come \nhome. Despite the unbearable heat, the constant danger, longings for \nhome, not one soldier I met in Iraq ever complained about walking point \nfor America--not one.\n  We went 10 miles south of Baghdad to a place called Patrol Base \nMurray. I ate lunch with some Illinois soldiers from the 3rd Infantry \nDivision out of Chicago, Aurora, Jacksonville, and Elmhurst. Most were \non their first deployments. One was on his third. Half were married \nwith kids. They try to keep in touch with things back home through e-\nmails, but it is tough.\n  They were laughing at me as I fumbled around trying to open up my \nMRE, a can of chicken and noodles with a built-in heater. I never quite \ngot it right. I am glad I gave them some comic relief there, at least \nfor a few minutes.\n  On August 11, after I came back home, 1 week after I visited this \npatrol base, two Illinois soldiers stationed there died in a roadside \nbomb explosion, along with two other soldiers, in a place called Arab \nJabour. All four soldiers were assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division \nbased in Fort Stewart, GA.\n  The Illinois soldiers lost were SPC Justin Penrod, 24 years old, of \nMahomet; and SGT Andrew Lancaster, 23, of Stockton. They are 2 of the \n146 sons and daughters of Illinois who have died so far in this \nconflict.\n  The same day they died, a fifth soldier from the 3rd ID died in Arab \nJabour in a separate incident, while a sixth was killed in an IED blast \nin Afghanistan. Six soldiers dead in 1 day. Sadly, such grim numbers \ndon't even make the big headlines anymore. After losing 3,800, I guess \nsomebody who runs these newspapers and television stations decides it \nis not big news. For some people, the daily toll of soldiers killed and \nwounded in Iraq seems to have just become another statistic, like the \nweather, but not to the devastated families of these fallen soldiers, \nnot to the children who will grow up never knowing their fathers or \nmothers who have died in this war, and not to the men and women with \nwhom they served.\n  A week after SGT Andrew Lancaster died in Iraq, his platoon \ncommander, 1LT Benjamin Kim, wrote me a letter about a man he \nconsidered a gifted leader and a brother. I have never met Lieutenant \nKim. I can't imagine why he sent this to me, other than to share deep \nfeelings that he just couldn't leave inside. He wanted someone else to \nread them. I really trust, based on what that letter contained, that he \nwould not mind if I read his words into the record about his fallen \ncomrade. The letter is dated August 18, 2007.\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin: My name is Benjamin Kim, and I am \n     assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division as an \n     infantry officer. By the time you receive this letter it will \n     have been a number of weeks since you came to Iraq and \n     visited my unit. If you recall, you came to Patrol Base \n     Murray in southeast Baghdad near a village called Arab \n     Jabour, and you met some soldiers from Illinois serving here. \n     One of these soldiers was a man named SGT Andrew Lancaster, \n     and he was a squad leader in my platoon. He was killed in \n     action on 11 August 2007, and as I write this letter, he and \n     the bodies of four other soldiers who died with him that day \n     are being prepared for transportation back to the United \n     States.\n\n  The lieutenant went on to say:\n\n       The purpose of this letter is not to seek any political \n     action. Nor is it to recount the grizzly details that \n     resulted in the untimely deaths of five of my finest soldiers \n     and subordinate leaders. I do not seek to achieve anything, \n     except perhaps to communicate to you my boundless respect for \n     the men who serve with me in this remote corner of the world. \n     I will probably never meet you, and I shall make no plans to \n     do so, but I find it oddly therapeutic to write to a man of \n     your station and rank in an earnest and sincere manner. \n     Whether you personally read this letter or not is irrelevant; \n     as I write this I am finding temporary reprieve from my \n     sorrow.\n\n  He goes on to write:\n\n       Andrew Lancaster was the iconic ``Man of the Midwest.'' He \n     was a pragmatist and he valued common sense and integrity as \n     two of the most important traits a leader should have. He was \n     straightforward with everything he said, and he was never \n     afraid to speak his mind on issues that mattered to him. And \n     yet, despite any of the pressures and frustrations that \n     encumber a leader in combat, he kept his head cool and his \n     professionalism was always above reproach.\n       He relentlessly pursued our elusive enemy with an intellect \n     that any general would envy. There were countless times where \n     he and I, and other leaders of the platoon, would discuss \n     various tactics and methods we should apply in our mission, \n     and more often than not we found ourselves listening \n     attentively to his analysis of the situation.\n       He was also compassionate. In one instance, he spearheaded \n     a platoon-level effort to capture a man who we suspected to \n     be an IED emplacer and a high ranking insurgent in our area \n     of operations. When we finally caught him, the insurgent knew \n     he'd be going away for a long time. 'Caster, as we called \n     him, gave him a final opportunity to kiss his family goodbye.\n       He was a soldier of the highest caliber, and yet his \n     humility offered a pleasing contrast to his confidence in his \n     own abilities. For all the times he furthered the interests \n     of our platoon, I wanted to nominate him for a bronze star \n     with a V-Device. His response was always the same--``I don't \n     really care about awards. I just want all of us to go home \n     alive and intact when these 15 months end.'' He was \n     posthumously awarded his bronze star along with a purple \n     heart; nevertheless, how ironic it is that the true heroes \n     never want to claim themselves as such.\n       In his personal life, 'Caster was strongly devoted to his \n     family. He would always sing\n\n[[Page S12393]]\n\n     high praises for his wife and high school sweetheart, \n     Tabbatha; whose outstanding cooking he would attribute both \n     woefully and wistfully the weight gain he experienced a month \n     before deployment. He loved her tremendously, and whenever we \n     weren't ``talking shop'' her name was his constant refrain.\n       He would also speak reverently of his brother. We would \n     listen to his stories about growing up in small town Illinois \n     and laugh with him about all the trouble he and his brother \n     would get into.\n       When he came to my platoon, he welcomed young soldiers who \n     were far from their families to his home frequently, be it \n     for Thanksgiving dinner or for a few beers or a football \n     game. He made our platoon his family, and we will always \n     cherish that bond.\n       I don't know what I planned to accomplish by writing this. \n     All I know is that this man was like a brother to me, and I \n     feel like I have to memorialize him somehow. He taught me a \n     lot of things that I need to know about being a good platoon \n     leader, and even now his legacy lives on in the soldiers he \n     once led and the outstanding ways in which they conduct \n     themselves.\n       I hope that I have given you a somewhat accurate picture of \n     the man we loved, but I have a sneaking suspicion that there \n     are no words eloquent enough to describe him. Nevertheless, I \n     thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. Keep \n     fighting the good fight, and we here will do the same.\n       Respectfully, 1LT Benjamin Kim.\n\n  SGT Andrew Lancaster of Stockton, IL, enlisted in the Army with a \nfriend in 2002 to protect America after September 11. Before Iraq, he \nserved as a paratrooper in Afghanistan with the Army's 173rd Airborne \nBrigade.\n\n  In Stockton, IL, a small town with a population of about 1,800, \nSergeant Lancaster was known as Andy, the kid everybody loved, and his \ndeath really hit the folks in that community hard.\n  At Freeport High School, where he graduated in 2002, where he stood \nout in football, basketball, and choir, his teachers and coaches recall \nAndy Lancaster as an outgoing and responsible young man who had a way \nof making everyone around him happy.\n  When the news of his death reached that town, the high school \nfootball team posted a tribute to Sergeant Lancaster's family on its \nmessage board. Messages of support were also posted at the local ice \ncream shop where Sergeant Lancaster's young widow Tabby once worked.\n  In addition to a town and a wife who loved him, Sergeant Lancaster \nleaves behind his mom and his stepfather, Donna and Steve Vanderheyden; \nhis father Harlan Lancaster; a brother, two step-sisters, and his \ngrandparents.\n  He and Tabby married just before Sergeant Lancaster left for \nAfghanistan, and they planned to start a family when he came home. \nInstead, last month, Tabby Lancaster attended a ceremony at Fort \nStewart at which 10 trees were planted in honor of her husband and nine \nother members of the 3rd Infantry Division who died recently in Iraq. \nSince 2003, a total of 369 trees have been planted along the base's \nmemorial walk.\n  Mr. President, I regret I never had a chance to meet Andy Lancaster, \nbut I have met so many soldiers just like him. They are natural leaders \nwho probably succeed at whatever they choose to do in life. They \ncertainly could have made a lot more money and lived far more \ncomfortably, but they chose to enlist to defend our country.\n  Those are the kind of people we are losing every day in these wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Like Andy Lancaster, each of them leaves a hole \nin the hearts of those who loved them and in the heart of our Nation. \nWe honor their sacrifice and grieve their loss.\n  In a few minutes, Mr. President, we will start debating the Defense \nappropriations bill. It is a critically important bill. As a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I know a lot of the discussion about this \nbill will be about numbers. This little statement that I have made on \nthe floor, reading into the record the letter of Lieutenant Kim about \nhis fallen sergeant, really takes this discussion and debate way beyond \nnumbers. It reminds us of 3,800 brave soldiers, such as Andy Lancaster, \nwho have given their lives for America, soldiers whose lives continue \nto be lost every single day that we continue this war.\n  I stand today in tribute not just to Sergeant Lancaster but to all \nthe men and women who continue to serve us with such honor and dignity. \nI hope all of us who value and cherish the contributions they make will \nremember them in our hearts and our prayers and our votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield back morning business time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12393-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment\n\n[[Page S12405]]\n\nbe considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment, and that no points \nof order be considered waived by this agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss H.R. 3222, a bill \nmaking appropriations for the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year \n2008. The bill that I present on behalf of the Appropriations Committee \nwas approved unanimously by the Committee on September 12. Senator \nStevens and I crafted this bill together in a bipartisan fashion. It \nappropriates $459.6 billion in new budget authority which is equal to \nthe subcommittee's 302b allocation. This amount is $3.5 billion less \nthan the funding requested by the administration, not including \nsupplemental spending for the cost of war. It is the same level as \nrecommended by the House.\n  I say to my colleagues this is a good bill, one that is critical for \nour Nation's defense. We believe it meets the Senate's priorities: \nensuring readiness, protecting our forces, and acquiring the critical \nequipment that our service men and women need and deserve.\n  The bill fully funds a 3.5 percent military and civilian pay raise, a \nhalf percent more than requested.\n  It recommends adding nearly $950 million for the Defense Health \nProgram to ensure that the health of our military families is \nprotected. This includes $486 million above the budget request to \nsupport our military hospitals which suffer from significant shortfalls \nand are stressed by our wounded heroes returning from war.\n  The Appropriations Committee included $1 billion above the \nPresident's request to purchase equipment for our National Guard and \nReserves recognizing the serious shortfalls that exist in our reserve \ncomponents.\n  It fully funds the Army's highest priority, the Future Combat System.\n  It supports the purchase of 20 F-22s and 12 Joint Strike Fighters as \nrequested.\n  The bill includes $470 million to support a multi-year purchase of \nthe Virginia class submarine, and provides full funding for the V-22 \nfor the Marines.\n  It would fund the authorized level for the Missile Defense Program, \nabout $300 million below the request.\n  As my colleagues all know, this is a massive bill, with thousands of \nprograms. While most of the administration's proposal is funded as \nrequested, the bill is not a rubberstamp. Senator Stevens and I have \nrecommended reductions in many programs because of schedule delays, \ncost increases, or other similar problems. In each case it is our \njudgment that the funds should be reapplied to other areas to address \nother urgent needs. In doing so, we have been able to increase funding \nfor health care, National Guard equipment, a higher pay raise, and many \nother worthy initiatives.\n  We should also raise the subject of earmarks in this measure. As you \nknow, the Congress passed new legislation which requires that the \ncommittee identify each congressionally directed spending item, which \nwe commonly refer to as earmarks. I want to point out that this bill \nincludes more than $4 billion in adds which were not requested by the \nPresident. However, under the definition in S. 1 very few of these \nitems are earmarks. For example, in many cases, the committee chose to \nprovide funding for items not because they were requested by a Member \nof the Senate, but because of the national merits of the program. Under \nthe definition in S. 1, these are not earmarks. None the less we have \nincluded in the report the name of all Members who requested such \nincreases. In fact, to ensure full transparency the committee report \nnot only lists the few earmarks that are required by law, but includes \nany item funded by the committee for which a Member sought an increase \nabove the President's request. We have gone way beyond the legal \nrequirement to increase transparency. We have nothing to hide in the \nfunding that we are recommending in this measure. I am confident the \nMembers who requested these funds have no reason not to have their \nnames listed.\n  Today is October 2. We have already started a new fiscal year. Our \nDefense Department is operating on scaled back funding under a short \nterm continuing resolution. That is no way to provide for our common \ndefense. It is critical that we expedite the consideration of this \nmeasure to ensure that our men and women in uniform and their families \nhave the funding they need for their pay, their hospitals, their \nhousing, and their schools. The funding that we recommend in this \nmeasure to equip our forces is critically needed as soon as possible.\n  We understand the desire of many Members to address policies which \nrelate to the war in Iraq. The war is extremely controversial; our \nNation is divided. This matter is so serious it deserves the Senate's \nfull attention and thoughtful debate, but that will take time. While we \ndon't all agree on the proper course in Iraq, there remains one thing \nin which there is universal agreement. We must support those who are \nwilling to wear our Nation's uniform and make the sacrifices to protect \nthe rest of us. That is a huge sacrifice.\n  We hope that in the coming weeks the Senate will consider a \nsupplemental spending measure to address funding for the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. We would urge our \ncolleagues to hold off on supplemental related issues until that bill \nis considered.\n  To this end, I have resolved to oppose any amendment which could \njeopardize quick enactment of this bill. We can best show our support \nto the military by completing action on the fiscal year 2008 Defense \nappropriations bill as quickly as possible. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill be able to endorse these recommendations and work with us to pass \nthis legislation. Our men and women in uniform deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor. I hope the Chair will recognize the vice chairman \nof the committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to endorse the comments of \nthe chairman of our subcommittee regarding this Defense appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2008 to the Senate. This bill does reflect a \nbipartisan approach. This is the approach Senator Inouye and I have \nalways maintained regarding the Department of Defense appropriations. \nThe fact is this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations \nCommittee almost 3 weeks ago by a unanimous vote. We hope, as the \nchairman of the subcommittee said, to finish this bill this week so we \ncan proceed to conference as soon as possible after the October recess \nfor Columbus Day.\n  Our fiscal year began yesterday. Normally this bill would have been \nsigned by the President by this time. But it is a matter that still has \nextreme urgency, as far as I am concerned, to get it before the \nPresident. As Senator Inouye has said, as a temporary measure we do \nhave the continuing resolution in place to keep operations ongoing in \nthe Department of Defense until this bill becomes law. That is a \ntemporary measure. There are many acquisition activities that simply \ncannot be initiated under a continuing resolution. They require an \nannual appropriations bill to be enacted.\n  Under the continuing resolution, there are very limited amounts \navailable each month to the Department. That is not sufficient to \nsustain a force in the field as we have in Afghanistan and Iraq. As a \nmatter of fact, there are hundreds of thousands of men and women in \nuniform deployed throughout the world. They serve our country now in \nover 154 countries, and in our own country here, in the United States. \nTheir bravery and dedication to our country is extraordinary and their \nsacrifices do not go unnoticed. We must not lose sight of our \nresponsibility to support them in an expeditious manner, and \ncompletely. These people depend on us and it is our job to see to it \nthey have all of the supplies, ammunition, and equipment they need to \ncarry out their orders.\n  Each year the Department of Defense faces the critical challenge of \nbalancing the cost of maintaining high levels of readiness, being ready \nto respond to any call wherever it occurs, whenever it is necessary. \nThis means we must adequately invest in those technologies that will \nprepare us for the future, prepare us for the threats of\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\ntomorrow as well as conduct the activities we have ongoing in those 154 \ncountries and in particular in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The bill Senator Inouye and I present today reflects a prudent \nbalance among those challenges. I concur--may I say I concur \nreluctantly--in Senator Inouye's request that we not have supplemental \nitems added to this bill. This is the first year we have not had, as \npart of the bill, a so-called bridge to cover the transition between \none fiscal year to the next, in terms of the demands of the war. Very \nclearly, if we are going to send the MRAPs over to Iraq--these are the \nnew vehicles that protect lives, that are saving lives--we need funding \nin advance. I am told we have over 30 different manufacturers working \non these machines now. They have to be paid. I do believe the \nsupplemental is absolutely necessary and I am very worried about it. It \nis to me a very difficult thing to believe the time might come when we \ndo not have the money to pay for these MRAPs and they will stay in this \ncountry rather than be taken to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  There are other new facilities and equipment that are needed by the \nDepartment of Defense. This is an ongoing. I was talking to my \ncolleague Sid Ashworth today about the transformation of the military. \nAt the same time as our people are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nare defending us in these other 152 countries, we face the problem of \ntransforming our military into the military of the future. New \ntechnologies, new techniques, and new requirements demand change. That \nchange demands new equipment and new research to assure we have the \nbasic equipment and technology base we need to protect this country for \nthe future.\n  I worry about a process that is slowing down the money that now for 4 \nyears has been presented in a supplemental, an addition to this bill as \nit was passed. This will be the first year we have not included that in \nthe consideration of the appropriations bill. As I said, I am following \nthe lead of our chairman, but I do believe we cannot go home this year \nwithout providing the money to carry over through the new year and into \nthe period of next year before we can get another bill passed.\n  This is, to me, a very serious matter and one I hope to speak on \nlater, at great length, as a matter of fact. But I do again thank \nSenator Inouye, our chairman, for his courtesy, his leadership, and his \nfriendship as we move this bill to the floor.\n  We welcome for consideration any amendments our colleagues wish to \npresent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 83-14, the \nSenate approved S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of \n2007. The President signed the legislation on September 14, 2007. This \nethics reform legislation will significantly improve the transparency \nand accountability of the legislative process.\n  Pursuant to new rule 44, the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction is required to certify that certain information related to \ncongressionally directed spending has been identified.\n  The required information must be available on a publicly accessible \ncongressional Web site in a searchable format at least 48 hours before \na vote on the pending bill. In addition, Members who request such items \nare required to certify in writing that neither they nor their \nimmediate family have a pecuniary interest in the items they requested. \nAnd, the committee is required to make those certification letters \navailable on the Internet.\n  The information provided includes identification of the \ncongressionally directed spending and the name of the Senator who \nrequested such spending.\n  This information is contained in the committee report numbered 110-\n155, dated September 14, 2007, and has been available on the Internet \nfor 2 weeks. The Member letters concerning pecuniary interest are also \navailable on the Internet.\n  I am submitting for the record the certification by the chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n  I send to the desk such certification and ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Byrd: I certify that the information required by \n     Senate Rule XLIV, related to congressionally directed \n     spending, has been identified in the Committee report \n     numbered 110-155, filed on September 14, 2007, and that the \n     required information has been available on a publicly \n     accessible congressional website in a searchable format at \n     least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3117\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like to send \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself \n     and Mr. Gregg, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Corker, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Sununu, and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 3117.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To improve the security of United States borders)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Border \n     Security First Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Appropriations for Border Security.--There is \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2008--\n       (1) to achieve and maintain operational control over the \n     entire international land and maritime border of the United \n     States including the ability to monitor such border through \n     available methods and technology, as authorized under the \n     Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367);\n       (2) to hire and train full-time border patrol agents, as \n     authorized under section 5202 of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458);\n       (3) to install along the international land border between \n     the United States and Mexico--\n       (A) fencing required under section 102(b) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1103 note)); and\n       (B) vehicle barriers, unmanned aerial vehicles, ground-\n     based sensors and cameras; and\n       (4) to remove and detain aliens for overstaying their \n     visas, illegally reentering the United States, or committing \n     other crimes for which they would be subject to removal; and\n       (5) to reimburse States and political subdivisions of a \n     State, for expenses that are reimbursable under 287(g) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).\n       (c) Employment Eligibility Verification.--Of the amounts \n     appropriated for border security and employment verification \n     improvements under subsection (b), $60,000,000 shall be made \n     available for employment eligibility verification, as \n     authorized under subtitle A of title IV of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).\n       (d) Emergency Requirement.--Amounts appropriated under \n     subsection (b) are designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment I have offered would \nappropriate $3 billion in emergency spending for border security \noperations. It is virtually the same amendment we had on the DHS \nappropriations bill.\n  The amendment will allow purchases to be made for unmanned aerial \nvehicles, ground sensors, and vehicle barriers. It provides funding for \nthe construction of 700 miles of fencing. It would establish \noperational control over all of our borders. It provides funding to \nobtain more bed space to detain immigrants for overstaying their visas, \nand it provides funding for States and localities that undergo training \nto assist the Federal Government in enforcing immigration law.\n  There has been a veto threat on the DHS bill. I am hoping that this \namendment, which passed 89 to 1--a similar version of it on the DHS \nappropriations bill--will find its way on this legislation, which I \nhope will get signed into law by the President.\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the pending business the Graham \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3119 to Amendment No. 3117\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send an amendment to the Graham amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3119 to amendment No. 3117.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       This section shall become effective 1 day after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham amendment. \nIt is an amendment which I have been involved in helping to develop. It \nis an amendment that was offered on the Homeland Security bill, and \nessentially it is the same concept. The purpose of this amendment is \nsomething on which I think there is general agreement in the Senate, \nwhich is that we supply adequate resources to make sure that our border \nis secure.\n  Now, this is an effort we have been pursuing for quite a while. I had \nthe good fortune to be chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity of the Appropriations Committee, and during that time we \ndramatically increased our commitment to border security, especially in \nthe area of the number of agents, in the area of the number of \ndetention beds, in the area of fencing, in the area of electronic and \nvirtual fencing, and in the area of making technology available and \nsupport facilities available to border security agents, and the ICE \nagents. It is a ramping-up process, however, and there is still a ways \nto go, although we have made very significant strides. Unfortunately, \nin our opinion, on this side of the aisle--and this amendment was \nagreed to by the other side of the aisle for all intents and purposes \nwhen it was offered on Homeland Security--there is a need for \nadditional funding to make sure that we put in place the resources \nwhich will basically assure the American people that the southern \nborder can and will be secured.\n  Now, what does that require? Well, this amendment doesn't put \nspecific numbers relative to the number of agents or detention beds or \nfencing, but what it does put in place is an additional $3 billion in \nemergency funding, which will essentially go toward three major areas, \nthe first of which is agents. We know that we need about 20,000 agents \non the border. We know we are headed toward that number, but we know it \nis going to take a significant increase in funding for us to get to \nthat.\n  Now, we wish we could sort of wave a magic wand of dollars and \nproduce these agents overnight, but we can't. These people are highly \nskilled. They require special qualities as individuals. They have to be \nobviously law enforcement individuals, but they also have to speak \nSpanish. They have to have the character and the personality to be able \nto work in a very intense environment and deal with very threatening \nsituations, while at the same time dealing with people who are coming \nacross the border and trying to make a better way of life for \nthemselves and shouldn't be treated in a criminal way but should be \ntreated as decent human beings trying to seek a better way of life in \nthe United States, who try to come in inappropriately but having to go \nback. Handling that type of situation requires a little bit more care \nand sensitivity than dealing with somebody who is coming across to sell \ndrugs.\n  So the individuals we need to attract into the border security effort \nare high-quality, high-caliber individuals. You can't gather them up \novernight. It takes awhile to get the applicants and then put them \nthrough the schooling process, and it does take money to do that. This \namendment will allow us, to the extent that we can find these types of \nindividuals to populate this workforce, to do exactly that so we will \nhave a full complement of agents on the southern border.\n  In addition, it will add detention beds which are critical. There is \na belief that we need around 33,000 detention beds, I think is the \nnumber. We are headed toward building out a significant number of \ndetention beds, and this amendment--or the dollars in this amendment--\nwill give the Department the resources it needs to accomplish the \nadditional detention beds.\n  Why are detention beds important? Because we have gone from a policy \nwhich was essentially catch-and-release of 2 years ago, or 3 years ago, \nto a policy where we actually catch and hold people. We no longer say \ncome back in a few months after we catch you crossing the border \nillegally; we would say come back in a few months and appear before the \ncourt, and what happened was people never came back. We would send them \noff and they would never return, not surprisingly. Now we hold these \nfolks, and we make sure they have their day in court, that they receive \nthe proper protections of our law enforcement system, but that if they \nare found to have entered this country illegally, they get sent back. \nBut it takes money, and that is why this amendment is important.\n  Thirdly, we are building a fence in those areas, a physical fence in \nthose areas where we need fencing. Fencing isn't appropriate for the \nentire border, but in our more urban areas along the border, it is \nappropriate, and it is expensive. So this money in this bill will allow \nus to complete the fencing commitments which we think are necessary. \nEqually important, it will put in place the operations of what amounts \nto what we call a virtual fence, but it is a real fence. There will be \ntowers essentially. We have a tremendous electronic surveillance \ncapability, oversight capability through unmanned aerial vehicles. All \nof this has been put into the works, and we are in the process of \nbuilding out this system of surveillance in nonphysical fenced areas \nbut areas which will have basically an electronic fence and a visual \ncapability. But that, again, costs a lot of money. So this amendment \nfully funds the movement in that direction. That is what we need to do. \nWe need to spend this money.\n  Now, it is a lot of money, $3 billion, there is no question about it. \nBut I see it very much as part of the war on terror, as a necessary \nelement to protecting our culture and our society. A country which \ncan't control its borders, which doesn't know who is coming across its \nborders, is a country which is at considerable risk. It is at \nconsiderable risk for a lot of reasons, but obviously the primary \nreason is the threat of terrorism. We have an obligation to our \ncitizenry to make sure as people come across the southern border, we \nknow who they are and we know that they are coming across legally.\n  I think the American people have grown--and rightly so, I am afraid--\na little cynical about our efforts on the southern border. They see us \nsay: Well, we are going to secure the southern border, but then they \ndon't see us putting the resources on the border to accomplish that. \nThese dollars will complete the debate on the issue of resources. The \ndollars will be there. Whether the management capability is there, \nwhether the build-out capability is there, that is still an issue--I \nadmit to that--but at least the dollars will be in the pipeline to \naccomplish this goal.\n  So as a practical matter, I think this is a very important step \nforward. I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina, who has been a \nleader on this effort for awhile. He was obviously a leader on \nimmigration reform, and he has backed up his words on immigration \nreform, in that the first step in effective immigration reform is \neffective border security.\n  That is true. That is essential. He has backed that up with this \namendment which puts the dollars in place to accomplish this. That is a \ncorollary to this whole debate, which is that we do need to \nsignificantly overhaul our immigration laws, make them more appropriate \nto the times and to the situations. But you cannot get the public\n\n[[Page S12408]]\n\nconfidence to do immigration reform unless the American people believe \nat the outset that our border--especially the southern border--is \nsecure from people being able to cross willy-nilly into this country \nillegally.\n  These dollars will put in place the resources necessary to accomplish \nthat, to make sure our southern border is secure on the issue of \ncrossings. It may take a couple years for them to bear fruit because \nthere is not an instant response with the hiring of agents. But the \nfact is that the resources will be in the pipeline to accomplish that, \nand the American people can have confidence that it is going to occur.\n  I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for his amendment. I \nam happy to join him as a cosponsor of the amendment. I hope it will be \nadopted unanimously or with a large majority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3126.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.  No amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to provide a waiver for \n     enlistment in the Armed Forces of an individual convicted \n     under Federal or State law of any felony offense, during the \n     five-year period ending on the date of the proposed \n     enlistment of such individual in the Armed Forces, as \n     follows:\n       (1) Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n       (2) Arson.\n       (3) Hate Crime.\n       (4) Sexual misconduct.\n       (5) Terrorist threatening.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading my \namendment. I had it read because it is such common sense. I think if \nyou went out on the street and you asked any American: Do you think \nthere are people serving in the military who, within the last 5 years, \nwere convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon or a sex \ncrime or a hate crime or making a terrorist threat that was a phony \nterrorist threat? They would say: Oh, no; no one like that would be let \nin, not if they did something like that within the last 5 years.\n  That is what leads me to this commonsense amendment. It is hard for \nme to believe I have to fight for this. This amendment may not pass, \nwhich is stunning to me when I think of how clear the issue is.\n  I guess I would ask a mom or a dad who has a son or a daughter over \nthere, would they want their child in a foxhole with someone who was \nconvicted twice of assault with a deadly weapon. Do you want someone in \na foxhole with your son or daughter who was convicted of a sex crime? I \nthink they would say no.\n  So here is where we are. In recent years, the U.S. Army in particular \nhas dramatically increased the number of waivers it grants for \nadmission into its ranks of those convicted of a felony. Now, let me be \nclear. It is against the rules to allow anyone to come into the \nmilitary who has a felony conviction. However, there is a loophole \nwhich says waivers can be granted in certain circumstances.\n  Now, I totally understand. For example, let's say as a young man or \nwoman some potential recruit tried drugs because it was the thing in \nhis school. He did it, but he regrets it and is over it. He was \nconvicted, but he has promised never to use drugs again. OK, give \nsomeone a chance. That is the American way. Give someone a chance. But \nfor these particular felonies, which I will outline again and explain \nwhat they are, I think if someone has been found guilty within the last \n5 years, it is an open-and-shut case.\n  Now, I understand the Army is under incredible strain right now and \nis facing a difficult recruitment environment. I realize there may be \ntimes that they are going to ask for these waivers. I know they do it \nfor health reasons and other things, but there is a point at which it \ngoes too far; that is, the point at which it is dangerous. When you \nhear about the increase in felony recruitment, you will agree it is \nalarming. Rather than strengthening our military, it weakens our \nmilitary.\n  Listen to these numbers: In 2004, the Army granted 360 waivers to \nrecruits with felonies on their records. In 2005, the number grew to \n571. And in 2006, the number grew to 901. The 901 figure is a 59-\npercent increase over the 2005 number, and a 150-percent increase over \nthe 2004 figure. So I believe the spirit of the law that allows these \nwaivers is being violated. Nobody thought that it would reach these \nproportions.\n  Again, I think people deserve a second chance in this country if they \nhave served their time and they are rehabilitated. That is why I have \nin this amendment a 5-year cooling off period so we know that they have \nbeen clean for 5 years of these types of crimes. But the Army should \nnot drastically lower its standards because it cannot find enough \nrecruits, and it should not seek out individuals who have had \ndisturbing personal histories involving violence.\n\n  I just read in the newspaper the other day that the military is going \nto these criminals if they are undergoing rehab. They go right there. \nArmy recruiters actually attended a job fair for ex-convicts in Houston \nin August of 2006. Many experts believe this is leading to a spike in \ngang activity in the military. Listen to this FBI report: ``Gang \nrelated activity in the U.S. military is increasing.'' This is a direct \nquote. ``Members of nearly every major street gang have been identified \non both domestic and international military installations.'' According \nto this report, these members can ``disrupt good order and discipline'' \nwhile in the military.\n  Here is the alarming part, and this is the FBI--the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation--speaking, not Senator Barbara Boxer or any other \nSenator. Upon discharge, ``they may employ their military training \nagainst law enforcement officials and rival gang members and such \nmilitary training could ultimately result in a more organized, \nsophisticated and deadly gang as well as an increase in deadly assaults \non law enforcement officials.'' The FBI is saying that an abuse of \nthese waivers is leading to a more dangerous America, more dangerous \nfor law enforcement--more gangs.\n  This is not what our country needs. It is not what our wonderful \nbrave men and women in uniform need right now. They have enough \nproblems to deal with in Iraq. They are in the middle of a civil war. \nThis President has no plan to get them out. While the military says \nthere is no military solution, this President is doing nothing about a \nlong-term solution. We find our young men and women in harm's way in \nthe middle of a civil war in a mission that has changed about five or \nsix times, and now they have to worry that they are serving next to \nsomeone who has been convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly \nweapon, arson, terrorist threatening, or sexual misconduct--imagine, \nwith all they have to worry about.\n\n[[Page S12409]]\n\n  I am going to share with my colleagues a chart that I do not believe \nhas ever been made public before. This is the list of all the different \nfelony waivers that have been granted--adult, juvenile, and the total. \nLook at this list of waivers that has been granted. I am going to go \nthrough, for my colleagues and for the American people to see, what \ncrimes have been committed by recruits.\n  I mentioned the top two and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, \nthen arson, attempt to commit a felony, breaking and entering, burglary \nwith burglary tools, a bad check worth less than $500, embezzlement, \nforgery, hate crime, larceny, narcotics, negligent vehicular homicide, \nriot, robbery, sexual misconduct, stolen property knowingly received, \nterrorist threatening, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, criminal \nlibel, illegal or fraudulent use of a credit card--$500 or more--\nperjury or subornation of perjury, car theft, mail--abstracting, \ndestroying--indecent acts with a minor, manslaughter, kidnaping or \nabducting a child. Kidnaping or abducting a child? We took in three \nrecruits.\n  What I have attempted to do is pick out the ones I believe would be \nan open-and-shut case here of where we would not want someone recruited \ninto the military who has been convicted of these particular crimes: \naggravated assault with a deadly weapon, arson, hate crime, sexual \nmisconduct, or terrorist threatening. There were 13 of those.\n  I want to protect our men and women in uniform. I have deep respect \nfor them. In my State, we have lost more than any other State--23 \npercent those killed in Iraq have been from or based in my State. I \nwant the men and women from my State and every other State to feel \ncomfortable that their buddies will truly be their buddies and that \nthey share the same values of right and wrong. I want to keep it that \nway.\n  Larry Korb, who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense under Ronald \nReagan, said, ``The more of those people you take the more problems you \nare going to have and the less effective they are going to be.'' This \nis Larry Korb, who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense under \nPresident Reagan: ``The more of those people you take the more problems \nyou are going to have.''\n  GEN Barry McCaffrey, who commanded U.S. forces during the gulf war, \nsaid, ``By and large these are flawed recruits. Those getting waivers \nwon't be sergeants.'' General McCaffrey pointed to the lessons of \npostwar Vietnam. ``It took us a decade to take a fractured Army and \nturn it around. We don't have 3 years this time.'' That is Barry \nMcCaffrey.\n  Retired LTG William Odom, who was the Army's chief intelligence \nofficer from 1981 to 1985, has called the increase in waivers \n``disturbing.'' The Army's chief of intelligence for 4 years called the \nincrease in waivers ``disturbing.''\n  The last thing our servicemembers need to worry about is whether \nthere are violent felons in their ranks. It sets back the quality of \nour forces. It can severely set back our mission.\n  I would like to share one particular story about lowering standards. \nI think we are all very familiar with the story of PVT Steven Green. As \nyou will remember, Private Green is the soldier charged with the deaths \nof an Iraqi family of four. According to the reports, Private Green \nwent to the home of an Iraqi family with three other soldiers. He ended \nup raping the 14-year-old daughter before killing her and setting her \nbody on fire. He is also alleged to have killed the other family \nmembers. This turned into an international news story that once again \nbrought negative attention to our country, infuriating Iraqis and \nmaking the lives of our troops that much more difficult.\n  Private Green was admitted to the Army after being given a waiver. In \nthe case of Private Green, it was a waiver for a misdemeanor offense, \nand I am not even stopping that with my amendment. I am not even \nstopping that with my amendment. I am going to the most egregious \ncrimes. That story illustrates the potential consequences of going down \na path where standards are dramatically lowered.\n\n  Let me spell out specifically how my amendment addresses the issue. \nThe amendment simply says the military cannot offer a waiver for \nenlistment to the Armed Forces to individuals convicted of these \nfelonies: aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, arson, hate crime, \nsexual misconduct, or terrorist threatening. They cannot get a waiver \nif they have committed any of these and they were convicted of it in \nthe last 5 years.\n  If someone stands up and says: Give people a second chance, then they \nhave not read my amendment because we are giving people a second \nchance. We are saying: If you are clean for 5 years, OK. And we are not \neven touching all these other waivers--unauthorized use of a motor \nvehicle, car theft, even indecent acts with a minor. I will tell you, \nif I had my way, I would put that one on--and kidnaping--but I just \npicked five.\n  So we provide for a cooling-off period, and we believe that cooling-\noff period--5 years clean--will give the military some information that \npeople are, in fact, on the straight and narrow path.\n  Unfortunately, we do not see the global challenges we face going \naway. We need our men and women in uniform not only to be soldiers but \nto be ambassadors to the world. They are the best we have. This \namendment helps to ensure we have the right men and women to do that \njob. I hope we will get support for this amendment. I say to my \ncolleagues who vote against this amendment, the only message you are \nsending to the people who are serving honorably is: You know what, we \nare so desperate, we are willing to put you at risk.\n  Again, I ask a rhetorical question: How would you feel if your son or \ndaughter or grandson or granddaughter wound up in an awful situation \nwith someone who had committed and was convicted of aggravated assault \nwith a deadly weapon?\n  There is one more thing I would like to do before I yield the floor, \nand that is to describe these felonies, how they are defined.\n  Arson, generally, is the malicious burning of another's dwelling. It \ncan be intentional or a fire set with reckless disregard of obvious \nrisks, in some States. Seven waivers were granted for arson.\n  Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon is the intentional creation \nof reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm by use a deadly weapon. An \nexample would be pointing a gun at someone, pointing a knife, swinging \na baseball bat, threatening violence or harm with a weapon in a manner \nto create a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm--40 waivers for \nthat.\n  Terrorist threatening: intentionally making false statements \nregarding a weapon of mass destruction such as placement on a \ngovernment or school property--essentially placing a fake WMD on \ngovernment property without permission; threatening to cause death or \nserious injury for the purpose of terrorizing others, their property, \nschool, or teachers; a false statement that could cause dangerous \nevacuation from buildings or airports. It could be bomb threats, \nthreats of poison-laced letters, or threats of mass shootings at \nschool. Waivers granted there.\n  Hate crimes. Most of the States penalize crimes of violence or \nintimidation based on race, color, religion, national origin, and when \nwe are looking at our military we are looking at the face of diversity, \nand someone who has been convicted of a hate crime within the last 5 \nyears--I think they need to think about what this country stands for \nand how it is based on equality for all before they are taken into the \nmilitary.\n  Sexual misconduct. Rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, sodomy of a \nminor--those are nonwaiver, but the category that is waiverable is \nsolicitation of sex, indecent exposure, illegal possession of \npornography.\n  So these are crimes which I think simply are too much to ask our men \nand women in uniform to deal with in new recruits.\n  I would point out something else. Because the Army has been so \ndesperate to get new recruits, they are paying tens of thousands of \ndollars, and now we have a situation where these convicted felons are \ngetting this money, to boot. It may not be that many people--maybe we \nare talking about 100. Overall, it has been 90+. We are making a point \nhere that our men and women in uniform deserve better protection than \nthis. We fight so hard, and we must fight to get them the bulletproof \nvests, to get them the up-armored HMMWVs\n\n[[Page S12410]]\n\nto protect them from IEDs, from all the horrors they face. Yet we allow \ninto the military--indeed, we pay bonuses to get into the military--\npeople who have been convicted of very serious crimes. It is not fair, \nit is not right, it is not just, and I hope there will be strong \nsupport for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second. There are no \nRepublicans on the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. We will ask for that later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I find it, firstly, very difficult to \nspeak in opposition to this amendment. But I do so after consulting \nwith the senior members, the chairman and the vice chairman, of the \nArmed Services Committee, the Senator from Michigan, and the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  I have been assured that after due consideration and investigation, \nthey have been convinced that the process of waivers does work. In \nfact, the investigation has suggested that those who have served after \nreceiving such waivers have done much better in serving our Nation than \nthose who came without any crime.\n  We should keep in mind that when we speak of certain crimes, there is \nno standard rule throughout the United States. In different States, \ncertain activities are considered criminal, in other States it is not \neven mentioned.\n  I was an assistant prosecutor a long time ago. I find that in certain \nStates certain activities are considered conservatively and other areas \nvery liberally. For example, in recent days, we have been hearing much \nabout the demonstration in Louisiana on the Jenna 6. Would that be a \ncrime in other States? In other communities? I do not think we have the \nanswer because we know that, depending on jurisdictions, certain \nactivities may be criminal and in others of no concern.\n  Whatever it is, on behalf of the Defense Appropriations Committee, I \nam calling on the leadership of the Armed Services Committee to conduct \na thorough further investigation on this matter. If it does work, and \nif it is necessary to provide waivers to get certain skills into our \nmilitary, then we should be told why.\n  But as of this moment, I cannot ignore the advice that I have \nreceived from my colleagues who are leaders of the authorizing \ncommittee. So, accordingly, at the appropriate time, I will make a \nmotion to table this amendment.\n  Before I do, if I may be very personal about this, I have been a \nvictim of hate and hate crimes, so I do know something about hate \ncrimes. If you can imagine my returning from World War II in my full \nregalia, uniform with four rows of ribbons, with a hook in my right \nhand, and going to a barber shop, and they looked at me and said: Are \nyou a Jap?\n  When I told them, no, I am an American: But your parents, are they \nJaps?\n  And I have to say: Yes, they are Japanese.\n  Well, we do not cut Jap hair.\n  Well, in some jurisdictions, that was appropriate and proper. Today \nwe do have jurisdictions where we do have segregation, maybe not \nlegally but understandably we do.\n  So as I have indicated, at the appropriate time, I will make a motion \nto table the Boxer amendment. It is not a happy deed. But I believe at \nthis moment, under the circumstances, I am compelled to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I note the Senator is waiting to be \nheard. I will be brief, but I do want to respond.\n  I so appreciate the fact that Senator Inouye spoke to our colleagues \non the Armed Services Committee. But I do think we need to use our own \nbrains and our own common sense. I do think when I look in the eyes of \nparents who are sending their kids into the military, they need to \nknow, they need to know that in addition to the dangers of this war, in \naddition to the danger of being thrust into the middle of a civil war, \nthey should not have to deal with the danger of a convicted felon who \nhas used a gun and put that gun against somebody's head within the past \n5 years.\n  We all know that the committees are very close to the military. I \nunderstand that. But is not there a time for us to stand up and show a \nlittle spunk and spine here and state the obvious, that although we all \nsupport waivers, because there are certain cases where a waiver may \nmake sense, there is such a thing as an abuse of a waiver. If you look \nat the numbers and see we are up to almost 1,000 of these waivers, \nthings are getting out of control.\n  Now, I know that both the Armed Services Committee, the authorizers \nand the Appropriations Committee, which are very powerful committees, \ndo not like this amendment. They want me to go away. They have offered \nnow twice, the authorizing and appropriations: Will you not take a \nstudy and go away?\n  Yes, I want to have a study. But, no, I do not think we should walk \naway from this. This is a commonsense amendment. This takes five of the \nwhole list of crimes--and I will repeat what they are: arson, \naggravated assault with a deadly weapon, sexual crimes, hate crimes, \nand making a terrorist threat.\n  I think for this year, do not pay bonuses to these people who have \nbeen convicted of these crimes for the last 5 years and do not take \nthem into the military. That would send a signal to the military that \nthey need to do their own study. It is stunning to me that we would \nhave to have a study about this--the DoD does not even want to study \nthis thing. They just want to meet the recruitment goal.\n  We all want them to meet their recruitment goals, but if it means \nputting someone, a dangerous criminal, next to one of my men and women \nin uniform, no thank you. It is tough enough to survive Iraq. We have \nworked with veterans on this amendment so we have gotten it to the \npoint where, yes, we give people a chance to turn over a new leaf.\n  I am disappointed that Senators Inouye and Stevens do not support \nthis amendment, but I am not surprised. I am going to keep talking \nabout this issue because this status quo is not good for our troops.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nunderlying appropriations bill. First, let me thank the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee. I think the work they have done \non this bill is very important.\n  I wish to talk especially about the issue of the bomber fleet in this \ncountry: B-2s, B-1s, B-52s. I do that for a very specific reason.\n  Right now a lot of our soldiers are in the field, in harm's way. They \nstrap on body armor in the morning, get shot at that day. We are at \nwar. All of us want to make certain our soldiers who have answered the \ncall have everything they need to do what they need to do.\n  I do think, however, there are times in the Pentagon when a \nsubstantial amount of money is spent, far more than is necessary, and \nthere is some waste. I wish to describe one of the things I find \ninteresting and also somewhat troubling.\n  Our bomber force is a part of the force that gives us air \nsuperiority. When you provide air superiority and have control of the \nair it has a tremendous impact on our ability to fight a war. We have \nseen some recent examples about what impact that has.\n  Part of that force is made up of B-52 bombers. They were produced \ndecades ago. They are kind of the ``gray beards'' of the bomber fleet. \nThey are essentially bomb trucks that will haul\n\n[[Page S12411]]\n\nweapons to various parts of the world. The newest ones were built in \nthe 1960s. But, of course, most of the plane has been rehabilitated and \nchanged, the electronics and so on.\n  Former Air Force Chief of Staff GEN John Jumper said the B-52 and \nother aircraft will have greater access to targets in the future \nbecause of the F-22. With its stealth and supercruise characteristics, \nthe F-22 will be able to precede other aircraft into combat zones to \nclear out any threats.\n  So we have been told we should fund the F-22. I have supported that. \nThe F-22 is an unbelievably effective next-generation fighter. We are \ntold we should support that because the F-22 goes in and essentially \nclears out the airspace; knocks out the radar and knocks out all things \nthat could be a threat to our bombers and other aircraft, at which \npoint the airspace is owned and you can bring in a bomb truck, for \nexample.\n  Well, here are the costs of flying our bombers. The cost is: $78,000 \nan hour to fly a B-2, $48,000 an hour to fly a B-1, and $34,000 an hour \nto fly a B-52.\n  We are told the B-52 will be usable for another 30 years. Yet we are \ntold by the Air Force planners that what they would like to do is \nretire the least costly bomb truck. That way, after we have cleared the \nair threat and have air superiority, they want to fly the most \nexpensive bomb trucks in and have the least costly bomb truck retired. \nIt makes little sense to me, from a taxpayer standpoint, but that is \nwhat we would try to do.\n  It also doesn't make sense when we look at the new bomber the Air \nForce is planning on. The earliest date it might be available is the \nyear 2018. Of course, that will slip. They all slip.\n  The new bomber, we are told, that when completed, would have an \nunrefueled range of 2,000 miles. The B-52 has double that and more. The \nnew bomber will have a weapons payload of 14,000 to 28,000 pounds; the \nB-52, 70,000 pounds.\n  Not only does the B-52 have more endurance and more payload than the \nnew bomber. The B-52 is also fully paid for. It is usable for three \nmore decades, and it flies at much less cost than the other two bombers \nwe now have. But the Air Force wants to take a good number of B-52s and \nretire them at Davis-Monthan.\n  I make the point that the authorizing committee has indicated the Air \nForce should keep 76 of the B-52s. As we work through this and look at \nwhat our bomber fleet should look like, I think it will become clear \nthat keeping the B-52s makes sense both for our defense capabilities \nand for the effect on the American taxpayer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3126, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have sent a modification of my \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.  No amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to provide a waiver for \n     enlistment in the Armed Forces of an individual convicted \n     under Federal or State law of any felony offense, during the \n     five-year period ending on the date of the proposed \n     enlistment of such individual in the Armed Forces, as \n     follows:\n       (1) Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n       (2) Arson.\n       (3) Hate Crime.\n       (4) Sexual misconduct.\n       (5) Terrorist threatening.\n       (6) Kidnapping or abducting a child.\n       (7) Indecent acts with a minor.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to make a couple other points that are not related \nto this specific bill but to the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill for the continuing Iraq War and fight against global terrorism. We \nhave a $152 billion request in front of us with another $45 billion \nexpected on top of that. All of this is emergency spending and none of \nwill be paid for. This will take us to the neighborhood of three \nquarters of a trillion dollars or more, when spent, with respect to the \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan and other related matters. All of these \ncosts will be added directly to the federal debt.\n  During wartime, in most cases, this country has decided it should pay \nfor things that we consume and pay for the cost of wars. We did it in \nthe Civil War. We did it in the Spanish-American War. We did it in \nWorld War I and World War II and other wars. We began a process by \nwhich we tried to pay for some of that which the war was costing.\n  The question about whether we should commit ourselves as a country to \npay for war is an interesting question. In the Iraq war, our soldiers \nwere sent to fight, and President Bush indicated we could best serve \nour country by going shopping. We should go to the mall to keep our \neconomy moving.\n  We could also best serve our country, in my judgment, by deciding not \nto send our soldiers to fight and then come back later and pay the bill \nbecause we decided to charge all of it--every penny of it borrowed.\n  Let me read something Franklin Roosevelt said during one of his \nfireside chats:\n\n       Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a ship \n     yard, or on the farms or in the fields or mines, producing \n     the weapons or raw materials that are needed by our armed \n     forces. But there is one front and one battle where everyone \n     in the United States--every man, woman, and child--is in \n     action. . . .That front is right here at home, in our daily \n     lives, and in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone will \n     have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \n     necessary, not only to supply our fighting men [and women], \n     but to keep the economic structure of our country fortified \n     and secure . . .\n\n  President Johnson said:\n\n       The test before us as a people is not whether our \n     commitments match our will and courage; but whether we have \n     will and courage to match our commitments.\n\n  When the emergency supplemental bill comes to the floor of the Senate \nthis time, I am going to ask if we should begin to pay for some of this \nand to begin to ask for some sacrifice. At least in the easiest of \nareas for all of us to make a decision, let me show you $23 billion of \nrevenue right now that we might use to offset some of that which \notherwise will be described as emergency. I have a piece of legislation \nthat will shut down offshore tax haven abuses. This is one I described \n2 years ago on the floor of the Senate. It is the Ugland House, a five-\nstory white house in the Cayman Islands, that is home to 12,748 \ncorporations. They are not there. That is a legal fiction created by \nlawyers to allow those companies to avoid paying the taxes they owe in \nthe United States. I have a piece of legislation, S. 396, that says if \nU.S. corporations are going to set up a paper company in an offshore \ntax haven simply to avoid paying taxes, it is not going to work. We \nclose that loophole. Here is an obvious one we could change \nimmediately: end abusive foreign sale and lease transactions. We can \nuse some of these to pay for some of that which we are spending on the \nwar. This is a case of the lease of 65 streetcars in Germany by a \nUnited States corporation, First Union Bank. Here is one in which \nWachovia Bank bought a sewage system in a German city. Do they want to \nown a German sewer system? No, they want to save $175 billion in taxes \nthrough a tax loophole. We could close this right now.\n  I am going to suggest, when we bring another emergency bill to the \nfloor--in this case nearly $200 billion--that maybe it is long past \ntime for us to meet the obligation we have; that is, to ask all of us \nto sacrifice a bit. In this case, ask those who have exercised huge \nloopholes to avoid paying taxes in the United States. This is a picture \nrelating to another bill I have. This is called the Radio Flyer. I \nexpect every Member of the Senate when they were little toddlers rode \nin a little red wagon called a Radio Flyer. This was made in Illinois. \nIt was made by an immigrant who over a century ago built the company \nthat created the Radio Flyer. The reason he named it Radio Flyer is, he \nliked Marconi. He enjoyed airplanes so he decided to call his little \nred wagon the Radio Flyer. Guess what. After a century this is gone. \nThere are no more red Radio Flyer wagons built in America. They have \nall gone to China. And by the way, the company that shut down the plant \nin the United States and moved the red\n\n[[Page S12412]]\n\nwagons to China in search of cheap labor got a tax incentive from this \nCongress to do it. We can shut that down immediately.\n  So these three ideas and a temporary 1 percent emergency tariff on \nimported foreign goods would raise some $23 billion in the first year \nalone. Do we need to wait? Do we need a month, a year, 10 years? I \ndon't think so. All we need is the will and the commitment to do what \nis right. With respect to these issues, I believe we could do plenty of \nthings that would begin to reduce the cost that will inure to our \nsoldiers, who valiantly fight when asked to, when they come back and \ndiscover we have spent a lot of money but we charged it all. So they \nget to fight today and pay the bill tomorrow. I think we can and should \ndo much better than that.\n  I have described in shorthand four proposals that I hope we will \nconsider when we do the second piece of this issue of Defense \nappropriations.\n  Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens worked very hard on this \nlegislation. This is one of the largest bills we consider in the \nSenate. There are a lot of issues, some very controversial. I \nappreciate the work they and their staff have done to put this \ntogether. It is not an easy appropriations bill to do. My hope is that \nas we work through this in the next day or so, we will be able to have \nfinal passage in a couple of days and get this into conference so we \ncan resolve all of these issues.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I want to start where the Senator from \nNorth Dakota concluded his remarks, to express the gratitude of \nDelaware for the fine work the appropriations subcommittee has done, \nthe leadership of Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, their staffs, the \nother members of the committee. One of the letters I sent to Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens several weeks ago was a letter calling on \nthem to not rescind, through legislative language in the appropriations \nbill, the 2004 Defense authorization language which said we were not \ngoing to allow the Air Force to retire any additional C-5 aircraft \nuntil the first three had been fully modernized, flight tested, and \nthen evaluated. A number of us signed that letter and a number of us in \nthe same letter also called for the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense to endorse the President's budget proposal for fiscal 2008 with \nrespect to C-5 modernization. The subcommittee has done that. I thank \nthem in a very public way for their attention to our request.\n  Today we are considering an important bill, one that provides funding \nfor our troops, many in harm's way around the world, others in \ndifferent phases of training or in some cases retraining or rest after \nthey have been deployed abroad. As we vote to appropriate these funds \nfor our Nation's defense, we are reminded of one of the fundamental \nduties of our military. Our Armed Forces are charged with providing our \nCommander in Chief and military leaders with flexible options for \nresponding to a wide variety of threats. In Iraq, our Armed Forces are \nkeeping the lid on civil war and protecting civilians from terrorists \nand literally from one another. In Korea, our Armed Forces are charged \nwith guarding the ally's border and deterring aggression on the part of \na large conventional military on the other side of the South Korean \nborder. In the Pacific and the Persian Gulf, they protect America's \ninterests through the projection of naval power and carrier-based air \npower.\n  At home our National Guard provides the Nation's Governors with \ncritical response capability to cope with natural disasters such as \nKatrina. At times it can seem as though the demands on our military are \nalmost limitless. Unfortunately, the resources available for equipping \nour military to meet these demands are not limitless. At a time when \nour Federal budget remains mired in red ink, we need to be looking for \nways to effectively meet our military requirements but to do so in a \nfiscally responsible manner.\n  Last Thursday in the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee of the \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, we spent 3 hours \ndoing just that. In this hearing, which I chaired along with Senator \nCoburn of Oklahoma, we explored how we can best meet our Nation's \nstrategic airlift needs and how we can do this in a way that is \nfiscally responsible. What I wish to do is take a few minutes this \nafternoon to remind us why airlift is important and to offer a little \nhistory of how we got into the position we are in today. Then I wish to \nshare with my colleagues some of what we learned at our hearing last \nweek.\n  The bottom line is that regardless of whether strategic airlift is \nperformed by C-5s, by C-17s, or by some other capability, airlift is \nessential to our Nation's ability to project power and meet threats \nabroad. I would remind us that roughly 90 percent of the materiel we \nmove around the world goes by sea. Maybe 10 percent goes by air. When \nit comes to moving military personnel, almost all of them are moved \naround the world by airlift. When you think of the 10 percent or so of \ncargo that is moved by aircraft, roughly half of that is moved by C-5s, \nC-17s, and by C-130s. The other half is moved by commercial aircraft \nthe Air Force leases from time to time.\n  The bottom line is that regardless of whether we are moving goods or \npersonnel by C-5, C-17, or some other capability, we have to have that \ncapability when we need it and it has to be reliable.\n  Though the men and women of our strategic airlift fleet rarely get \nthe attention they deserve, the reality is our military could not \nperform its missions if it were not for the hard work and dedication of \nthe airlift. Strategic airlift involves the use of cargo aircraft to \nmove personnel, weaponry, materiel over long distance, often to combat \ntheaters on the other side of the globe. During the current war in \nIraq, airlift sorties have made up the majority of the nearly 35,000 \ntotal sorties flown by U.S. aircraft. Strategic airlift enables our \nmilitary to respond to threats wherever they occur in the world real \ntime. Not only must our fighting men and women be transported to the \nfight, they must be continually supplied. Airlift helps to make that \nhappen. Both the C-17 and the C-5 have fulfilled their lift duties \nadmirably, and the United States owes much of its rapid deployment \ncapability to these fine machines.\n  We are blessed in Delaware at the Dover Air Force Base to have both \nC-5Bs and a new squadron of C-17s. However, the problem is that over \nthe past 10 years, the United States has reduced its Cold War \ninfrastructure and closed two-thirds of our forward bases. I remember \nmany of the bases my squad and I used to fly out of in Vietnam. A lot \nof the bases in Thailand from which we flew missions in Southeast Asia, \nOkinawa, and the Philippines have now been closed. We no longer fly \nfrom those particular places. As a result, our ability to project our \ntroops by air power as well as by sea power is more important than \never.\n\n  One of the ways we have sought to keep the strategic airlift fleet \nhealthy and ready to meet this challenge is by modernizing the C-5 \nthrough two unique programs. One is called the Avionics Modernization \nProgram, where we take a 1960s, 1970s cockpit and turn it into a \ncockpit for the 21st century. The second is a program called the \nReliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program, where we literally \ntake old C-5 engines, take them out--they break down about every 5,000 \nflight hours anyway--and replace them with an engine that will give us \n10,000 hours between engine changes; change out the hydraulic system, \noverhaul the landing gear system, fix some 70 systems in all, and, \nagain, replace the cockpit.\n  Those are the kinds of things that are done with the modernization \nprocess that is underway. So far, three aircraft have been fully \nmodernized; three C-5s have been fully modernized and are being flight \ntested as we speak here today. In fact, collectively they have been \nflown over 500 hours, and the full evaluation is to be completed--I \nthink the flight evaluation will be done for the most part within the \nnext 12 months, and some flight evaluations will be completed by June \nof 2010.\n  Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor in the program. They are \nobligated to produce C-5Ms with a mission-capable rate that meets or \nexceeds 75 percent. That is well above where the C-5 is today. It is, \nfrankly, slightly below where the C-17 is today.\n\n[[Page S12413]]\n\n  Lockheed reports that nothing in the flight data to date, after over \n500 hours of flight testing, suggests the 75 percent mission-capable \nrate cannot be met or exceeded. The Assistant Secretary for Acquisition \nof the U.S. Air Force last week in our hearing concurred in that \nopinion. Consequently, I was compelled, along with Senator Coburn, to \nhold a hearing to find out an answer to a very contentious question, \nand here is the question: At what price per aircraft could Lockheed or \nwould Lockheed modernize all or part of the remaining C-5 fleet of 108 \naircraft?\n  This past summer, Lockheed offered to modernize the C-5 fleet at what \nthey call a flyaway cost of--a little less than $90 million per \naircraft, whether the Congress and the administration decide to \nmodernize half of the C-5 fleet, two-thirds of the C-5 fleet or all 108 \nC-5s. If Lockheed can deliver C-5s at a mission-capable rate of 75 \npercent or higher, at a flyaway cost of $85 million, $95 million or \neven $105 million, aircraft capable of flying another quarter of a \ncentury or more, we would be foolish not to modernize the remaining 108 \nC-5s. If Lockheed cannot deliver--cannot deliver aircraft that are 75 \npercent mission-capable rate or higher--if they can't deliver them at a \ncost we are willing to pay--then we need to find another alternative.\n  Now, the Air Force has questioned whether Lockheed will actually be \nable to deliver what the company has promised. The Air Force has \nsuggested the cost of fully modernizing the C-5s may significantly \nexceed original expectations. This has led the Air Force to conclude \nthat C-5 modernization may not be as cost effective as we all had \noriginally thought and hoped.\n  I wish to take a moment and share with my colleagues three areas in \nwhich the Air Force and Lockheed appear to be in disagreement. As you \ncan see from the chart beside me, the Air Force and Lockheed disagree \non the modernizing of C-5s in three areas. No. 1, propulsion system, \nthat is aircraft engine; No. 2, installation costs and what they call \ntouch labor costs, or the amount of man-hours to be invested in these \nchanges; and finally, overhead costs which include, among other things, \nthe kinds of problems that might be uncovered as Lockheed goes through \nand conducts the modernization of the C-5s--problems that aren't even \nrelated to the modernization changes that are being installed.\n  Now, this disagreement yields a C-5 modernization cost discrepancy of \nover $4 billion--not a small amount of money. With this fundamental \ncost disagreement coming to light, our hearing tried to get into the \ntrue cost of C-5 modernization. What we found was a temporary \nstalemate. We also found what appears to be a way forward. In their \ncost calculations of the C-5 modernization, the Air Force determined \nthe cost of the C-5 modernization has grown over its baseline, causing \nthe view of at least some in the Air Force to trigger what we call a \nNunn-McCurdy breach. The Nunn-McCurdy breach, as some will recall, is \npart of a law passed in 1983 that allows Congress to track the rising \ncosts of Defense programs. A breach of Nunn-McCurdy occurs when a \nDefense program procurement cost goes beyond 50 percent of its \nbaseline. When this happens, the Department of Defense has to notify \nthe Congress and the program is more heavily scrutinized, in this case \nby the office of the Secretary of Defense. Interestingly enough, \nthough, we found that part of the Air Force calculation includes costs \nof inflation due to the risks the Air Force may incur if Lockheed \ncannot meet its goals. Lockheed also stated they have a different \ncalculation to show some growth but not enough to trigger a Nunn-\nMcCurdy breach.\n\n  Lockheed's witness at our hearing last Thursday stated that the \ncontractor--that is Lockheed--is ready to alleviate the Air Force's \nconcerns and, therefore, to decrease the amount of cost growth that the \nC-5 modernization would realize by providing the Air Force with a firm, \nfixed price contract to modernize all 108 aircraft at a set cost. If \nLockheed exceeds this price, then the cost is on them--on Lockheed. The \nonly obstacle--major obstacle at least--that stands in Lockheed's way \nis the Air Force's decision on how fast they want to fully modernize \nthe C-5s. The President's budget for 2008 calls for modernizing C-5s, \none starting in fiscal 2008, ramping up from 1 to as many as 12 several \nyears down the line. But the contractors need to know how many aircraft \nare going to be modernized, and in order for them to be able to be held \nor bound to a fixed cost, they have to have some reasonable assurance \nthat what is being projected will actually be followed, in this case by \nthe Air Force and by us in the Congress.\n  Let me mention a couple of things in closing. One, it says propulsion \nsystem. This is one of the three areas of disagreement between Lockheed \nand the Air Force. This involves engines--actually the same engine that \ngoes on Air Force One and a whole lot of other aircraft around the \nworld. The engine, made by General Electric, provides generally between \nengine changes about 10,000 flight hours. It would replace an engine \nthat gets about 1,000 hours between engine changes. That is a \nmiserable-performing engine that is on the C-5, and it has led to all \nkinds of problems. There is a question about what is GE going to charge \nLockheed to sell them four new engines for 108 planes, plus 25 spares. \nI think that ends up being about 457 engines.\n  In our conversation offline with GE, they gave us a price well below \nwhat the Air Force is expecting or is calculating. If GE is good to \ntheir word and Lockheed is good to its word, then this $1.2 billion \ndeficit--or in the case of the Air Force, ostensibly an overrun--that \nshouldn't be there. That shouldn't be there. The question is, Can GE \nand Lockheed be compelled--contractually bound--to provide these \nengines at the lower cost that was quoted to us by GE.\n  The second piece deals with labor, touch labor costs, the amount of \nman-hours that will be used to build these or rebuild these aircraft. \nThe first of the C-5s that were modernized took 143,000 man-hours, the \nsecond took 125,000, the third took about 110,000 man-hours. Lockheed \nsays they think they can bring it in at about 100,000 man-hours. The \nAir Force says, no, 116,000 man-hours. Lockheed has a learning curve in \nterms of better, faster work on the modernization that they believe \nthey can adhere to. The Air Force says, no, that is too optimistic.\n  Interestingly enough, though, Lockheed has said to the Air Force and \nto us at our hearing, if we are wrong on the number of man-hours that \nwe say it is going to take to modernize the fourth, fifth or sixth \naircraft, if we are wrong on the learning curve and not as successful \nas we think we are going to be, we will eat the cost. They say they \nwill eat the cost. That is great that they offer that, but what we need \nis a contract that can bind them to eat the cost if there is a failure \nto perform as otherwise would be suggested.\n  Those are the kinds of things that are in dispute. Ultimately, I \nwould hope--and I can't speak for Senator Coburn, but I believe I would \nshare his view that we need large cargo aircraft. We have C-5s. They \ncan carry more than most cargo aircraft. Right now, we are using \nRussian aircraft, Russian-made aircraft, a big aircraft called the AN-\n124, to supplement the work that the C-5 can do. We spend today almost \n$200 million leasing Soviet aircraft or Russian aircraft to do the work \nfor us of the strategic airlift. Nothing against the Russians, God \nbless them, but I don't know how comfortable you feel--I don't feel all \nthat comfortable--relying on Russian cargo aircraft to supplement our \nneeds around the world.\n  My hope is that what we will do is have our friends from Lockheed and \nour friends from the Air Force step back, for a moment, and then \nreengage in a way that seeks to narrow this, what you call a $4 billion \ndelta or difference, in the assumption of costs for completing this \nproject.\n  If Lockheed can produce fully modernized C-5Ms that will perform at a \n75-percent mission-capable rate or more and do that at a cost of $85 \nmillion, $95 million or even $105 million on a flyaway basis, we would \nbe foolish to turn down that deal. If they can't do it, if they can't \ndeliver aircraft at that kind of mission-capable rate, if they can't do \nit along the line that I quoted as a price that we can be assured of, \nthen we need to look for another alternative.\n  My hope, coming out of our hearing last week, is that there is a way \nforward, and we need the best efforts of\n\n[[Page S12414]]\n\nthe Air Force and the best efforts of Lockheed to find it. If we get \nthose best efforts, we may end up with what in the end will not be just \na good deal for our country and for our taxpayers at a time when we are \nrunning huge budget deficits but a good deal for the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces who are depending on strategic airlift every day of \ntheir lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3130\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and to call up the Sanders amendment, which has \nbeen filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3130.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase, with an offset, the amount appropriated for \n    Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard, by $10,000,000)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107. (a) Additional Amount for Operation and \n     Maintenance, Army National Guard.--The amount appropriated by \n     title II under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Army \n     National Guard'' is hereby increased by $10,000,000.\n       (b) Offset.--The aggregate amount appropriated by title II, \n     other than under the headings ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Army National Guard'' and ``Operation and Maintenance, Air \n     National Guard'', is hereby reduced by $10,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, yesterday, as part of the managers' \npackage, the Senate approved an amendment that I offered to the Defense \nauthorization bill. That amendment would establish a pilot program at \nthe Department of Defense to deal with a very important problem. That \nproblem is that all across our country, men and women are returning \nhome from the war in Iraq, from the war in Afghanistan, they are coming \nhome to big cities, small towns, and rural communities, and they and \ntheir families, in many cases, are hurting. These are soldiers and \nmilitary family members who are suffering from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, who are suffering from traumatic brain injury, who are \nsuffering from depression, and who are watching their marriages and \ntheir families coming apart. They are suffering nightmares, they are \nsuffering panic attacks and sometimes uncontrollable anger and various \nphysical symptoms. Because of the stigma, many of these brave soldiers \ndo not come forward for help, and others, where the military \ninfrastructure is not strong, simply don't know where to turn. They are \nhurting, but they don't know how to get help. In my view, we have a \nmoral responsibility to reach out to these soldiers and their families \nand to help them.\n  The program, approved by unanimous consent yesterday, would create a \npilot program at the Department of Defense. Under this pilot, funds \nwould be provided to adjutant generals to conduct person-to-person \noutreach to soldiers who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. In \nother words, the heart of this program is outreach quality. We can't be \nsuccessful in dealing with PTSD if soldiers do not get involved in the \nprogram, if they are not involved in counseling. I fear very much that \nunless we are aggressive in our outreach efforts, especially in rural \nareas, especially with the National Guard's people, we are going to see \nfolks who don't know where to turn.\n  These trained outreach personnel will be meeting with the soldiers \nand their families. They will be able to make sure the soldiers and \ntheir families know about the help that is available to them. In other \nwords, it doesn't matter how much help we have if our soldiers don't \nknow where to turn and what is available. These outreach workers would \nmake sure that America's heroes and our military families don't fall \nthrough the cracks.\n  As I mentioned, this body unanimously approved this new pilot as part \nof yesterday's Defense authorization bill. I thank the Members for \ntheir support. That pilot program amendment was cosponsored by Senators \nSununu, Kerry, Harkin, and Brown. I also point out that this amendment \nis supported by the National Guard Association of the United States.\n  My amendment today, cosponsored by Senator Leahy, is to make sure the \ncommitment we made yesterday to returning servicemembers and their \nfamilies is a real commitment backed by the necessary resources. This \namendment would provide $10 million to carry out the pilot program for \nState-based outreach programs to assist servicemembers and their \nfamilies created by the Sanders-Sununu-Kerry-Harkin-Brown amendment No. \n2905 to the Defense authorization bill. This amendment is fully offset.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the chairman and the ranking member, and I look \nforward to working with them.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the present \namendment be set aside to reconsider the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Boxer amendment, as \nmodified; that the time from 3:55 until 4 p.m. be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Boxer and Inouye or their designees; that \nno amendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote; that at 4 \np.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that when \nthe Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 3222 on Wednesday, following \nmorning business, there will be 30 minutes of debate prior to a vote in \nrelation to the pending Graham amendment; that the second-degree \namendment be withdrawn and no other amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; that the time be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Graham and Inouye or their designees; that \nupon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3126\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I understand I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes, \nfollowed by Senators Inouye and Stevens, and then there will be a \nmotion to table my amendment. I hope to convince colleagues who may be \nlistening to this debate to vote no on the motion to table.\n  I think this amendment deserves to be heard. It doesn't deserve to be \nshut down. The amendment is my modified amendment, which I sent to the \ndesk. It basically says there can be no more waivers granted for folks \nwho want to join the military who have been convicted of aggravated \nassault with a deadly weapon, arson, a hate crime, sexual misconduct, \nthreatening a terror attack, kidnapping or abducting a child, or \nindecent acts with a minor.\n  If we can show you this chart, right now, it is against the military \npolicy to allow any of the people into the military who have been \nconvicted of a felony. But there is a waiver process. What has happened \nis--and we all agree that there are occasions when there ought to be a \nwaiver now and then--we have seen an alarming increase in these waivers \nbecause the Army, in particular, is having a hard time meeting its \nrecruitment goals. We see in 2004 that the Army granted 3 of the 60 \nwaivers to recruits who had felonies on their record. In 2005, they \ngranted 571. In 2006, they granted 901 waivers. That is a 59-percent \nincrease over the 2005 number. It is a 150-percent increase over the \n2004 figure.\n\n[[Page S12415]]\n\n  So what we have seen is an alarming increase in the number of \nwaivers. What my amendment simply says is: Enough of this for seven \nfelonies. Again, the seven felonies are aggravated assault with a \ndeadly weapon, which is someone who has been convicted, perhaps, of \nputting a gun to someone's head and threatening them with bodily harm; \narson, someone who obviously has started a fire and put other people's \nlives in danger; hate crimes, and we discussed that at length. As a \nmatter of fact, we have a fine amendment that Senator Kennedy offered \nand that is now on the Defense authorization bill, which would say that \npeople have a right to be free of hate crimes because of the fact that \nthey may be different than the next person. Here you send people like \nthis into the military, and this is one of the most diverse \ninstitutions we have.\n  In conclusion, we are saying, please, don't table this amendment. The \nothers are sexual misconduct, terrorist threatening, indecent acts with \na minor, and kidnapping or indecent acts with a child. You don't want \nsomebody like that next to your son or daughter who is serving \nhonorably in the military.\n  I hope you vote no on the motion to table. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, as I indicated in the earlier debate, we \nhave been assured by the chair of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. \nLevin, and the vice chair, Mr. McCain, that this waiver process is \nworking and has worked.\n  It is not an easy amendment to speak against, but I am reminded of \nsomething that happened during my days of youth. After World War II, \nthere was a very distinguished German, who was a Nazi. He was the prime \nperson who helped develop the rockets and bombs that devastated London, \nwho was then in the process of developing an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile to devastate the United States. But we provided him with a \nwaiver. He came to the United States and worked to develop rockets for \nthe United States. If it weren't for this scientist, there is grave \ndoubt that we could have sent a man to the Moon at the time we did or \nwhether we could have developed the ICBM that we have today. His name \nwas Dr. Wernher von Braun.\n  I am against those crimes that my colleague from California cited. \nThey are objectionable, they are horrible, and as the father of a son, \nI can imagine what I would go through if my son had been a victim of \none of these crimes. But this process does work, and I think at this \nmoment to flat-out determine that this process cannot be used in \ncertain crimes may be shortsighted.\n  So on behalf of the ranking member of the committee and myself, I \nmove to table the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I join in that motion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing managers' package, No. 1, be adopted: amendment No. 3120, for \nSenator Baucus and others, regarding the Army Smart Data Project; \namendment No. 3125, for Senator Roberts, regarding Air Force materials \nresearch; amendment No. 3128, for Senator Kohl, regarding the Navy's \npermanent magnet motor; amendment No. 3124, as modified, for Senator \nLott, regarding Air Force pallet systems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We support these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3120\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test, and \n  Evaluation, Army, $1,000,000 for the Smart Data Project: Real Time \n             Geospatial Video Sensor Intelligence program)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.

Availability of Funds.--Of the amount \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by title III under \n     the heading ``Other Procurement, Air Force'', up to \n     $4,000,000 may be available for purposes of accelerating the \n     deployment of the Associate Intermodal Platform pallet \n     system.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, as my colleagues are aware, current \nforce intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, ISR, capabilities \nare impeded by three specific technology issues: in-theater network \ninterference, dissimilar IT infrastructure across forces and \nintelligence agencies, and slow storage and retrieval of mission \ncritical intelligence.\n  Once intelligence is gathered, whether by unmanned aerial vehicle, \nstationary sensors or mobile ground sensors, it is transmitted to ISR \nCommand. The data is sent as two streams--content, which is the actual \nimagery, and context, which is comprised of metadata relating to \nlocation, date, time, target information, destination of message, \nsender information, and more. Currently, much of this context stream, \nwhether location coordinates, date, and/or time information, is dropped \nor interrupted during transmission. These drops render as much as 30 \npercent of all motion video and still-imagery intelligence unusable. \nSuch data loss negatively affects current ISR operations and creates \nundesirable consequences in the field.\n  In cooperation with Senators Tester, Kerry, Wyden, and Smith, I \nsubmitted an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2008. This amendment would provide funding for the \nSmart Data Project through companies in three states. The recipient of \nfunding for this project would be Digimarc, Inc., of Oregon and \nMassachusetts. Additional research for the project will be conducted by \nGCS Research of Missoula, Montana, and S Technologies of Pablo, \nMontana. The purpose of this program is to address the existing \ncapability gap within the military's intelligence gathering operations \nand to provide our military with real-time geospatial video sensor \nintelligence.\n  The basis for the solution to address this capability gap is \ncurrently employed by all the major media networks, which use \ncomponents of Smart Data technology to track usage of proprietary \nvideo. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox embed unique data such as TV station \nidentification, date, and time into the content. This unique embedded \ndata is then used to generate reporting information about distribution \nand viewership.\n  Adaptation of Smart Data technology for military applications \ninvolves the embedding of key contextual information such as location \ncoordinates, date, time, and sender onto reconnaissance imagery. The \nembedding technology developed by the Smart Data team will eliminate \ndata loss that has negative effects on Current Force ISR operations. \nAddressing this data loss will improve operative effectiveness and save \nlives in the field.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3125\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nto the 2008 Defense Appropriations Act. This amendment is in the \ninterest of Kansas and our national security. I request up to $1 \nmillion be made available for Materials Integrity Management Research \nfor Air Force Systems, MILTEC. This project aims to develop advanced \nwireless sensors to be optimally placed for aircraft structure health \nmonitoring. The processed data will provide diagnostic and prognostic \ninformation that can be further used to assist in critical mission \nplanning. MILTEC is currently operating through Wichita State \nUniversity in Wichita, KS. I have no personal, familiar, or political \nconnection to these projects.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3128\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I submitted amendment No. 3128 along with \nSenator Kennedy to allow the Navy to provide up to $2 million to DRS in \nMilwaukee, WI, for DDG51 Class Modernization, Hybrid Propulsion \nPermanent Magnet Drive System. This would give the Navy the flexibility \nto develop a hybrid drive system to increase fuel economy. Today the \nDDG51 uses gas turbines to power the propulsion system. Installing a \nhybrid system would allow an electric motor to drive the ship at low \nspeed when the main turbine would be very inefficient. The project is \nexpected to pay for itself in saved fuel costs in 3 years. This upgrade \nwould be performed as the DDG51s underwent their 15-year midlife \nupgrade. While the work envisioned in this amendment would be done in \nMilwaukee, part of the work would also be done in Massachusetts and \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I submitted amendment No. 3128 along \nwith Senator Kohl to allow the Navy to provide up to $2 million to DRS \nin Milwaukee, WI for DDG51 Class Modernization--Hybrid Propulsion \nPermanent Magnet Drive System. This would give the Navy the flexibility \nto develop a hybrid drive system to increase fuel economy. Today the \nDDG5l uses gas turbines to power the propulsion system. Installing a \nhybrid system would allow an electric motor to drive the ship at low \nspeed when the main turbine would be very inefficient. The project is \nexpected to pay for itself in saved fuel costs in 3 years. This upgrade \nwould be performed as the DDG51s underwent their 15-year midlife \nupgrade.

Madam President, I am submitting Senate amendment No. 3124 \nto make funds available from the appropriation account Other \nProcurement, Air Force, to accelerate the deployment of the Associate \nIntermodal Platform pallet system.\n  The Associate Intermodal Platform pallet system is manufactured by \nShan Industries LLC, headquartered in Miami, FL, with manufacturing \nplants currently located in New Jersey and Oklahoma.\n  The Department of Defense has concluded that use of the Associate \nIntermodal Platform, AIP, pallet system, developed 2 years ago by the \nU.S. Transportation Command, could save the United States as much as \n$1,300,000 for every 1,000 pallets deployed. The Associate Intermodal \nPlatform pallet system can be used to transport cargo alone within \ncurrent International Standard of Organization containers, or in \nconjunction with existing 463L pallets. The Associate Intermodal \nPlatform pallet system has successfully passed rigorous testing by the \nU.S. Transportation Command at various military installations in the \nUnited States and in the field in Iraq, Kuwait, and Antarctica. The \nAssociate Intermodal Platform pallet system has performed well beyond \nexpectations and is ready for immediate production and deployment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate the work of the managers on \nthis important piece of legislation. I have conferred with the \nmanagers. After we have one vote sometime tomorrow morning, and if \nthere is nothing more happening, I think we should move to third \nreading. Just to protect all of our military, in case something goes \nawry in the next 24 hours, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     353, H.R. 3222, Department of Defense Appropriations Act, \n     2008.\n         Daniel K. Inouye, Jon Tester, Robert P.

Lincoln, Charles \n           Schumer, Byron L. Dorgan.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would hope we can just totally avoid this. \nOf\n\n[[Page S12417]]\n\ncourse, the cloture vote would not occur, at the earliest, until \nThursday anyway. I would hope that it will not be necessary that \ncloture be invoked. But we want to make sure that we are able to \ncomplete this legislation, including the managers' package on which \nthese two veteran legislators have worked. I have spoken to staff, and \nthe managers' amendment has not been cleared yet. It should be cleared. \nI hope we can finish this bill tomorrow afternoon early. This cloture \nmotion is to protect us in case something goes wrong.\n  I think perhaps we shouldn't go into morning business right now. \nSomeone might want to offer an amendment, and I want to make sure \neveryone has the ability to do that. It is 5 o'clock now. There will be \nno more votes today. Unless we have somebody here by 5:30 to offer an \namendment, we will go into morning business.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3135\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I introduced amendment No. 3135 to allow the Navy to \nprovide up to $5 million for the high temperature superconductor AC \nsynchronous propulsion motor. These funds will be used to test and \ntransition the high temperature superconductor AC synchronous \npropulsion motor to Navy ship class. This will serve in the effort to \nincrease power while reducing vessel weight.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 3134\n\n  I introduced amendment No. 3134 to allow the Navy to provide up to $3 \nmillion for the MK 50, NULKA, Decoy System. These funds can be used for \nthe purpose of continuing efforts to defend the Navy from the \ncontinually evolving threat of antiship missiles and associated seeker \nsystems.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I submitted an amendment with Senator \nKennedy as a cosponsor which may provide up to $1 million, within the \nNavy Sealift Account, to the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, MMA, in \nBuzzards Bay, MA. The funding will be used to help complete the \nconversion of the T.S. Enterprise, a Ready Reserve Force training ship. \nIn fiscal year 2000-2001, the Department of Defense Appropriations \nconference report included $25 million for the conversion of the T.S. \nEnterprise. However, that funding only allowed MARAD to produce a ship \nwhich holds only 600 cadets. The Massachusetts Maritime Academy has had \na growing number of students in recent years and requires the \nadditional room to allow all of their cadets to train on the ship. At a \ntime when our troops depend heavily on the material shipped to war \nzones on American flag ships, I believe it is critical to the \nlivelihood of the Nation that our maritime academies continue to \nproduce the professional men and women needed in the maritime trades.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on my amendment, \ndesignating $5 million--the amount requested by the Pentagon--for the \nMissile Defense Space Experimentation Center, a facility within the \nMissile Defense Integration & Operations Center on Schriever Air Force \nBase in Colorado Springs, CO.\n  The Missile Defense Space Experimentation Center supports research \nand development, agency operations, test and evaluations and operations \nand training for missile defense capabilities. It provides the Missile \nDefense Agency a common support infrastructure and connectivity for \noperating MDA experimental satellites, and integrating space data in \nsupport of the missile defense mission. The MDSEC provides a multilevel \nsecurity environment for sensor data management and integration across \nall space and terrestrial sensor data activities.\n  MDSEC activities support analysis, demonstration and integration of \nspace sensor capabilities into developmental and operational MDA \nElements. MDSEC also supports advanced technology and algorithm \ndevelopment, including fusion of multiple sensor types--radar, overhead \nnonimaging infrared, electro-optical and other emerging sensor \ntechnologies. MDSEC supports mission integration of space-based missile \ntrack--boost and midcourse phases--sensor and weapons cueing via C2BMC, \nfeatures and discrimination, kill and impact point assessments into \nC2BMC, Aegis, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense--THAAD--Global \nMissile Defense--GMD--and other--non-MDA--mission areas such as space \nsituation awareness, technical intelligence, and battle space \ncharacterization. For Fiscal Year 2008, the Missile Defense Space \nExperimentation Center will: Demonstrate connectivity and integration \nof space layer data into X-lab, BMDS elements, and external users; \ndemonstrate capability to access, share, and playback data across \nstakeholder programs--MDSEC Interchange System; provide synergy for \ntesting, experiments, integration and algorithm development--\nIntegration Lab; demonstrate capability to support and integrate across \nmultiple security environments/domains; demonstrate space-layer data \nsupport to non-BMDS Missions--external users; demonstrate integrated \nbirth-to-death tracking and fusion across existing, R and future BMDS \nsensors; support space-based sensors data collections and algorithm \ntesting experiments; complete MDSEC Interchange System--MIS: Test \nprototype MIS operating system and host MIS hardware suite.\n  I believe the mission and task for the MDSEC require our support and \nI urge passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, in regards to my amendment designating $5 million to \nsupport research and development, agency operations, test and \nevaluations and operations and training for missile defense \ncapabilities at the Missile Defense Space Experimentation Center, a \nfacility within the Missile Defense Integration & Operations Center on \nSchriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, CO, neither I nor anyone \nin my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the center or its \noperations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3140\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today in support of amendment No. \n3140 to the 2008 Defense Appropriations Act. This amendment is in the \ninterest of Louisiana and health care programs within the Department of \nDefense. I request up to $1 billion be made available for Maternal-\nFetal Health Informatics and Outreach Program. This project will be the \nuse of Telehealth and electronic medical record, EMR, technologies \ncentered on conducting research and developing technology solutions for \nhigh-risk obstetrical patients, in collaboration with the DOD. The \nintent of the Maternal Fetal Informatics Outreach Program, MFIOP, is to \nleverage technology toward optimizing health care delivery solutions \nfor women and infants. This effort will increase portability of patient \nrecords and lead to a decrease in associated health care cost related \nto obstetrical, OB, and newborn health care services. The Maternal-\nFetal Health Informatics and Outreach Program is currently operating \nout of Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge, LA.

Mr. President, earlier today, I left a Banking Committee \nhearing to go out to Arlington National Cemetery to meet with a group \nof World War II veterans. A woman by the name of Ms. Best, who had \nserved in World War II, was laying the wreath on behalf of Miami \nCounty, OH, veterans--some 35 or so veterans from Ohio who took a bus \nunder the sponsorship of Glenn Devers, who raises money so veterans can \ncome to Washington and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier \nand then proceed to see the World War II monument.\n  I was struck, first, by all the stories of Mr. and Mrs. Whited, for \ninstance. Mr. Whited was called off to the service and went overseas. \nHis child was born a few months after he left, and when he returned, he \nsaw his son for the first time, who was the age of 2. He is now more \nthan 60 years old. I was taken by the stories of so many of these World \nWar II veterans, their courage and heroism, their love of country, \ntheir duty, their commitment, and their patriotism. They surely--\nwithout overusing the phrase--were part of ``the greatest generation.''\n  Few veterans have asked for credit or recognition, but it was such a \npleasure to go there and talk to them today. I\n\n[[Page S12418]]\n\nhad one request of them. Of course, I thanked them over and over. I had \none request, and that was that these veterans, both men and women, tell \ntheir stories to their children and grandchildren. My father, a World \nWar II veteran who enlisted about a year after Pearl Harbor, sometime \nduring 1942, and went overseas, he didn't talk about it much. He passed \naway 6 years ago at the age of 89. He didn't talk about it much. I \nencouraged these men and women who served our country valiantly in \nWorld War II--or any veteran since then--to share the stories with \ntheir children and grandchildren because it will enrich their lives. \nThey don't need to brag, but they ought to tell friends and families \nabout their accomplishments and feats. These are stories that their \nchildren and grandchildren and great-grandchildren will treasure for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  I thought of that visit yesterday before I made the visit, as I was \nplanning it. I thought yesterday, when the Senate passed the Defense \nreauthorization bill, of an amendment that Congressman Bart Stupak of \nMichigan and I have been working on. Currently, the Department of \nDefense--prior to this amendment--is allowed to use any combination of \nair, rail or road transportation to bring the body of a fallen soldier \nhome. But what has been done, because the rule is so broad, the law is \nso broad, the Department of Defense in many cases has brought the body \nof a soldier killed in action to the nearest big city airport, which \ncould be 50, 100, 200 or 300 miles away. Congressman Stupak represents \nan area in northern Michigan, the Upper Peninsula, and often bodies are \nbrought back to Green Bay, which is too far from many of these families \nwho have to go to an airport that is 2 or 3 hours away with the funeral \nhome, paying the expenses and accompanying the body back to the \nhometown. That has happened in southern Ohio, where there is no \nairport. Maybe they would go to Charleston, Columbus or Pittsburgh. It \nis outrageous that the Department of Defense doesn't bring the bodies \nto the communities where the families live, when they are already so \ndistraught from losing a loved one.\n  We were able to get the fallen servicemember respectful return \namendment included in the Department of Defense bill. This means that \nwhen our soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice in service to their \ncountry, the least the Government and the DOD can do--and for reasons I \ndon't even understand they had failed to do. We talk so much about \nhonoring our soldiers, but they failed to do this. All of the money we \nare spending--hundreds of billions of dollars--and they didn't get \nthese bodies back to the funeral home in the local communities. It is \nincumbent upon us to do that.\n  Congressman Stupak in the House and my amendment in the Senate \nfinally has done that. The least we can do is ease the path for these \nfamilies as they confront their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12418-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12418-S12419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Children's Health Insurance Plan \nlegislation was delivered to the White House this afternoon for, I \nhope, the President's signature, but unfortunately, I fear the \nPresident's veto. It is unbelievable that the President would veto \nlegislation that means so much to many working families in Ohio, in the \ngreat State of Colorado, and any of the other 48 States in our great \nNation.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program was conceived in 1996 and \ntook effect in 1997, with a Democratic President and a Republican House \nand Senate. It now insures some 6 million children in our country. \nThese are the sons and daughters of working families, parents who are \nworking hard, playing by the rules, paying their taxes, but they make \ntoo much to be on Medicaid but make too little to be able to afford \ninsurance, especially if one of their children has a preexisting \ncondition of any serious nature. They are making $20,000, $30,000, and \n$40,000 a year.\n  The President--as Senator Grassley has pointed out in criticism--has \nsaid we don't want to give help to these rich children. These are \nfamilies making $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, and as much as $50,000 or \n$60,000 a year but mostly families making less. They are struggling, \nand it is not easy to pay the bills when you make $30,000 or $40,000 a \nyear, let alone pay for health care bills and health insurance.\n  The President also said he doesn't want this big Government program. \nHe talked about socialism, or something I don't understand. The \nPresident of the United States and most Members of Congress go out to \nBethesda. That is a Government health care system. They get great \nhealth care at Bethesda Naval Hospital. The VA has terrific facilities, \nnot just the CBOCs, community-based outreach clinics, such as in \nMansfield, Youngstown, Lorraine, Springfield, Marion, Lima, and all \nover the State and all over this country; but the big VA hospitals in \nplaces such as Brecksville, Columbus, and Chillicothe, and what all \nthat means.\n\n  The President says these are kids who should be covered by private \ninsurance. Sure, they should. I wish these children did have private \ninsurance. But the fact is that millions of children in our country \ndon't have private insurance. At relatively little cost--because most \nchildren don't cost much to insure--we can put them in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  If the President vetoes this bill, it will immediately mean that some \nnumber of children--several hundred thousand--will lose their health \ninsurance immediately, and it will mean a lost opportunity for 4 \nmillion other children in Colorado, Ohio, and all over this country, to \nget health insurance. Again, these are children of working parents--\nparents who are struggling and doing the best they can to make a go of \nit. All they want is health insurance for their children.\n  The President is critical of the cost of the bill. This bill will \ncost about $7 billion a year, the Children's Health Insurance Plan. The \nPresiding Officer voted for it and I voted for it and it passed this \nSenate with 68 votes, with almost 20 Republicans--almost 40 percent of \nthe Republicans voted for this bill in the Senate and all of the \nDemocrats. This is a bipartisan bill. The House is the same way, where \ndozens of Republicans in the House voted for it.\n  So it is clearly a bipartisan bill, and the President says it costs \ntoo much. It costs $7 billion a year in the next 5 years. What does \nthat mean? In contrast, we spend in 1 week in Iraq close to $3 billion. \nSo we are spending $3 billion a week in Iraq, and we want to spend $7 \nbillion a year to cover 4 million children--some 60 or 70 or 80 in Ohio \nwould take advantage of this--and the President says no to that. He \nwants more than $3 billion additional per week in Iraq. Something is \nwrong with those priorities.\n  The President has had the legislation delivered to him at the White \nHouse. I hope the President will reconsider some of his public comments \nand listen to middle-class families. This is one of those times when \nGovernment can directly help the middle class and make a difference in \nthe lives of so many middle-class families who are struggling, such as \nthe Demko family in Columbus.\n  I just wish the President would open his mind and his ears and his \neyes for the next few days and let's send some children, some families \nwe have met, whom you have met, Mr. President, in Boulder or Denver, \nwhom you met in Colorado Springs, whom I have met in Columbus, \nCincinnati, or Dayton, or Zanesville, or Steubenville--let's invite \nsome of those families to the White House, sit down with the President \nand say: Mr. President, here is what the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram means to me and my family and to a lot of my neighbors. Please, \nMr. President, sign this bill.\n  I believe, because I think he is a decent person, if the President \nwould open his ears, eyes, and mind to that conversation of those \nfamilies, it would be a very different outcome. I am hopeful in the \nnext couple of days that the President will sign the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. If he does not, I am confident we will override his \nveto in the Senate, and I am hopeful that enough Republicans will get \non this bipartisan bandwagon and join the Democrats in overriding that \nveto because it will mean a stronger, more vibrant, more humane policy \nand a stronger middle class for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S12419]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, from day one, the Bush administration \nhas pursued an aggressive agenda of privatizing essential Government \nservices, even when there has existed overwhelming evidence that doing \nso would waste money, impair accountability, harm citizens who rely on \nthose services, or jeopardize our Nation's safety and security. The \nKennedy-McCaskill amendment on civilian contracting will slow this \nagenda and bring some much needed common sense to the administration's \ncampaign to outsource essential functions to the private sector.\n  Among other reforms, the amendment will nullify an edict imposed from \noutside the Department of Defense that the agency contract out a \ncertain number of jobs regardless of the merits; give Federal employees \nthe same rights to challenge a contracting decision that are now \nenjoyed by private contractors; and eliminate a wasteful rule that \ncivilian jobs automatically be recompeted at the end of each \nperformance period. I am a strong supporter of the Kennedy-McCaskill \namendment, which will serve as an important check on the \nadministration's privatization agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12419-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12419-S12420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIMES\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I objected to a unanimous consent request \nto pass S. 535/H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime \nAct. I objected, not because I disagree with the well intended motives \nof the legislation, but because the authors of the bill refused to work \nwith me to make some commonsense changes.\n  Let me be clear, I absolutely support the goals of this legislation \nand believe that those who committed civil rights crimes must be \nbrought to justice, but I believe that we can and must do so in a \nfiscally responsible manner.\n  Just last week, the Senate voted to increase the Federal Government's \ndebt limit to $9.815 trillion. It is beyond irresponsible to pass any \nbill that will add to this debt that will be inherited by our children \nand grandchildren. Even our best intentions need to be paid for with \noffsets from lower priorities or wasteful spending.\n  On February 5, 2007, I sent a letter to my colleagues outlining my \nintent to object to any legislation authorizing new spending that is \nnot offset by reductions in real spending elsewhere. I strongly believe \nthat Congress should stop borrowing and spending beyond our means. \nInstead, Congress, like all families, ought to prioritize spending and \nreduce less important spending when greater priorities arise.\n  S. 535/H.R. 923 violates two of the principles that I outlined in my \nFebruary letter. These are: If a bill authorizes new spending, it must \nbe offset by reductions in real spending elsewhere; and if a bill \ncreates or authorizes a new Federal program or activity, it must not \nduplicate an existing program or activity.\n  This bill authorizes unpaid for new spending and creates a new \ngovernment program that duplicates existing government efforts. Both of \nthese concerns could be easily addressed if the sponsors of the bill \nwere interested in securing its passage.\n  In June of this year, my office contacted the bill's sponsors to \nsuggest possible offsets so that I could give my consent--but there was \nno desire, at the time, to amend the bill. This was unfortunate because \nlast Congress, when Senator Jim Talent was the lead sponsor, he agreed \nto include offsets in exchange for my consent, but the compromise \nlanguage was opposed by an unidentified Senator.\n  It is also unfortunate because there is no shortage of potential \noffsets for this bill within the Department of Justice, which would \nadminister the proposed program. The bill authorizes $12 million each \nyear for 10 years. The Department has $1.6 billion in unobligated \nbalances, which are funds that have been appropriated but which there \nare no plans to spend. In fiscal year 2006, the Department spent $45.9 \nmillion on conferences, a 34-percent increase since fiscal year 2000. \nThe inspector general examined just 10 conferences and found that the \nDepartment spent an estimated $1.5 million on food and beverages. This \nincluded paying $4 per meatball at one lavish dinner and spreading an \naverage of $25 worth of snacks around to each participant at a movie-\nthemed party. It is estimated that the current fiscal year 2008 \nCommerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill contains congressional \nearmarks totaling $587 million and the bill exceeds the President's \nrequest by more than $2 billion. Clearly, there is wasteful spending \nthat can be reduced to pay for this program.\n  Just like American taxpayers, Congress needs to learn to pay for what \nit spends. This is a reasonable expectation but one that has been \nignored by Washington politicians who tend to put off difficult \ndecisions and, as a result, have charged up a $9 trillion debt.\n  This bill also creates a new Federal program that duplicates an \nexisting Federal Government initiative that seeks to address unsolved \ncivil rights crimes. The Department of Justice and the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are currently working \nwith States and nonprofit groups to pursue unsolved civil rights era \ncrimes that resulted in death.\n  In February 2006, the FBI began an initiative to identify hate crimes \nthat occurred prior to December 1969, and resulted in death. Since \nthen, the Bureau's 56 field offices began to reexamine their unsolved \ncivil rights cases\n\n[[Page S12420]]\n\nand determine which ones might still be viable for prosecution. To \ndate, they have identified nearly 100 case referrals. Furthermore, the \nU.S. Attorney General and the FBI Director announced a partnership with \nthe NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Urban \nLeague to investigate unsolved crimes from the civil rights era.\n  I am very supportive of this effort and I am also encouraged that \nthese cases are currently being pursued.\n  On August 2, 2007, I sent a letter to the Attorney General requesting \nmore information about these efforts to ensure that any legislation \npassed by Congress would assist the Department to meet its goals. I am \nawaiting a response.\n  I do believe that solving these crimes is imperative to remedying \npast injustices and ensuring future justice. These types of crimes \nshould never have been and never again tolerated or ignored.\n  I also believe that because of the nature of the crime, the time \nelapsed, and the fact that many witnesses and potential murderers have \nmoved to different States, this is an area of the law that rightly \nrequires Federal assistance.\n  Consequently, it is my hope that the bill's sponsors will support my \nefforts to find funding for this worthy program. It is unfortunate that \nsuch a well intentioned effort is being held up because Washington \npoliticians refuse to live under the same budget rules that every \nfamily in America adheres to. In the meantime, the American people can \nrest assured knowing that the Department of Justice and the FBI are \nalready conducting the investigations that this bill seeks to address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12420-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12420-S12421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR THE MEDICAL DEVICE USER FEE AMENDMENTS OF 2007\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on September 20, 2007, the Senate passed \nH.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. \nTitle II of this bill includes the reauthorization of the FDA's medical \ndevice user fee program.\n  Performance goals, existing outside of the statute, accompany the \nauthorization of medical device user fees. These goals represent a \nrealistic projection of what the Food and Drug Administration's Center \nfor Devices and Radiological Health and Center for Biologics Evaluation \nand Research can accomplish with industry cooperation. The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services forwarded these goals to the chairmen of the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate, \nin a document entitled ``MDUFA PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PROCEDURES.'' \nAccording to Section 201(c) of H.R. 3580, ``the fees authorized under \nthe amendments made by this title will be dedicated toward expediting \nthe process for the review of device applications and for assuring the \nsafety and effectiveness of devices, as set forth in the goals . . . in \nthe letters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the \nChairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of \nthe Senate and the Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of \nthe House of Representatives, as set forth in the Congressional \nRecord.''\n  Today I am submitting for the Record this document, which was \nforwarded to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on \nSeptember 27, 2007, as well as the letter from Secretary Leavitt that \naccompanied the transmittal of this document.\n  I ask unanimous consent this material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Health and\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2007.\n     Edward M.

As \n     you know, this bill contains the reauthorization of user fees \n     for drugs and devices as well as other key provisions vital \n     to the Food and Drug Administration. We appreciate your \n     support and hard work on this legislation, the commitment of \n     Members of the Committee in working out these measures, and \n     the support shown by the full Senate.\n       I am including as enclosures to this letter the two \n     commitment documents for the drug and device user fee \n     programs which outline the agreements between the Agency and \n     the industries with regard to application approval \n     timeframes, issuance of guidances, post market program \n     enhancements, and milestones for other activities to be \n     supported by user fees. These documents cover fiscal years \n     2008 through 2012 and they represent the commitment of the \n     Department and the FDA to carry out the goals under the \n     mutual agreement with the industries.\n       Thank you again for successful enactment of the FDA \n     Amendments Act. I look forward to working with you as we \n     proceed with the implementation of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O.

Review performance goals--Fiscal year 2008 through 2012 \n     as applied to receipt cohorts.\n       All references to ``days'' mean ``FDA days.''\n       A. Original premarket approval (PMA), panel-track PMA \n     supplement, and premarket report submissions.\n       FDA will issue a decision for 60 percent of non-expedited \n     filed submissions within 180 days, and for 90 percent within \n     295 days.\n       B. Expedited original PMA and panel-track PMA supplement \n     submissions.\n       FDA will issue a decision for 50 percent of expedited filed \n     submissions within 180 days, and for 90 percent within 280 \n     days.\n       C. PMA modules.\n       FDA will take action on 75 percent of PMA modules within 90 \n     days, and on 90 percent within 120 days.\n       D. 180-day PMA supplements.\n       FDA will issue a decision for 85 percent of 180-day PMA \n     supplements within 180 days, and for 95 percent within 210 \n     days.\n       E. Real-time PMA supplements.\n       FDA will issue a decision for 80 percent of real-time PMA \n     supplements within 60 days, and for 90 percent within 90 \n     days.\n       F. 510(k) submissions.\n       FDA will issue a decision for 90 percent of 510(k)s within \n     90 days, and for 98 percent within 150 days.\n       G. Maintenance of current performance.\n       The agency will, at a minimum, maintain current review \n     performance in review areas such as IDEs and 30-day Notices \n     where specific quantitative goals have not been established.\n       H. Interactive review.\n       The agency will continue to incorporate an interactive \n     review process to provide for, and encourage, informal \n     communication between FDA and sponsors to facilitate timely \n     completion of the review process based on accurate and \n     complete information. Interactive review entails \n     responsibilities for both FDA and sponsors.\n       Interactive review is intended to: (a) prevent unnecessary \n     delays in the completion of the review; (b) avoid surprises \n     to the sponsor at the end of the review process; (c) minimize \n     the number of review cycles and extent of review questions \n     conveyed through formal requests for additional information; \n     and (d) ensure timely responses from sponsors.\n       All forms of communication should be used as ``tools'' to \n     facilitate interactive review. These include, but are not \n     limited to, the following: (a) e-mail; (b) one-on-one \n     telephone calls; (c) telephone conferences; (d) \n     videoconferencing; (e) fax; and (f) face-to-face meetings.\n       Application of these tools for interactive review should \n     remain flexible, balancing speed and efficiency with the need \n     to ensure supervisory concurrence for significant information \n     requests. In general, e-mail should be the preferred \n     mechanism for informal communication because it creates a \n     clear record of the interaction, with telephone calls used \n     primarily for seeking clarification or answers to very \n     limited questions. Conferencing, either by telephone, video, \n     or face-to-face mechanisms, should be used at key milestones, \n     such as those described below, in the review process.\n       A cornerstone of interactive review is that communication \n     should occur as needed to facilitate a timely and efficient \n     review process. In particular:\n       1. There should be regular, informal communication from FDA \n     to seek clarification on issues that can be resolved without \n     substantive review or analysis. When appropriate, FDA will \n     also informally communicate substantive review issues if FDA \n     determines that it will facilitate a timely and efficient \n     review process.\n       Because all reviewers will be active participants in the \n     interactive review process established under this agreement, \n     it should be a natural outcome that reviewers will share \n     issues with sponsors prior to incorporating them into \n     formal letters.\n       2. Whenever FDA informally requests additional information, \n     the sponsor and FDA will determine an acceptable timeframe \n     for submission of the information. If the information is not \n     received within the agreed upon\n\n[[Page S12421]]\n\n     timeframe or the information is incomplete, the application \n     will be placed on hold (with a major deficiency letter or AI \n     letter) until the information is received.\n       FDA will develop a guidance document that incorporates \n     these general principles and should make them operational \n     within the review processes for 510(k)s, PMAs, and PMA \n     supplements. FDA will use this detailed interactive review \n     summary as the basis for a guidance document which FDA will \n     issue as a ``final'' guidance 6 months from the date an \n     agreed upon legislative package is sent to Congress or 3 \n     months from the date of enactment, whichever is later.\n       I. Meetings.\n       FDA will make every effort to schedule both informal and \n     formal meetings, both before and during the review process, \n     in a timely manner and industry will make every effort to \n     provide timely and relevant information to make the meetings \n     as productive as possible. These meetings include, but are \n     not limited to the following: pre-submission meetings, \n     determination meetings, agreement meetings, and Day-100 \n     meetings (for PMAs).\n       J. Quarterly performance reports.\n       The agency will report quarterly its progress toward \n     meeting the quantitative goals described in this letter and \n     will do so in a timely manner. In addition, for all \n     submission types, FDA will track total time (time with FDA \n     plus time with the company) from receipt or filing to final \n     decision for approval, denial, SE, or NSE. FDA will also \n     provide de-identified review performance data for the branch \n     with the shortest average review times and the branch with \n     the longest average review times for 510(k)s, 180-day \n     supplements, and real-time supplements on an annual basis. \n     Finally, in an effort to enhance accountability and \n     transparency, the agency will meet with the industry \n     informally on a semi-annual basis to discuss issues related \n     to performance and expenditures. At that time, the agency \n     will provide a qualitative update on how funding is being \n     used for the device review process, including investments in \n     information technology and training.\n       K. New commitments.\n       All agency guidance documents will reflect commitments made \n     in this goals letter, as appropriate. If a guidance document \n     has not been updated, FDA will still act in accordance with \n     the goals letter.\n       L. Reviewer training.\n       As resources permit, the agency will apply user fee \n     revenues to support reviewer training that is related to the \n     process for the review of devices, including training to \n     enhance scientific expertise. FDA will provide summary \n     information on the types of training provided to its staff on \n     an annual basis.\n       M. Guidance document development.\n       The agency will continue to develop guidance documents to \n     the extent possible without adversely impacting the \n     timeliness of review of MDUFA-related submissions. Each year, \n     FDA will post a list of guidance documents it is considering \n     for development and provide stakeholders an opportunity to \n     provide comments and/or draft language for those topics as \n     well as suggestions for new or different guidances.\n       N. Imaging devices with contrast agents or \n     radiopharmaceuticals.\n       FDA will, after consultation with affected parties, develop \n     a guidance document intended to ensure timely and effective \n     review of, and consistent and appropriate postmarket \n     regulation and labeling recommendations for, diagnostic \n     imaging devices used with imaging contrast agents and/or \n     radiopharmaceuticals approved for the same or different \n     indications. Draft guidance will be published by the end of \n     FY 2008, and will be subject to a 90-day public comment \n     period. FDA will issue a final guidance within one year of \n     the close of the public comment period.\n       O. In vitro diagnostics.\n       To facilitate the development of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) \n     devices, FDA will continue to explore ways to clarify the \n     regulatory requirements and reduce regulatory burden, as \n     appropriate, by:\n       1. Issuing new or revised guidance on: (a) the conduct of \n     clinical trials involving de-identified leftover specimens; \n     (b) clinical trial design issues for molecular diagnostic \n     tests; (c) migration studies; (d) Herpes Simplex Virus IVDs; \n     (e) enterovirus IVDs; and (f) influenza testing.\n       2. Conducting a pilot program to evaluate integrating the \n     510(k) review and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments \n     (CLIA) waiver review processes for possible increased \n     efficiencies. This pilot will include only voluntary \n     participants from industry, and the 510(k) applications \n     involved in the pilot will not be counted toward the MDUFA \n     performance goals.\n       3. Considering industry proposals on acceptable CLIA waiver \n     study protocols, developing acceptable protocol designs, and \n     making them available by adding appendices to the CLIA waiver \n     guidance or by posting redacted protocols on the FDA website.\n       4. Tracking review times for CLIA waiver applications, \n     sharing this information with industry annually and, at the \n     end of year two of MDUFA, evaluating whether CLIA waiver user \n     fees and performance goals should be considered for MDUFA \n     III.\n       5. Reviewing a list of class I and II low risk IVD devices, \n     to be provided by industry, to determine whether any of them \n     could be exempted from premarket notification, and allowing \n     interested parties to petition for exemptions consistent with \n     section 510(m)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (the Act).\n       6. Performing a review of its pre-IDE program for IVD \n     devices. This review will be conducted during the first year \n     of MDUFA and will focus on specific issues identified by \n     industry that they would like to see addressed by the program \n     review.\n       P. Transition period.\n       FDA will meet the performance goals established under MDUFA \n     II beginning October 1, 2007. However, because, beginning \n     October 1, 2007, FDA will be reviewing submissions under \n     MDUFMA I goals and MDUFA II goals at the same time (due to \n     submissions received in FY 2007 but acted upon in FY 2008), \n     FDA will not manage to the MDUFMA I cycle goals for those \n     submissions received in fiscal year 2007. FDA will meet the \n     MDUFMA I decision goals for submissions received in FY07 and \n     will apply the principles of interactive review.\n       II. Definitions and explanations of terms.\n       A. FDA Decision.\n       PMA decisions are approval, approvable, approvable pending \n     GMP inspection, not approvable, withdrawal, and denial. \n     510(k) decisions are substantially equivalent (SE) or not \n     substantially equivalent (NSE).\n       Not Approvable decisions will generally not be issued on \n     the first review cycle. The rare cases where a not approvable \n     decision might be issued on the first review cycle would \n     include situations such as (1) the application is complete \n     and there are no outstanding FDA issues, but the data do not \n     demonstrate that the device provides reasonable assurance of \n     safety and effectiveness, or (2) the PMA receives a not \n     approvable recommendation from an advisory panel. Any ``Not \n     Approvable'' decision will be accompanied by the rationale \n     for its issuance.\n       Submission of an unsolicited major amendment to any \n     original PMA, premarket report, panel-track supplement, or \n     180-day supplement extends the FDA decision goal date by the \n     number of days equal to 75 percent of the difference between \n     the filing date and the date of receipt of the amendment.\n       B. Expedited review.\n       The MDUFA II expedited review performance goals will apply \n     only to devices for which expedited review has been granted \n     in accordance with section 515(d)(5) of the Act.\n       If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions \n     granted expedited review equals 10 or more, FDA will be held \n     to the expedited review performance goals for that fiscal \n     year.\n       If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions \n     granted expedited review is less than 10, then it is \n     acceptable to combine the submissions for the following \n     year(s) in order to form a cohort of 10 submissions upon \n     which FDA will be held to the performance goals. However, FDA \n     will continue to report performance data on the cohort for \n     each fiscal year.\n       C. PMA modules.\n       Action on a PMA module includes accepting the module, \n     request for additional information, receipt of the PMA, and \n     withdrawal of the module.\n       D. 180-day PMA supplements.\n       Decisions for 180-day PMA supplements include approval, \n     approvable, approvable pending GMP inspection, and not \n     approvable.\n       FDA will implement a major deficiency letter process for \n     180-Day PMA Supplements (similar to that for PMAs).\n       E. Real-time PMA supplements.\n       Decisions for real-time PMA supplements include approval, \n     approvable, and not approvable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12421-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12421-S12428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERFORMANCE GOALS FOR THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE AMENDMENTS OF 2007\n\n  Mr. Kennedy. Mr. President, on September 20, 2007, the Senate passed \nH.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. \nTitle I of this bill is the reauthorization of the FDA's prescription \ndrug user fee program, and includes the initial authorization for a \nvoluntary user fee program for advisory reviews of direct-to-consumer \ntelevision advertising.\n  Performance goals, existing outside of the statute, accompany the \nreauthorization of the drug user fee program and the authorization of \nthe advisory review user fee program. These goals represent a realistic \nprojection of what the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research and Center for Biologics Evaluation and \nResearch can accomplish with industry cooperation. The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services forwarded these goals to the chairmen of the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate, \nin a document with two sections entitled ``PDUFA REAUTHORIZATION \nPERFORMANCE GOALS AND PROCEDURES'' and ``PERFORMANCE GOALS AND \nPROCEDURES FOR ADVISORY REVIEW OF DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER TELEVISION \nADVERTISING.'' According to Section 101(c) of H.R. 3580, ``the fees \nauthorized by the amendments made in this title will\n\n[[Page S12422]]\n\nbe dedicated toward expediting the drug development process and the \nprocess for the review of human drug applications, including postmarket \ndrug safety activities, as set forth in the goals . . .in the letters \nfrom the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and \nthe Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \nRepresentatives, as set forth in the Congressional Record.''\n  Today I am submitting for the Record this document, which was \nforwarded to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on \nSeptember 27, 2007, as well as the letter from Secretary Leavitt that \naccompanied the transmittal of this document.\n  The agency-industry agreement on prescription drug user fees \nincludes, for each of the 5 fiscal years of the reauthorization, an \nadditional $29,290,000 and 82 full time employees for the postmarket \ndrug safety activities described in the document. These funds are \naugmented in Title I of H.R. 3580 by an additional $225 million for \npostmarket drug safety, $25 million for fiscal year 2008, $35 million \nfor fiscal year 2009, $45 million for fiscal year 2009, $55 million for \nfiscal year 2010, and $65 million for fiscal year 2011. The FDA will \nuse this $225 million to implement the postmarket drug safety programs \nand authorities set out in Title IX of H.R. 3580.\n  I ask unanimous consent this material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2007.\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: I want to congratulate you for \n     completing action on the FDA Amendments Act, H.R. 3580. As \n     you know, this bill contains the reauthorization of user fees \n     for drugs and devices as well as other key provisions vital \n     to the Food and Drug Administration. We appreciate your \n     support and hard work on this legislation, the commitment of \n     Members of the Committee in working out these measures, and \n     the support shown by the full Senate.\n       I am including as enclosures to this letter the two \n     commitment documents for the drug and device user fee \n     programs which outline the agreements between the Agency and \n     the industries with regard to application approval \n     timeframes, issuance of guidances, post market program \n     enhancements, and milestones for other activities to be \n     supported by user fees. These documents cover fiscal years \n     2008 through 2012 and they represent the commitment of the \n     Department and the FDA to carry out the goals under the \n     mutual agreement with the industries.\n       Thank you again for successful enactment of the FDA \n     Amendments Act. I look forward to working with you as we \n     proceed with the implementation of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Section A: PDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures \n                     Fiscal Years 2008 Through 2012\n\n       The performance goals and procedures of the FDA Center for \n     Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for \n     Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), as agreed to under \n     the reauthorization of the prescription drug user fee program \n     in the [cite statute] are summarized below.\n       Unless otherwise stated, goals apply to cohorts of each \n     fiscal year (FY).\n       I. REVIEW PERFORMANCE GOALS\n       A. NDA/BLA Submissions and Resubmissions\n       1. Review and act on 90 percent of standard original NDA \n     and BLA submissions within 10 months of receipt.\n       2. Review and act on 90 percent of priority original NDA \n     and BLA submissions within 6 months of receipt.\n       3. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 1 resubmitted \n     original applications within 2 months of receipt.\n       4. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 2 resubmitted \n     original applications within 6 months of receipt.\n       B. Original Efficacy Supplements\n       1. Review and act on 90 percent of standard efficacy \n     supplements within 10 months of receipt.\n       2. Review and act on 90 percent of priority efficacy \n     supplement within 6 months of receipt.\n       C. Resubmitted Efficacy Supplements\n       1. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 1 resubmitted \n     efficacy supplements within 2 months of receipt.\n       2. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 2 resubmitted \n     efficacy supplements within 6 months of receipt.\n       D. Original Manufacturing Supplements\n       1. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing \n     supplements within 6 months of receipt and review and act on \n     90 percent of manufacturing supplements requiring prior \n     approval within 4 months of receipt.\n       E. These review goals are summarized in the following \n     table:\n\n       ORIGINAL AND RESUBMITTED NDAs/BLAs AND EFFICACY SUPPLEMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Submission cohort              Standard             Priority\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Applications..........  90% in 10 Mo......  90% in 6 Mo.\nClass 1 Resubmissions..........  90% in 2 Mo.......  90% in 2 Mo.\nClass 2 Resubmissions..........  90% In 6 Mo.......  90% in 6 Mo.\nOriginal Efficacy Supplements..  90% in 10 Mo......  90% in 6 Mo.\nClass 1 Resubmitted Efficacy     90% in 2 Mo.......  90% in 2 Mo.\n Supplements.\nClass 2........................  90% in 6 Mo.......  90% in 6 Mo.\n \n                        MANUFACTURING SUPPLEMENTS\n \nFY 2008-2012...................  90% in 6 Mo.......  90% in 4 Mo.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       II. NEW MOLECULAR ENTITY (NME) PERFORMANCE GOALS\n       A. The performance goals for standard and priority original \n     NMEs in each submission cohort will be the same as for all of \n     the original NDAs (including NMEs) in each submission cohort \n     but shall be reported separately.\n       B. For biological products, for purposes of this \n     performance goal, all original BLAs will be considered to be \n     NMEs.\n       III. MEETING MANAGEMENT GOALS\n       A. Responses to Meeting Requests\n       1. Procedure: Within 14 calendar days of the Agency's \n     receipt of a request from industry for a formal Type A \n     meeting, or within 21 calendar days of the Agency's receipt \n     of a request from industry for a formal Type B or Type C \n     meeting (i.e., a scheduled face-to-face, teleconference, or \n     videoconference), CBER and CDER should notify the requester \n     in writing (letter or fax) of the date, time, and place for \n     the meeting, as well as expected Center participants.\n       2. Performance Goal: FDA will provide this notification \n     within 14 days for 90% of Type A meeting requests and within \n     21 days for 90% of Type B and Type C meeting requests.\n       B. Scheduling Meetings\n       1. Procedure: The meeting date should reflect the next \n     available date on which all applicable Center personnel are \n     available to attend, consistent with the component's other \n     business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent \n     with the type of meeting requested. If the requested date for \n     any of these types of meetings is greater than 30, 60, or 75 \n     calendar days (as appropriate) from the date the request is \n     received by the Agency, the meeting date should be within 14 \n     calendar days of the date requested.\n       a) Type A Meetings should occur within 30 calendar days of \n     the Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       b) Type B Meetings should occur within 60 calendar days of \n     the Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       c) Type C Meetings should occur within 75 calendar days of \n     the Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       2. Performance goal: 90% of meetings are held within the \n     timeframe.\n       C. Meeting Minutes\n       1. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes which will be \n     available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting. \n     The minutes will clearly outline the important agreements, \n     disagreements, issues for further discussion, and action \n     items from the meeting in bulleted form and need not be in \n     great detail.\n       2. Performance goal: 90% of minutes are issued within 30 \n     calendar days of date of meeting.\n       D. Conditions\n       For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:\n       1. A written request (letter or fax) should be submitted to \n     the review division; and\n       2. The letter should provide:\n       a) A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting;\n       b) A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the \n     requester expects from the meeting;\n       c) A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed for \n     each agenda item;\n       d) A listing of planned external attendees;\n       e) A listing of requested participants/disciplines \n     representative(s) from the Center;\n       f) The approximate time that supporting documentation \n     (i.e., the ``backgrounder'') for the meeting will be sent to \n     the Center (i.e., ``x'' weeks prior to the meeting, but \n     should be received by the Center at least 2 weeks in advance \n     of the scheduled meeting for Type A meetings and at least 1 \n     month in advance of the scheduled meeting for Type B and Type \n     C meetings); and\n       3. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful \n     purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary). \n     However, requests for a ``Type B'' meeting will be honored \n     except in the most unusual circumstances.\n\n[[Page S12423]]\n\n       Sponsors are encouraged to consult available FDA guidance \n     to obtain further information on recommended meeting \n     procedures.\n       IV. CLINICAL HOLDS\n       A. Procedure: The Center should respond to a sponsor's \n     complete response to a clinical hold within 30 days of the \n     Agency's receipt of the submission of such sponsor response.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such responses are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the \n     sponsor's response.\n       V. MAJOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n       A. Procedure: For procedural or scientific matters \n     involving the review of human drug applications and \n     supplements (as defined in PDUFA) that cannot be resolved at \n     the signatory authority level (including a request for \n     reconsideration by the signatory authority after reviewing \n     any materials that are planned to be forwarded with an appeal \n     to the next level), the response to appeals of decisions will \n     occur within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the \n     written appeal.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such answers are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the \n     written appeal.\n       C. Conditions:\n       1. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or \n     scientific issue at the signatory authority level. If it \n     cannot be resolved at that level, it should be appealed to \n     the next higher organizational level (with a copy to the \n     signatory authority) and then, if necessary, to the next \n     higher organizational level.\n       2. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written \n     confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal \n     notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either \n     grant or deny the appeal.\n       3. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response \n     should include reasons for the denial and any actions the \n     sponsor might take in order to persuade the Agency to reverse \n     its decision.\n       4. In some cases, further data or further input from others \n     might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these \n     cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that \n     information (e.g., requesting further information from the \n     sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling \n     the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available \n     advisory committee).\n       5. In these cases, once the required information is \n     received by the Agency (including any advice from an advisory \n     committee), the person to whom the appeal was made, again has \n     30 calendar days from the receipt of the required information \n     in which to either deny or grant the appeal.\n       6. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the \n     response should include the reasons for the denial and any \n     actions the sponsor might take in order to persuade the \n     Agency to reverse its decision.\n       7. N.B. If the Agency decides to present the issue to an \n     advisory committee and there are not 30 days before the next \n     scheduled advisory committee, the issue will be presented at \n     the following scheduled committee meeting in order to allow \n     conformance with advisory committee administrative \n     procedures.\n       VI. SPECIAL PROTOCOL QUESTION ASSESSMENT AND AGREEMENT\n       A. Procedure: Upon specific request by a sponsor (including \n     specific questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), \n     the Agency will evaluate certain protocols and issues to \n     assess whether the design is adequate to meet scientific and \n     regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.\n       1. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific \n     questions about the protocol design and scientific and \n     regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement \n     (e.g., is the dose range in the carcinogenicity study \n     adequate, considering the intended clinical dosage; are the \n     clinical endpoints adequate to support a specific efficacy \n     claim).\n       2. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and \n     specific questions, the Agency will provide a written \n     response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment \n     of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the \n     sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol \n     design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to \n     achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the \n     disagreement will be explained in the response.\n       3. Protocols that qualify for this program include: \n     carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 \n     protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary \n     basis of an efficacy claim. (For such Phase 3 protocols to \n     qualify for this comprehensive protocol assessment, the \n     sponsor must have had an end of Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting \n     with the review division so that the division is aware of the \n     developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed \n     and the questions being answered.)\n       4. N.B. For products that will be using Subpart E or \n     Subpart H development schemes, the Phase 3 protocols \n     mentioned in this paragraph should be construed to mean those \n     protocols for trials that will form the primary basis of an \n     efficacy claim no matter what phase of drug development in \n     which they happen to be conducted.\n       5. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined \n     above and agreement with the Agency is reached on design, \n     execution, and analyses and if the results of the trial \n     conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of \n     the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the \n     protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for \n     approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is \n     that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses \n     proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency \n     will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design, \n     execution, or analyses unless public health concerns \n     unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this \n     process are evident.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of special protocols assessments \n     and agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor \n     within timeframes.\n       C. Reporting: The Agency will track and report the number \n     of original special protocol assessments and resubmissions \n     per original special protocol assessment.\n       VII. ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\n       A. Simplification of Action Letters\n       To simplify regulatory procedures, CBER and CDER intend to \n     amend their regulations and processes to provide for the \n     issuance of either an ``approval'' (AP) or a ``complete \n     response'' (CR) action letter at the completion of a review \n     cycle for a marketing application.\n       B. Timing of Sponsor Notification of Deficiencies in \n     Applications\n       To help expedite the development of drug and biologic \n     products, CBER and CDER intend to submit deficiencies to \n     sponsors in the form of a ``discipline review'' (DR) letter \n     when each discipline has finished its initial review of its \n     section of the pending application.\n       VIII. ENHANCEMENT AND MODERNIZATION OF THE FDA DRUG SAFETY \n     SYSTEM\n       FDA will use user fees to enhance and modernize the current \n     U.S. drug safety system. FDA will adopt new scientific \n     approaches, improve the utility of existing tools for the \n     detection, evaluation, prevention, and mitigation of adverse \n     events, and continue to enhance and improve communication and \n     coordination between post-market and pre-market review staff. \n     Enhancements to the post-market drug safety system will \n     improve the public health by increasing patient protection \n     while continuing to enable access to needed medical products. \n     User fees will provide support for 1) preparing and \n     implementing a 5-year plan to modernize drug safety, \n     including improving communication and coordination between \n     the post-market and pre-market review staff, 2) conducting \n     and/or supporting activities designed to modernize the \n     process of pharmaco-vigilance, 3) developing with sponsors, \n     reviewing, and monitoring implementation of risk management \n     plans, and 4) related activities.\n       A. Development of 5-year plan, and Communications and \n     Technical Interactions\n       1. The FDA will develop and periodically update a 5-year \n     plan describing activities that will lead to enhancing and \n     modernizing FDA's drug safety activities/system. The \n     activities described in the 5-year plan will include:\n       a) Assessment of current and new methodologies to maximize \n     the public health benefit associated with collecting adverse \n     event information at various points during the product \n     lifecycle;\n       b) With input from academia, industry, and others from the \n     general public, identifying epidemiology best practices and \n     developing guidance(s) describing these practices;\n       c) Expanding CBER/CDER's database acquisition and use for \n     the purposes of targeted post-marketing surveillance and \n     epidemiology;\n       d) Developing and validating risk management and risk \n     communication tools, including assessing the effectiveness of \n     risk management plan agreements and developing, implementing, \n     and evaluating mechanisms for public communications about the \n     benefits and risks of drugs and biological products;\n       e) Improving post-market IT systems (e.g., AERS 2, safety \n     tracking system, and opportunities for linked data \n     management);\n       f) Enhancing and improving communication and coordination \n     between the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and the \n     Office of New Drugs in CDER and the Office of Biostatistics \n     and Epidemiology and the pre-market product review Offices in \n     CBER, including activities to assess the impact and value of \n     routinely including post-market review staff on pre-market \n     review teams.\n       2. The plan will be drafted, published on the FDA website, \n     and updated as follows:\n       a) FDA will publish a draft of the plan by March 31, 2008. \n     At that time, FDA will solicit and consider comments from the \n     public on the draft plan. The public comment period will be \n     at least 45 calendar days. FDA will complete revisions to the \n     plan and publish the final version no later than December 31, \n     2008.\n       b) By the end of FY 09, FDA will conduct an annual \n     assessment of progress against the plan to be published on \n     the FDA website. The report will describe progress on issues \n     outlined in the five year plan. In addition, the report will \n     include FDA efforts to facilitate the interactions between \n     OND/OSE related to the process of evaluating and responding \n     to post-marketing drug safety/adverse event reports.\n       c) FDA will publish updates to the plan as FDA deems \n     necessary. FDA will publish on the FDA website draft \n     revisions to the plan, solicit comments from the public on \n     those draft revisions, and consider the public comments \n     before completing and publishing updates to the plan.\n       B. Conduct and support activities designed to modernize the \n     process of pharmaco-vigilance\n       1. Maximize the Public Health Benefit of Adverse Event (AE) \n     Collection Throughout\n\n[[Page S12424]]\n\n     the Product Life Cycle: By the end of FY 08, FDA will publish \n     a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from \n     outside research organizations to conduct research on \n     determining the best way to maximize the public health \n     benefit associated with collecting and reporting serious and \n     non-serious adverse events occurring throughout a product's \n     life cycle. Central to addressing this question are \n     determining the number and type of safety concerns discovered \n     by AE collection, the age of products at the time safety \n     concerns are detected by AE collection, and the types of \n     actions that are subsequently taken to protect patient \n     safety. Contractor(s) should study adverse event collection \n     both within and outside the U.S. Contract(s) will be awarded \n     during FY 09 and the completion of study(ies) targeted for FY \n     11.\n       2. Epidemiology Best Practices and Guidance Document \n     Development: During FY 08, the FDA, with input from academia, \n     industry, and others from the general public, will hold a \n     public workshop to identify epidemiology best practices. The \n     workshop will examine current epidemiology practices both \n     within and outside the U.S. By the end of FY 10, CDER and \n     CBER jointly will develop and issue a draft guidance document \n     that addresses epidemiology best practices and provides \n     guidance on carrying out scientifically sound observational \n     studies using quality data resources. A final guidance will \n     be issued in FY 11.\n       3. Expanding Database Resources: A critical part of the \n     transformation of the drug safety program is maximizing the \n     usefulness of tools used for adverse event signal detection \n     and risk assessment. To achieve this end, data other than \n     passive spontaneous reports, including population-based \n     epidemiological data and other types of observational data \n     resources will be used and evaluated. Access to these types \n     of data will expand the FDA's capability to carry out \n     targeted post-marketing surveillance, look at class effects \n     of drugs, and potentially carry out signal detection using \n     data resources other than reports from AERs system. PDUFA \n     funds will be used to obtain access to additional databases, \n     to train existing staff, and to hire additional \n     epidemiologists and programmers to be able to use these new \n     resources.\n       4. Development and Validation of Risk Management and Risk \n     Communication Tools: During FY 08, FDA will develop a plan to \n     1) identify, with input from academia, industry, and others \n     from the general public, risk management tools and programs \n     for the purpose of evaluation and 2) conduct assessments of \n     the effectiveness of identified Risk Minimization Action \n     Plans (RiskMAPS) and current risk management and risk \n     communication tools. A public workshop will be held during FY \n     09 to obtain input from industry and other stakeholders \n     regarding the prioritization of the plans and tools to be \n     evaluated. Starting in FY 09, FDA will conduct annual \n     systematic public discussion and review of the effectiveness \n     of one to two risk management program(s) and one major risk \n     management tool. Reports of these discussions will be posted \n     on the FDA website.\n       C. Review of risk management plans\n       FDA may use user fees for the review of risk management \n     plans and related activities (e.g., meeting with sponsors, \n     collaborations between review divisions and the appropriate \n     safety group in CDER or CBER, and reviews of periodic reports \n     on the implementation of any risk management plan).\n       D. Other Activities\n       FDA will establish the following standards-based \n     information systems to support how FDA obtains and analyzes \n     post-market drug safety data and manages emerging drug safety \n     information:\n       1. Enhanced adverse event reporting system and surveillance \n     tools;\n       2. IT infrastructure to support access and analyses of \n     externally-linked databases; and\n       3. Workflow tracking system.\n       IX. REVIEW OF PROPRIETARY NAMES TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS\n       To enhance patient safety, FDA will utilize user fees to \n     implement various measures to reduce medication errors \n     related to look-alike and sound-alike proprietary names and \n     such factors as unclear label abbreviations, acronyms, dose \n     designations, and error prone label and packaging design.\n       A. Review Performance Goals--Drug/Biological Product \n     Proprietary Names\n       1. Proprietary names submitted during IND phase (as early \n     as end-of-phase 2)\n       a) Review 50% of proprietary name submissions filed during \n     FY 09 within 180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative \n     acceptance or non-acceptance.\n       b) Review 70% of proprietary name submissions filed during \n     FY 10 within 180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative \n     acceptance or non-acceptance.\n       c) Review 90% of proprietary name submissions filed during \n     FYs 11 and 12 within 180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of \n     tentative acceptance or non-acceptance.\n       d) If proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, sponsor \n     can request reconsideration by submitting a written rebuttal \n     with supporting data or request a meeting within 60 days to \n     discuss the initial decision (meeting package required).\n       e) If proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     above review performance goals also would apply to the \n     written request for reconsideration with supporting data or \n     the submission of a new proprietary name.\n       f) Complete submission is required to begin the review \n     clock.\n       2. Proprietary names submitted with NDA/BLA\n       a) Review 50% of NDA/BLA proprietary name submissions filed \n     during FY 09 within 90 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of \n     tentative acceptance/non-acceptance.\n       b) Review 70% of NDA/BLA proprietary name submissions filed \n     during FY 10 within 90 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of \n     tentative acceptance/non-acceptance.\n       c) Review 90% of NDA/BLA proprietary name submissions filed \n     during FYs 11 and 12 within 90 days of receipt. Notify \n     sponsor of tentative acceptance/non-acceptance.\n       d) A supplemental review will be done meeting the above \n     review performance goals if the proprietary name has been \n     submitted previously (IND phase after end of phase 2) and has \n     received tentative acceptance.\n       e) If proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, sponsor \n     can request reconsideration by submitting a written rebuttal \n     with supporting data or request a meeting within 60 days to \n     discuss the initial decision (meeting package required).\n       f) If proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     above review performance goals apply to the written request \n     for reconsideration with supporting data or the submission of \n     a new proprietary name.\n       g) Complete submission is required to begin the review \n     clock.\n       3. Guidance Document Development\n       a) By the end of FY 08, FDA will publish a final guidance \n     on the contents of a complete submission package for a \n     proposed proprietary drug/biological product name.\n       b) By the end of FY 09, FDA will prepare a MaPP (Manual of \n     Policies and Procedures) to ensure that FDA internal \n     processes (e.g., Division of Medication Errors and Technical \n     Support, Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and \n     Communications, Office of New Drugs, CDER and Advertising and \n     Promotional Labeling Branch, CBER) are consistent with \n     meeting the proprietary name review goals.\n       c) By the end of FY 10, after public consultation with \n     academia, industry, and others from the general public, FDA \n     will publish a draft guidance on best practices for naming, \n     labeling and packaging drugs and biologics to reduce \n     medication errors. Final guidance will be published by the \n     end of FY 11.\n       d) By the end of FY 12, after public consultation with \n     industry, academia and others from the general public, FDA \n     will publish a draft guidance on proprietary name evaluation \n     best practices. Publication of final guidance on proprietary \n     name evaluation best practices will follow as soon as \n     feasible.\n       B. Pilot Program\n       During PDUFA IV, FDA will develop and implement a pilot \n     program to enable pharmaceutical firms participating in the \n     pilot to evaluate proposed proprietary names and submit the \n     data generated from those evaluations to the FDA for review.\n       1. FDA will hold a public technical meeting to discuss the \n     elements necessary to create a concept paper describing the \n     logistics of the pilot program, the contents of a proprietary \n     name review submission, and the criteria to be used by FDA to \n     review submissions under the pilot program. Subsequently, by \n     the end of FY 08, FDA will publish the concept paper.\n       2. By the end of FY 09, FDA will begin enrollment into the \n     pilot program.\n       3. By the end of FY 11, or subsequent to accruing two years \n     of experience with pilot submissions, FDA will evaluate the \n     pilot program.\n       C. Other Activities\n       1. FDA and industry are interested in exploring the \n     possibility of ``reserving'' proprietary names for companies \n     once the names have been tentatively accepted by the Agency. \n     By the end of FY 08, FDA will initiate a public process to \n     discuss issues around ``reserving'' proprietary names.\n       2. FDA will provide the full source code and supporting \n     technical documentation for the Phonetic and Orthographic \n     Computer Analysis (POCA) tool and make it available on disk \n     for use by industry and others from the general public by \n     end of FY 08.\n       X. FIRST CYCLE REVIEW PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL\n       A. Notification of Issues Identified during the Filing \n     Review\n       1. Performance Goal: For original NDA/BLA applications and \n     efficacy supplements, FDA will report substantive review \n     issues identified during the initial filing review to the \n     applicant by letter, telephone conference, facsimile, secure \n     e-mail, or other expedient means.\n       2. The timeline for such communication will be within 14 \n     calendar days after the 60-day filing date.\n       3. If no substantive review issues were identified during \n     the filing review, FDA will so notify the applicant.\n       4. FDA's filing review represents a preliminary review of \n     the application and is not indicative of deficiencies that \n     may be identified later in the review cycle.\n       5. FDA will notify the applicant of substantive review \n     issues prior to the goal date for 90% of applications.\n       B. Notification of Planned Review Timelines\n       1. Performance Goal: For original NDA/BLA applications and \n     efficacy supplements, FDA will inform the applicant of the \n     planned timeline for review of the application. The \n     information conveyed will include a target date for \n     communication of feedback from the review division to the \n     applicant regarding proposed labeling and postmarketing study \n     commitments (PMCs) the Agency will be requesting.\n       2. The planned review timeline will be included with the \n     notification of issues identified during the filing review, \n     within 14 calendar days after the 60-day filing date.\n\n[[Page S12425]]\n\n       3. The planned review timelines will be consistent with the \n     Guidance for Review Staff and Industry: Good Review \n     Management Principles and Practices for PDUFA Products \n     (GRMPs), taking into consideration the specific circumstances \n     surrounding the individual application.\n       4. The planned review timeline will be based on the \n     application as submitted.\n       5. FDA will inform the applicant of the planned review \n     timeline for 90% of original BLA and NME NDA applications \n     beginning in FY 09; 90% of efficacy supplements for new or \n     expanded indications beginning in FY 10; 90% of all original \n     NDAs/BLAs beginning in FY 11; and 90% of all efficacy \n     supplements beginning in FY 12 (see table below).\n\n                                                    (Percent)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      FY 08    FY 09    FY 10    FY 11    FY 12\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal BLAs and NME NDAs.........................................       --       90       90       90       90\nEfficacy supplements for new/expanded indications..................       --       --       90       90       90\nAll original NDAs..................................................       --       --       --       90       90\nAll efficacy supplements...........................................       --       --       --       --       90\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       6. Should the applicant submit any unsolicited major \n     amendment(s) to the application (e.g., a major new clinical \n     safety/efficacy study report, major re-analyses of previously \n     submitted study(ies)) and if the division chooses to review \n     such amendment(s) during that review cycle, the planned \n     review timeline will no longer be applicable (even if the \n     unsolicited major amendment leads to an extension of the \n     overall PDUFA review clock). No new planned review timeline \n     need be provided in such cases; however, the overall PDUFA \n     action goal date, including any extension, will still apply. \n     The division will notify the applicant promptly of its \n     decision regarding review of the unsolicited major \n     amendment(s) and whether the planned review timeline is still \n     applicable.\n       7. In the event FDA determines that significant \n     deficiencies in the application preclude discussion of \n     labeling or PMCs by the target date identified in the planned \n     review timeline (e.g., failure to demonstrate efficacy, \n     significant safety concern(s), need for a new study(ies) or \n     extensive re-analyses of existing data before approval), FDA \n     will communicate this determination to the applicant in \n     accordance with GRMP and no later than the target date. In \n     such cases the planned review timeline will be considered to \n     have been met. Communication of FDA's determination may occur \n     by letter, telephone conference, facsimile, secure e-mail, or \n     other expedient means. Communication of the deficiencies \n     identified will generally occur through issuance of a \n     discipline review letter(s) in advance of the planned target \n     date for initiation of postmarketing study commitments and \n     labeling discussions.\n       8. Should the applicant submit a major amendment(s) (e.g., \n     a major new clinical safety/efficacy study report, major re-\n     analyses of previously submitted study(ies)) to provide \n     information or data requested by FDA during the review (e.g., \n     a solicited major amendment) and if the division chooses to \n     review such amendment(s) during that review cycle, the \n     planned review timeline initially communicated will generally \n     no longer be applicable. If the solicited major amendment \n     does not result in an extension of the overall PDUFA review \n     clock, and depending upon the circumstances, the review \n     division may choose to retain the previously communicated \n     planned review timeline (e.g., the solicited major amendment \n     is submitted early in the review cycle, review of the \n     amendment is not expected to significantly alter the \n     division's planned review timeline). If the solicited major \n     amendment is submitted during the last 90 days of the review \n     cycle and results in an extension of the PDUFA action date \n     (review clock), the review division will establish a new \n     review timeline for communication of feedback on proposed \n     labeling and PMCs. The division will notify the applicant \n     promptly of its decision regarding review of the major \n     amendment(s) and whether the planned review timeline is still \n     applicable. If the solicited major amendment results in an \n     extension of the overall PDUFA review clock, the division \n     will communicate a new planned review timeline to the \n     applicant at the time of the clock extension.\n       C. Report on Review Timeline Performance\n       1. FDA will report its performance in meeting the goals for \n     inclusion of a planned review timeline with the notification \n     of issues identified during the filing review in the annual \n     PDUFA performance report.\n       2. FDA will report its performance in meeting the planned \n     review timeline for communication of labeling comments and \n     PMC requests in the annual PDUFA performance report. The \n     report will include the percentage of applications for which \n     the planned target dates for communication of labeling \n     comments and PMC requests were met. The report will also note \n     how often the planned review timeline was met based on \n     communication of labeling comments and PMC requests by the \n     target date and how often such communication did not occur \n     due to FDA's determination that significant deficiencies in \n     the application precluded communication of labeling comments \n     and PMC requests at the time initially projected. \n     Communication of labeling comments and PMC requests, or \n     communication of FDA's determination that significant \n     deficiencies preclude initiation of such discussions, within \n     7 calendar days of the target date stated in the planned \n     review timeline will be considered to have met the target \n     date. FDA will also report the number of times that the \n     review timelines were inapplicable due to the Agency's \n     decision to review an unsolicited major amendment or a \n     solicited major amendment that did not result in an extension \n     of the review clock (unless the review division chose to \n     retain the previously communicated planned review timeline.)\n       3. FDA will engage an independent outside consultant to \n     conduct an analysis of the Agency's success in adhering to \n     the planned review timelines. The contractor will assess the \n     factors, based on input from both the FDA and the applicants, \n     that contributed to the ability of the Agency to adhere to \n     the planned review timelines and those factors attributable \n     to either the FDA or the applicant that contributed to \n     failure to adhere to the planned review timeline. A final \n     report will be provided to FDA at least 6 months before the \n     end of FY 11. FDA will make available a releasable version of \n     the final report within 2 months of receipt from the \n     independent outside consultant.\n       D. Standard Operating Procedures and Training\n       FDA will develop harmonized (CBER/CDER) standard operating \n     procedures (SOPs) regarding the notification of planned \n     review timelines. These SOPs will be finalized and \n     implemented by the end of FY 08. Training will be provided to \n     all CBER and CDER review staff on the harmonized (CBER/CDER) \n     standard operating procedures. Training will continue for all \n     new review staff and refresher training will be provided to \n     all review staff as necessary through FY 12.\n       XI. EXPEDITING DRUG DEVELOPMENT\n       A. Guidance Development: FDA will develop and publish for \n     comment draft guidances on the following topics by the end of \n     the indicated Fiscal Year of PDUFA-IV. FDA will complete the \n     final guidances within one year of the close of the public \n     comment period.\n       1. Clinical Hepatotoxicity--FY 2008\n       2. Non-inferiority Trials--FY 2008\n       3. Adaptive Trial Designs--FY 2008\n       4. End of Phase 2(a) Meetings--FY 2008\n       5. Multiple Endpoints in Clinical Trials--FY 2009\n       6. Enriched Trial Designs--FY 2010\n       7. Imaging Standards for Use as an End Point in Clinical \n     Trials--FY 2011\n       B. Ongoing Scientific Collaboration: FDA will participate \n     in workshops with representatives from the scientific \n     community (including industry, academia and other interested \n     stakeholders) to further the science toward development of \n     guidance documents in the following areas:\n       1. Predictive Toxicology\n       2. Biomarker Qualification\n       3. Missing Data\n       C. FDA will participate in workshops and other public \n     meetings to explore new approaches to a structured model for \n     benefit/risk assessment. The results of these interactions \n     will be used to assess whether pilot(s) of such new \n     approaches can be conducted during PDUFA-IV. These efforts \n     may lead to the development of guidance documents.\n       XII. POSTMARKETING STUDY COMMITMENTS\n       FDA will develop harmonized (CBER/CDER) standard operating \n     procedures that articulate the Agency's policy and procedures \n     (e.g., timing, content, rationale and vetting process) for \n     requesting that applicants agree in writing to voluntary \n     postmarketing study commitments. The SOPs will be finalized \n     prior to the end of FY 08. In developing these SOPs, the \n     Agency will take into consideration the findings of the \n     contractor study of current Agency procedures to be completed \n     during FY 07. FDA will make available a releasable version of \n     the final report within 2 months of receipt from the \n     contractor. Training will be provided to all CBER and CDER \n     review staff on the harmonized (CBER/CDER) standard operating \n     procedures. Training will continue for all new review staff \n     and refresher training will be provided to all review staff \n     as necessary through FY 12.\n       XIII.

Assessment of the progress toward full implementation of \n     Good Review Management Principles, focusing on both FDA \n     reviewer practices and industry sponsor practices affecting \n     successful implementation.\n       3. Assessment by an independent accounting firm of the \n     review activity adjustment methodology (as described in \n     section 736(c)(2) that is applied in FY 09 with \n     recommendations for changes, if warranted\n\n[[Page S12426]]\n\n       XIV. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GOALS\n       A. Objectives\n       1. FDA is committed to achieve the long-term goal of an \n     automated standards-based information technology (IT) \n     environment for the exchange, review, and management of \n     information supporting the process for the review of human \n     drug applications throughout the product life cycle. Towards \n     this goal, FDA will work toward the accomplishment of the \n     following objectives by the end of FY 12:\n       a) Develop and periodically update an IT plan, as defined \n     in Sections B) and C) below, covering a rolling five-year \n     planning horizon.\n       b) Develop, implement, and maintain new information systems \n     consistently across all organizational divisions \n     participating in the process for the review of human drug \n     applications, and in compliance with the IT plan, the FDA's \n     program-wide governance process, the FDA's target enterprise \n     architecture, and with HHS enterprise architecture standards. \n     The consistency of development, implementation, and \n     maintenance of new information systems will be determined by \n     the FDA based on considerations of program efficiency and \n     effectiveness. Emphasis will be placed on the consistency of \n     interactions with regulated parties and other external \n     stakeholders.\n       c) Update technical specifications and IT-related guidance \n     documents as necessary to reflect consistent program-wide \n     implementation of new information systems supporting \n     electronic information exchange between FDA and regulated \n     parties and other external stakeholders.\n       d) Extend the capability of the secure electronic single \n     point of entry to include two-way transmission of regulatory \n     correspondence.\n       e) Establish an automated standards-based regulatory \n     submission and review environment for INDs, NDAs, and BLAs, \n     and their supplements, that enables the following functions \n     over the life cycle of the product:\n       (1) Electronic IND, NDA, and BLA submissions received by \n     FDA can be archived to enable retrieval through standardized \n     automated links;\n       (2) Electronic IND, NDA, and BLA submissions can include \n     cross-references to previously submitted electronic materials \n     through standardized automated links; and\n       (3) Archived electronic IND, NDA, and BLA submissions can \n     be retrieved through standardized automated links.\n       f) Establish a system for electronic exchange and \n     management of human drug labeling information in a modular \n     manner (e.g., at the label section level) that is based on \n     FDA standards and that enables revision tracking.\n       g) Establish standards-based information systems to support \n     how FDA obtains and analyzes post-market drug safety data and \n     manages emerging drug safety information, as described in \n     Section VIII addressing the enhancement and modernization of \n     the FDA drug safety system.\n       B. Communications and Technical Interactions\n       1. FDA will develop and periodically update a five-year IT \n     plan for improving the automation of business processes and \n     acquiring and maintaining information systems to achieve the \n     objectives defined above in PDUFA IT Goal A. The plan will \n     include measurable or observable milestones toward \n     achievement of those objectives.\n       2. The IT plan will be reviewed and approved through the \n     appropriate FDA governance process to ensure it conforms to \n     the Agency's overall long-term automation strategy.\n       3. The IT plan will be drafted, published on the FDA web \n     site, and updated as follows:\n       a) FDA will publish a draft of the IT plan by December 31, \n     2007. At that time, FDA will solicit and consider comments \n     from the public on the draft IT plan. The public comment \n     period will be at least 45 calendar days. FDA will complete \n     revisions to the IT plan and publish the final version no \n     later than May 30, 2008.\n       b) FDA will conduct an annual assessment of progress \n     against the IT plan and publish on the FDA web site a summary \n     of the assessment within 2 months after the close of each \n     fiscal year.\n       c) FDA will publish updates to the IT plan as FDA deems \n     necessary to achieve the objectives defined in PDUFA IT Goal \n     A. FDA will publish on the FDA web site draft revisions to \n     the IT plan; solicit comments from the public on those draft \n     revisions; and consider the public comments before completing \n     and publishing updates to the IT plan.\n       4. The FDA and industry stakeholders will meet on a \n     quarterly basis to discuss ongoing implementation of the IT \n     plan, status of IT metrics as available, and potential \n     impacts that future activities may have on stakeholders. \n     These meetings will also be used to discuss potential FDA \n     revisions to the IT plan based on operational experience.\n       C. Standards and IT Plan\n       The IT plan referenced in PDUFA IT Goal B will provide a \n     vision for FDA standards and technical infrastructure \n     supporting the process for the review of human drug \n     applications and will address the following:\n       1. A description of the scope and approach for an \n     evaluation and design of the target enterprise architecture \n     necessary to achieve the objectives defined in PDUFA IT Goal \n     A.\n       2. The business processes targeted for automation to \n     achieve business-driven objectives.\n       3. Which electronic data standards, including the \n     associated Standards Development Organization, are being \n     considered for adoption or development. (Note: The FDA's \n     process for adopting or developing standards includes the \n     consideration of existing open consensus standards prior to \n     the development of new standards. FDA participates in \n     international Standards Development Organizations and \n     supports global harmonization of data standards through open \n     structured processes.)\n       4. Implementation of information systems that are based on \n     the electronic data standards.\n       5. Training for system users, stakeholder adoption, and \n     communications for transitioning to new or reengineered \n     information systems supporting the process for the review of \n     human drug applications.\n       6. A description of FDA's processes for\n       a) evaluating business processes for electronic information \n     exchange between FDA and regulated parties or external \n     stakeholders;\n       b) evaluating, adopting or developing electronic data \n     standards for information exchange between FDA and regulated \n     parties or external stakeholders; and\n       c) developing, piloting, and deploying information systems \n     that use those standards in supporting the process for the \n     review of human drug applications.\n       D. Metrics and Measures\n       FDA will measure progress toward achievement of the \n     objectives defined in PDUFA IT Goal A. Measures will include:\n       1. The number and percentage of IND, NDA, and BLA \n     submissions received in valid electronic format in compliance \n     with FDA standards, categorized by types of submissions. \n     Increasing the number and percentage of IND, NDA, and BLA \n     submissions received in valid electronic format is a goal \n     that is supported by the FDA and industry stakeholders. \n     Achievement of this goal requires the cooperation of \n     regulated industry. To support the assessment of this goal, \n     the following information will be tracked and reported at \n     least annually:\n       a) Total number of submissions categorized by type of \n     submission;\n       b) Total number of submissions in valid electronic format \n     in compliance with FDA standards\n       c) Total number of submissions received through the secure \n     electronic single point of entry versus other methods; and\n       d) Total number of submissions received substantially on \n     paper.\n       2. Total number of standards-based electronic submissions \n     that fail to comply with FDA electronic submission standards, \n     along with a distribution of these submission failures across \n     categories of failure or problem type.\n       3. Annual spending on maintenance of legacy IT systems and \n     IT systems that are common across the organizational \n     divisions participating in the process for the review of \n     human drug applications.\n       4. Other measures and milestones to be identified in the IT \n     plan addressed under Sections B and C above.\n       XV. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n       A. The term ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the \n     issuance of a complete action letter after the complete \n     review of a filed complete application. The action letter, if \n     it is not an approval, will set forth in detail the specific \n     deficiencies and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to \n     place the application in condition for approval.\n       B. A major amendment to an original application, efficacy \n     supplement, or resubmission of any of these applications, \n     submitted within three months of a goal date, may extend the \n     goal date by three months. A major amendment to a \n     manufacturing supplement submitted within two months of the \n     goal date extends the goal date by two months. Only one \n     extension can be given per review cycle.\n       C. A resubmitted original application is a complete \n     response to an action letter addressing all identified \n     deficiencies.\n       D. Class 1 resubmitted applications are applications \n     resubmitted after a complete response letter (or a not \n     approvable or approvable letter) that include the following \n     items only (or combinations of these items):\n       1. Final printed labeling\n       2. Draft labeling\n       3. Safety updates submitted in the same format, including \n     tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data \n     and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new \n     information including important new adverse experiences not \n     previously reported with the product are presented in the \n     resubmission)\n       4. Stability updates to support provisional or final dating \n     periods\n       5. Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including \n     proposals for such studies\n       6. Assay validation data\n       7. Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to \n     support approval\n       8. A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the \n     application (determined * * *\n       9. Other minor clarifying information (determined by the \n     Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)\n       10. Other specific items may be added later as the Agency \n     gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via \n     guidance documents to industry.\n       E. Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any \n     other items, including any items that would require \n     presentation to an advisory committee.\n\n[[Page S12427]]\n\n       F. A Type A meeting is a meeting which is necessary for an \n     otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed (a \n     ``critical path'' meeting) or to address an important safety \n     issue.\n       G. A Type B Meeting is a 1) pre-IND, 2) end of Phase 1 (for \n     Subpart E or Subpart H or similar products) or end of Phase \n     2/pre-Phase 3, or 3) a pre-NDA/BLA meeting. Each requestor \n     should usually only request 1 each of these Type B meetings \n     for each potential application (NDA/BLA) (or combination of \n     closely related products, i.e., same active ingredient but \n     different dosage forms being developed concurrently).\n       H. A Type C meeting is any other type of meeting.\n       I. The performance Goals and procedures also apply to \n     original applications and supplements for human drugs \n     initially marketed on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis through \n     an NDA or switched from prescription to OTC status through an \n     NDA or supplement.\n       J. IT Definitions (see section XI)\n       1. ``Automation of business processes'' refers to the \n     development and deployment of information systems that \n     support program activities (i.e., business processes) \n     conducted under the process for the review of human drug \n     applications. The purpose of business process automation is \n     to support decision making by FDA program managers and \n     reviewers. The scope of business process automation is \n     determined by program managers toward the objective of more \n     efficient and effective program operations.\n       2. ``Program'' refers to the organizational resources, \n     procedures, and activities assigned to conduct ``the process \n     for the review of human drug applications,'' as defined in \n     the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.\n       3. ``Standards-based'' means compliant with published \n     specifications that address terminology or information \n     exchange between the FDA and regulated parties or external \n     stakeholders, as adopted by the FDA or other agencies of the \n     federal government, and often based on the publications of \n     national or international Standards Development \n     Organizations.\n       4. ``FDA Standards'' means technical specifications that \n     have been adopted and published by the FDA through the \n     appropriate governance process. FDA standards may apply to \n     terminology, information exchange, engineering or technology \n     specifications, or other technical matters related to \n     information systems. FDA standards often are based on the \n     publications of other federal agencies, or the publications \n     of national or international Standards Development \n     Organizations.\n       5. ``Product life cycle'' means the sequential stages of \n     human drug development, regulatory review and approval, post-\n     market surveillance and risk management, and where \n     applicable, withdrawal of an approved drug from the market. \n     In the context of the process for the review of human drug \n     applications, the product life cycle begins with the earliest \n     regulatory submissions in the Investigational New Drug (IND) \n     phase, continues through the New Drug Application (NDA) or \n     Biological Licensing Application (BLA) review phase, and \n     includes post-market surveillance and risk management \n     activities as covered under the process for the review of \n     human drug applications.\n       6. ``The FDA's program-wide IT governance process'' \n     includes centralized oversight of all data and technology \n     standards adoption, technology acquisition, and funding \n     allocation.\n       7. ``The FDA's target enterprise architecture'' includes \n     data and technology standards for the electronic exchange and \n     management of information supporting the process for the \n     review of human drug applications.\n\n  Section B: Performance Goals and Procedures for Advisory Review of \n  Direct-to-Consumer Television Advertising Fiscal Years 2008 Through \n                                  2012\n\n       The performance goals and procedures of the FDA Center for \n     Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for \n     Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), as agreed to under \n     the direct-to-consumer television advertising user fee \n     program in Section 736A of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act are summarized below.\n       I. FINDINGS\n       A. FDA's advisory review of proposed prescription drug \n     television advertisements helps to ensure that these \n     advertisements communicate information to consumers that is \n     accurate, balanced, and adequately substantiated, thereby \n     improving the quality of these advertisements.\n       B. It is important to industry and FDA to provide \n     predictability in the timeframe for reviewing and providing \n     written comments on direct-to-consumer television \n     advertisements submitted to FDA for advisory review before \n     initial dissemination.\n       C. FDA needs additional resources to ensure that it has \n     adequate staff to provide advisory reviews of direct-to-\n     consumer television advertisements in a timely manner.\n       D. A program that requires payment of user fees by those \n     who choose to voluntarily submit direct-to-consumer \n     television advertisements for advisory review by FDA is \n     established to provide needed resources to FDA and improve \n     the timeliness of FDA advisory reviews while maintaining the \n     quality of the reviews.\n       E. Each submission for advisory review will be assessed a \n     fee, but the sponsor may resubmit that advertisement one time \n     after receiving comments without further fee assessment.\n       F. Under this program, it is important to ensure that FDA \n     has the resources needed to hire and retain adequate staff to \n     meet review performance goals.\n       G. Because reviews from this program are dependant on \n     submissions which are unpredictable, the statute establishes \n     a reserve fund to maintain a staff that can meet the review \n     performance goals in case user fees for any year of the \n     program are not adequate. In addition, user fees for all \n     submissions during a fiscal year are to be paid at the start \n     of each fiscal year or late fees will be assessed.\n       II. REVIEW PERFORMANCE GOALS\n       A. Goals for First 150 Advisory Review Submissions.\n       Fiscal Year 2008:\n       1. Review and provide advisory comments for 75 original \n     submissions within 45 days (50% of 150).\n       2. Review and provide advisory comments for 37 \n     resubmissions of original submissions within 30 days (50% of \n     75 resubmissions).\n       Fiscal Year 2009:\n       1. Review and provide advisory comments for 90 original \n     submissions (60% of 150) within 45 days.\n       2. Review and provide advisory comments for 45 \n     resubmissions (60% of 75) within 30 days.\n       Fiscal Year 2010:\n       1. Review and provide advisory comments for 105 original \n     submissions (70% of 150) within 45 days.\n       2. Review and provide advisory comments for 52 \n     resubmissions (70% of 75) within 30 days.\n       Fiscal Year 2011:\n       1. Review and provide advisory comments for 120 original \n     submissions (80% of 150) within 45 days.\n       2. Review and provide advisory comments for 60 \n     resubmissions (80% of 75) within 30 days.\n       Fiscal Year 2012:\n       1. Review and provide advisory comments for 135 original \n     submissions (90% of 150) within 45 days.\n       2. Review and provide advisory comments for 68 \n     resubmissions (90% of 75) within 30 days.\n       NOTE: For any goal year, if the number of submissions or \n     resubmissions received is not greater than the number for \n     which the Agency has committed to provide advisory comments \n     on within the goal timeframe, then the goal will be to \n     provide comments on 90% of the number received within the \n     goal timeframe. For example, if FDA receives only 30 \n     resubmissions in fiscal year 2008, then the goal would be to \n     review 27 resubmissions within 30 days.\n       B. Goals after 150 Submissions\n       If in any fiscal year after FY 2008, participants in the \n     program indicate (in response to the Federal Register notice) \n     the intent to submit more direct-to-consumer broadcast \n     advertisement submissions for advisory review than were \n     subject to the goals in the prior year, the following \n     performance goals will apply (see Appendix B-1 for specific \n     examples):\n       1. In the first year of the increase, FDA will review and \n     provide advisory comments for:\n       a) 50% of the additional paid original submissions over the \n     cohort of original submissions from the previous fiscal year, \n     up to a maximum of 50 additional submissions, within 45 days.\n       b) 50% of the additional resubmissions over the cohort of \n     resubmissions from the previous fiscal year, up to a maximum \n     of 24 additional resubmissions, within 30 days.\n       2. In each subsequent year, the performance goals will \n     increase in the same manner as in section A. for each \n     additional cohort of up to 50 additional submissions over the \n     cohort of the prior year (i.e., in the second year after the \n     increase, the goal will be to review 60% of the additional \n     cohort from the prior year (up to 50 submissions) and 50% of \n     any further additions (up to an additional 50 submissions)).\n       3. For purposes of this adjustment, it is assumed that the \n     number of submissions subject to review metrics cannot \n     decrease from one year to the next even if actual submissions \n     decrease.\n       4. For purposes of this adjustment, it is assumed that 150 \n     submissions are subject to performance goals in fiscal year \n     2008.\n       5. The goals described in this subsection will be \n     calculated based solely on the number of submissions \n     identified in response to the Federal Register notice for \n     that fiscal year.\n       III. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n       1. The term ``amendment'' shall mean additional documents \n     submitted to FDA to complete an original submission or \n     resubmission. For example, references that have been cited in \n     the original submission but were omitted from the original \n     submission package could be submitted as an amendment.\n       2. The term ``original submission'' shall mean a proposed \n     television advertisement submission for which a sponsor paid \n     for an advisory review. The proposed television advertisement \n     may not be more than two minutes long.\n       3. The term ``resubmission'' shall mean a subsequent \n     submission of a revised version of the advertisement \n     contained in an original submission. Any revisions made to \n     the proposed television advertisement must be based on FDA \n     comments on the original submission.

Mr. President, last night, we passed the Department of \nDefense Authorization bill. I want to comment briefly on the debate we \nhad during consideration of that legislation related to the war in \nIraq. I am frustrated that we did not reach a bipartisan consensus on a \nnew way forward that could begin to bring an end to this conflict.\n  When I introduced the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation \nAct last spring with Senator Alexander and a bipartisan group of our \ncolleagues, I was hopeful we could work constructively with the \nPresident toward the goal of having our troops redeployed by the spring \nof 2008. I was hopeful that we would send a strong signal--with a \nbipartisan group that eventually grew to 17 Senators--that we should \nget out of the combat business in Iraq as quickly as possible.\n  The Iraq Study Group Report was issued 10 months ago. Its core \nrecommendation was that we transition our military mission from combat \nto training, supporting, and equipping Iraqi security forces. The \nreport said that we should condition our support of the Iraqi \nGovernment on its performance in meeting important milestones. The \nreport contemplated that we could be out of the combat business by \nMarch 31, 2008.\n  The report was anticipated with great fanfare. But when it came out, \nthe Bush administration failed to embrace it. The Iraqi Government has \nfailed to meet most of the benchmarks described in the report. General \nPetraeus has testified, essentially, that we should maintain our combat \nmission for the foreseeable future. And that March 31 date is only 6 \nmonths away.\n  I still believe in the report. It is still relevant, and it is still \nimportant. It sets forth a comprehensive military, political, and \neconomic strategy for bringing a responsible end to the war in Iraq.\n  But I believe we must build upon the report and take decisive action \nnow to redefine our mission in Iraq and set a clear course for the \nredeployment of our troops.\n  Ten months after the Iraq Study Group issued its report, we have \nfailed to begin the transition of our mission that was central to their \nrecommendations. That transition in mission is the key to encouraging \nthe Iraqi Government to take responsibility for the future of their \ncountry. The Government Accountability Office has concluded that the \nIraqi Government has failed to take that responsibility by meeting the \nreasonable benchmarks set forth by the Iraq Study Group.\n  I continue to believe that we must follow the core principles laid \nout in the Iraq Study Group Report. I continue to believe we need a \nbipartisan solution to bring this conflict to a responsible end. And I \nthank each of the cosponsors of our amendment, Republicans and \nDemocrats, for their willingness to join in this important effort. They \ninclude Senators Alexander, Bennett, Coleman, Collins, Domenici, Gregg, \nSpecter, and Sununu from the Republican side and Democratic Senators \nPryor, Casey, Carper, Conrad, Landrieu, Lincoln, McCaskill, and Bill \nNelson.\n  I believe now is the time to build upon the principles set forth by \nthe Iraq Study Group. We must begin a transition of mission from combat \nto training and support. We must demand more from the Iraqi Government \nand send a strong and unequivocal message that our commitment is not \nopen-ended. I believe these actions are consistent with the \nrecommendations of the Iraq Study Group, and I remain hopeful that our \nlegislation can be the basis for a constructive, bipartisan solution to \nthe war in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12428-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12428-S12429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Second Class Charles Luke Milam\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to reflect on the life and service \nof Navy Hospital Corpsman Second Class Charles Luke Milam. Luke was \nkilled last Wednesday in a rocket attack near the town of Musa Qula, \nAfghanistan. He was 26 years old.\n  Luke Milam was a giant of his generation, a man who served his \ncountry and those around him with dignity, courage, and honor. I cannot \nbegin to paint the picture of someone so deeply respected by those with \nwhom he served, so committed to helping others.\n  Luke Milam grew up in Littleton, CO, the youngest of four siblings. \nHe was smart, friendly, and athletic. He loved the mountains of \nColorado and spent his time biking, backpacking, hiking, and canoeing.\n\n[[Page S12429]]\n\n  I do not know what inspired Luke's strong sense of virtue or what led \nhim to join the military. Perhaps it was the service of his grandfather \nCharles or his brother Keith that moved him to enlist after graduating \nfrom high school.\n  I imagine, though, that Luke's own experiences as a witness to one of \nthe worst tragedies of our time, the shootings at Columbine High \nSchool, strengthened his resolve to bring healing, peace, and good to \nareas torn by violence. Luke Milam was a senior at Columbine when, on \nApril 20, 1999, 2 shooters killed 12 people and wounded 24 others \nbefore turning their guns on themselves.\n  I was Colorado's attorney general when the shootings occurred. The \ntime I spent with the Littleton community in the aftermath--sorting \nthrough the events, finding out what went wrong and then helping to \nrebuild--affirmed my unmatched admiration for the young people who \nendured one of the darkest moments of American history. So many of \nColumbine's survivors have gone on to do extraordinary things--it is as \nthough they have committed themselves to overcoming the evil they \nwitnessed by planting hope, decency, and goodness wherever they can. \nLuke Milam was among them.\n  Serving as a Navy corpsman with a unit of marines--a special \noperations unit no less--requires great skill and courage. The corpsman \nis tasked with providing medical care for marines on the field of \nbattle. It is an incredibly dangerous job that entails carrying a \nloaded weapon along with the tools of your trade. Some of America's \nmost renowned heroes on the battlefield were hospital corpsmen: people \nsuch as Wayne Caron, David R. Ray, and Francis Hammond--Medal of Honor \nrecipients who gave their lives in combat to save others.\n  Hospital Corpsman Milam served in this tradition. He was highly \ndecorated for his service, earning a Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, two \nCombat Action ribbons, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, \ntwo Good Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Medal, and two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons. More \nimportantly for the corpsman, though, Luke Milam earned the deepest \nrespect and admiration of the marines with whom he served.\n  Luke was on his fourth tour, having served three tours in Iraq. He \n``felt it was his calling to help the guys around him,'' his brother \nKeith said. ``If there were guys in harm's way, he needed to be there \nto take care of them.''\n  Almost a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt told a Paris crowd that the \nmodel citizen is the man who is willing to take action in pursuit of \nthat which he thinks is right. His speech draws on the same words that \nfamily and friends use to describe Luke Milam's virtues.\n  When evaluating mankind's progress, said Roosevelt, ``it is not the \ncritic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man \nstumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The \ncredit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is \nmarred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, \nwho comes short again and again, because there is no effort without \nerror and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; \nwho knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in \na worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high \nachievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while \ndaring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and \ntimid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.''\n  Hospital Corpsman Luke Milam sacrificed his life for this Nation as a \nman who knew that his country needed him to be ``in the arena,'' \nhelping others. He accepted the risks of his job with extraordinary \nprofessionalism and served with honor in the best tradition of the \ncorpsman. We cannot repay our debt nor replace his loss.\n  To Luke's parents, Rita and Michael, to his sister, Jaeme, and to his \nbrothers, Keith and Andrew, I know that no words can describe or \nassuage the pain you feel. I pray that you can find comfort in the \nknowledge that Luke was doing something which he truly loved, that he \nwas doing it well, and that he will never be forgotten. His country is \neternally grateful. He will endure in our hearts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12429-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12429-S12430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF SCOTT GUDES\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Scott Gudes, \nwho leaves his post at the helm of my Budget Committee staff this week. \nAfter 29 years of loyal service to the Federal Government, Scott has \nchosen to become vice president for government relations for the \nNational Marine Manufacturers Association--a job well suited for a man \nwho loves the sea as much as he does.\n  When I became chair of the Senate Budget Committee in 2005, I asked \nScott if he would serve as my staff director. In under a year, under \nScott's stewardship, we passed both a budget for the first time in 2 \nyears, specifically the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution, and a \nreconciliation bill, the Deficit Reduction Act, DRA--marking the first \ntime in 10 years Congress had passed a reconciliation bill to reduce \nspending.\n  The DRA was a notable achievement in that it saved $39 billion, a \nfeat which is practically unheard of around here, as the last time it \nwas done was in 1997. These accomplishments could not have been done \nwithout Scott, who worked tirelessly to shepherd each authorizing \ncommittee through the often confusing reconciliation process. His \nunique combination of intellect, humor, and humbleness was a key \ncomponent in navigating the complex waters of the compromise that was \nnecessary to pass the first substantive deficit reduction legislation \nin 10 years.\n  Scott followed up his initial year of success by spearheading efforts \nto develop a more comprehensive approach to restraining spending. His \nefforts contributed to the introduction of the Stop Over-Spending Act, \na budget process reform bill that helped focus the national debate on \nsolutions to our long-term fiscal challenges. Just this year, Scott \nhelped structure the Conrad/Gregg Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible \nFiscal Action Act of 2007, legislation that will encourage bipartisan \naction to put our fiscal house back in order. At heart, Scott is a true \nnonpartisan who recognizes that the best policy is made when both sides \nof the aisle work together, and his first instinct is to seek out \ncommon ground rather than partisan differences.\n  However, much like Thomas Jefferson chose to be remembered as author \nof the Declaration of Independence rather than various elected offices \nhe held, including President, I expect that Scott would rather be \nremembered for spearheading efforts to write, edit, and publish the \n``Budget Committee History'' rather than his impressive legislative \ncredentials. Scott took it upon himself to initiate a historic \naccounting of the Senate Budget Committee. This labor of love reflects \ncountless interviews and hours chronicling the birth, history, and \nimportance the committee has held in shaping the Federal budget and \nfiscal policy. His devotion to this project is an example of Scott's \nlove of history and respect for the institution of the Senate.\n  The handful of aforementioned achievements merely reflects Scott's \nlatest accomplishments in an achievement-filled career. It would be \nnearly impossible to chronicle the numerous programs and projects he \ncreated, funded, and oversaw--programs that improved and enriched both \nindividual lives and the environment.\n  In addition to his tour of duty at the Senate Budget Committee, Scott \nhas held key positions on both sides of the Capitol, both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue, and a point I like to forget, Scott has even \nworked on both sides of the aisle. Included in this impressive list are \nstints as the clerk of the Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations \nSubcommittee, professional staff on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and Acting NOAA Administrator, where he championed \nscience, service, and environmental stewardship programs and greatly \nimproved agency morale. In NOAA circles, Scott is a virtual god--king \nof satellites, staunch advocate of the NOAA Corps and its ships and \nplanes, and an addict of the NOAA label, which I understand is \nplastered on literally everything under and around his home, car, and \noffice.\n  But the true bearing of Scott's 29 years of Federal service is not \nthe remarkable list of the jobs he has held, although the list is long \nand distinguished, but the manner in which Scott\n\n[[Page S12430]]\n\nhas approached these positions and the people he has touched along the \nway. Those who know Scott best describe him as a loyal, encouraging, \nand creative boss, who supports and celebrates those who work with him. \nEverything Scott does is done in an ``all hands on deck'' manner that \ngives everyone an opportunity to pitch in and support the common goal.\n  One cannot talk about Scott without recognizing his acumen for all \nthings trivia--Scott is a virtual trivia savant. He knows the answer to \nnearly every trivia question, regardless of topic, and can somehow \nrelate every event back to an old movie or seventies rock song. He will \nsearch to the end of the Internet to find a historic or comic analogy \nto make a point about fiscal responsibility, or often the lack of it. \nHe is equally conversant on the latest entertainment news and military \nstrategies of ancient times. The influence of his crosscutting interest \nand knowledge has occasionally found its way to the Senate floor, where \nboth the Geico Caveman and a Rube Goldberg cartoon have been used to \ndrive home a point.\n  As a lifelong boater, fisherman, and lover of all things relating to \nthe ocean, Scott reminds me of the remarks that President Kennedy made \nat the 1962 America's Cup sailing race. He said, ``All of us have in \nour veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in \nthe ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in \nour tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea--\nwhether it is to sail or to watch it--we are going back from whence we \ncame.''\n  Kathy joins me in wishing Scott well as he joins the National Marine \nManufacturers Association, to ``go back from whence he came'' and \nadvocate on behalf of issues he is most passionate about. As he sets \noff for new adventures with his wife Ann, and, of course, Buddy the \nBudget beagle dog by his side, Scott leaves in his wake a nation that \nis better off for his service, and colleagues that will miss him \ndearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12430-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHILD HEALTH DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Child \nHealth Day. Under a joint resolution of Congress, the President has \nproclaimed National Child Health Day each year since 1928. It is \nespecially fitting that we celebrated Child Health Day yesterday, \nOctober 1, 2007, just 4 days after this body approved legislation to \nreauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, improving \nbenefits and ensuring that 10 million American children receive health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Child Health Day serves to focus attention on children's health \nissues. Past themes of this day have ranged from prenatal care, \nchildhood injury prevention, the importance of immunizations and \nprenatal care. This year's theme is ``Building a Bright Future Through \nPreventive Health,'' and this is exactly what Congress seeks to do with \nthe bipartisan reauthorization of CHIP sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n  The role of preventive health care in ensuring the well-being of all \npeople is well established, but such care is especially critical for \nchildren. The American Academy of Pediatrics, AAP, recommends that \nchildren receive routine preventive health services such as \nimmunizations, vision and hearing checks, and screenings for signs of \ndevelopmental or medical problems. These recommendations include 6 \npreventive care visits during a child's first year, 3 visits during the \nsecond year, and 17 preventive visits between ages 2 and 21.\n  Unfortunately, many of our Nation's children do not receive these \nimportant physician visits. A survey of literature by the Commonwealth \nFund found that estimates of the number of children who receive all \ntheir recommended visits range from 37 percent to 81 percent. \nCritically, this review concluded that insurance coverage is the most \npowerful indicator of whether a child receives all recommended well-\nchild care. One study determined that just 68 percent of uninsured \nchildren receive the recommended preventive care, compared with 76 \npercent of privately insured children and 85 percent of publicly \ninsured children.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act will increase the \nnumber of children who receive this important preventive care. Simply \nby providing nearly 4 million uninsured children with insurance \ncoverage will increase the likelihood that they will be screened for \ndevelopmental and medical problems, receive all their immunizations, \nand benefit from regular hearing and vision checks. In addition, the \nlegislation ensures that children who receive their health coverage \nthrough Medicaid are entitled to all medically necessary early periodic \nscreening, diagnosis, and treatment, EPSDT, services. These services \nare required in every State and are designed to improve the health of \nlow-income children by addressing their physical, mental, and \ndevelopmental health needs.\n  As we recognize Child Health Day, I wish to congratulate Congress on \nits bipartisan effort to improve child health through reauthorization \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program. I also urge President Bush, \nin the spirit of Child Health Day, to drop his veto threat and sign \nthis legislation. This is the single most important action he can take \nto ensure more children get the health care they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12430-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12430-S12431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the next 10 days, a remarkable event \nwill unfold in Shanghai, China. Every 2 years, thousands of Special \nOlympics athletes from around the world come together to showcase their \nathletic skills and celebrate the spirit of Special Olympics. Starting \ntoday, more than 7,500 Special Olympians will begin competing in \nShanghai in the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games.\n  Over the coming 10 days, tens of thousands of athletes, coaches, \nvolunteers, family members, government and industry officials, plus \nexperts in health and education from 165 countries have come together \nto celebrate the talents of those among us who have intellectual \ndisabilities. This spectacular event is not about athletic skill as \nmuch as it is about determination, courage, and the desire to compete.\n  I can speak firsthand about what a rewarding experience it is for all \nof us who have been involved in Special Olympics. Last year, my State \nof Iowa hosted the first USA National Summer Games. Thousands of \nathletes, volunteers, coaches, and families attended our games, in \naddition to 30,000 fans and spectators. Ames, IA, was transformed into \nan Olympic Village, and it was thrilling to experience.\n  I am pleased that three extraordinary athletes from Iowa are now in \nChina competing: Corey Leonhard in track, and Jenna Schrack and Jody \nSheriff competing in bowling. Team USA includes 401 athletes, and 102 \nof them are at the World Games today.\n  Special Olympics is not just about sports. It is about spirit, and it \nis about drawing out the best in all of us. The Special Olympics \norganization is responsible for much more than the games. Its Special \nOlympics Healthy Athletes Program, developed over a decade ago, focuses \non the health, fitness, and well-being of people with and without \ndisabilities. Last year alone, it made possible more than 135,000 \nhealth care screenings. Volunteer health care professionals and \nstudents were trained to provide the screening and compile the data. In \nChina, medical volunteers will provide health examinations free of \ncharge, including dental, vision, and hearing exams.\n  The Special Olympics is both a world-class sporting event and a \nworld-class humanitarian experience. Many countries have sent \ndelegations to the games. In addition to our athletes and volunteers \nattending the Opening Ceremonies, the U.S. delegation will include \nDepartment of Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, figure skating \nchampion Michelle Kwan, former Assistant Secretary of Education John \nHager, Ernie Banks of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Lynn Fuchs, \nProfessor of Special Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt \nUniversity, Anne Sweeney of Disney Media Networks and Disney-ABC \nTelevision Group, Jennifer Polk Wardlow, a Special Olympics North \nCarolina athlete, Dr. Tim Shriver, chairman of the board of Special \nOlympics, and the incomparable Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of \nSpecial Olympics.\n  Mr. President, I regret that, with the Senate in session, I couldn't \nattend today's opening ceremonies. But my\n\n[[Page S12431]]\n\nthoughts are with each and every one of Special Olympics athletes. I \nwish them all the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12431-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     KCUR-FM RADIO 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncommunity of Clovis, NM, on its 100th birthday. Since the first train \ndepot was built in this area a century ago, Clovis has continued to \ngrow and expand its economy.\n  Clovis has seen its share of turmoil and adversity throughout the \npast 100 years, and yet it has maintained its sense of community and is \nnow seeing consistent growth. The growth has been so remarkable that \nthe city has been dubbed the ``City on the Move.'' The land, flat and \nfertile, has been an asset for farmers, cattle growers and dairymen all \nacross the area. And most recently, the largest cheese producing \nfactory in North America was built here. Clovis is home to Cannon Air \nForce Base, which was recently put on the BRAC list for closure. But \nthe town fought back, and now Cannon is not only staying open, but they \nhave received a new mission as an Air Force Special Operations Base \nwhich is slated to expand the base even further.\n  In honor of this centennial birthday, Clovis planned many events. \nSome of the events included the unearthing of a time capsule, a parade, \ncook-off, photo exhibit of Clovis over the last 100 years, and the year \nwill culminate with an Anniversary Celebration Banquet this Saturday \nnight.\n  Clovis is such a special place and I am honored to see this community \ncontinue to succeed. It is with great pleasure that I recognize this \nunique town here today on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12431-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12431-S12432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LYNNE M. ROSS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, before I was elected by the \npeople of Connecticut to serve in the Senate, I was privileged to serve \nas their attorney general for 6 years. During my tenure as AG, I was \nassisted not only by my top rate staff but by an organization that \nproved invaluable toward my efforts to protect public health and \nsafety, the National Association of Attorneys General.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General, NAAG, has been \nassisting the chief legal officers of all 50 States, the District of \nColumbia, and other jurisdictions since 1907. In the last 30 years, the \nscope of NAAG's operations has increased dramatically with the opening \nof its Washington, DC, office, which has been a tremendous resource to \nState attorneys general seeking to coordinate with each other and with \nthe Federal Government. One person who was particularly instrumental in \nexpanding the association's Washington operations is Lynne Ross, who \nretired in September after working in public service for over 30 years.\n  When NAAG first opened its Washington office in 1976, Ms. Ross was \nits first and at that time only full time employee. Given this, it is \namazing the broad array of services this office offered. Serving as \nboth deputy director and legislative director, Ms. Ross coordinated \nlegislative activities on behalf of attorneys general across the \ncountry, including securing $25 million dollars in Federal aid to help \nStates develop/enhance their antitrust capacity. In addition, she \nworked together with State and environmental groups in passing the \nFederal Facilities Compliance Act, which requires Federal facilities to \nfollow the same State, local, and Federal environmental regulations \nthat govern private industry. This act has greatly expanded the ability \nof attorneys general to clean up the environment.\n  Ms. Ross also worked as a liaison between State attorneys general and \nthe White House and executive agencies such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Federal Trade Commission, with which many AGs \nhave extensive, yet sometimes frayed, relations. Ms. Ross was known for \nher ability to help AGs and their staff clear through the bureaucratic \nbrush and find who they need to talk to. She undertook efforts to help \nattorneys generals better perform their jobs by preparing regular NAAG \nmeetings which fostered interaction between AGs and the various Federal \nagencies, by producing various NAAG publications which both informed AG \noffices of various legal developments, and also provided advice on how \nbest to fulfill their roles and responsibilities as the chief public \nlaw enforcement officer for the State.\n  The work done by Ms. Ross and NAAG proved to be so immensely valuable \nto State attorneys general that by 1997, when Ms. Ross returned to the \nNAAG after serving 4 years at EPA, its Washington office had grown to \nemploy almost 50 people to accommodate for the increased demand for \nservices. This speaks volumes about Ms. Ross's talents and work ethic.\n  Upon returning to NAAG, Ms. Ross served again as deputy director, \nmanaging the day-to-day operations of the association. In 2002, she \nbecame executive director, in which she put her experience and wisdom \nto work developing programs and initiatives in an array of substantive \nareas including criminal law, consumer protection, cybercrime, and \nmore.\n  Throughout the years Lynne was at NAAG she was also instrumental in \nthe\n\n[[Page S12432]]\n\ncreation and support of an auxiliary organization of former attorneys \ngeneral called the Society of Attorneys General Emeritus, SAGE. SAGE \nmembers could always rely on Lynne's prompt and responsive counsel and \nadvice.\n  Mr. President, what I have provided today is just a mere sampling of \nLynne Ross's professional accomplishments. One could easily fill up a \nlarge book with the things she has done and yet still not do her career \njustice. Perhaps it best to simply say: Thank you, Lynne Ross, for \nhelping to make NAAG the organization it is today. All our country's \nattorneys general and the people they serve are better off because of \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12432-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2276.

Yet the majority of the public \nremains unaware of the impending digital television transition. \nMillions of Americans may turn on their TVs on February 18, 2009, only \nto find themselves left in the dark without access to critical weather \nupdates, emergency alerts, news or entertainment programming. In my \nhome state of Wisconsin alone, over half a million households rely on \nfree over-the-air TV.\n  As Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I recently held a \nhearing entitled, ``Preparing for the Digital Television Transition: \nWill Seniors Be Left in the Dark?'' Our hearing uncovered several \nconcerns. First, seniors need targeted outreach about the transition \nand the related coupon program. Second, there is shockingly little \ncoordination between the Government agencies overseeing the transition \nand the voluntary industry efforts to educate consumers. Third, \nnonprofit organizations require additional resources to sufficiently \nassist seniors with navigating the transition. Finally, the \nGovernment's plan to provide coupons to partially offset the cost of a \nconverter box is fraught with confusion and vulnerable to fraud and \nabuse.\n  My legislation will address these problems by creating a formalized \npartnership between the Federal Communications Commission, the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration and the \nAdministration on Aging with specific reporting requirements. Together \nthese entities will work with stakeholders such as the broadcasters, \nthe aging network, disability groups, rural Americans, and State, local \nand tribal governments to craft a coordinated outreach campaign. This \nlegislation will also establish a grant program to ensure that \nnonprofits and state and local government agencies, like area agencies \non aging, have access to assistance as they help seniors and other \nvulnerable populations navigate the transition and the coupon program.\n  This legislation will help safeguard seniors and their families by \nfacilitating a number of common sense solutions. The bill requires \ncommercial broadcasters to air public service announcements and develop \nconsumer education plans to meet the needs of local viewers. It \nrequires that coupon-eligible converter boxes are easily identifiable \nto mitigate the potential of consumers being swayed into purchasing \nexpensive equipment they do not need. It also requires that \nmanufacturers of converter boxes maintain a toll-free 1-800 number to \nassist individuals with installation. It sets specific reporting \nrequirements for the FCC and NTIA to monitor the progress of their \nconsumer awareness campaign and the coupon program. The legislation \nalso modifies the coupon program to ensure that households relying \nsolely on over-the-air television sets are prioritized and that \nresidents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities are eligible \nto participate.\n  I want to thank the following organizations for endorsing this \nlegislation: AARP, the Association for Public Television Stations, the \nNational Association of State Units on Aging, the National Association \nof Area Agencies on Aging, American Association of Homes and Services \nfor the Aging, the Meals on Wheels Association of America, and the \nNational Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs.\n  Senior citizens deserve to receive targeted outreach and complete \ninformation about the upcoming transition. They do not deserve to be \nthe brunt of fraudulent schemes or to be left in the dark after \nFebruary 17, 2009. I believe we must prepare America's seniors, and I \nhope my colleagues will join in my effort to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Reporting requirements.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on February 17, 2009, television stations will cease \n     broadcasting analog signals and traditional analog \n     televisions will stop working unless they are connected to a \n     digital-to-analog converter box, cable, or satellite;\n       (2) a study conducted by the National Association of \n     Broadcasters revealed that over half of the respondents had \n     ``seen, read, or heard nothing'' about the transition to \n     digital television, and only 10 percent were able to guess \n     that the transition would occur in 2009;\n       (3) according to a July 2007 study released by the \n     Association of Public Television Stations, older \n     individuals--\n       (A) over the age of 65 are more likely to be found in over-\n     the-air households and are, therefore, a much more vulnerable \n     group with respect to maintaining television service as the \n     digital transition is completed;\n       (B) as a group, are less likely to have purchased a new \n     television in the past 3 years, are less likely to have HDTV \n     capabilities in their households, and are less likely to own \n     a digital television;\n       (C) will not have the same exposure to digital television \n     transition messages from electronic retailers as will younger \n     members of the population; and\n       (D) will need special focus in efforts to educate the \n     public with respect to the transition from analog to digital \n     television;\n       (4) according to a Nielsen Media Research report, \n     approximately 20,000,000 households rely exclusively on \n     analog or free over-the-air broadcasts;\n       (5) of these 20,000,000 households, approximately 8,000,000 \n     include at least 1 person over the age of 50, according to \n     the Nielsen Media Research TV Household Estimates;\n       (6) according to the General Accountability Office, about \n     48 percent of over-the-air households have incomes under \n     $30,000;\n       (7) frail, homebound, rural, minority, disabled, limited \n     English proficient, and low-income older individuals will \n     need specific guidance and assistance in order to purchase \n     and properly install a digital-to-analog converter box;\n       (8) without a targeted outreach program residents in \n     nursing homes and assisted living facilities represent a \n     segment of the population at risk for losing television \n     service as a result of the digital transition;\n       (9) failure to seamlessly transition from analog to digital \n     television will restrict or eliminate the access of older \n     individuals to essential preparedness and safety information \n     in the event of an emergency or disaster, as such individuals \n     will be unable to receive national and local alerts aired \n     over television;\n       (10) it is now 6 years after the communication failures of \n     September 11, 2001, which spurred Federal Government adoption \n     of a firm digital television transition date;\n       (11) unfortunately the Department of Commerce and the \n     Federal Communications Commission have not adequately assured \n     Congress that vulnerable households will be properly educated \n     and prepared for such transition; and\n       (12) older individuals, their families, caregivers, and \n     aging support networks will need targeted outreach to inform \n     them of steps to take in order to ensure uninterrupted \n     television service and to help mitigate potential\n\n[[Page S12436]]\n\n     digital television transition scams that may target the \n     elderly.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals to defer recognition of reinvested capital gains \ndistributions from regulated investment companies; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, \nan important bill that will allow Americans to save more for the long \nterm and will better prepare them for a secure retirement. The \nGenerating Retirement Ownership Through Long-Term Holding, GROWTH Act, \nhad substantial bipartisan support in the House last Congress, and has \nbeen introduced in a bipartisan manner again in the House this \nCongress. Mr. Johnson and I are proud to introduce in the Senate this \nbipartisan legislation that provides Americans a better tool to grow \ntheir long-term retirement savings.\n  The GROWTH Act would allow investors in mutual funds to keep more \nretirement savings invested longer and growing longer by deferring \ntaxation of automatically reinvested capital gains until fund shares \nare sold, rather than allowing those long-term gains, which generate no \ncurrent income or cash in hand, to be taxed every year.\n  To understand how beneficial this bill would be, it is important to \nunderstand the role of mutual funds in long-term retirement savings. \nAmong households owning mutual funds, 92 percent are investing for \nretirement, with more than 70 percent saying their primary purpose in \ninvesting in funds is to prepare for retirement. Many of today's \nworkers do not yet have in place the retirement savings supplement to \nSocial Security that will prepare them for the future. In fact, almost \nhalf of American workers, nearly 75 million of 155 million workers--are \nnot offered any form of pension or retirement savings plan at work.\n  Meanwhile, the number of years spent in retirement is growing and the\n\n[[Page S12440]]\n\ncosts individuals can expect to bear in retirement are growing, too. \nThe Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that an individual \nretiring at age 65 in 2016 will need more than $300,000 just to cover \nhealth coverage premiums and expenses. Individual savings efforts also \nface significant obstacles. Those not covered by an employer's \nretirement plan, for example, can set aside a deductible IRA \ncontribution of only $4,000 this year, $5,000 if they are age 50 or \nolder.\n  Mutual funds are a hugely important part of American workers' \npreparation for retirement, both through their employers' retirement \nplans and on their own. Mutual funds now make up about half of the $4.1 \ntrillion held by American workers through 401(k) plans and other \nsimilar job-based savings programs. About 38 million American investors \nhold mutual funds through their defined contribution plans. More than \n31 million American investors are saving through taxable mutual fund \naccounts, either as supplements to their employers' plans or because \nthey do not have such plans.\n  The GROWTH Act is also a good idea because it remedies an unfairness \nin the tax code that can make saving difficult for many Americans. \nMutual fund investors who are struggling to save for retirement should \nnot have to pay taxes on ``profits'' they have not realized. If they \ndon't have money in hand, it makes no sense for them to have to pay \ntaxes. The GROWTH Act would defer taxes until the mutual fund shares \nare sold and the investor has actual funds to pay the taxes.\n  The GROWTH Act would be a valuable contributor to retirement savings \nefforts. Mutual fund savers who automatically reinvest are doing what \npolicymakers want to see. They are holding for the long term, \ncontributing to national savings, and building up their own retirement \nnest egg. These Americans should be encouraged to save, not discouraged \nthrough a tax on automatic reinvestments. The GROWTH Act is a step that \nwill show immediate results, a step that will help tens of millions of \nAmerican savers and ``should-be savers'' over the course of their \nworking lives, and a step that with time can make a real difference in \nthe retirement readiness of American families.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Johnson and me in supporting the \nGROWTH Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to once again join my \ncolleague Mike Crapo of Idaho in introducing a bill with growing \nbipartisan support, a bill that promises to be an important part of the \nmany steps we will need to take to help Americans save more effectively \nfor the many long-term needs they must increasingly plan for on their \nown--health, education and retirement.\n  Currently, mutual fund investors who are saving outside a 401(k) plan \nor an IRA find themselves taxed every year as a result of the buying \nand selling that is part of fund diversification, even if they have \narranged to automatically reinvest any capital gains, even though they \nsold no shares, in fact, even if the value of their investments have \nfallen.\n  As a result, each year during tax season, we hear from investors who \nhave worked hard and played by the rules. These are Americans who are \ncommitted to a plan of saving for the long term, who nevertheless find \nthemselves hit with a tax bill although they are simply staying the \ncourse. Mr. Crapo and I don't believe that these people should be \ndiscouraged from long-term investing and taxed I prematurely when a \nbetter-timed tax--one that comes in when investments are sold--would \nbetter facilitate long-term investing, retirement readiness, and \nperhaps even tax compliance through simpler calculations and fewer \nannual adjustments.\n  Congress has spent a great deal of effort trying to strengthen and \npromote pension promises, through both defined benefit and defined \ncontribution plans. Yet many of today's workers do not yet have in \nplace the retirement savings to supplement Social Security benefits. In \nfact, almost half of American workers--nearly 75 million of 155 million \nworkers--are not offered any form of pension or retirement savings plan \nat work. These are the people who need GROWTH the most.\n  And the challenge they face for the future is growing. The number of \nyears Americans and their families can expect to spend in retirement is \ngrowing, as are the costs individuals can expect to bear in retirement. \nIndividual savings opportunities for those who spend some or all of \ntheir working years without participating or vesting in an employer's \nretirement plan are modest. Those workers covered by an employer's \nretirement plan, for example, can set aside a deductible IRA \ncontribution of only $4,000 this year, $5,000 if they\n\n[[Page S12441]]\n\nare age 50 or older. Many will want and need to save more every year if \nthey are to be ready for retirement. These are the people who need \nGROWTH.\n  How many are there? More than 31 million Americans are saving through \ntaxable mutual fund accounts, either as supplements to their employers' \nplans or because they do not have such plans. The GROWTH Act would \nprovide sensible tax treatment that would defer, not avoid, taxation. \nIn the process, it would better enable retirement savers in what they \nare trying to do, plan for an uncertain road ahead.\n  A bigger tax debate is ahead, along with a bigger debate about the \nfuture of Social Security and the way to modernize and improve private \nsector retirement savings tools that must supplement it. The GROWTH Act \nis one of those practical building blocks that deserves to be part of \nfuture debates on tax and retirement policy. Its impact illustrates \njust how many millions of American households are out there right now, \nhouseholds of modest incomes, saving on their own, through mutual fund \ninvestments, making up that growing middle class, a middle class that \nis facing a lot of squeezes, a lot of growing demands on their savings, \nbut a group that is trying to save nevertheless. About three in five \nfund investors have household incomes between $25,000 and $100,000. Not \nhigh-flyers looking to be creative, but working people who deserve to \nfind a few less obstacles in their way.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Crapo and me in supporting the \nGROWTH Act and refocusing their attention to just who these savers are \nand what kind of sensible tax policy they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 2127. A bill to provide assistance to families of miners involved \nin mining accidents; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, I heard disturbing testimony \nduring a Senate HELP Committee hearing on the Crandall Canyon Mine \ndisaster about the misinformation that families received during the \ntragedy. When I met with many of the family members of the miners \ninvolved in the accident, I saw the enduring pain of their loss, and, \nalthough there is nothing I can do to take that pain away, I can work \nto ensure that if other families are ever faced with such tragedy in \nthe future, they will be cared for with respect, dignity, and \nconsistency.\n  I am proud to introduce the Mine Disaster Family Assistance Act of \n2007, closely modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board's \nhighly effective family assistance model used during major aviation \naccidents in this country to care for victims and their families.\n  This bill puts families who experience such a tragedy first by \nestablishing a director of family support services at MSHA. This person \nwould serve as the Federal Government's point-of-contact for families \nduring an emergency. The director would be responsible for the overall \ncoordination of family services provided by all parties involved in a \nmine emergency and ensure that families receive consistent information \nfirst during rescue and investigation efforts.\n  Second, it requires the designation of an independent nonprofit \norganization with experience in disasters and post trauma family \ncommunication, such as the American Red Cross, ARC, as the primary \ncoordinator of emotional care and support for families. This \norganization will provide mental health and counseling services to \nfamilies, and a private place to grieve; meet with family members \nonsite; and update families on accident and post accident activities.\n  Third, it requires mine operators to submit a strategic plan to \nclearly establish accident protocols for meeting the needs of families \nbefore an emergency occurs. To ensure these plans are submitted and \napproved in a timely fashion, the bill also prohibits approval of other \noperating plans until a mine has an MSHA-approved family assistance \nplan.\n  Finally, it gives families a voice in the process by including them \nas a required partner in a task force designed to provide \nrecommendations for program enhancements. Other partners include mine \noperators, including operators of small mines, labor, the ARC, and the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  We all agree that families who have lost loved ones in mining \ntragedies like those at Sago and Crandall, deserve our best efforts to \nprovide consistent communication and support. The landmark MINER Act, \nsigned into law last year, was a good first step in this direction, but \nthese tragedies demand that we take additional steps to ensure that the \nvictims' families receive the best information and care possible during \nan emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12441-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12441-S12442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 341--CONCERNING THE RECENT FOREST FIRES IN GREECE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 341\n\n       Whereas more than 3,000 forest fires have been recorded in \n     Greece since June 2007;\n       Whereas over a 10-day period, an estimated 4,000 people saw \n     their homes destroyed by the wildfires, which razed dozens of \n     villages, destroyed livestock and charred an estimated \n     469,000 acres of mostly forest and farmland;\n       Whereas dozens of Greek families have lost their loved ones \n     to the fires;\n       Whereas thousands of Greeks have been left homeless and \n     hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine forest have been \n     destroyed;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of mature olive trees, \n     vineyards and thousands of animals perished in the flames;\n       Whereas damage to the Greek economy is estimated at between \n     $1,600,000,000 and $5,400,000,000;\n       Whereas the United States and Greece have stood side by \n     side in confronting world challenges throughout the 20th \n     century, and will stand together in confronting this new \n     challenge; and\n       Whereas the United States, through its government, its \n     people and its Greek-American community, has already extended \n     significant support to the people of Greece during this \n     difficult time: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends its condolences and sympathy to the Government \n     and the people of Greece for the grave loss of life and vast \n     destruction caused by the devastating fires raging through \n     Greece;\n       (2) vows its full support and solidarity to a close friend, \n     a strategic partner, and a longstanding ally in this painful \n     and difficult hour;\n       (3) fully supports the Administration's initiatives to \n     provide assistance and relief to the people of Greece, \n     including its pledge of $1,500,000 in aid as well as expert \n     and technical assistance;\n       (4) encourages public institutions, specialized agencies, \n     as well as private citizens, to offer their resources; and\n       (5) expresses confidence that Greece and its people will \n     succeed in overcoming the hardships incurred through this \n     tragedy.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution with \nmy friend and colleague Senator Menendez concerning the devastating \nseries of forest fires which ravaged much of Greece, especially in the \nPeloponnese, this past summer.\n  Beginning in June, over 3,000 forest fires raged across the cradle of \nDemocracy. Tragically, 9 people were killed in blazes in June and July, \nand 68 people lost their lives in the especially destructive fires \nbetween August 24 and September 4. The Greek economy ministry initially \nestimated that the fires caused 1.6 billion euros, or $2.2 billion of \ndamage. Subsequent assessments have placed that figure as high as $5.4 \nbillion.\n  I am proud that, more than offering its sympathy, the U.S. has also \noffered its help to the brave people and government of Greece. \nAccording to the State Department, the U.S. Government has thus far \ncontributed nearly $2 million in aid to Greece in response to the \nfires. The bulk of this aid was provided in a ``wildfire assistance \npackage'' consisting of the deployment of a technical assistance team \nwhich arrived in Greece on September 1 representing the disciplines of: \nfire management, fire investigation, emergency management systems, burn \narea emergency rehabilitation, and ecosystem and watershed restoration. \nAdditionally, the U.S. Government provided 3,000 complete fire suits \nfor the national fire brigade.\n  Americans have also stepped up to give privately to the victims of \nthese terrible fires as well. Charities organized by Greek-American \norganizations and the Orthodox Church in the U.S. have already raised \nmillions to aid the people and government of Greece in rebuilding and \nmitigating the economic loss resulting from the fires.\n  It is essential for the Senate to both recognize and pledge its \nsupport for\n\n[[Page S12442]]\n\nthese efforts, as the connection between the U.S. Congress and the \nGreek people is not limited to the Greek Americans who have served as \nmembers, or the foreign policy issues debated in its halls. Rather, the \nvery inspiration for the Congress as a legislative body are the \ndemocratic chambers of ancient Greece.\n  More recently, the U.S. and Greece stood resolutely by one another in \nconfronting the political and economic challenges of the 20th century, \nand are close partners in combating terror in these opening years of \nthe 21st century. It is imperative that we continue to stand together \nin confronting this new challenge.\n  On September 5, the House of Representatives passed a similar \nresolution to the one Senator Menendez and I have introduced today. \nThese resolutions reflect that the myriad ties between our two \ncountries, be they cultural, economic or geopolitical, comprise a bond \nthat can and should only strengthen in the wake of this devastating \ntragedy.

Con. Res. 48\n\n       Whereas, for over half a century, a close relationship has \n     existed between the United States and Taiwan, which has been \n     of enormous political, economic, cultural, and strategic \n     advantage to both countries;\n       Whereas Taiwan is one of the strongest democratic allies of \n     the United States in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas it is United States policy to support and \n     strengthen democracy around the world;\n       Whereas, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Taiwan made \n     a remarkable transition to a full-fledged democracy with a \n     vibrant economy and a vigorous multi-party political system \n     that respects human rights and the rule of law;\n       Whereas, in spite of its praise for democracy in Taiwan, \n     the United States Government continues to adhere to \n     guidelines from the 1970s that bar the President, Vice \n     President, Premier, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister of \n     Taiwan from coming to Washington, DC;\n       Whereas these restrictions deprive the President, Congress, \n     and the American public of the opportunity to engage in a \n     direct dialogue regarding developments in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and key elements of the relationship between the \n     United States and Taiwan;\n       Whereas whenever high-level visitors from Taiwan, including \n     the President, seek to come to the United States, their \n     request results in a period of complex, lengthy, and \n     humiliating negotiations;\n       Whereas lifting these restrictions will help bring a friend \n     and ally of the United States out of its isolation, which \n     will be beneficial to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific \n     region;\n       Whereas, in consideration of the major economic, security, \n     and political interests shared by the United States and \n     Taiwan, it is to the benefit of the United States for United \n     States officials to meet and communicate directly with the \n     democratically-elected officials of Taiwan;\n       Whereas since the Taiwan Strait is one of the world's \n     flashpoints in terms of global security, it is essential that \n     United States policymakers directly communicate with the \n     leaders of Taiwan; and\n\n[[Page S12443]]\n\n       Whereas section 221 of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Technical Corrections Act of 1994 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note) \n     provides that the President or other high-level officials of \n     Taiwan may visit the United States, including Washington, DC, \n     at any time to discuss a variety of important issues: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) restrictions on visits to the United States by high-\n     level elected and appointed officials of Taiwan, including \n     the democratically-elected President of Taiwan, should be \n     lifted;\n       (2) the United States should allow direct high-level \n     exchanges at the Cabinet level with the Government of Taiwan, \n     in order to strengthen a policy dialogue with Taiwan; and\n       (3) it is in the interest of the United States to \n     strengthen links between the United States and the \n     democratically-elected officials of Taiwan and demonstrate \n     stronger support for democracy in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12443-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3116.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 19, 2007, as ``National Mammography Day.'' This is \nthe 15th\n\n[[Page S12448]]\n\nstraight year I have introduced such legislation, and I am proud to say \nthat on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight \nagainst breast cancer by approving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to introduce this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2007, it is estimated that nearly 178,480 women \nwill be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 40,460 women will die \nof this disease.\n  The first several times I introduced this resolution, I commented on \nhow gloomy the statistics surrounding breast cancer were. While too \nmany of our loved ones still die from breast cancer each year, there \nare some numbers these days that give us hope in our persistent \nstruggle to defeat this disease. As I mentioned last year, the trend \nover time is that the number of deaths from breast cancer is actually \nstable or falling from year to year. According to the American Cancer \nSociety, the death rate from breast cancer in women has decreased since \n1990: between 1975-1990, the death rate increased by 0.4 percent; \nbetween 1990-2004, the death rate decreased by 2.2 percent annually.\n  This decline in the breast cancer mortality rate has been attributed \nto both improvements in breast cancer treatment as well as early \ndetection from mammograms and other screening methods. New digital \ntechniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and precise \nthan before. In addition, early detection of breast cancer continues to \nresult in extremely favorable outcomes: 98 percent of women with \nlocalized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. Government \nprograms will provide free mammograms to those who can't afford them, \nas well as Medicaid eligibility for treatment if breast cancer is \ndiagnosed. Information about treatment of breast cancer with surgery, \nchemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting enormous \nresearch advances in this disease. With all of these advances in \nresearch, screening and treatment, a diagnosis of breast cancer is not \na death sentence--all of us encounter long-term survivors of breast \ncancer almost daily, whether we realize it or not.\n  Recently, there has been discussion among scientists regarding the \nbest and most appropriate screening tool for breast cancer--traditional \nmammography or more advanced technology like magnetic resonance \nimaging, MRI. In addition, newspapers have been filled with discussions \nover whether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion \nthat periodic screening mammography saves lives. For those of us who \nare neither physicians nor scientists in this highly technical area, we \nlook to the experts. The American Cancer Society, the National Cancer \nInstitute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force all continue to \nrecommend periodic screening mammography.\n  As for mammography versus MRI's, in 2007 an expert panel convened by \nthe American Cancer Society released new recommendations for the use of \nMRI for women at increased risk for breast cancer. Essentially, the \nSociety recommended annual screening using MRI in addition to \nmammography for women at high lifetime risk, 20 to 25 percent or \ngreater of developing breast cancer. Women with moderately increased \nrisk of developing the disease, 15 to 20 percent lifetime risk, should \ndiscuss the option of adding an MRI to their annual mammogram with \ntheir physician. Women that do not fall into the high-risk or moderate-\nrisk categories for developing breast cancer have no need to supplement \ntheir mammogram with an MRI.\n  I know that some women don't have annual mammograms because of either \nfear or forgetfulness. It is only human nature for some women to avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what the test will reveal. To \nthose who are fearful, I would say that if you have periodic routine \nmammograms, and the latest one comes out positive, even before you have \nany symptoms or have found a lump on self-examination, you have reason \nto be optimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers \nare highly treatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it \nis to remember to do something that only comes around once each year. I \nwould suggest that this is where National Mammography Day comes in. On \nthat day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific date \non which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a \nchild's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are \ndue. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of \nthese dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, \nyour wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to \nget a mammogram on that date every year. Once you pick a date, call \nyour health care provider and make an appointment. If you have access \nto the internet, go the American Cancer Society's website and sign up \nfor the mammogram reminder service--they'll send you an e-mail to \nremind you about the date you picked. Do it for yourself and for the \nothers that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long \nas possible.\n  And to those women who are reluctant to have a mammogram, once again \nI say let National Mammography Day serve as a reminder to discuss this \nquestion each year with your physician. New scientific studies that are \npublished and new mammography techniques that are developed may affect \nyour decision on this matter from one year to the next. I encourage you \nto keep an open mind and not to feel that a decision at one point in \ntime commits you irrevocably to a particular course of action for the \nindefinite future.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight \nagainst breast cancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to \ndesignate October 19, 2007, as ``National Mammography Day''.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Res. 343\n\n       Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, in 2007, \n     178,480 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer \n     and 40,460 women will die from that disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States \n     are living with breast cancer, about 2,300,000 have been \n     diagnosed with the disease, and an estimated 1,000,000 do not \n     yet know they have the disease;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 36 percent greater \n     mortality rate from breast cancer than White women and more \n     than a 100 percent greater mortality rate from breast cancer \n     than women from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian \n     populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 90 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of 98 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 19, 2007, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/02/senate-section/article/S12448-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12448-S12449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION COMMAND 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 397, S.J. Res. \n13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 13) granting the consent of \n     Congress to the International Emergency Management Assistance \n     Memorandum of Understanding.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this joint resolution reflects the best \ntraditions of international cooperation between our nation and our \nCanadian neighbors to the north.\n  Formally, this joint resolution would grant the consent of Congress \nto the International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of \nUnderstanding, which allows emergency responders from the United States \nand Canada to help each other across our shared border during natural \ndisasters and other serious emergencies. But beyond this legal \nformality, this agreement reflects our longstanding cooperative \npartnership with Canada, and how, in times of emergency or natural \ndisaster, we respond together, as neighbors across a largely unguarded \nborder.\n  When our communities need help, we must join together and come to \ntheir aid, whether or not a border is drawn between us. This agreement \nallows us to honor the extraordinary tradition of international \ncooperation and good will between our nations, and will make the \ncitizens of both the United States and Canada more secure and safer.\n  We must all do our best to prepare for the most serious emergencies \nthat can harm our communities. These crises may arise from natural or \nmanmade disasters, from technological hazards, civil emergencies, or \neven terrorist events. As those who live in the Northeast know, extreme \nweather is not uncommon in New England, or in the eastern Provinces of \nCanada, and we have endured catastrophic blizzards and ice storms as \nrecently as this winter that have closed roads and highways, shut down \npower for extended periods, and stranded travelers and rural residents \nfor days, or longer. Under this agreement, first responders and \nemergency management professionals from the United States and Canada \ncan work together to provide the necessary assistance to secure public \nsafety.\n  This compact works well for New England and the eastern Canadian \nProvinces, and it stands as a model for emergency management planning \nand cooperation. It has the support of all the emergency management \ndirectors in the New England States, and the bipartisan support of all \nof the New England Senators who have joined me and Senator Snowe to \ncosponsor this resolution. It is a crucial element of the security and \nsafety planning for all communities in New England and eastern Canada.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 13) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 13\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT.\n\n       Congress consents to the International Emergency Management \n     Assistance Memorandum of Understanding entered into between \n     the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, \n     Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the Provinces of Quebec, \n     New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and \n     Newfoundland. The compact is substantially as follows:\n\n     ``Article I--International Emergency Management Assistance \n       Memorandum of Understanding Purpose and Authorities\n\n       ``The International Emergency Management Assistance \n     Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the \n     `compact,' is made and entered into by and among such of the \n     jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact, \n     hereinafter referred to as `party jurisdictions.' For the \n     purposes of this agreement, the term `jurisdictions' may \n     include any or all of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, \n     Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the \n     Provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, \n     Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and such other states and \n     provinces as may hereafter become a party to this compact.\n       ``The purpose of this compact is to provide for the \n     possibility of mutual assistance among the jurisdictions \n     entering into this compact in managing any emergency or \n     disaster when the affected jurisdiction or jurisdictions ask \n     for assistance, whether arising from natural disaster, \n     technological hazard, manmade disaster or civil emergency \n     aspects of resources shortages.\n       ``This compact also provides for the process of planning \n     mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual \n     cooperation, including, if need be, emergency-related \n     exercises, testing, or other training activities using \n     equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect \n     of the giving and receiving of aid by party jurisdictions or \n     subdivisions of party jurisdictions during emergencies, with \n     such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency \n     periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the \n     use of emergency forces by mutual agreement among party \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     ``Article II--General Implementation\n\n       ``Each party jurisdiction entering into this compact \n     recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities \n     of a party jurisdiction and that intergovernmental \n     cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each \n     jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be \n     emergencies that may require immediate access and present \n     procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and \n     effective response to such an emergency because few, if any, \n     individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in \n     all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering \n     resources to areas where emergencies exist.\n       ``The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources \n     of the participating jurisdictions, including any resources \n     on hand or available from any other source that are essential \n     to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event \n     of any emergency or disaster, shall be the underlying \n     principle on which all articles of this compact are \n     understood.\n       ``On behalf of the party jurisdictions participating in the \n     compact, the legally designated official who is assigned \n     responsibility for emergency management is responsible for \n     formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual \n     aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact, \n     and for recommendations to the jurisdiction concerned with \n     respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations, or \n     ordinances required for that purpose.\n\n     ``Article III--Party Jurisdiction Responsibilities\n\n       ``(a) Formulate Plans and Programs.--It is the \n     responsibility of each party jurisdiction to formulate \n     procedural plans and programs for inter-jurisdictional \n     cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed \n     in this section. In formulating and implementing such plans \n     and programs the party jurisdictions, to the extent \n     practical, shall--\n       ``(1) review individual jurisdiction hazards analyses that \n     are available and, to the extent reasonably possible, \n     determine all those potential emergencies the party \n     jurisdictions might jointly suffer, whether due to natural \n     disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or \n     emergency aspects of resource shortages;\n       ``(2) initiate a process to review party jurisdictions' \n     individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will \n     determine the mechanism for the inter-jurisdictional \n     cooperation;\n       ``(3) develop inter-jurisdictional procedures to fill any \n     identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies \n     or overlaps in existing or developed plans;\n       ``(4) assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing \n     jurisdictional boundaries;\n       ``(5) protect and ensure delivery of services, medicines, \n     water, food, energy and fuel,\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\n     search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services \n     and resources, both human and material to the extent \n     authorized by law;\n       ``(6) inventory and agree upon procedures for the inter-\n     jurisdictional loan and delivery of human and material \n     resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or \n     forgiveness; and\n       ``(7) provide, to the extent authorized by law, for \n     temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances, over \n     which the province or state has jurisdiction, that impede the \n     implementation of the responsibilities described in this \n     subsection.\n       ``(b) Request Assistance.--The authorized representative of \n     a party jurisdiction may request assistance of another party \n     jurisdiction by contacting the authorized representative of \n     that jurisdiction.
