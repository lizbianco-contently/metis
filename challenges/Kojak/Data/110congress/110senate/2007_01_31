Mr. President, we will be in a period for the transaction \nof morning business for 60 minutes. The first half is under the control \nof the Republicans, the second half under the control of Senator Wyden. \nFollowing morning business, we will resume H.R. 2, the minimum wage \nbill.\n  As I indicated in closing yesterday, we expect Senator Kyl to be here \nthis morning when we resume the bill. I understand a number of \nconversations have taken place among Senators Baucus, Grassley, Kyl, \nand Kennedy regarding these amendments. It is anticipated once we are \nback on the bill there will be debate with respect to one or more of \nthe Kyl amendments and that a vote in relation to an amendment could \noccur sometime around noon today.\n  Once we have completed action on all the amendments, then it is my \nhope that we can yield back all the time postcloture and then dispose \nof the substitute amendment. If we have to run the full 30 hours on the \nsubstitute, I think I am correct in stating that the 30 hours would \nexpire at about 6:40 this evening, cloture having been invoked \nyesterday at about 12:40 p.m. Of course, once all that time has expired \nor been yielded back and the substitute has been disposed of, cloture \non the bill would occur immediately and automatically.\n  Mr. President, just a couple of comments. When we complete the debate \non minimum wage and the bill is completed, we move to Iraq, and that \nis, as we know, a very contentious issue. But as the distinguished \nRepublican leader last night stated, we are trying to arrive at a point \nwhere we can have a good, strong debate. It will take cooperation, it \nwill take compromise so we can be in a position to have this debate so \nall Senators can voice their opinion and, hopefully, we can settle on a \nfinite number of pieces of legislation to vote on. That is my goal, and \nI hope we can do that. Certainly the American people deserve this \ndebate.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid pertaining to the introduction of S. 439 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REID.

We\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\nprobably will be able to get to final passage tomorrow.\n  And then, as the majority leader indicated, he and I have had \nextensive discussions about crafting the various proposals, how many we \nare going to have on each side to address the most important issue in \nthe country right now, which is the Iraq war, and that debate, of \ncourse, will occur next week.

As I told the \ndistinguished Republican leader and as we have announced on a number of \noccasions, we had our retreat, and the Republicans certainly cooperated \nwith us, and we are going to cooperate with them. These retreats are \nextremely important to this body. They allow us to enhance the \npolitical parties within this great Senate and focus on what is good \nfor the country. We have done that, and the Republicans are going to do \nthat the day after tomorrow, and I think that is important.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be a period for the transaction of morning business for up to 60 \nminutes with each Senator permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes with \nthe first half of the time under the control of the minority and the \nsecond half of the time under the control of the Senator from Oregon, \nMr. Wyden.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss the Iraqi \nsituation. Not the shootings and explosions we see in the streets of \nBaghdad and in al Anbar Province, but the struggle were currently \nengaged in right here in the Senate.\n  This latter battle is arguably more important to our long-term \nnational security than any other issue we face today.\n  While everyone remembers the tragedy of 9/11, the pain and anguish \nexperienced by Americans that day appears to have faded over time for \nan ever increasing number of our citizens.\n  For me, it remains as vivid and as gut wrenching today as it was that \nSeptember morning more than 5 years ago.\n  It seems too easy these days to point fingers of blame at one another \nfor our current situation in Iraq.\n  I could stand here today and recite quote after quote from Members on \nboth sides of the aisle who were certain that Saddam Hussein possessed \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Hussein and his Baathist regime had ruled Iraq as a personal fiefdom \nfor more than 30 years.\n  There is no arguing that Hussein was personally responsible for the \nbrutal deaths of hundreds of thousands of his own citizens, invaded two \nof his neighbors, supported worldwide terrorism, and violated 17 \nseparate United Nations resolutions aimed at curtailing his WMD \nprograms.\n  Seventy-seven Senators voted to give President Bush the authority to \nact.\n  With the clear authority from Congress to undertake military \noperations against Saddam Hussein, President Bush tried long and hard \nto seek a peaceful resolution. Saddam Hussein could not be reasoned \nwith.\n  Following 9/11 and in an age of nuclear bombs and other weapons of \nmass destruction, we could no longer afford to sit by and wait on those \nwanting to do us harm to land the first punch.\n  We could not wait until we were attacked before acting. Calls for the \nPresident to act in order to protect America were loud and clear. And \nthe President did act.\n  In doing so, Saddam Hussein's regime was eliminated and some 28 \nmillion Iraqis were freed from a living hell on Earth.\n  Watching the Iraqis struggle since then to establish their own \ndemocracy has not been a pretty sight.\n  With the luxury of hindsight, it's no secret that serious mistakes \nwere made; too few troops; de-baathification of the Iraqi government \nand; failure of Federal Departments other than Defense to be fully \nengaged in this effort, to name a few.\n  We need to face the fact that we are in Iraq. We need to ask \nourselves what do we do now.\n  Do we pack up and leave, even though every voice of reason tells us \nthat Iraq would implode into a terrorist state used by al-Qaida as a \nlaunching pad against the ``infidels''; reminiscent of Afghanistan \nunder the Taliban?\n  As Senator McCain has reminded us time and again, Iraq is not \nVietnam. When we left South Vietnam, the Viet Cong did not pursue us \nback to our shores. . .\n  Al-Qaida is not the Viet Cong. Al-Qaida has sworn to destroy us and \nis committed to bringing their brand of terror to America.\n  This fact was evidenced recently during testimony by Lieutenant \nGeneral Maples, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  He testified that documents captured by coalition forces during a \nraid of a safe house believed to house Iraqi members of al-Qaida 6 \nmonths ago revealed al-Qaida was planning terrorist operations in the \nU.S. Anyone willing to go to Iraq to fight Americans is probably \nwilling to travel to America.\n  Do we pass meaningless resolutions that mandate unconstitutional caps \non the number of troops deployed to Iraq?\n  I am not a military strategist, so I rely on the opinion of experts \nto educate me.\n  General Petraeus, the new commander of the Iraqi Multi-National \nCoalition and author of the Army's new Counter Insurgency Manual, told \nme that he could not succeed in providing security for the citizens of \nBaghdad and al Anbar Province without the additional troops called for \nin the President's plan.\n  Do we allow the President the ability to adjust those troop numbers \nin an effort to bring security to Baghdad and al Anbar Province?\n  From what I see, the President has the only plan on the table that \ndoesn't ensure defeat. It may not be a perfect plan, and it may need to \nbe adjusted in the near term, but it is certainly a change from what \nwe've been doing so far.\n  One particular area that I believe needs improvement is our \nreconstruction effort.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service the United States has \nspent over $35.6 billion on reconstruction efforts.\n  We have to stop squandering our resources on reconstruction projects \nin Iraq that fail to deliver basic security and critical \ninfrastructure.\n  A recent article in the Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding \ntalked of the need to abandon a scattergun approach to reconstruction \nwhich focuses on winning hearts and minds and results in many \nnonessential projects being started but not completed.\n  I believe that we need to have what the author called a triage \napproach to reconstruction. The military calls it SWEAT: sewage, water, \nelectricity and trash.\n  Let's focus on getting these essential services operating at the \nlevel they were before we invaded Iraq. This approach will undoubtedly \nmake our military effort easier.\n  Our efforts to improve fundamental services up to this point have not \nreceived the focus and attention they deserve.\n  We have fallen short in the area of electricity production. Before we \ninvaded Iraq, electric power was 95,600 megawatt hours; now, it is \nclose to 90,000 megawatt hours. The goal was originally 120,000 \nmegawatt hours.\n  In Baghdad, Iraqis receive about three fewer hours of electricity \nthan before the war. Outside of Baghdad they do receive more, but we \nknow most of the problems are in Baghdad. CRS notes that of 425 \nprojects planned in the electricity sector, only 300 will be completed.\n  We have done somewhat better in assistance with water and sanitation.\n  We have provided clean water to 4.6 million more people and \nsanitation to 5.1 million more than before the war. But besides water, \nsanitation, and\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nelectricity we know that Iraq needs a functioning oil sector.\n  Revenues from oil are necessary to fund government services, \nincluding security and maintain infrastructure. According to CRS, oil \nand gas production has remained stagnant and below pre-war levels for \nsome time.\n  The pre-war level of oil production was 2.5 million barrels per day; \nit currently stands at 2.0 million barrels per day.\n  That is far below the 3.0 million barrels per day we were told Iraq \nwas expected to reach by end of 2004. According to the Special \nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, besides the destruction \ncaused by the insurgents, poor infrastructure, corruption, and \ndifficulty maintaining and operating U.S.-funded projects are \nchallenges faced by the industry.\n  We are at a pivotal point in this Nation's history.\n  We face an enemy unlike anything ever witnessed before. We cannot \nwash our hands of the responsibility incumbent upon us as the leader of \nthe free world.\n  It is time to join together, forgetting whether we are Republicans, \nwhether we are Democrats, remembering we are Americans. It is time to \ncome together behind our men and women in uniform, figure out what the \nbest strategies are, and move forward together. It used to be said that \npartisanship stopped at our shore's edge. We need to go back to that \nspirit of being Americans. We cannot afford to fail in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I, too, rise today on the Senate floor to \ndiscuss the very serious issue of Iraq and how we move forward there to \neventually get our troops home. I have been in the Senate 2 years. \nBefore that, I was in the House for 5 years. That is a relatively short \namount of time, but I daresay I believe, as do many of my colleagues \nwho have been here 20 or 30 years, this truly is one of the most \nimportant issues we will ever debate and have an impact on. In fact, \neven for a career that long, it may be the single most important issue \nwe will debate and have an impact on.\n  I hope all of us take that to heart. Don't say it as a truism but \nunderstand what that means and what it demands of us. What it demands \nof us is that we act responsibly and whatever our feelings and point of \nview, we put them forward in a responsible way for the good of America.\n  What do I mean by that? I primarily mean two things. First of all, \neach of us as Senators has the right to oppose a plan, including the \nPresident's plan. I will be the first to say that. I will be the first \nto defend my colleagues' right to oppose any plan, including the \nPresident's plan. But along with that right comes responsibility, and \neach of us also has a responsibility to be for a plan to move forward \nin Iraq. It does not need to be the President's plan, but we sure as \nheck have a responsibility to be for some coherent plan, in some level \nof detail. How do we move forward in Iraq for the good of the country, \nfor our security, and for stability in the Middle East?\n  Second, what being responsible means is taking to the Senate floor to \nimpact policy, to take action but not simply to offer words that have \nno impact in the real world but only serve to undercut the morale and \nfocus of our troops and to embolden the enemy. Some resolutions, which \nare mere words--they don't constrain any activity of the President or \nof our troops--I think have that unintended result. They do not limit \ntroops, they do not limit troop numbers, but they sure as heck destroy \nmorale. They certainly embolden the enemy. Don't believe me about that \njudgment. Turn to very respected military leaders, including GEN David \nPetraeus, who said that directly, frankly, in his testimony before \nSenate committees.\n  I have been guided by that responsibility, to face the issues \nsquarely, to be responsible, to be for some plan--not necessarily the \nPresident's but some real, detailed plan; to take action on the Senate \nfloor and not float words which can have negative consequences for our \ntroops and also embolden the enemy.\n  After a lot of thought and in that context and after a lot of careful \nstudy, including many hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on which I sit, I have decided to support the President's \nplan as a reasonable attempt to move forward--indeed, as a final \nattempt to stabilize the situation. But I have also decided to do it in \nthe context of three very strong recommendations which I have made many \ntimes directly to the President and to other key advisers, such as \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice, such as the President's National \nSecurity Adviser, Steve Hadley, and others. Those three strong, clear \nrecommendations are as follows:\n  No. 1, I do believe, with the Iraq Study Group and others, we need to \nput even more emphasis on a diplomatic effort and, in my opinion, that \nshould be to encourage and embrace and participate in a regional \ndiplomatic conference that involves all of Iraq's neighbors, including \nIran and Syria. This would be very different from direct bilateral \ntalks with either Iran or Syria. With regard to that push, I disagree \nwith that, including, to some extent, the Iraq Study Group. But I do \nthink a regional conference focussed specifically and exclusively on \nstabilizing Iraq, promoting democracy in Iraq, would be very positive.\n  No. 2, I agree with many that we can be even stronger, clearer, \nfirmer about benchmarks for the Iraqi Government and consequences if \nthe Iraqi Government does not meet those benchmarks. President Bush has \ntalked a lot about what are clear benchmarks, but I have encouraged him \nto go even further, be even more direct and clear, including in public, \nabout those benchmarks. Those would be things such as the Iraqis \ncontinuing to take clear, strong action against all who promote \nviolence, whether they are Sunni or Shia or anyone else; things such as \nan oil revenue law that must be passed in the very near term; things \nsuch as major reform of the debaathification process, which has stirred \nup enormous sectarian conflict and hatred, particularly from the Shia \nand Sunnis.\n  Third, I have been very clear in saying over and over and over that \nwe must constantly reexamine these new troop numbers to make sure they \ncan have a meaningful impact on the ground in the short term. I am for \ntrying this as a final attempt, but I am not for throwing too little \ntoo late at the effort.\n  I respect the judgment of military leaders such as GEN David \nPetraeus. I take them at their word, and I respect their judgment that \nthis additional 21,500, coupled with redeployment and reemphasis of \ntroops already in theater, is enough, but I think we have to constantly \nexamine that to make sure we don't make the mistake we have made in the \npast, which is underestimating troop need.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the Iraq Study Group report, \nfor good reason. A lot of leading citizens contributed very thoughtful \nanalysis to that report. But I think far too much of that discussion \nhas unfairly portrayed the President's plan and different versions of \nit, like what I am talking about, as in stark contrast to the Iraq \nStudy Group report. In fact, I don't believe that to be the case at \nall. It is not exactly the Iraq Study Group report. It is different, \nbut it has enormous areas of overlap.\n  With regard to political solutions that have to happen lead by Iraqis \non the ground in Iraq, there is enormous agreement between what I am \nsupporting, what the President is describing, and the Iraq Study Group \nreport. With regard to a diplomatic initiative, there is enormous \noverlap between what I am pushing in terms of a regional diplomatic \nconference involving all of Iraq's neighbors and what the Iraq Study \nGroup discusses. Yes, they seem to favor direct bilateral talks with \ncountries such as Iran and Syria. I do not and the President does not. \nBut there is still enormous overlap and agreement on things we can do \nvery proactively and aggressively on the diplomatic front.\n  Even on the military component there is great overlap and significant \nagreement. In that regard I would simply point to one very important \npassage on page 73 which states clearly, discussing military troop \nlevels and numbers:\n\n       We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or \n     surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to \n     speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S.\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\n     commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be \n     effective.\n\n  Well, of course, the new U.S. commander of Iraq is GEN David \nPetraeus, and he has suggested and asked for exactly that, which is why \nit is significant in the President's plan.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to give this issue serious thought, to \nbe responsible, to advocate whatever is in their heart and in their \nmind but to do it responsibly. Support some plan, and do not throw out \nmere words that have no concrete effect except undermining our troops \nand emboldening the enemy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments we have heard \nthis morning from the distinguished Senator from Nevada and the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, and I couldn't agree more with \nthe comments they have made. I would like to add some, perhaps, even \nmore eloquent words--and rest assured they are not mine--to this debate \nbecause I think it helps us understand in a way that we might not \notherwise understand what is at stake and what the people who are most \ndirectly impacted believe is at stake in the war on terror, \nparticularly the conflict in Iraq.\n  I first want to quote the words of Roy Velez. Roy is from Lubbock, \nTX, and has lost two sons--one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. \nRecently, Roy Velez said:\n\n       It is not about President Bush. It is not about being a \n     Democrat or a Republican. It is about standing behind a \n     country that we love so much. I know it has cost us a lot in \n     lives, including my two sons, and it has taken a toll on \n     America. But we can't walk away from this war until we're \n     finished.\n\n  I don't know anyone who has earned the right to speak so directly to \nwhat is at stake, the sacrifices that have been made, and the \nconsequences of our leaving Iraq before it is stabilized and able to \ngovern and defend itself.\n  Then there is also the story of 2LT Mark J. Daily. Lieutenant Daily \nwas 23 years old from Irvine, CA. He was with the 4th Brigade Combat \nTeam, 1st Cavalry Division out of Fort Bliss, TX. Lieutenant Daily was \nkilled on January 15 when an improvised explosive device exploded and \nripped through his vehicle, taking his life and those of three fellow \nsoldiers. Mark had been, as so many of our military have done, keeping \nin touch with his family via e-mail, and he maintained a blog on the \npopular My Space Web site. In that blog, Mark specifically explained \nwhy he joined, and this is what he wrote:\n\n       Why I joined: This question has been asked of me so many \n     times in so many different contexts that I thought it would \n     be best if I wrote my reasons for joining the Army on my page \n     for all to see. First, the more accurate question is why I \n     volunteered to go to Iraq. After all, I joined the Army a \n     week after we declared war on Saddam's government with the \n     intention of going to Iraq. Now, after years of training and \n     preparation, I am finally here. Much has changed in the last \n     three years. The criminal Baath regime has been replaced by \n     an insurgency fueled by Iraq's neighbors who hope to \n     partition Iraq for their own ends. This is coupled with the \n     ever-present transnational militant Islamist movement which \n     has seized upon Iraq as the greatest way to kill Americans, \n     along with anyone else who happens to be standing near. What \n     was once a paralyzed state of fear is now the staging area \n     for one of the largest transformations of power and ideology \n     the Middle East has experienced since the collapse of the \n     Ottoman Empire.\n\n  I would say in closing that we can't claim to support the troops and \nnot support their mission. If we don't support the mission, we should \nnot pass nonbinding resolutions. We should do everything within our \npower to stop it. I do believe that we should support that mission. I \ndo believe we should support our troops. That is why I believe we \nshould send them the message that, yes, we believe you can succeed, and \nit is important to our national security that you do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator from Texas, and I would like to add \nmy comments to his. We are certainly discussing probably one of the \nmost deadly serious issues that I have been a part of since being in \nthe Congress. I must start by expressing my respect for the Senators \nwho are proposing this resolution. I know their intent is good. They \nhave heartfelt concerns about what we are doing.\n  But what I would like to do is remind all of us that our role is a \nrole of being leaders, not just being critics. As elected officials, we \nknow what it is like to have critics second-guess all the decisions we \nmake, but our job as Senators is to be leaders; and to be leaders, we \nhave to make good decisions. If we make good decisions, we have to know \nwhat our real choices are. I am afraid those who are proposing this \nresolution are not considering the real choices because we can keep the \nstatus quo, we can withdraw and be defeated, or we can continue until \nwe win and accomplish our goals in Iraq.\n  This resolution is a resolution of defeat and disgrace. There is no \nother way it could come out. That is the choice they are making. That \nis the decision they are making because we know if we withdraw and \nleave this to the Iraqis when they are not ready, we will lose all. Not \nonly will we be disgraced as a nation, but we will have probably the \nbiggest catastrophe--human catastrophe as well as political \ncatastrophe--in the Middle East that is going to occur. We have to \ndiscuss the real implications of that choice.\n  I oppose this resolution because it does not support our mission, it \ndoes not support success, and it makes the decision for defeat. Real \nleaders would come up with a plan of action that they follow through \non. And whether we agree with the President or not, he has put a plan \non the table and he intends to follow through on it with all the advice \nhe can get from his military people. Our role is not just to criticize \nthat, but if we don't agree, it is to come up with another plan, \npropose it, and our responsibility is to sell it to the American \npeople--not just to criticize, not to come up with resolutions that \ndon't mean anything, intended to embarrass the President. But what it \nreally does is deteriorate the morale of our troops.\n  I know we are frustrated with this war, and the fear of failure is \nall around us. But we cannot digress into being critics in this body. \nOur job is to lead.\n  I want to conclude this morning with some comments from the soldiers. \nI know other Senators have called parents who have soldier sons and \ndaughters who have been killed. I have not had one who told me to get \nout of Iraq. I have had a lot of them tell me: Win. That is how to \nhonor the sacrifice is to win.\n  SPC Peter Manna:\n\n       If they don't think we're doing a good job, everything we \n     have done here is all in vain.\n\n  We have a number of these, but I don't have time to read them all.\n  SGT Manuel Sahagun said:\n\n       One thing I don't like is when people back home say they \n     support the troops but they don't support the war. If they're \n     going to support us, support us all the way.\n\n  Americans are not against this war; they are against losing. They \nneed to know we can win it.\n  General Petraeus, the best general that we have, whom we have just \napproved, confirmed in the Senate, has told us that we can succeed with \nthe President's plan. This is our last best hope to leave Iraq as a \nfree democracy and to help stabilize the Middle East. The other choice \nis defeat and disgrace.\n  Mr. President, I call on all of my Senate colleagues not to support \nthis resolution and to act as leaders: to put forward a plan or support \nthe one that the President has put forward.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I believe I have \ntime reserved at this point. I was going to speak for a little over 20 \nminutes or so. I would like to inquire through the Chair of my \ncolleagues if they wish to finish their remarks before I go to mine.\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in response to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon, I believe our morning business time has expired and we \nwould yield back any remaining time so the Senator from Oregon can \nbegin his remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, it is not breaking news that the American \nhealth care system is broken, even though our country has scores of \ndedicated and talented health care providers. It isn't breaking news \nthat Congress has ducked fixing health care since 1994.\n\n  What should be breaking news is that for the first time in decades \nthere is a genuine opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work \ntogether to fix American health care.\n  A few days ago in his State of the Union Address, the President put \nforward a health care reform proposal that focuses on changing the \nFederal Tax Code. Since then, leading Democratic and Republican \neconomists have joined forces to point out how Federal health care tax \nrules benefit the most affluent among us, and subsidize inefficiency as \nwell.\n  For example, right now under the Federal Tax Code, a high-flying CEO \ncan write off the cost on their Federal taxes of going out and getting \na designer smile while a hard-working gal in a small hardware store in \nMontana, Oregon, or anywhere else in the country, gets virtually \nnothing.\n  I am of the view that Democrats and Republicans should work together \nto change this inequity and make sure that all of our citizens have \naffordable, quality, private health care coverage with private sector \nchoices--the way Members of Congress do.\n  The Federal Tax Code and its policies have disproportionately \nrewarded the affluent. They came about because of what happened in the \n1940s when there were wage and price controls. These policies might \nhave worked for the 1940s, but they are clearly not right 60 years \nlater. Democrats and Republicans can work together to change the \nFederal tax rules that grease the system and disproportionally reward \nthe most affluent and subsidize inefficiency.\n  In return for those on the Democratic side of the aisle supporting a \nchange in Federal health tax rules and coverage through private sector \nchoices, the President and Republicans should join with Democrats and \nindependent health experts of all political philosophies who say to fix \nhealth care we have to cover everybody for essential benefits. What is \nvery clear now on health care is if we do not cover everybody--and not \nfor Cadillac coverage, but for the essentials--our country will always \nhave a health care system where those who have no coverage have their \ncosts transferred to people who do have coverage. Every night in \nMontana, Oregon, and elsewhere in our country we have folks in hospital \nemergency rooms because they have not been able to get good outpatient \nhealth care, and the costs for folks in hospital emergency rooms who \ncannot pay get transferred to people who can pay. Many health care \nexperts have theorized that perhaps up to 20 percent of the premium \npaid by people who have coverage is because of the costs for caring for \nthose without coverage.\n  At this point in the debate, Democrats can say that Federal tax rules \nare inequitable with respect to health care and we can use private \nsector choices. My hope is Republicans will say to fix health care we \nhave to have a system that covers everybody. Democrats and Republicans \ncan come together to make that case.\n  There are other areas where we can find common ground right now \nbetween the political parties on health care. For example, Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate think we ought to give a broad berth to \nthe States to innovate in the health care area. Surely what works in \nthe State of Montana may not necessarily work in Florida, Iowa, or New \nYork. They say, ``Let's give a broad berth to the States to show \ninnovative approaches.'' Particularly Governor Schwarzenegger and \nGovernor Romney deserve a lot of credit for being willing to lead at \nthe State level. In my State, folks have some innovative ideas, as \nwell. My guess is they do in Montana, elsewhere. We can take steps to \npromote them. I personally don't think the States can do it all because \nthe States cannot solve problems they did not create. That is why we \nneed to change the Federal health care tax rules. Because of the \nfederal tax rules, the Federal Government is the big spender in health \ncare. The States cannot do a lot about that. But surely, as part of the \neffort to bring Democrats and Republicans together, we can agree to \nmake changes in the Federal health care tax care rules and we can agree \nto get everyone covered. We can also agree there is a lot of common \nground between Democrats and Republicans, to give States the \nopportunity to innovate.\n  Democrats and Republicans, as we look at the possibility of a \ncoalition, can join together so we have health care rather than sick \ncare. We do not do a lot to promote wellness and prevention in this \ncountry. Medicare shows that better than anything else. Medicare Part A \nwill pay checks for thousands and thousands of dollars of hospital \nexpenses. Medicare Part B, on the other hand, the part for outpatient \nservices, hardly does anything to reward prevention and wellness. You \ncan not even get a break on your premium--the Part B premium, they call \nit--if you help to hold down your blood pressure, cholesterol, stop \nsmoking, and that sort of thing. Surely Democrats and Republicans can \njoin hands to do more to promote prevention, and to have incentives for \nparents, for example, to get their kids involved in wellness.\n  This would not be some kind of national nanny program where we have \nthe Federal Government saying, we are going to watch the chip bowl, but \nsensible prevention policies on which Democrats and Republicans can \nagree.\n  It also seems to me that Democrats and Republicans can join hands \nwith respect to chronic health care and end of life health care. We \nknow in the Medicare Program close to 5 percent of the people take \nabout 50 percent of the health care dollars because those folks need \nchronic care and because of spending at the end of life. They need \ncompassionate health care. We have not thought through policies that \ncan bring both Democrats and Republicans together to deal with this \narea of health care where an enormous amount of the money is going.\n\n  For example, to get Medicare's hospice benefits, right now seniors \nhave to choose whether they are going to get curative care or hospice \ncare. That makes no sense at all. Why should a senior have to give up \nthe prospects of getting a cure for their particular illness in order \nto get hospice benefit? Let's not pit the hospice benefit against \ncurative care. Let's have Democrats and Republicans work together in \norder to make changes that expand the options available for older \npeople.\n  The door is open right now. The State of the Union gave new \nvisibility to the health care cause. Democrats, such as myself, who \nserve on the Committee on Finance, who will say these Federal health \ncare tax rules are inequitable, can join hands with Republicans who \nwill say we need to cover everybody and stop the cost shifting. The \ndoor is open right now if Democrats and Republicans will work together \nin a bipartisan basis.\n  Some people are saying it can't be done. They are saying there is too \nmuch polarization on health care and other big issues. Let's talk about \nit, once again, when there is a Presidential campaign. I send a clear \nmessage on that point, as well. Of course, this country can put off \nfixing health care once more, as it has done again and again for 60 \nyears--going back to Harry Truman in the 81st Congress. It was 1945 \nwhen he began to talk about fixing health care. I guess one can argue, \nlet's put it off again and have another Presidential campaign where \npeople go back and forth on this issue. However, I submit that whoever \nthe new President is in 2009--and I am very excited about our \nDemocratic candidates--no matter who is the new President--should \naddress this issue. However if, heaven forbid, there is a terrorist \nattack early in the new Administration, health care would get put\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\noff once more. Perhaps we would go for several more years without \ntalking about health care reform.\n  We have had people working to fix health care in this country for \nyears and years, people on both sides of the aisle. On our side of the \naisle, we have Senator Kennedy. No one has championed the cause of \nfixing health care for as many years as passionately as Senator \nKennedy. Republicans have worked very hard for health care reform, as \nwell.\n  I hope this question of health care reform is not somehow deferred \nonce again until 2009. There is a broad consensus of what needs to be \ndone. I outlined four or five areas this morning, starting with \nchanging the Federal health care tax rules and making sure there are \ngood private sector choices for Americans, getting everyone covered, \nand emphasizing prevention and wellness. That alone would be a good \nbasis for Democrats and Republicans to start in. Clearly, a system that \nwas created in the 1940s ought to be modernized in 2007. As I pointed \nout, the system that came about in the 1940s was a historical accident. \nThere were wage and price controls and there was no way to get health \ncare to working families other than to say, maybe the employers will \ncover it.\n  Today our businesses are up against global competitors that have \ntheir governments pick up their health care bill. The combination of \nthe disadvantage our businesses face, the huge escalation of costs, the \nsignificant increase in chronic illness, and our rapidly aging \npopulation means the current system is not sustainable. It is not \nsustainable and that is why we need to act.\n  I am so pleased to see the Presiding Officer in the chair, a new \nSenator from Montana, who has lots of good ideas on health care and has \ncampaigned on them. I know he and many on both sides of the aisle want \nto fix the system. That is what we got an election certificate to do, \nto work together on the most important issues, not put it off for \nanother couple of years and have another Presidential campaign. We need \nto sort it out right now.\n  The American people know we ought to have a new focus, on prevention \nrather than sick care. We can work on that now. The American people \nknow a lot of the States have innovative approaches. We can help them \nbuild on it. The American people know the tax system in the health care \narea disproportionately favors the most affluent and does not give a \nbreak to the working person and it ought to be changed. These are the \nreasons why both sides ought to join hands to do that.\n  The time to fix health care is now. There are a variety of proposals \nthat have been put before the Congress. I have not even mentioned my \nlegislation this morning, the Healthy Americans Act, based on many of \nthe principles I have discussed today. I am not wedded to every \nprovision or every part of it. It is a piece of legislation that can \nbring folks together. When I introduced it, Andy Stern, the president \nof the Service Employees International Union, 1.8 million members, was \nthere, but so was Steve Burd, the CEO of Safeway, with over 200,000 \nemployees. So was Bob Beall, the CEO of a company with 400 people. So \nwas a member of the National Federation of Independent Businesses who \nwas from Oregon. He spoke for himself, not for the group. He employs \neight people. All of these employers said that the legislation would \nwork for them.\n  Now it is up to us in the Senate. It is up to us, with the door open, \nto get Democrats and Republicans to come together. I certainly have not \nagreed with all the details of the President's proposal, but he has \ngiven some new visibility to the cause. All sides ought to say, let's \nget going, let's not wait for another campaign for President to go \nforward. Let us do our job now. There is much to work with that can \nbring both political parties together to fix American health care.\n  I will be spending a lot of my waking hours on that in the days \nahead. I look forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate to get it done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 209\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are at least two--and I believe only \ntwo--amendments that will be pending that are germane postcloture to be \nconsidered. The first of those is my amendment No. 209. I will speak to \nthat at this point and then will continue the debate after some other \nbusiness has been conducted.\n  Amendment No. 209 to the substitute is an amendment to the Baucus \nFinance Committee amendment which has been agreed to by the Senate. I \nwill describe the background of that amendment and then the \njustification for it.\n  Under current law, small businesses can expense $100,000 of qualified \nbusiness investments in the first year that the property is placed into \nservice. Because the level is indexed for inflation, the 2007 expensing \nlimit is $112,000. But after 2009, the expensing limit drops back down \nto $25,000 a year, clearly an insufficient amount. Recognizing this, \nthe Baucus Finance Committee amendment would extend the increased \nexpensing levels through 2010. That is only a 1-year extension. \nAmendment No. 209 extends it through 2012, which is the same period of \ntime that the work opportunity tax credit has been extended under the \nFinance Committee amendment. Section 179 of the Tax Code, which allows \nsmall businesses to elect to deduct all or part of the cost of certain \nqualifying property the year that it is placed into service, would work \nthrough the year 2012 rather than 2010, as under the Finance bill.\n  We know that this immediate expensing has been critical to supporting \neconomic growth. We, also, know that small businesses account for about \n60 percent of the cost that is imposed as a result of the increase in \nthe minimum wage that is in the underlying bill. As a way to try to \nhelp small businesses overcome the costs we are imposing on them, we \nhave talked to them. They are pretty unanimous in the view that the one \nthing we could do that best helps them be able to afford this is to \nextend the small business expensing under section 179.\n  The reason we need to extend it a longer period of time is because of \nthe certainty they need. When they are planning on making improvements \nto their business and they know they can expense that when they put \nthat improvement in place, in force, then they will proceed to do what \nis in the economic best interest of their business. But if their plans \nare restrained by the Tax Code, then we are not enabling them to \nfulfill their fullest potential in making the business decisions that \ncreate jobs. The key of this particular program is that it is a job \ncreator. That is why almost all of us would like to see this extended \nas far as we can. I don't think there is any real dispute about that. \nAs I said, the Kyl amendment to the Baucus substitute would simply \nextend this increased small business expensing through the year 2012, \nthe same extension as is given the work opportunity tax credit.\n  For the sake of illustration, you can see that on this chart, the \nwork opportunity tax credit is extended through the year 2012, and as a \nresult of the Finance Committee bill into 2013. The other expensing \nprovisions or depreciation provisions that were in the Finance \nCommittee bill are only extended through the end of the first quarter \nof next year, except for section 179, which currently goes through the \nend of 2009, and the Finance Committee bill takes it through 2010.\n  What this amendment would do is take it through 2012, the same period \nas the work opportunity tax credit under the Finance Committee bill.\n\n  The chairman of the committee argues that the small business tax \nrelief package should be balanced between the expensing and \ndepreciation provisions and the work opportunity tax credit. As I \nnoted, that is extended for 5 years, while section 179 is extended for \nonly 1 year. Small business expensing has always enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support. I don't think there is any reason now to treat this \nissue as a political issue or a partisan issue and to try to put it in \ncompetition with the work opportunity tax credit. They can move forward \ntogether.\n  That is especially the case because section 179, unlike the work \nopportunity tax credit, is targeted at small businesses. Not only is \nexpensing limited to $112,000, but current law actually reduces that \namount for property that costs over $400,000, which is also indexed. \nMeaning that section 179 is simply not useful to large businesses that \nare in the business of purchasing things for far more than $400,000. \nBut we know, in pure dollar terms, the work opportunity tax credit \nprimarily benefits larger businesses. In fact, testimony before the \nFinance Committee was that 95 percent of the credits go to either C or \nS corporations. Since the bulk of the cost of imposing the minimum wage \nis on small businesses, since section 179 expensing is the primary way \nwe can help small businesses, and since the value of the work \nopportunity tax credit primarily helps the bigger businesses, it seems \nto us that the proper balance is to extend both of them through 2012, \nand section 179, under our amendment, would be brought to that point.\n  One more word about the investments that small business makes because \nthis is instructive. According to the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, 63 percent of small business owners will make \ncapital improvements over any 6-month period, and this could include \nacquiring new equipment, buying new vehicles, new furniture, expanding \nexisting facilities, maybe even buying a new facility. They need to \nacquire new equipment and facilities to expand their businesses and \ncreate jobs. That is the point of section 179. It enables job creation. \nThat is probably the best antidote to the cost imposed by increasing \nthe minimum wage.\n  As many experts have pointed out, one of the fallouts from increasing \nthe minimum wage is that some smaller businesses simply hire fewer \npeople. Some even reduce the number of hours their entry-level workers \nwork or even lay people off. The benefit of section 179 that everyone \nhas recognized is it enables the small businesses to grow, to create \njobs, and, therefore, the potential downside of increasing the minimum \nwage is offset, in effect, and never occurs because the jobs are \ncreated by virtue of section 179 and other benefits.\n  Everybody recognizes that allowing first-year expensing is what makes \nit easier for small businesses to make investments. Business income is \noverstated because we require businesses to depreciate investments over \na period of time instead of deducting the entire cost all at once. But \nthe business must buy an entire machine or building all\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nat once, which ties up funds that otherwise would be available to earn \nincome. So allowing the immediate expensing of the $112,000 worth of \nbusiness investment frees up funds that small business owners can use \nto grow their businesses, and those owners are likely to reinvest the \nmoney back into their business because they are entrepreneurs. This \nincreased business investment benefits the entire economy. It is the \njob creator.\n  Small business represents 99.7 percent of all employers. It employs \nover half the private sector employees. They pay 44.3 percent of the \ntotal U.S. private payroll. This is a very big factor in our economy. \nSmall businesses generate 60 to 80 percent of the net new jobs, \naccording to statistics over the last decade, and create more than 50 \npercent of nonfarm private gross domestic income. Extending the \nincreased limits through 2012 will provide greater stability for these \nsmall business owners. The best answer is to actually make the \nincreases permanent, but that is not what this amendment does. It \nextends it to the same period of time that the work opportunity tax \ncredit is.\n  Most people would recognize that this is wise, that it is good \npolicy, and that my amendment, therefore, takes us a substantial step \nin the right direction.\n  The question before was whether the budget would require that there \nbe a separate so-called pay-for, a permanent tax increase that would \noffset the cost of this temporary tax extension. There have been \nvarious types of pay-go since the statutory pay-go was enacted in 1990. \nThe point of order was enacted in 1993. Statutory pay-go, which expired \nin 2002, was enforced by OMB, but Congress always enacted legislation \nto avert it. But contrary to popular belief, the Senate has a pay-go \nrule in effect right now. It was first created in 2003. The current \npay-go rule provides a 60-vote point of order against any new mandatory \nspending or new tax cuts that exceed specified levels. This is called \nthe pay-go scorecard. Those levels are set in the budget resolution, \nand the current scorecard set in the 2006 budget resolution, which was \nthe last budget agreed to by the House and Senate and the one \napplicable here, currently allows no unoffset tax cuts or mandatory \nspending from 2006 to 2010. But it does allow up to $268 billion in \noffset tax cuts or mandatory spending from 2011 to 2015, without \ntriggering a point of order. There is no point of order against this \namendment because of the current scorecard and the way this amendment \nwould work.\n\n  The problem with any version of pay-go is that the CBO assumes all \nentitlement programs live forever, regardless of whether a program must \nbe reauthorized. But tax cuts that must be reauthorized are not \nincluded in the baseline. Pay-go does not apply to appropriations. So \nthat is why there is no pay-go point of order against this amendment \nbecause the Baucus substitute already extends section 179 small \nbusiness expensing to 2010. It includes the necessary offsets to cover \n2010, and our amendment extends that same expensing through 2011 and \n2012, years in which the pay-go scorecard has more than sufficient \nallocation to cover any revenue that Joint Tax projects will not be \ncollected in those years.\n  I think all of the ends are tied up here. This is something that most \nof us would like to see done. It would help the small businesses that \nwill bear the brunt of the expected passage of the minimum wage \nincrease. We have a way to extend the most useful of the tax \ndeductions, this expensing for small business, through 2012. That does \nnot require any new permanent increases in taxes to offset the cost. It \nseems to me that this is very wise public policy. It doesn't have to be \npartisan. It would be good policy for us to extend this.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we have an opportunity to vote on this \namendment, to support it, or if there is a motion to table it, to vote \nagainst the motion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nMassachusetts seeks recognition. I yield to him whatever time he would \nlike to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nBaucus. As we get to the opening of this debate, I wish to provide a \nlittle sense about where we are on the increase in the minimum wage. \nMost of those who watched the debate yesterday saw that we had an \noverwhelming majority of Members who voted effectively for cloture. \nUsually, that means the end of debate is in sight. But because of \nvarious procedural situations we are facing, now we know we are going \nto have another vote required on cloture. This debate probably will \nroll on into the very end of the week. There is no reason we can't \ndispose of the amendments rapidly. There are important responses that \nshould be made, and then we can get about the business of finding ways \nwhere we can bring the House and Senate bills to accommodation and get \nthe increase in the minimum wage to those who are hard working and are \nentitled to this increase.\n  This is our eighth day of debate on this issue. We have had 16 days \nof debate, outside of these last 8, so we're up to 24 days where we \nhave debated the minimum wage on the floor of the Senate without \ngetting an increase, 24 days we have debated, an issue as simple as \ngoing from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour should not take all that period of \ntime. We know that here on the Democratic side we are prepared to vote \nnow, today. I am sure we can get the majority leader to request that we \nvote at noontime or so today and get this process moved ahead. But, no, \nthere are those on the other side who have a series of amendments and \nthey have them now. The good Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, will \nrespond to the issue which is at hand.\n\n  I want to reiterate once again that this is not an omnibus tax bill. \nThis legislation is long overdue. It is not an opportunity for Members \nto present their tax cut wish list. It is Congress' opportunity to \nfinally right the wrong of denying millions of hard-working minimum \nwage workers a raise for 10 years.\n  Since the minimum wage was last increased 10 years ago, we passed \n$276 billion in corporate tax breaks. In addition, Congress has cut \ntaxes for individuals by more than a trillion dollars, with most of the \nbenefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers. Unfortunately, for some of \nour Republican colleagues, there are never enough tax breaks, and they \nhave filed more than 25 amendments proposing new or expanded tax cuts \nto the minimum wage bill. Many of them would cost billions of dollars \nand most are not paid for.\n  So we know our friends on the other side are attempting to hold the \nminimum wage increase hostage for more tax cuts. I believe that is a \nshameless strategy. As has been pointed out, the Kyl amendment is one \nof the most expensive of all tax cut proposals. The entire amendment \nwould cost more than $45 billion over the next 10 years. Not a single \ndollar is paid for. It is $45 billion the American people cannot \nafford, and it should be rejected. I know we will hear from Senator \nBaucus as he addresses this issue.\n  We have debated over the period of the last few days tax breaks for \ncorporate America. Over the last 10 years, we have seen $276 billion in \ntax breaks for corporations and $36 billion in tax benefits to small \nbusinesses. We have increased the minimum wage nine times. There has \nonly been one time we have ever added tax benefits. The House of \nRepresentatives, with the vote of 82 Republicans, passed a clean bill. \nThat is what we should be about doing here. That is not where we are.\n  A final point I will make is that it came to my attention over the \nevening that many of the spouses of our service men and women in Iraq \nare working for low wages. In looking over the numbers of spouses of \nservice men and women in Iraq, there are 50,000 who will benefit from \nan increase in the minimum wage. Imagine that, 50,000 members of the \nmilitary force and their families will benefit from an increase in the \nminimum wage. That is not a point to dismiss lightly.\n  I think we ought to get about the business of doing something for \nthose families and spouses. It is difficult for me to believe we have \nthat number, but that is the figure--50,000 working between $5.15 and \n$7.25 an hour, so they would directly benefit from the raise to\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n$7.25. These are spouses of our military forces, and we are debating \nanother $45 billion in tax cuts. This is supposed to be a debate about \nan increase in the minimum wage that hasn't been raised for 10 years. \nAll it will do is restore the purchasing power of those on the lower \nrung of the economic ladder. It seems to me this continued delay is \nunconscionable.\n  Some have said it is necessary because our good friends on the other \nside are not prepared to get started on the debate on Iraq. There have \nbeen a lot of excuses and we hear all of them. But what has to be \nrecognized is the increase in the minimum wage to $7.25 is going to \nbenefit more than 6 million children. More than one million more \nchildren have fallen into poverty in the last 5 years. Six million \nchildren who live in homes where there will be an increase will \nbenefit, with all of the implications that has in terms of nutrition, \neducation, health care, and also in terms of the joy families can have \nwhen they get at least some small relief. These are hard-working people \nwho are trying to provide for themselves and their families and trying \nto make a difference in the community. They are men and women of great \ndignity.\n  We ought to be getting to a final vote on increasing the minimum \nwage, and we ought to get about it now. If there is going to be \nadditional debate on taxes and other things, let's do it at another \ntime. Let's not hold hostage--which is what's being done here--an \nincrease in the minimum wage for additional tax breaks. Let's not do \nthat. Let's say we have sufficient respect and admiration for these men \nand women of dignity. They are primarily women in our society--and many \nof these women who have children. For all these who are working hard at \nthe minimum wage, let's say we have sufficient respect for them so we \nare not going to hold them hostage to get tax breaks after tax breaks \nafter tax breaks after tax breaks. These men and women are entitled to \na Senate decision. We on our side are prepared to vote on it now; the \nsooner the better.\n  I am grateful to my colleague and friend from Montana for permitting \nme to say these words. I thank him very much for the courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I tip my hat to my good friend from \nMassachusetts. He is such a fighter and he is so correct in the \nstatements he is making on behalf of the people who need this increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  It is unconscionable that the Senate is delaying that increase. The \nHouse passed an increase. We have the same goal line, but we have a \nmore circuitous route in getting there. The Senate is taking so much \ntime in our way to get to the same goal line and raise the minimum \nwage. The Senator from Massachusetts is pricking our conscience to get \nthis done quickly--now. I deeply compliment my good friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we are wondering what \nin the world is going on here. Let me share some thoughts on the \nschedule. We are seeking to arrange votes on two amendments by my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl. We on our side of the aisle are \nready to vote. We want to vote. It appears, though, that there are some \nobjections on the other side of the aisle. I hope we can vote in the \nearly afternoon. The objections, I understand, are conflicts that \nSenators have in the next couple of hours. I hope we can have at least \none vote in the early afternoon. Probably after that, we will have \nanother vote in relation to another Kyl amendment, and we are hoping \nthose rollcall votes will be all that are left.\n  An agreement is not entered into yet--we are working on it--but it is \nmy hope we will have an early vote this afternoon and that then there \nis one more vote after that, on another Kyl amendment. That should help \nus to reach a conclusion on this bill, although I suspect a final vote \nwill not be until tomorrow. That is the state of play right now.\n  A couple words on the substance of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. This is only one of seven amendments \nhe has offered. Like six of those seven, this one is not offset. We \nhave already voted on one amendment by the Senator from Arizona. The \nremaining are not offset, and they would explode the budget deficit. \nThe earlier amendment was soundly defeated on previous rollcall vote. \nIt was offset by cutting education benefits for families who work in \neducation institutions. That was defeated.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona now is similar to \nthe one we have defeated. He would like to extend the section 179 \nexpensing provision in the law. We are doing that in the bill. The bill \nincreases the length of time in which the section 179 expense provision \nwould be in law. We would enable that extension to occur until 2010. My \nLord, this is 2007. That is not a permanent extension, but it is still, \ngiven the constraints we have, a reasonable extension. Everybody likes \ncertainty. We would like a little more certainty in the Senate than we \nhave. But it is still, I think, certainly already in the law and it is \nnot good policy to adopt the amendment of the Senator from Arizona \nwhich would extend it for a couple more years but cost about $2 \nbillion, which would be totally unpaid for. If there is one thing the \nAmerican people want, it is for us to live within our means and not \nincrease the deficit but to try to reduce the deficit. This amendment \nincreases the deficit. We have voted on a similar amendment and it has \nbeen rejected. I hope the same is true here.\n  At the appropriate time, I will move to table the amendment, and I \nhope we can get that accomplished in the early afternoon so we can move \non to the next Kyl amendment and debate that and vote on that amendment \nas quickly as possible. I hope there are no more amendments. We are \ngetting close. We all want to get a minimum wage bill passed, which is \nso important to so many people in our country. I think we ought to take \nthe responsible action and dispose of these tax amendments that are not \npaid for and reject them and get on to final passage on minimum wage, \nwhich I hope will be tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, previous to Senator Baucus speaking, we \nheard my friend from Massachusetts harangue about minimum wage not \nbeing considered for the last 10 years and that it is about time we get \nthe job done. I am going to be one of those to vote yes to get the job \ndone, to increase the minimum wage. But I think it is legitimate to ask \na couple of questions. One, there was a period of time during that 10 \nyears that Senator Kennedy's party was in the majority and controlled \nthe Senate. I don't recall them bringing up the minimum wage issue at \nthat particular time. If it was so important that it be done before \nthis period of time has elapsed, I would have thought they would be \nvoicing concern about raising the minimum wage as much and have a \nresponsibility to do it when they were in the majority, as it is now; \nand we are accused because we want to amend some tax provisions to it, \nwhich are very directly related to some of the negative impacts of \nincreasing the minimum wage on small business, and it is a very \nlegitimate point to bring up.\n  The second point I will bring up to the Senator from Massachusetts \nis, when he talks about adding tax provisions to the minimum wage, has \nhe forgotten that during the signing ceremony of the last increase in \nthe minimum wage bill by President Clinton Senator Kennedy was praised \nfor bringing a bill to the President that had tax provisions that were \nvery beneficial to small business and also other provisions that were \nvery beneficial to minimum wage workers by increasing the minimum wage?\n  I read from President Clinton's statement last week during the \ndebate. I know Senator Kennedy heard me say that. And yet it seems like \nit went in one ear and out the other because here he is saying it is \nwrong now, that when we are increasing the minimum wage, we have a \nsmall business tax provision included with the minimum wage increase.\n  It makes me wonder if there is a double standard: It is okay to have \ntax bills connected with a minimum wage increase when there is a \nDemocratic President, but when there is a Republican President, it is \nnot okay. I don't think we ought to have those sort of double \nstandards. I think if it is okay\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\nin the case of a Democratic President, it ought to be okay in the case \nof a Republican President.\n  Plus, I could raise the issue that if it is legitimate to have tax \nchanges to benefit small business at the same time we are having \nincreases in the minimum wage, this tax package is very meager compared \nto the one that was in the bill that President Clinton signed. At that \ntime, I believe, there was about $20 billion worth of small business \ntax changes to benefit depreciation and other things that can offset \nthe detrimental impact on a minimum wage increase on small business.\n  We all know there is no detrimental impact on larger businesses that \ncan pass along the cost. But for smaller businesses that can't, for \nstruggling small businesses, in particular mom and pops, it has to be \nsomething we take into consideration not only for the benefit of the \nsmaller business but also for the benefit of the workers who work for \nthat small business that maybe will be more underemployed or unemployed \nbecause maybe the small business can't afford to keep the same number \nof workers as when the minimum wage was lower. So all of these things \nseem to me to be legitimately tied together.\n  But in the case of a $20 billion tax package 10 years ago, compared \nto an $8 billion tax package in this bill, and considering inflation \nover the last 10 years, there isn't a single person listening to this \ndebate who doesn't know that when there are complaints about connecting \ntogether a tax bill with a minimum wage increase, compared to the last \ntime this was done in the Clinton administration, this tax package is \npeanuts compared to what we did for small business then--peanuts. Yet \nwe are having this harangue about it, that somehow this debate is not \nlegitimate.\n  Well, if it was legitimate in the Clinton administration, why isn't \nthis debate legitimate now, particularly considering the great lengths \nto which President Clinton went to compliment Senator Kennedy for \ndelivering a bill to President Clinton that had provisions benefiting \nsmall business, as well as benefiting the minimum wage worker?\n  We are going to get a bill passed. I don't know who is complaining. \nWhat is coming up when we get done? Well, of course, the debate, I \nsuppose, on Iraq is going to come up. And it ought to come up. We know \nwhat is coming up. We know there is not going to be any more votes on \nthat issue this week. So if we get this bill done today or tomorrow--\nand I bet it will be done today--then we know that is probably going to \nbe the last vote of the Senate this week. I think the people on the \nother side of the aisle who are managing this bill know that. They know \nwhen we get a couple of votes on a couple of other tax provisions, that \nit is limited. We know there is finality coming. There hasn't been any \neffort by anybody on this side of the aisle to hold up this bill, \nexcept to make sure that the impact of the minimum wage increase on \nsmall business is going to be considered the same way it was in the \nprevious administration.\n  I am very happy that yesterday cloture was invoked on the Baucus \nsubstitute amendment, and it contains these two very important \ncomponents about which I have already talked. For summary, in case \npeople are now beginning to pay attention to this debate after 1 week \nin the Senate, the first component proposed an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  You can make all sorts of arguments why maybe the minimum wage should \nnot be increased. Economists can make that argument about some increase \nin unemployment. Some people would say you should never have passed the \nminimum wage in the first place in 1938. But forget those economic \narguments. It is a political decision that we have had a minimum wage \nfor the last 70 years, and it has to be a political consideration that \nit ought to be increased from time to time or you shouldn't have it.\n  So let's get over that argument, as legitimate as the economic \narguments might be. They are going to be put aside because we are not \ngoing to eliminate the minimum wage. It is a part of the safety net of \nAmerican society. It is part of the fabric of our society, just as \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. You can all argue about \nwhether seven decades ago some of these decisions should have been made \nby Congress. But after a period of time, you accept it as a fact of \nlife; they are part of the social fabric of America, and move on. It is \na question now of how much.\n  That decision has even been answered--$2.10. It is about the same \ndecision that is being answered in several State legislatures around \nthe Nation, including my own State of Iowa, which now has made a \ndecision that it ought to be $2.10, albeit triggered a little quicker \nthan is going to be done under this bill. So we move ahead and that is \ntaken care of.\n  The second component is not seven decades old, as I indicated. The \nBaucus substitute connects these efforts to assist small business with \nsome changes in the tax law to benefit them. It has only been in the \nrecent two decades that that has been an issue. But at least it \nrecognizes something that maybe wasn't recognized before; that small \nbusiness is the engine of employment in America and it ought to be \nrecognized that, in some instances--and economists can back this up--\nthere is some underemployment or unemployment, particularly among young \npeople, and most particularly among minority young people.\n  I think it is legitimate to consider that because we make a great \ndeal in this Congress about having programs for the unemployed, such as \nretraining. We make a big deal about education, vocational education, \nand preparing people for the workforce. But do we ever stop to think of \nsomething that doesn't cost the taxpayers one penny? And that is that \nvocational education goes along with a young person getting the first \njob that they have ever had so that they learn to get up in the \nmorning, go to work, and be part of the workforce.\n  If you are not in the workforce, you are never going to work your way \nup the economic ladder. So getting in the workforce, learning the rules \nof the workforce, treating people right, taking orders, being a \nproductive citizen is very important vocational education. So if we are \ncreating some unemployment, particularly among minority young people, \nbecause of a decision we are making, a political decision we are \nmaking, we ought to at least take that into consideration. But for two \ndecades now we have considered that there is some negative impact.\n\n  There is not going to be a one-for-one correlation between changes we \nmake in depreciation schedules for small business that is going to \nguarantee Joe Blow or Mary Smith, teenagers working for a mom-and-pop \ngrocery store, that they are going to be able to keep their jobs. But \nit is some relief across the board that is going to benefit small \nbusiness, and there may be less unemployment of teenagers, less \nunemployment of minority teenagers so that they can get in the world of \nwork and work themselves up the economic ladder. So the Baucus \nsubstitute is before us and will pass this body.\n  Despite serious policy concerns about the efforts to raise the \nminimum wage, we all know that public support for increasing the \nminimum wage remains strong. And who can argue with that? Ten years? So \nthere is a rationale for raising it. It is pretty hard to convince \nanybody that as long as Congress is setting a minimum wage, it \nshouldn't be adjusted from time to time. So it is quite obvious. That \nis why we are here for that debate. So the political reality is that a \nmajority of Senators support a minimum wage increase, not based upon \nbeing trustees of the American people but based on the proposition of \nbeing representatives of the American people. And that message is \ncoming very clearly from the grassroots.\n  As predicted, the cloture vote last week showed there are not 60 \nvotes for this minimum wage bill without the small business tax \nincentives. And for Senator Kennedy, who is haranguing about the fact \nthis is not being passed fast enough, the members of his own party \nvoted with us on that, and that seems to show it is bipartisan.\n  As I said before, tax incentives targeted to small business and other \nbusinesses impacted by a minimum wage increase have been linked to \nminimum wage legislation over the past couple of decades. Democrats \nhave, at times, joined Republicans in supporting that linkage. Once \nagain, Republicans have asked for small business tax relief, if a \nminimum wage hike is going to happen. Based on an overwhelming cloture\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nvote yesterday on this Baucus substitute, it looks as if we are going \nto get there. Democrats, in effect, agree--through that vote--with this \nlinkage.\n  To different groups of Senators, these topics carry their own \nbenefits or burdens. Many on my side don't like the idea of second-\nguessing the labor market with a federally mandated minimum wage. In \npast statements, I pointed out some of the related issues that should \ngive us pause when considering such legislation. Some, mostly \nDemocrats, will call this bill before us nothing but a minimum wage \nincrease bill. Some, mostly on my side of the aisle, will call it a \nsmall business tax relief bill. But isn't that how we get things done \nin the Senate? Doesn't almost everybody have to have a win? And in this \naren't we having a win-win situation in a bipartisan way?\n  I suppose some of our Members are going to have it both ways, it is \ngoing to be both a minimum wage increase and a small business tax \nrelief bill. President Bush, similar to President Clinton, whom I have \nalready quoted, will recognize both parts of this package. If my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would review that statement, as \nI led them to review it last week, they will note that President \nClinton saw merit in the small business tax relief package.\n  If I were chairman, I might have tilted the package a bit more toward \ndepreciation and less toward, let's say, that portion that we call the \nworker opportunity tax credit. It is important these incentives \ncoincide with the timing when the minimum wage increase will be taking \neffect. It has been proven that a minimum wage hike without tax relief \nfor small business will not fly in a body where we have to move ahead \nin a bipartisan way or nothing gets done. Let's recognize that reality. \nLet's improve this bill and complete it in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for up \nto 7 minutes as in morning business, and following that, Senator \nLandrieu be given permission to speak as in morning business for up to \n7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe charged postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators' time will be charged \npostcloture.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Vitter and Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for what time I might consume, and it will not be too \nlong, on two bills I am going to introduce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley and Mr. Dodd pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 467 and S. 468 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, since I do not think anybody else is \nseeking the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue as \nin morning business for, I would say, roughly 10 or 12 minutes on an \nissue unrelated to what is on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Alternative Minimum Tax\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, next week the President's budget will \ncome to Capitol Hill. In terms of tax issues, no issue is more pressing \nin the upcoming budget than resolving the alternative minimum tax issue \nfor both the short term as well as the long term.\n  As many Members know, the so-called patch--the temporary fix we did \nlast year for the alternative minimum tax so no more people would be \nhit by it than are presently hit by it--ran out at the end of last \nyear. So right now 23 million people in the year 2007 could be hit by \nthe alternative minimum tax, if we do not do something about it. Since \nwe have to offset things such as this, if we patch this up again, it is \ngoing to take $50 billion to offset or, if it isn't offset, that means \n$50 billion that would come into the Federal Treasury under existing \nlaw would not come in.\n  Next week I will give a series of speeches in some detail. I am going \nto look at how we got where we are on the alternative minimum tax. I \nwill examine the history of the alternative minimum tax and the origins \nof the current problem. In another speech, I am going to discuss the \nfiscal effects of maintaining, repealing, and replacing the alternative \nminimum tax. And in the third speech, I will talk about options to \nremedy the alternative minimum tax problem in the short term and over \nthe long term.\n  Today, on a preemptive basis, I want to counter a charge that I think \nis going to be repeated by Democratic-leaning think tanks, maybe by the \nleadership of the Congress, and, more importantly, by east coast media \nwho tend to be sympathetic to the views of those political \norganizations. The charge will be that the alternative minimum tax \nproblem we face is a result of the bipartisan tax relief legislation \nenacted in 2001 and 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent to maintain the floor and yield to the \nmajority to make a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 2:30 p.m. be equally divided between Senators Baucus \nand Kyl or their designees; that at 2:30 p.m., the Senate vote in \nrelation to Senator Kyl's amendment No. 209; that no other amendment be \nin order prior to that vote; that following that vote, amendment No. \n115 be considered in order for purposes of drafting under rule XXII; \nand that all other amendments to the bill and to the substitute be \nwithdrawn accept for amendment No. 115; and that no other amendments be \nin order except the substitute and amendment No. 115.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me ask the majority, would they like me to yield \nthe floor for that debate?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. No, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Next week, when the President's budget comes out, there \nis going to be an awful lot of discussion about the alternative minimum \ntax. I am trying to preempt--in a sense counter--what I think are old \narguments that are going to be repeated about that issue. They are \ngoing to be coming from leftwing think tanks, and maybe the Democratic \nleadership in the Congress will pick up on it. For sure, the east coast \nmedia, who tend to be sympathetic to the views of these political \norganizations, is going to be loudly speaking about it. I don't\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\nfind anything wrong with it being discussed, but I am going to make \nsure it is discussed in an intellectually honest manner.\n  The charge is going to be made that the alternative minimum tax \nproblem we face now is a direct result of the bipartisan--I emphasize \nbipartisan--tax relief legislation that was enacted in 2001 and 2003, \nwhich, by the way, Chairman Greenspan has said, both before he left the \nFed as well as a private citizen, that these tax relief packages we \npassed back then are the basis for the economy going very smoothly in \nthe last 3 or 4 years, creating 7.2 million jobs. If that is the \nargument they are going to make--and I will bet you, although I am not \na betting man, that that is what we are going to hear--it is a \ndistortion, plain and simple. So I think I am going to try to correct \nthe record in advance. Maybe next week, if I have done it adequately, \nthere won't be any record to correct. I have been around here long \nenough to know what is going to be said.\n  To the extent the Democratic leadership and allies suggest, like \nothers who have looked at this issue, that the bipartisan tax relief \npackages are responsible for the alternative minimum tax problem, I \nrespond in this way: Most who have reached that conclusion have done so \nby misusing data, data that is provided by the truly nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, an agency of Congress that you might say wears \ngreen eyeshades, looks at things as they are, without a Republican or \nDemocratic bias. These figures of the Joint Committee on Taxation will \nbe used to distort the record on the issue of the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis suggests an alternative \nexplanation for the alternative minimum tax problem, and that is the \nfailure of Congress to index the alternative minimum tax for inflation \nwhen it was first established 35 years ago. The critics are going to \ncharge that the bipartisan tax relief packages are responsible for this \nalternative minimum tax problem. This conclusion is reached in error \nbecause it is based upon faulty logic. Those who have done similar \nanalyses have based their conclusions on the mistaken assumption that a \nreduction in Federal receipts should be interpreted as a percentage \ncausation of the alternative minimum tax problem. The Joint Committee \non Taxation was asked to project Federal alternative minimum tax \nrevenue, if the bipartisan tax relief provisions were extended but \ncurrent law hold-harmless provisions were not extended. And what do we \nget, a $1.1 trillion issue, and a Federal alternative tax revenue, if \nneither the Bush tax cuts nor the hold-harmless provisions is extended, \na $400 billion issue compared to the $1.1 trillion issue.\n  From that data, some erroneously concluded and publicly represented \nthat the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are responsible for 65 percent of \nthe alternative minimum tax problem. In other words, this $1.1 trillion \nminus the $4 billion divided by $1.1 trillion. And conversely then, \nthat the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 tripled the size of the alternative \nminimum tax problem; again, $1.1 trillion divided by $400 billion. The \nlogic used to reach that conclusion is flawed. That is what I am about \nto show.\n  This is because the many variables affecting the alternative minimum \ntax have overlapping results, and the order in which one analyzes those \noverlapping variables will directly impact the outcome of the analysis.\n  In that way, we can use the same Joint Committee on Taxation data in \nthe analysis above to suggest that the failure to index is actually the \ndominant cause of the alternative minimum tax problem. If one were to \nfirst index--and that wasn't done 35 years ago--the current tax system \nfor inflation by permanently extending an indexed version of the \ncurrent hold-harmless provisions, Federal alternative minimum tax \nrevenue would be reduced from $1.1 trillion to $472 billion over the \n10-year period we use to guesstimate taxes coming into the Federal \nTreasury. Thus, extending and indexing the current hold-harmless \nprovision for future inflation would reduce the alternative minimum tax \nrevenues by 59 percent over the same period referred to in the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation letter dated October 3, 2005, as ``percentage of \nAMT effect attributable to failure to extend and index hold harmless \nprovision.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of that entire letter in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2005.\n     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr.\n     From: George Yin.\n     Subject: AMT Effects.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request of September 29, \n     2005, for an analysis of the portion of the AMT effect (AMT \n     liability plus credits lost due to the AMT) which can be \n     attributed to the failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount \n     to inflation, assuming alternatively that the EGTRRA and \n     JGTRRA tax cuts (``tax cuts'') are either permanently \n     extended or repealed. We also explain how this information \n     compares to information previously provided to you on August \n     31, 2005 and September 16, 2005.\n       For the purpose of this analysis, we have first assumed \n     that the tax cuts are repealed. The first set of figures in \n     Table 1 compares the AMT effect under this assumption if, \n     alternatively, (1) the AMT exemption amount hold-harmless \n     provision is not extended beyond 2005; (2) such provision is \n     extended permanently; and (3) such provision is extended \n     permanently and indexed after 2005. The second set of figures \n     presents the same comparison under the assumption that the \n     tax cuts are permanently extended. All of the information \n     provided in this table was previously provided to you in our \n     September 16, 2005 memo, except in a different format.\n\n                                 TABLE 1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              AMT effect\n                            Item                              (billions\n                                                             of dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax Cuts Repealed:\n    (1) Hold-harmless provision not extended...............        399.9\n    (2) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently.......        212.0\n    (3) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure to          47%\n     extend hold-harmless provision (((1)-(2))/(1))........\n    (4) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently and           169.7\n     indexed...............................................\n    (5) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure to          58%\n     extend and index hold-harmless provision (((1)-(4))/\n     (1))..................................................\nTax Cuts Extended Permanently:\n    (6) Hold-harmless provision not extended...............      1,139.1\n    (7) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently.......        628.5\n    (8) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure to          45%\n     extend hold-harmless provision (((6)-(7))/(6))........\n    (9) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently and           472.0\n     indexed...............................................\n    (10) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure            59%\n     to extend and index hold-harmless provision (((6)-(9))/\n     (6))..................................................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In the information provided to you on August 31, 2005 and \n     September 16, 2005, we analyzed the portion of the AMT effect \n     attributable to the tax cuts. In the analysis described \n     above, we identify the portion of the AMT effect attributable \n     to failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount to inflation. \n     There is, however, interaction between these two contributing \n     factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting \n     of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The \n     apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will \n     vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total \n     effect remains constant.\n       This phenomenon is illustrated by Tables 2 and 3 below. The \n     first two columns of Table 2 show the portion of the AMT \n     effect attributable to the tax cuts, consistent with the \n     information provided on August 31, 2005 and September 16, \n     2005. The second two columns of Table 2 show the portion of \n     the AMT effect attributable to the failure to extend and \n     index the hold-harmless provision, consistent with the \n     information provided in Table 1 above. Note that if these two \n     contributing factors were completely independent of one \n     another, the information in Table 2 would suggest that the \n     two factors together contribute to more than 100 percent of \n     the AMT effect. In fact, as shown in Table 3, the two factors \n     together contribute to only 85 percent of the AMT effect. \n     Thus, there is substantial overlap between these two factors.\n\n                                 TABLE 2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                AMT effect                    AMT effect\n             Item               (billions         Item        (billions\n                               of dollars)                   of dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline.....................      1,139.1  Baseline.......      1,139.1\nRepeal tax cuts..............        399.9  Extend and             472.0\n                                             index AMT hold-\n                                             harmless\n                                             provision.\nDifference...................        739.2  Difference.....        667.1\nPercentage of baseline.......          65%  Percentage of            59%\n                                             baseline.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\n\n                                 TABLE 3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              AMT effect\n                            Item                              (billions\n                                                             of dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline...................................................      1,139.1\nRepeal tax cuts and extend and index AMT hold-harmless             169.7\n provision.................................................\nDifference.................................................        969.4\nPercentage of baseline.....................................          85%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let's go back to the Joint Committee on Taxation \nanalysis. If we then assume that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are \nrepealed, alternative minimum tax revenue falls by an additional $302 \nbillion, from $472 billion to $169 billion. That second drop \nattributable to the repeal of the Bush tax cuts reduces Federal revenue \nby only 27 percent. Thus, one should argue that failure to index is a \ngreater cause of the alternative minimum tax problem--in other words, \n59 percent versus 27 percent. If we had indexed, we wouldn't have this \nproblem.\n  Using logic similar to that undertaken above would also cause us to \nconclude that failure to index is responsible for 59 percent of the \nalternative minimum tax problem or, alternatively, that failure to \nindex also nearly triples the size of the AMT problem. But simple logic \nsuggests that the bipartisan tax relief cannot be responsible for 65 \npercent of the alternative minimum tax problem and failure to index \nresponsible for 59 percent of the problem. The anomaly arises because \nthere is overlap between variables being analyzed. Although the \nanalysis fairly demonstrates the amount of alternative minimum tax \nrevenue saved by making a particular change to the Federal tax system, \nit is inappropriate to represent that such analysis accurately isolates \ncausation of the alternative minimum tax. Because there is overlap in \nthe variables being analyzed in these examples, indexing and the \nbipartisan tax relief packages, the order of analysis of those \nvariables is crucial to whatever outcome we have.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation acknowledges this point to us in a \nletter dated October 3, from which I will quote:\n\n       There is, however, interaction between these two \n     contributing factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid \n     double counting of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. \n     The apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will \n     vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total \n     effect remains constant.\n\n  To this point in time, I have not seen anything that accurately \nsuggests that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have worsened the alternative \nminimum tax problem to date. It is my intention to ensure we continue \nto honor that commitment.\n  Proponents of this charge fail to recognize that we addressed the \nproblem for 2001 through 2005 in legislation that most of these \norganizations opposed. By the way, those hold-harmless alternative \nminimum tax provisions were the first significant legislative efforts \nto stem the rise of the alternative minimum tax tide, meaning affecting \nmillions more people who were never intended to be affected by it.\n  It was, in fact, the Finance Committee that put its money where its \nmouth was on the alternative minimum tax. Last year's bipartisan tax \nrelief reconciliation did the same thing for the year 2006--in other \nwords, to make sure that the alternative minute tax problem is not \nworsened. Once again, it was the bipartisan leadership of the Finance \nCommittee that ensured millions of families would not face the \nalternative minimum tax problem in the tax-filing season this year.\n  I might say that Republicans, last year, when we were controlling, \nwere willing to add millions of people to it because they didn't want \nto hold harmless completely, just to some extent. But we in the Senate \nstuck to our guns, and we got the hold harmless kept in place, as it \nhad been since 2001.\n  I reiterate the importance of the last sentence in my remarks, where \nI said that the Finance Committee ensured that millions of families \nwould not face the alternative minimum tax in this tax-filing season \nthat we are in right now. Everyone who supported the tax relief \nreconciliation bill walked the walk on the alternative minimum tax. A \nlot of the critics I am referring to have talked that walk on the \nalternative minimum tax, but if you look at their voting records, they \nhave not walked the walk on the alternative minimum tax. Thank \ngoodness, then, 15 million families were put above politics, or you \nmight say a bipartisan solution saw that they were not harmed because, \notherwise, 15 million families would be dealing right now, as they file \nlast year's income tax, with the AMT in their tax returns--in other \nwords, paying the alternative minimum tax because we did not hold \nharmless.\n  If they had to deal with that, you know how complex they think the \ntax forms are already and the tax system is already. Well, if you have \nto go through that alternative minimum tax exercise, it almost doubles \nthe complexity. Every Member who voted against the bipartisan tax \nrelief reconciliation bill ought to think about that bottom-line \nreality. If that group, led by--because it tended to be very partisan--\nthe Democratic leadership had prevailed, 15 million families \nconcentrated in the so-called blue States would have been dealing with \nthe alternative minute tax now. It is a fact--because higher income \npeople tend to live in the so-called blue States, according to the \nresults of the last two Presidential elections--they are paying more of \nthis alternative minimum tax. They happen to be represented by people \nof the other political party who thought that the hold harmless \nprovisions should not have been there. So 15 million people--most of \nthem in those States--would be hit again.\n  The clock is ticking on the alternative minimum tax problem for this \nyear. In other words, we have to do something before the end of the \nyear or we are going to have 23 million people hit by it. A year from \nnow then, those 23 million people will be working with the complexities \nof the AMT and paying the alternative minimum tax. They are people who \ncome from those high-income States, more so than the State I come from, \nalthough we have people who are hurt by it--or would be hurt by it--but \nnot to the extent of some of the high-income States. On October 15, a \ntaxpayer's first quarter estimated tax payments will be due, and they \nwill have to take this into consideration. Twenty-three million \nfamilies will have to start dealing with the AMT yet this year on these \nquarterly estimates.\n  Last year, Congress acted a few weeks after April 15. Hopefully, this \nCongress will act before April 15. Mr. President, next week, Congress \nwill be facing the AMT problem as the budget process moves forward. \nThat is what is going to start this demagoguery about the AMT. To get a \ngrip on that problem, we need to examine its history, assess its fiscal \nimpact, and carefully consider our short-term and long-term options. I \nlook forward to these discussions on these three topics next week. \nLet's use correct data when we discuss the alternative minimum tax. \nLet's be intellectually honest. Let's discard the partisan fuzzy math \nand partisan revisionist history.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           FISA Court Orders\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I received notice this morning that \nPresident Bush has agreed to our bipartisan request for key recent \norders from the FISA Court. Let me explain this a little bit. I have \nbeen very critical now for some time of the warrantless wiretapping of \nAmericans done, apparently, under the President's order. We have, as \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, which sets up a special court where you can go in \nsecret if you suspect a terrorist is phoning into the United States, \nand you can get an\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\norder to wiretap that call. But according to the press, the \nadministration has not followed that law, has not gone into the court. \nThey have allowed widespread wiretapping of Americans without a court \norder. This has been troublesome to a lot of people on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  So we learned recently--Senator Specter and I--that the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court had issued orders authorizing NSA's \nwiretapping program, which meant the President was going back to the \ncourt, as he should have, of course, before. We asked the court to make \nthese orders available to the Judiciary Committee. The chief judge of \nthe court approved providing the orders but left the final decision to \nthe executive branch.\n  I made it clear, when Attorney General Gonzales appeared before us, \nthat we expected to see the orders. After all, we write the law as to \nhow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is supposed to work, and \nwe have the responsibility to make sure it is followed. The President \nhas made the right decision in changing his previous course of \nunilaterally authorizing the warrantless surveillance program. He is \nnow going to follow the law in seeking court approval for wiretaps.\n  Senator Specter and I, on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, will \nhave to look at the contours of the wiretapping program. We have to \nlook at the Court's orders to determine whether the administration \nreached the proper balance to protect Americans, while following the \nlaw and the principles of checks and balances. I hope the \nadministration will eventually allow all members of the Judiciary \nCommittee to look at these orders.\n  We all want to catch terrorists, but we don't want a country where we \nhave warrantless wiretapping of Americans. If we start down that slope, \nwe all lose the right to privacy and the values this Nation has stood \nfor for more than 200 years. So Senator Specter and I will review the \ncourt orders to make sure the law is being followed. I believe in this \ncase, the President has taken the right first step, and I commend him \nfor it.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Terrorist Surveillance Program\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator \nLeahy in the acknowledgment that the Attorney General will be turning \nover to Senator Leahy and me, in our capacities as chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, the applications which were filed by \nthe Department of Justice for the change in the terrorist surveillance \nprogram and the court orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court establishing a new line of judicial review for that \nsurveillance program.\n  Back on December 16, 2005, the New York Times broke a major story \ndisclosing that there had been a secret wiretapping program, electronic \nsurveillance without the customary judicial review. The customary \napproach is to have a law enforcement official apply for a warrant \nshowing an affidavit of probable cause to justify a search and seizure \nfor a wiretap which is a facet of the search and seizure, and that \ndisclosure back on December 16 was quite a revelation. As a matter of \nfact, we were in the midst of debating the PATRIOT Act at that time, \ntrying to get that through on reauthorization, and it was a major bone \nof contention, with some Senators saying they had been disposed to vote \nfor the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act and wouldn't do so now with \nthe disclosure of that program.\n  Through a good bit of last year, the Judiciary Committee worked on \nefforts, through legislation, to have judicial review of that program, \nand, in fact, at one point an agreement was reached with the White \nHouse on a legislative package to move forward. Ultimately, that \nlegislative effort was unsuccessful and the program continued to have \nthese wiretaps without judicial approval. Then, on January 17--earlier \nthis month--the Attorney General announced there had been a change in \nprogramming and there would be application made to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Board under procedures which the Department \nof Justice had established with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt.\n  I received a lengthy briefing on the nature of the program, but it \nfell short of the necessary disclosure because I did not know what the \napplications, the affidavits provided, nor did I know what the court \nhad said. And there was an issue as to whether there was a blanket \napproval for the program or whether there were individualized warrants, \nand in order to meet the traditional safeguards for establishment of \nprobable cause, there would have to be individual warrants.\n  Senator Leahy and I then pressed the Attorney General for access to \nthese documents which would give us a fuller understanding of what was \nhappening. I was pleased to learn earlier today that the Attorney \nGeneral has consented to make those disclosures to Senator Leahy and \nmyself, and we will be reviewing those documents. They will not be made \npublic. Until I have had a chance to see them, I wouldn't have any \njudgment as to whether they ought to be made public. My own view is \nthere ought to be the maximum disclosure to the public consistent with \nnational security procedures. The Attorney General has represented that \nthere is classified information here which ought not to be made public, \nand I will reserve judgment until I have had an opportunity to see \nthose documents.\n  I know Senator Leahy was on the floor a little earlier today, within \nthe past half hour or so, and I wanted to join him in thanking the \nPresident for this action. We have seen an expansion of Executive \nauthority which I have spoken about on this Senate floor in a number of \nsituations with the signing statements, where the President signs \nlegislation but expresses reservations. There is a real question in my \nmind as to the constitutionality of that. The Constitution provides \nthat Congress passes legislation and the President either signs it or \nvetoes it. I have introduced legislation to give Congress standing to \nchallenge those signing statements or limitations therein in court and \nother examples of the expansion of Executive authority.\n  So I think this is a significant step forward, and I commend the \nPresident and the Department of Justice for taking this stand. I am \ngoing to reserve judgment on the program itself, obviously, until I \nhave had a chance to review it. But I did want to acquaint my \ncolleagues in the Senate with what is happening and acquaint the \nAmerican people too because there has been considerable concern about \nthe protection of civil rights, and obviously our war on terrorism has \nto be fought in a vigorous and tenacious manner, because it is a real \nthreat to our national security and the safety of the American people, \nbut at the same time have the balancing of protecting civil liberties. \nThis is a significant step forward, and I am anxious to see the details \nto be able to report further on it.\n  I thank the Chair, and in the absence of any other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Simplifying the Tax Code\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, although it is unrelated to what we are \ndoing, I wish to talk a little bit about general tax reform.\n  The amendments are very important, and we are dealing with the issue, \nof course, of the minimum wage and offsetting some of those costs to \nsmall businesses. I support that idea. But I wanted to say that I hope \nwe soon give more attention to reforming of the\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\noverall tax forms. We are getting into a position where every time \nthere is an issue, every time there is something we want to accomplish, \nwe have some tax relief for this section of the economy and for that \nsection of the economy. It has become so complex and so shortchanged in \nterms of the time, the exchanges that we have. I think we have to have \nsome overall tax reform.\n  I understand it is not easy because all of these issues are \ndifferent. On the other hand, we can simplify the Tax Code, if we take \nthe time. I mentioned it this morning in the Finance Committee. I \nrealize we are not going to be able to address it in a short time, but \nI think we ought to set it as a long-term goal and begin to deal with \nsimplifying the Tax Code. As each of us moves into our own taxes this \nyear, it becomes obvious how detailed these taxes are. If you happen to \nbe involved in a business, even a small business, the Tax Code is so \ndifficult. I don't think we ought to be managing the behavior of this \ncountry through taxes. Taxes ought to be set in a general and long-term \nway so that people can understand, over time, what the tax situation \nis, and we can make it attractive enough that we don't have to change \nit for every issue that comes up.\n  Again, I certainly am supportive of what we are doing now. But in the \nlonger view of things, I urge that we give consideration to reforming \nthe Tax Code, to making it simpler, understandable, longer term, and to \navoid setting up the situation where each time there is some issue \naffecting anyone in this country, we don't, as a secondary action, \nchange the Tax Code to encourage a particular outcome. It should not be \nthe purpose of taxes to regulate behavior.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 209\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, unless the Senator from Wisconsin wishes to \nspeak, I will proceed. I believe we have about 14 minutes remaining on \nour side. I would like to use at least some of that time to clear up a \ncouple points that were made earlier in the debate. I am speaking on \nthe amendment No. 209, which is my amendment to extend the period of \ntime that so-called section 179 small business expensing would be \neffective. Instead of cutting off at 2010, it would be the same period \nof time that we extended the work opportunity tax credit; namely, 2012. \nThe obvious reason being that businesses would have more time within \nwhich to plan these additions or improvements to their business and \nwould be able to count on what the Tax Code treatment would be and, \ntherefore, would be more likely to make the investment and, therefore, \ncreate more jobs and, therefore, be able to absorb the cost of the \nminimum wage that will be imposed by the legislation before us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander be added as a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 115 and that Senator Specter be added as a \ncosponsor both to this amendment, No. 209, and to No. 115.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts made a \ncouple of statements I need to correct. One was that this amendment \nwould cost $45 billion. I do not know how he arrived at that figure. \nEven if you add up all of the amendments I have proposed at one time or \nanother on this bill, they don't add up to $45 billion.\n  The amount that this amendment would, in effect, cost to take section \n179 through the year 2012 would be about $2.1 billion over 10 years. \nThat is more than absorbed by the authority that we have under the \nbudget from last year, which is $278.6 billion. So there doesn't have \nto be an additional offset. There doesn't have to be an additional pay-\nfor. The cost for extending section 179--what we are doing with this \namendment--is entirely subsumed in the budget we passed last year. That \nis why it is not subject to a point of order and why a mere majority \nvote will determine whether it moves forward.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, by the way, the minimum \nwage increase will impose about $5 billion worth of new costs on \nbusinesses each and every year. Most of that will be on small \nbusinesses. The extension of this relief will benefit those very small \nbusinesses that are going to have to absorb this additional cost.\n  When the Senator from Massachusetts said earlier, ``We have debated \nover the period of the last few days tax breaks for corporate \nAmerica,'' I want to be very clear, that is not the tax break I am \ntalking about. The tax break for corporate America is the tax break the \nmajority of the Democrats on the Finance Committee have provided in the \nform of the work opportunity tax credit.\n  Testimony before our committee confirmed that 95 percent, \napproximately, of the value of the WOTC, work opportunity tax credit, \ngoes to bigger businesses, S and C corporations, because they have the \nwherewithal to set up the complicated accounting mechanisms for the \nwork opportunity tax credit legislation to actually work. Very few of \nthe small businesses are benefited by that tax relief. But almost all \nof the small businesses are benefited by the tax relief that I have \nproposed. So I respectfully correct my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  What I am proposing doesn't benefit the big corporations. That is \nwhat is already extended under the bill through the year 2012. What we \nare doing is extending through the year 2012 these benefits for the \nsmall businesses--specifically, the section 179 expensing. How does \nthat work? As I explained this morning, by definition, section 179 \nallows businesses to write off an amount that is right now $112,000, \nwhen they spend that much money on a new piece of equipment or add on \ntheir business. If they spend more than $400,000, they cannot use this \nparticular provision.\n  The bottom line is that this is for the small business, it is not for \nbig business. So it is simply incorrect to say that the proposal that \nis before us now, to be voted on shortly, benefits big corporations. \nThey cannot, by definition, take advantage of this particular provision \nof the Tax Code.\n  Again, why are we seeking to do this? All of us on the Finance \nCommittee agreed that we needed to provide some tax relief to small \nbusinesses because small businesses would bear the brunt of the new \nexpense of the minimum wage. So the committee unanimously extended \nvarious provisions of the Tax Code. It extended this section 179 for \nanother year, recognizing its importance. All my amendment does is \nextend it another 2 years, so that it will conform with the same period \nof time that the work opportunity tax credit goes to and, thus, provide \nsome balance between the big businesses, which get the work opportunity \ntax credit relief, and the small businesses, which primarily rely on \nthe section 179 tax relief.\n\n  Section 179 is probably the most used of the tax provisions because \nall small businesses can take advantage of it whenever they add value \nto their particular business. It is for this reason that several \norganizations have endorsed this proposal of mine and, in fact, have \ncommunicated with us that they intend to key vote this amendment. So \nwhen you are voting on my amendment, if you vote to table my amendment, \nyou are going against the recommendations of the following groups: \nNational Federation of Independent Business, NFIB; Food Marketing \nInstitute; Printing Industries of America; International Franchise \nAssociation; and Society of American Florists.\n  You can see that these are the kinds of businesses that can take \nadvantage of this section of the Tax Code. So anybody who votes to \ntable this amendment, as I said, will be going against the \nrecommendation of these particular groups.\n  I urge my colleagues--this has never been a partisan issue. Section \n179 is supported by Democrats and Republicans and Independents. Our \ncommittee action was unanimous. There is no reason this has to become a \npartisan issue. There is no question of pay-for. We already, in the \nbudget from last\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nyear, the scorecard, as they call it, have revenue available to offset \nthe modest increase of $2 billion that a 2-year extension would entail \nin this particular amendment. So I see no reason for anybody to vote \nagainst it and, most especially, to table this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to table.\n  Madam President, might I inquire how much time is now available on \nboth sides of this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 6 minutes, and the majority \nhas 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. All right. It is also my understanding that time not used is \nto be counted off equally against both parties; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For quorum calls, yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Oh, I see. As the proponent of the amendment, I hope that I \nwill be able to close the debate. But given the fact that there is 6 \nminutes remaining on my side, if there is nobody from the majority side \nto speak to this, then I will continue the conversation, at least until \nsomeone arrives.\n  One of the other arguments is that by extending this through 2008, we \nhave provided enough certainty to small businesses that they could go \nahead and make the investment, plan the renovation or buy the piece of \nequipment, or whatever that might be. The bottom line is that any \namount that we extend in these tax provisions enables businesses to \nplan better. If we extend it 1 year, as the committee did, then at \nleast businesses can look out 1 year. But as we all know, in the \nbusiness environment, a 1-year horizon is very short. That is why, just \nas we extended the work opportunity tax credit through 2012, it makes \nsense to extend the small business expensing through the year 2012 as \nwell. Any additional time that businesses can know what the tax \nconsequences of their purchases or expenses are is an advantage to them \nand will enable them to create the jobs, as I said, that will offset \nthe costs of the minimum wage.\n  Madam President, I don't know of anybody who opposes the extension of \nsection 179. The committee itself extended it for 1 year. I don't know \nwhy there would be partisan debate about extending it for another 2 \nyears. I think we can all agree that would represent good policy. The \nrelatively modest expense of this $2.1 billion, in terms of theoretical \nlost revenue, is more than compensated for by the $278 billion in \noffset tax authority from the years 2011 and 2015 under the budget we \npassed last year. So there is no point of order and there is no reason, \non a purely fiscal basis or balanced budget basis, to vote against \nthis.\n  Everybody knows it is good for small business. Adding 12 years for \nplanning purposes for the business to purchase the equipment or add to \nthe building is simply an improvement over existing law and enhancing \nof the small business's ability to create more jobs, expand their \nbusiness and, frankly, to contribute to the great economic growth that \nwe have right now.\n  So I don't understand any of the reasons a Member of this body would \nwant to oppose this particular amendment. I am not doing this for any \npurpose other than to try to support these small businesses. That is \nwhy the NFIB and the others are so supportive of my amendment. I would \nthink that in this time when we wanted to start out the year in a \nbipartisan way, this is a provision that has strong bipartisan support; \nit always has. I just don't understand why anybody would not want to \nextend it for 2 years, especially when the costs of doing so are \nalready offset in the budget that we passed last year.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to table this \namendment.\n  Madam President, let me first inquire how much time both sides have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 2 minutes, the majority has 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I compliment Senator Kyl for his \nwork. I expect a vote for the minimum wage with the small business tax \nadjustments that are with it. As I said on the floor of the Senate the \nother day, it is not the most efficient way for the Government to \nintervene help for the poorest people who are working. I think that \nwould be an increase in the earned-income tax credit. It would be less \nexpensive, more efficient, and all of us would pay the bill for that, \nnot just small businesspeople.\n  If we are going to raise the minimum wage, we ought to not impose the \nwhole burden on just that small segment of society. I agree that \nextending these small business depreciation and expensing benefits \nwould help small business men and women who are trying to compete in \nthe world to be able to compete. And it gives all of us who pay taxes a \nchance to pay for this idea that we have called the minimum wage, which \ntries to help working people have more.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl because \nit will do more to offset the increased costs imposed on small \nbusinesses through raising the minimum wage by making it easier for \nmany small business owners to take advantage of the tax relief \ncontained in this bill. In addition, the amendment will help create \njobs by encouraging small business owners to grow their businesses and \nhire new employees.\n\n  Under current tax law, small businesses can expense up to $100,000 of \ncertain new property the year it is put in service. That figure is \nindexed to inflation, so small businesses will be able to expense up to \n$108,000 in 2006. After 2009, this expensing level will drop back down \nto $25,000 a year for these small businesses. The tax relief package \nincluded in the minimum wage bill would extend the $100,000 expensing \nlimit--indexed for inflation--through the end of 2010. The Kyl \namendment would add 2 years to that extension. In other words, the Kyl \namendment would allow small businesses to expense the higher amount \nthrough the end of 2012.\n  Last week, I spoke on the Senate floor about the burden imposed on \nthe small business community by raising the minimum wage. Small \nbusinesses will bear the brunt of approximately 60 percent of the costs \nof a minimum wage increase. I applaud the Finance Committee including \nChairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for approving a tax relief \npackage to help offset these costs. In particular, I am glad that tax \nrelief package includes the expensing provision that we are talking \nabout on the Senate floor today.\n  The Kyl amendment would make the expensing provision even stronger by \nallowing for higher expensing limits through the end of 2012. This is \nimportant because continuing the higher expensing limits for an \nadditional 2 years would give small businesses more time to plan and \nfully use this benefit. If small business owners can take greater \nadvantage of the tax relief in this bill, that means more help in \noffsetting the added costs imposed on small business owners through a \nminimum wage increase.\n  Not only does this particular tax provision help offset the costs of \nan increased minimum wage, but it will help create grow the economy and \ncreate jobs. Allowing small business owners to immediately expense \ncritical investments encourages the purchase of new equipment, which \nhelps to spur economic growth. New equipment for small businesses also \nusually leads to greater efficiency. And putting more money back into \nthe hands of small business owners allows them to hire new workers.\n  During this minimum wage debate, a lot of my colleagues have talked \nabout the economic challenges facing working families. I can't think of \na better way to help low-income Americans than passing legislation that \nhelps grow the economy and create new jobs, and that's what this \namendment would do. I applaud my colleague from Arizona for offering \nthis amendment and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, before the Senate votes on the second\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\namendment by Senator Kyl, the amendment is not offset, not paid for. It \nwould add about $2 billion to our Federal deficit. The Senate rejected \na Kyl amendment last week that was similar. I admire the Senator's \npersistence. He is a firm subscriber to the proverb that if at first \nyou don't succeed, try, try again. I admire that very much.\n  But there is also another reference, I think, from Ecclesiastes, that \nessentially there is a time and place for everything. This is not the \ntime and this is not the place to pass this amendment, which adds $2 \nbillion to the national deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion I am about to make, which \nis to table the amendment. The underlying amendment not only is not \npaid for, it is unbalanced. We had it packaged together here, and we \nvoted on similar amendments, and it is time to get on with final \npassage of the minimum wage bill. That is what Americans are looking \nfor. They want to increase the minimum wage. We should no longer dally \nhere, with no disrespect for my colleague from Arizona. We are working \non amendments that we worked on, that we had votes on.\n  I will make the motion and urge my colleagues to vote to table the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me use the last minute of my time, and then I will yield \nto the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually, the time of the Senator has expired \non the minority side.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on my leader time, I yield a minute \nto the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I simply wanted to respond to the point the \nchairman of the committee just made, which is that this is not offset. \nThe reason there is no pay-go point of order against this amendment is \nbecause the Baucus substitute already extends section 179 small \nbusiness expensing through 2010 and includes the necessary offsets to \ncover 2010. This amendment merely extends that through 2012, years in \nwhich the pay-go scorecard has more than sufficient allocation to cover \nany revenue that Joint Tax projects would not be collected in those \nyears. That is why there is no point of order and why we believe this \nis a fiscally responsible way to assist small business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, using some of my leader time, \nRepublicans worked hard this week to make sure we pass a minimum wage \nbill that gives everybody a lift--the American worker who earns the \nwage and the American worker who pays it. The Kyl amendment reflects \nthis basic concern for the worker and the wage payer, and I encourage \nall of our colleagues to give it their full support.\n  This amendment will let American business men and women deduct the \ncost of tools and equipment the same year they buy it. This is clearly \ngood news for employers and for workers. By giving business men and \nwomen the freedom to deduct costs right away, fewer will be forced to \nchoose between new equipment and new hires. Republicans like Senator \nJon Kyl are working hard to make sure we have a bipartisan \naccomplishment with this bill. I urge all of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to give this amendment their full support.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask 1 minute on leader time on the \nmajority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is very simple. This amendment is not paid for. It is \nscored as a $2 billion additional hit to the deficit. It is not paid \nfor, let's make that clear.\n  Second, we are talking about extending what is called section 179, \nwhich is the small business expensing provisions in the law. The \nunderlying bill already extends 179 through 2010. It already does. This \nadds 2 more years at the cost of $2 billion. We have time, maybe this \nyear or next, to extend it when we can pay for it at the appropriate \ntime.\n  But, again, the underlying bill very clearly takes care of small \nbusiness expensing needs by extending 179 through 2010. Second, it is \nnot paid for. We should not adopt this amendment.\n  Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from \nMaryland has the floor.\n\n\n                        Cloned Food Labeling Act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Madam President. I rise today to \ntalk about a bill I introduced last week. It is called the Cloned Food \nLabeling Act.\n  My colleagues would be shocked to realize that the FDA has announced \nthat meat and milk products from cloned animals are safe for human \nconsumption. My bill will require the Government to label any food that \ncomes from a cloned animal or its progeny. My colleagues need to know I \nam strongly opposed to the FDA approving meat and milk products from \ncloned animals entering into our food supply, and I am not the only \none. Most Americans actively oppose it, and scientists say we should \nmonitor it. But the FDA decided food from cloned animals is safe to \neat. And since the FDA decided it is safe, the FDA will not require it \nto be labeled as coming from a cloned animal or its progeny.\n  Now, the American people don't want it. They find it repugnant. \nGallup polls report over 60 percent of Americans think it is immoral to \nclone animals, and the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology found a \nsimilar percentage say that, despite FDA approval, they won't buy \ncloned milk. But what troubles me is not only what public opinion says \nbut what the National Academy of Sciences says. They reported that--so \nfar--studies show no problems with food from cloned animals. But they \nalso admit it is a brand-new science. What about the unintended \nconsequences? They caution the\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nFederal Government and recommend this technology be monitored for \npotential health effects and urge diligent post-market surveillance. \nWell, you can't do post-market surveillance if the food is not labeled. \nHow do you know where the cloned food is?\n  So the FDA tells us once they determine it is safe, they will allow \nthe food to enter the market, unidentified, unlabeled, and unbeknownst \nto us, and I find it unacceptable. Consumers would not be able to tell \nwhich food came from a cloned animal. So, here we have a picture of \nDolly--the first cloned animal. Hello, Dolly! We say: Hello, Dolly. You \nhave been approved for our food supply. Hello, Dolly. Welcome to the \nworld of the Dolly burger. Hello, Dolly. Welcome home to Dolly in a \nglass. Hello, Dolly. Welcome to this plate of special cloned lamb chops \nwhen you are celebrating the 25th anniversary for your wife. I say: \nGoodbye, Dolly, the FDA's approval was baa, baa, baa.\n\n  I can't stop this from being approved by FDA, but I want an informed \npublic to know what they have before them. Most Americans do not want \nthis. They should not be required to eat it. I don't think they should \nbe required to eat it without knowing what it is. Therefore, my \nlegislation says any cloned food or its progeny would have to be \nlabeled at the wholesale level, at the retail level, and at the \nrestaurant level. This would ensure informed consent. To help the \nAmerican public make this informed decision, I introduced a bill to \nrequire that all food which comes from a cloned animal or its progeny \nbe labeled. This legislation will require the FDA and the Department of \nAgriculture to label all food that comes from a cloned animal. The \nlabel simply would read, ``THIS PRODUCT IS FROM A CLONED ANIMAL OR ITS \nPROGENY.'' The public would be able to decide which food they want to \nbuy--and I mean all food, not just packages in a supermarket but also \nthe meals they choose from a menu.\n  Now, the FDA has responsibility to guarantee the safety of our food. \nAlthough many aspects of food safety are beyond their control, this is \nnot. Scientists and the American people have the right to know. \nConsumers need to know which food is cloned and the scientists need to \nbe able to monitor it. We don't know the long-term effect of cloned \nanimals in our food supply.\n  What factors influenced the decision to deem food from cloned animals \nsafe? Are they allowing an eager industry to force questionable science \non an unknowing public? I am not so sure.\n  The FDA used to be the gold standard, but we have heard ``it is \nsafe'' for too long. What if they are wrong? We were told asbestos was \nsafe. Do you want asbestos in your home? We were told DDT was safe. Do \nyou want to be sprayed with DDT? We were told thalidomide was safe. No \npregnant woman today would take it. We were told Vioxx was safe. Does \nanyone with a heart condition or high cholesterol want to take it? I \ndon't think so. We have been down this road before regarding the safety \nof products.\n  When it is so unclear and so uncertain, I am saying let's take our \ntime. If America doesn't keep track of this from the very beginning \nwith clear and dependable labeling, our entire food supply could be \ncontaminated. I worry about what happens to the consumer. I worry about \nit being eaten by ordinary folks. I worry about it being in our school \nlunch program. I worry about it because we do not know enough.\n  In Europe, they call this type of stuff ``Frankenfood.'' I worry, \nthen, that because it will be unlabeled, more of our exports will be \nbanned. My State depends on the export of food--whether it is seafood \nor chicken or other products. I don't want to hear one more thing \ncoming out of the EU about not wanting to buy our beef or our lamb \nbecause they are worried that it is Frankenfood. We need to be able to \nexport our food. If it is labeled, we will be able to do that.\n  At the end of the day, I want our consumers to have informed consent, \nscientists to be able to monitor this, and Congress to be able to \nprovide FDA oversight. I reject the notion that FDA or anyone else \nshould allow this to go forward without some type of declaration about \nwhat it really is.\n  Please, when we see this creature, Dolly, in this photograph--I don't \nknow its purpose; I don't know what it accomplishes. We do not have a \nshortage of food in our country; we don't have a shortage of milk in \nour country. For those people who want to produce Dolly, we can't stop \nit, but I do think we should stop the FDA from putting this into our \nfood supply without labeling and without an informed consent.\n  I say bah, bah, bah to those who want to bring this into our food \nsupply.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my understanding is that the pending business \nis amendment No. 115.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending question.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will briefly describe this amendment. It \nextends for an additional period of time three provisions of the Tax \nCode that relate to smaller businesses that the Committee on Finance \nagreed should have this tax relief and provides for a more balanced \nbill in terms of the extension of the tax provisions. It deals with \nleaseholds and restaurant renovations, new restaurant construction and \nowner-occupied retail. It is identical to an amendment the Senate \ntabled last week except that it drops the revenue offset since Senator \nBaucus had identified that offset as the primary problem he had with \nthe amendment.\n  Specifically, it would extend three provisions of the Small Business \nand Work Opportunity Act of 2007 through the end of 2008. The three \nprovisions are the 15-year recovery period for leasehold improvements \nin restaurant renovations, as current law provides they run through the \nyear 2007; 15-year recovery for new restaurant construction, which is a \nnew provision; and another new provision, 15-year recovery period for \nretail improvements.\n  My chart shows what we have done in the Committee on Finance and what \nI am proposing here. These are the three provisions covered by the \namendment before the Senate at this time. We have added the two new \nprovisions in green for new restaurants and retail, and we have \nextended the leasehold and restaurant provision by 3 months. All three \nof these would expire at the end of March of next year. What we do in \nthis amendment is extend them through the end of the year. The reason \nshould be obvious: For businesses to plan ahead, they need a little bit \nof lead time. To provide only a 3-month extension, for example, is not \nvery much tax relief.\n\n  We all acknowledge that the point of this relief in the first place, \nwhich the committee unanimously agreed to, was to help small business \nbe able to offset the cost of the minimum wage increase. If we are \ngoing to do that, it should be meaningful. This amendment simply \nextends from a 3-month period to the end of the year and extends the \ntwo new provisions as well through the end of 2009.\n  Let me describe each of these three provisions.\n  The leaseholds and restaurant renovation provision under current law \nare depreciated over a 15-year period, but this treatment only applies \nto property placed in service by the end of 2007. The amendment that \ncame out of the Committee on Finance, the Baucus Committee on Finance \nsubstitute, would extend this 15-year recovery period by 3 months for \nproperty placed in service by March 31, 2008.\n  Under the two new provisions, new restaurant construction, there is \ncurrently no law provision allowing for accelerated depreciation of new \nrestaurant construction, and the Baucus Committee on Finance substitute \nprovides to correct this problem with a 15-year recovery period for \nsuch new restaurants. It is an important and necessary change, but it \nonly, under the Committee on Finance bill, provides the treatment from \nthe date of enactment through March 31, 2008.\n  And the same thing for owner-occupied retail. There is currently no \nprovision allowing for accelerated depreciation of improvements made to \nowner-occupied retail space. The Baucus Committee on Finance provides a \n15-year\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nrecovery period for improvements made to such spaces, thus putting \nthese establishments on the same footing as leasehold. The bill \nprovides this treatment from the date of enactment through March 31, \n2008.\n  The committee had recognized the importance of these depreciation \nperiods for owner-occupied retail, new restaurant construction, and \nleaseholds and restaurant renovations. There is no dispute about that, \nno debate about that. The only question is how far the relief should be \nextended.\n  While obviously everyone appreciates in this case the 3-month \nextension, it is hardly enough to be able to say to these small \nbusinesses: We solved your problem; we put a big burden of paying for \nthe minimum wage increase on you, but we have enabled you to offset \nthat by depreciating your property more quickly and being able to plan \nfor your future construction needs. Clearly, that provision does not do \nthe trick. Even these two new provisions, as welcome as they are, only \nextend the relief through March of next year. Again, what my amendment \ndoes is extend it through the end of the year. That is all it does.\n  Let me illustrate the importance of the tax provisions that the \nFinance Committee passed and which we are seeking to extend by this \namendment.\n  If you stop and think about it, the policy justification for a 39-\nyear depreciation recovery period for new construction of a restaurant, \nfor example, makes no sense at all. How many of you know of any \nrestaurant that has not done a thing to the restaurant for 39 years? If \nyou are in the restaurant business, you have to constantly upgrade your \nfacilities. Certainly, your kitchen facilities have to be upgraded. And \nnew construction and renovation should obviously be treated the same \nway.\n  Under this bill, they are given a 15-year depreciation schedule. Now, \nthat is the same depreciation schedule as for convenience stores, of \ncourse--a direct competitor of quick-service restaurants. They can use \nthe 15-year depreciation schedule for all construction, new or \nrenovation. Under their provision of the Tax Code, it is permanent law, \nso we do not have to extend it each year.\n  So what the Finance Committee has done is to try to bring some sense \nof balance and fairness into the code to treat like properties in a \nlike way. If you are a fast-food restaurant, it does not matter whether \nyou are a convenience store or regular restaurant, whether you build \nthe place new or you simply spend the money to renovate, the expense of \nwhat you have done should be depreciated over the same period of time.\n  Fifteen years is probably too long, but that is the period that has \nbeen selected. It should be the same for all. By allowing restaurateurs \nto deduct the cost of renovations and new construction on this shorter \nschedule, many more restaurant owners will be in a position to grow \ntheir business and to continue to create more jobs. That is the key to \noffsetting the expenses of the minimum wage.\n  By definition, encouraging more new restaurants to be built means \nmore new restaurant jobs. That is a tautology. This is important \nbecause the restaurant industry is uniquely impacted by a minimum wage \nincrease. Of the nearly 2 million workers earning the minimum wage, 60 \npercent work in the food service industry. Furthermore, the last time \nCongress increased the minimum wage, 146,000 jobs were cut from \nrestaurant industry payrolls, according to information from the \nindustry. That is why this provision I am offering today is so \nimportant. The very people who are going to bear the impact--namely, \nthe workers in restaurants, who could see their jobs evaporate as a \nresult of passage of the minimum wage increase--will find that their \njob is going to be OK when their restaurant can expand or build a new \nrestaurant, thus creating more new jobs.\n  Instead of having to lay people off in order to pay the increased \nminimum wage, the businesses will be able to create more jobs and, \ntherefore, everyone would be able to be employed by them. This is the \ntheory. The Finance Committee agrees with the theory by adopting these \ntwo new provisions and extending the existing provision for 3 months. \nBut as I said before, it did not do the job well enough.\n  This is very modest relief and hardly gives a restaurant, for \nexample, the confidence it can continue to make improvements and \nreceive the favorable tax treatment, the 15-year writeoff provision we \nare providing in the law. That is why it is important to continue to \nextend it. It would be nice if it were permanent, as it is for \nconvenience stores. That is what it should be. It would be nice, as \nunder the work opportunity tax credit, if it went out through the year \n2012 or 2013. That would be nice. We are simply taking it to the end of \nthe year 2009. That is not too much to ask to help these small \nbusinesses.\n  Let me just note a couple of the objections that came from the \nchairman. The first had to do with so-called balancing of the work \nopportunity tax credit and the tax relief for small businesses. Now, \nthe work opportunity tax credit, as you can see with this red line on \nthe chart, the committee bill went to the end of 2012. And these others \nonly go through March of 2009. That is hardly balanced. Moreover, all \nof these provisions have always attracted bipartisan support.\n  It is not like the work opportunity tax credit is a Democratic \nprovision and the retail improvements are a Republican provision. We \nhave all supported both provisions. Both make sense. We understand \nthat. So it is not like somehow there has to be a partisan reason to \nsupport this but not support this, or this or this, as shown on the \nchart. We do not need partisan politics injected into this debate. So \nthere is no reason now to politicize these issues, characterizing them \nas Republican or Democrat.\n  It is obvious the bill is not balanced. Even if you assume there \nshould be some balance, the work opportunity tax credit, as I noted, is \nextended for 5 years, while the accelerated depreciation for leasehold \nand restaurant improvements is extended for a 3-month period.\n  As I noted before, the primary objection of the chairman before was \nover the offset. I understand that. It was a somewhat controversial \noffset. Of course, in the committee, when I offered this amendment, the \nchairman said unless I had an offset, it would be declared out of \norder. So we looked for and thought we had an offset that would be \napproved. But it turned out the chairman did not like that offset. That \nwas his primary objection to this provision. So we will simply remove \nthat offset and provide that we will extend the provisions for another \n9 months through the end of 2009, without an offset of any tax \nincrease.\n  But let me just make this point. We are talking about a very \ntemporary extension of an important tax provision. This leasehold and \nrestaurant provision has been in existence now for some time. We are \nextending it all of 3 months. Yet under the theory of those who say it \nhas to be offset by a new tax increase, we would have to permanently \nfind a source of revenue that would pay for this 3-month extension. \nThat is a perversion of the pay-go concept. It is inappropriate, \nespecially for provisions that generate jobs.\n  We should not have to pass a permanent tax increase in order to be \nable to fund a temporary provision of the Tax Code that helps to create \nnew jobs. As I said before, when you build a new restaurant, you are \ncreating new jobs. That is obvious. And when you create new jobs, you \ncan better afford to hire the people who would be at the minimum wage, \n60 percent of whom are in the restaurant business, and there is a job \nthere for them.\n  So it makes sense to extend these provisions. The work opportunity \ntax credit, as beneficial as it might be, does not create new jobs. So \nif anything, you would want to balance with more emphasis on these \nthree provisions than you would under the work opportunity tax credit.\n\n  So I guess the bottom line of this is that the reason for objecting \nto this provision, based on the lack of an offset, does not make sense \nin terms of practical economics, given the fact that the provisions \nthat we would extend in 2008 are job creators and would create the very \njobs that people earning the minimum wage could then move into.\n  Without the creation of these new jobs, some businesses are going to \nhave to lay people off, and there will not be\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\njobs for them. This would provide for those jobs.\n  Mr. President, I guess the bottom line is this: We have seen, \nunfortunately, the debate over these amendments break down along \nprimarily party lines. I think that is very unfortunate because a small \nbusiness owner can be a Republican, a Democrat, or anybody else. They \ncreate the bulk of jobs in our society. They pay a huge amount of the \ntaxes. They will be the ones most hard hit by the increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  If we pass a minimum wage increase with bipartisan support, it seems \nto me we should follow the leadership of the Finance Committee in \nextending these tax provisions in a bipartisan way. And when we only \nextend a provision for 3 months, to me, it is not a good-faith \nrecognition of the problem we have placed on that small business by the \nimposition of the minimum wage mandate. We need to keep faith with \nthose businesses by providing a longer extension of the tax provisions \nthat benefit them in a way that enables them to pay for this minimum \nwage increase. That is how we would be keeping faith with these small \nbusinesses.\n  So I hope we can eschew the partisanship that has characterized the \nprevious votes, we can appreciate the importance of extending these \nprovisions which, after all, were created in a totally bipartisan way \nin the Finance Committee, and we can recognize it is possible to both \nraise the minimum wage for low-income workers and help create new jobs \nfor them with these tax provisions.\n  I hope when it comes time to consider a motion to table this \nparticular provision that my colleagues will vote against a motion to \ntable or support the provisions if we have the opportunity for an up-\nor-down vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today President Bush called for \nrenewal of fast-track trade negotiating authority, otherwise known as \ntrade promotion authority, otherwise known as TPA. Fast-track authority \nexpires 6 months from today. Many view this date with fear and \ntrepidation. I do not. I view it as an opportunity to take a hard look \nat the direction of America's trade policy. It is an opportunity to air \ndifferences and an opportunity to find common ground.\n  Trade policy is a bargain, a bargain struck between the American \nGovernment and the American people. Americans trust their Government to \nuse trade policy to expand export opportunities, create jobs, to fuel \nour economy. In exchange for that trust, Americans expect their \nGovernment to make sure that trade works for them, and they expect \ntheir Government to take action when it does not. That is the \nfundamental debate in which we, as a nation, must engage. Does trade \nwork for the American farmer, rancher? Does trade work for American \nfactory workers? Does trade work for the American economy?\n  I believe it does. I believe trade creates opportunities. I believe \ntrade generates American jobs. I believe trade bolsters our global \ncompetitiveness. I believe trade allows us to project America's values \nto the world. And I believe the alternative, erecting barriers to \ntrade, is self-defeating and will not make anyone better off. That is \nwhy, during my years in Congress, I have long supported granting the \nPresident fast-track authority. The success of America's ranches and \nfarms, the success of businesses big and small, requires that the \nPresident have this authority.\n  Twelve million American jobs depend on exports. Exports account for a \ntenth of our country's gross domestic product. Montana exports 60 \npercent of the wheat grown there.\n  But there are other voices. Many have deep and legitimate concerns \nabout the effect of trade and globalization. Many equate trade with \nballooning deficits, stagnating wages, and job layoffs. Many view the \ngrowth of China and India as threats rather than as opportunities. Many \npoint to abhorrent labor and environmental conditions in some of our \ntrading partners. And many no longer trust the Government to do its \npart to take care of the Americans whom trade leaves behind.\n  These concerns are real. They are deeply felt. And we cannot ignore \nthem. True leadership requires that we address these concerns head on. \nThe expiration of trade promotion authority allows us to have this \ndebate. It reminds us we cannot consider renewal of this authority in a \nvacuum. It underscores the paramount importance of restoring America's \nfaith and confidence in our trade policy, a huge opportunity. In the \nprocess, we will examine a series of critical issues. These are issues \nwe must address as we consider whether to reauthorize trade promotion \nauthority.\n  First, we must make trade adjustment assistance, otherwise known as \nTAA, more reflective of today's innovative economy. TAA is America's \ncommitment to provide wage and health benefits while trade-displaced \nworkers retool, retrain, and find better jobs. A renewed TAA must do \nwhat today's program does not. It must be made available to the 8 out \nof 10 American workers who make their money in service professions. It \nmust apply to all workers displaced by trade, not just those affected \nby free-trade agreements. The time has come to consider other ways to \nhelp workers displaced not just by trade but by other aspects of \nglobalization, including the advance of technology.\n  Second, we have to address concerns that our trade agreements \nencourage companies to move jobs to countries where substandard labor \nand environmental policies occur. We need to find common cause with \nthose who abhor child and sweatshop labor anywhere. We need to \nacknowledge the justifiable ends of those who want to employ trade to \nhelp stop despoliation of the planet. We project our values as \nAmericans when we use our trade agreements to create a race to the top. \nAs our trade agreements require our partners to step up their \nprotection of investments and intellectual property, so our agreements \nshould lead to improvements in our partners' labor and environmental \nprotections.\n  Third, we cannot conclude more trade agreements without giving \nAmericans the confidence that we vigorously enforce those agreements \nalready on the books. Too many of our partners cheat and maintain bogus \nbarriers against American exports. For example, look at Korea's \nunscientific ban on beef; look at the illegal subsidies China grants to \nits manufacturers. But the trade-enforcement tools that Congress \ncreated in the 1970s and 1980s, such as section 301, are outdated. They \nno longer function as intended. It is time to take a hard look at these \ntools. We should redraft them so they better address the trade barriers \nthat American exporters face in today's global economy.\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\n  Fourth, we cannot expect Americans to support trade when they see \never-ballooning trade deficits. Our trade deficit with China this year \nwill approach $300 billion. That is unsustainable. We need to get our \nbalance sheet back in line. That requires us to boost U.S. exports \nthrough better enforcement and better export promotion. That requires \nus to call out countries such as China, possibly even Japan, that use \nthe value of their currency to gain a trade advantage. And it means \naction at home to improve public and private savings.\n\n  Fifth, a successful trade policy means that America must be the most \ncompetitive nation in the world. American workers need to know they can \ncompete and they can win on a global playing field. And we need to take \na good, hard look at how health care costs, our education system, and \ntax policies affect America's global competitiveness. As I did in the \nlast Congress, I will push competitiveness at every opportunity. I will \nwork for passage of legislation that will guarantee America's economic \npreeminence for years to come.\n  With trade promotion authority about to expire, the locus of trade \npolicy shifts back to Congress. We have both the opportunity and \nresponsibility to create the next trade policy that will guide us and \nguide this country forward. We need to work together, clearly, \nobviously, on trade to find answers to the hard questions. We need to \nwork together on trade to shore up our international leadership, sorely \nneeded. And most of all, we need to work together on trade to restore \nour bargain with the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Before the Senate today is the exact same amendment \noffered by my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, that the Senate \nrejected last Thursday. The only difference is that Senator Kyl has \nmodified the amendment to make it even more pernicious; that is, by \nremoving the offset. Thus, the pending amendment would add nearly \nanother $3 billion to the deficit in the next 10 years.\n  The Senate rejected the Kyl amendment last week, but we are here yet \nagain today considering these same issues. This time around, my \ncolleague does not attempt to offset those cuts. Rather, his amendments \nwould put another $3 billion hole in our budget. The amendment would \npile onto a deficit that we are desperately trying to erase.\n  Many of us support the policy behind these provisions. We would not \nhave included them in our bill if we did not. As I told the Senator \nfrom Arizona at our committee markup, if we could have made these \nprovisions permanent, I certainly would have done so. But the \nunderlying substitute amendment is the product of a Finance Committee \nhearing, deliberation, and markup. It is balanced. It is revenue \nneutral. And all Members supported it--it passed unanimously--including \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  Senators made compromises to get this bill to the floor, and we have \ndone so. I must say, though, I admire the persistence of my good friend \nfrom Arizona. He is the original ``energy bunny'' of tax cut \namendments. I commend him for that. But he was not successful in \ncommittee, and he was not successful on the floor last week. I hope and \ntrust that that was because the Senate would like to provide a balanced \npackage of tax incentives. I hope and trust that the Senate wants a \npackage that does not worsen our deficit. Therefore, I oppose adding \nanother $3 billion in tax provisions to this already $8 billion bill. \nThe $8 billion is paid for. The amendment by the Senator would add \nanother $3 billion and that would not be paid for.\n  At the appropriate time, I intend to raise a budget point of order \nagainst the amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe motion to waive that point of order, which I assume will occur in \nnot too many minutes from now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 505(a) of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004. On behalf of Senator \nKyl, I move to waive the applicable provisions for the consideration of \nthe amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before the cloture vote on the bill.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of cloture \non the\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\nunderlying bill. I appreciate the wise direction that this body has \ndecided upon with regard to the minimum wage. We have correctly \nconcluded that raising the minimum wage without providing relief for \nthe small businesses that must pay for that increase is simply not an \noption. I hope this is an approach that our colleagues in the House \nwill not derail. This approach recognizes that small businesses have \nbeen the steady engine of our growing economy and they have been the \nsource of new job creation. It, also, recognizes that small businesses \nin every sense of the phrase are middle class families too.\n  I am proud the body has chosen a path which attempts to preserve this \nsegment of the economy which employs so many working men and women and \ntrains them. The Senate has recognized the simple fact that a raise in \nthe minimum wage is of no benefit to a worker without a job or a job \nseeker without a prospect.\n  As this Congress moves forward, we will need to confront a range of \nissues facing working families. Lessons in this debate should not be \nforgotten as we approach complex issues. Yesterday, we were referencing \nthe so-called war on the middle class. That is partisan rhetoric which \nwas never accurate and is now simply divisive. Who is more middle class \nthan America's small business men and women? Tax relief to the middle-\nclass small business owners who must pay the cost of this wage increase \nmandate is no attack on the middle class. An attack would be passing \nthe bill without such tax relief.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been 8 days--8 days since we \nstarted this debate on the minimum wage. Every Member of this body has \nmade $4,500, and yet we haven't been able to get an increase in the \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. Forty-five hundred dollars, everyone \nhas made in this body, but minimum wage workers have still been denied. \nEight days.\n  How long does it take? How long does it take for this body to be able \nto say: Yes, we are going to increase the minimum wage. How many more \namendments are over there on the Republican side? We have none. We are \nprepared to vote on final passage right now. But oh, no, we can't do \nthat. There should be no doubt in the minds of working families, of the \nmiddle class, who is standing for those who are earning the minimum \nwage.\n  Since we started this debate, there have been thousands of meals that \nhave been served in nursing homes. There have been thousands of beds \nthat have been made in hotels around this country. There are 6 million \nchildren who will benefit from this increase in the minimum wage, who \ncan't afford books to read, who can't afford to buy a present to go to \na birthday party, and who can't spend enough time with their parents, \nbecause their parents are working 2 or 3 jobs. Today there are 50,000 \nwives or husbands of soldiers serving in our armed forces who are \nearning the minimum wage. We can do a favor for those individuals and \ntreat them with respect and dignity by voting for the increase in the \nminimum wage. We ought to do that right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vote on final passage \nright now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have a process that is set up and a vote \nthat is called for, and I think we ought to follow that process. I \nthink we have made a lot of progress, and as long as we continue to \nhave progress in a bipartisan way, this will make it through the \nprocess. It has been something everybody pledged themselves to early, \nand I hope we haven't broken that pledge. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the vote is called, I wish to alert \neveryone here that the distinguished Republican leader and I are \nnegotiating, trying to work something out on Iraq, which is the next \nissue we will go to when we finish this bill, which will be tomorrow \nsometime. It is very possible we are going to have a vote Monday at \nnoon on the Iraq issue--everyone should understand that--Monday at \nnoon. We hope that be can avoided, but we may not be able to avoid it. \nThe Republican leader and I are doing our best to work something out. \nWe have had a number of meetings, and we will continue to do that \nthroughout the day.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last October, my alma mater, Georgetown \nLaw Center, established an endowed chair in human rights in honor of \nFather Robert Drinan. At the ceremony, Yale Law School Dean Harold Koh \ncalled Robert Drinan ``a father in more senses than one.'' Dean Koh \nsaid:\n\n       He is the father of a remarkable revolution--a human rights \n     revolution--a person of simple, radical faith.\n\n  Sunday night, at the age of 86, Robert Drinan died. The world has \nloss a courageous champion for justice, human rights, and human \ndignity.\n  I just missed Father Drinan. I graduated from Georgetown Law before \nhe joined the faculty, and he left Congress before I arrived. So I \nnever had the chance to study and work with him directly. But like a \nlot of others, I was inspired and challenged by him.\n  Georgetown University estimates that Father Drinan taught 6,000 \nstudents in a teaching career that stretched over more than five \ndecades. But those are just the students who enrolled in his classes at \nBoston College and, later, at Georgetown. In fact, he taught a lot of \npeople. He taught all of us about the responsibility each of us has to \nspeak out for the voiceless and the oppressed, not just to speak, but \nto work for justice.\n  In the 1960s, as dean of Boston College Law School, Father Drinan \nshowed courage by calling for the desegregation of Boston's public \nschools. He challenged his students at the law school to become active \nin the civil rights movement.\n  In 1970, the people of Boston's western suburbs elected Father Drinan \nto represent them in Congress, making him the first Catholic priest \never to serve as a voting Member of Congress. He ran as a strong \nopponent of the Vietnam war. He was the first Member of Congress to \ncall for the impeachment of Richard Nixon, but not over Watergate, \nrather over the undeclared war against Cambodia. He fought to make \nhuman rights the cornerstone of American foreign policy and to \nestablish a bureau for human rights within the U.S. State Department. \nHe fought against government abuses of power and led a successful \nbattle to finally abolish the House Internal Security Committee, \nformerly the Un-American Activities Committee, which we recall was \nresponsible for so many unjust findings by this Congress, ruining the \nprivate lives of so many American citizens.\n\n  In 1975, he became the first American to receive his own CIA and FBI \nfiles under the Freedom of Information Act. With Congressman Frank \nChurch and others, he worked to safeguard our right to privacy.\n  Father Drinan was elected to five terms in Congress, each time by \nlarger margins. Finally, in his last race in 1978, he didn't have an \nopponent. He would have been reelected again in 1980, but he was forced \nto step down when Pope John Paul II barred Catholic priests from \nholding elective office. Father Drinan left office, but he never left \nthe struggle. He continued to work and speak out for justice until the \nday he died.\n  In 1981, he took a post at Georgetown Law Center where he taught \nhuman rights, civil liberties, and government ethics. He taught his \nstudents that the central commandment of the Bible is that ``the people \nof God must be devoted to justice in every way.'' He taught that it is \na sin that 31,000 children die of starvation every day in this world. \nHe urged his students, all of us: ``Sharpen your anger at injustice.'' \nUse the talents God gave you to make this world better.\n  Two months ago Father Drinan told a reporter that he hadn't given any \nthought to retiring; there was just too much left to do. And, he said, \n``Jesuits don't ordinarily retire. We just do what you do.''\n  Earlier this month Father Drinan was called on for a particularly \nsymbolic ceremony. He celebrated Mass for Speaker  Nancy Pelosi at her \nalma mater in Washington, Trinity College. It was a special mass in \nhonor of ``the children of Darfur and Katrina.''\n  Father Drinan spoke to our conscience. He spoke for the overlooked \nand underpaid, for those who were too poor or too weak to speak for \nthemselves. He spoke out in passionate defense of the great moral and \npolitical values of our Nation.\n  In his lifetime he received many awards. Last May he received \nCongress's Distinguished Service Award for his service in the House. \nThe American Bar Association honored him with the ABA medal for his \nwork on behalf of human rights. He was a founder of the Lawyers \nAlliance for Nuclear Arms Control; president of Americans for \nDemocratic Action; a member of the national board of Common Cause, \nPeople for the American Way, the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, \nthe National Interreligious Task force on Soviet Jewry, the American \nCivil Liberties Union, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n  He received 22 honorary degrees from colleges and universities. One \nof those degrees, given to him by Villanova University in 1977, hung on \nthe wall of his office in the House of Representatives. It read:\n\n       Your life's work has provided proof that service to God and \n     country are not inimical.\n\n  How true.\n  In his sermon on the mount, Jesus told us:\n\n       Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after justice: for \n     they shall have their fill.\n\n  Robert Drinan is, indeed, blessed, and we were blessed to have him \nserving America for so many years. Those of us who admired him and \nloved him were saddened by his death. But we take comfort in knowing \nthat just as his influence in Congress has lasted beyond those 10 years \nof service, Robert Drinan's influence on this world will continue to be \nfelt long after we are all gone.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1381-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1381-S1391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SEC INVESTIGATION FINDINGS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very happy to be on the floor with \nmy colleague Senator Specter on something we have worked on together \nover a long period of time, and it falls very much into the category of \ncongressional oversight. I am not going to go into the details now \nbecause I have a statement I want to use as a basis for our \ncooperation, and then you will hear from Senator Specter. I want to say \nhow great it was to work with Senator Specter.\n  We are here to update the Senate on the interim Finance Committee \nfindings of the joint investigation into the Securities and Exchange \nCommission that was conducted by the Finance Committee on the one hand, \nand the Judiciary Committee on the other, during the 109th Congress.\n  Before I go into details, there is another person I would thank for \nhis cooperation. I want to take this opportunity to thank Securities \nand Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox for his cooperation in \nproviding access to thousands of pages of documents, as well as \ninterviews with the staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nChairman Cox's cooperation was very essential to our ability to conduct \nour constitutionally mandated oversight of Federal agencies.\n  That said, I hope Chairman Cox takes today's findings to heart and \nwill work to implement recommendations Senator Specter and I plan to \nput forth into the forthcoming final report.\n  Today, we want to update the Senate on some of the details of our \ninvestigation, which began early last year when allegations were \npresented to our staffs by former Securities and Exchange Commission \nattorney Gary Aguirre. Mr. Aguirre described the roadblocks he faced in \npursuing an insider trading investigation while he was employed as a \nsenior enforcement attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nSpecifically, he alleged his supervisor prevented him from taking the \ntestimony of a prominent Wall Street figure because of his ``political \nclout,'' which obviously should not be ignored if an agency is doing \nthe job they should be doing.\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\n  Well, after Mr. Aguirre complained about that sort of preferential \ntreatment given to somebody with ``political clout,'' his supervisors \nterminated him from the SEC while he was on vacation.\n  The interim findings we released today outlined the three primary \nconcerns shared by Senator Specter and me. First, the SEC's \ninvestigation into Pequot Capital Management was plagued with problems \nfrom its beginning to its abrupt conclusion. Second, the termination of \nMr. Aguirre by the SEC was highly suspect given the timing and the \ncircumstances. Thirdly, the original investigation conducted by the SEC \nOffice of Inspector General was both seriously and fatally flawed. The \ninspector general's failure required our committees to take a more \nthorough look at Mr. Aguirre's allegations and examine this matter \nclosely. Taken together, these findings paint a picture of a troubled \nagency that faces serious questions about public confidence, the \nintegrity of its investigations, and its ability to protect all \ninvestors, large and small, with an even hand.\n  The SEC should have taken Mr. Aguirre's allegations more seriously \nand very seriously. Instead, it does like too many agencies do when \nunder fire: it circled the wagons and it shot a whistleblower--an all \ntoo familiar practice in Washington, DC. As we know, whistleblowers are \nabout as welcome as a skunk at a picnic.\n  There is more information to follow and more details that need to \ncome to light. Senator Specter and I together plan on releasing a \ncomprehensive report in the near future. For now, I hope these interim \nfindings will spur the SEC to consider meaningful reforms. I urge all \nmy colleagues to read these important interim findings and to read the \nfinal report when it is made available.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, for his outstanding work on \nthe issues which he has just addressed. Senator Grassley and I have a \nlong record of working together. We were elected together in November \n1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan. There were 16 members of the \nincoming class of Republican Senators at that time. Two Democrats were \nelected.\n  In the intervening years, Senator Grassley and I have become the sole \nsurvivors, and we have done a great deal of work together.\n  We sit together on the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Grassley has \nhad a very distinguished record as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee during the 109th Congress, and I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee during the 109th Congress. We are making a presentation today \nof interim findings on the investigation into potential abuse of \nauthority at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  I join Senator Grassley in commending the Chairman of the SEC, \nChristopher Cox, for his cooperation, and I also join Senator Grassley \nin urging Chairman Cox and the SEC to do more. The oversight which our \ntwo committees undertook constituted a review of over 9,000 pages of \ndocuments and the interviewing of 19 witnesses over the course of 24 \ninterviews.\n  The Judiciary Committee, on which we both serve, held a series of \nthree public hearings regarding this matter, most recently on December \n5, 2006, when the committee heard detailed sworn testimony from current \nand former SEC employees involved in the so-called Pequot \ninvestigation.\n  Based upon our review of the evidence, we have serious concerns, \nwhich are documented in a lengthy report, which we will make a part of \nthe record, plus supplemental documents. Our investigation has raised \nconcerns about, first, the SEC's mishandling of the Pequot \ninvestigation before, during, and after the firing of Mr. Gary Aguirre; \nsecondly, the circumstances under which Mr. Aguirre was terminated; and \nthird, the manner in which the SEC's Inspector General's Office handled \nMr. Aguirre's allegations after he was fired.\n  Viewing these concerns as a whole, we believe a very troubling \npicture evolves. At best, the picture shows extraordinarily lax \nenforcement by the SEC, and it may even indicate a coverup by the SEC. \nWe are concerned, first of all, as detailed in this report, that the \nSEC failed to act on the GE/Heller trades for years. We are concerned \nabout the suggestions of political power which was present in the \ninvestigation, which has all of the earmarks of a possible obstruction \nof justice.\n  There is sworn testimony by Mr. Gary Aguirre that he was told in a \nface-to-face meeting with his immediate supervisor, Branch Chief Robert \nHanson, that he could not take the testimony of Mr. John Mack, who was \nthought to have leaked confidential information. Mr. Aguirre testified \nthat Mr. Hanson refused to allow the taking of testimony, as Mr. \nAguirre pointed out, because of Mr. Mack's ``powerful political \ncontacts.''\n  Now, Mr. Hanson denied to the SEC inspector general and to the \ncommittee that he ever said that, but we have contemporaneous e-mails, \nfor example, where Mr. Hanson admitted to a very similar statement when \nhe wrote to Mr. Aguirre on August 24, 2005, ``Most importantly, the \npolitical clout I mentioned to you was a reason to keep Paul,'' \nreferring to a man named Paul Berger, ``and possibly Linda,'' referring \nto a woman named Linda Thomsen, ``in the loop on the testimony.'' Now, \nthat is conclusive proof of the political clout or at least what Mr. \nHanson thought was political clout when the SEC made a decision not to \npermit the taking of key testimony, the testimony of Mr. Mack.\n\n  Mr. Hanson submitted a written statement to the committee concluding \nthat it was ``highly suspect and illogical'' to link Mr. Mack as the \ntipper, but in his prior writings he said, in written form, ``Mack is \nanother bad guy.''\n  The rationale used by the SEC officials who denied Mr. Aguirre's \nrequest to take the testimony of Mr. Mack was that they wanted to get \n``their ducks in a row.'' But the overwhelming evidence in the matter \nshowed that the testimony should have been taken at a much earlier \nstage. There is no problem with taking testimony again if necessary at \na later stage.\n  A key SEC investigator, Mr. Hilton Foster, with knowledge of the \nPequot matter, said, ``As the SEC expert on insider trading, if people \nhad asked me, `When do you take his testimony,' I would have said take \nit yesterday.''\n  Mr. Joseph Cella, Chief of the SEC's Market Surveillance Commission, \ntold committee investigators, ``it seemed to me that it was a \nreasonable thing to do to bring Mack in and have him testify,'' and \n``in my mind there was no down side.''\n  Mr. Mack's testimony was taken 5 days after the statute of \nlimitations expired. But let me point out at this juncture that even \nthough the statute of limitations has expired, there is injunctive \nrelief and other action that can yet be taken by the SEC.\n  The problems with the Pequot investigation are amplified by the \nsuspect termination of Mr. Aguirre. On June 1, 2005, in a performance \nplan and evaluation, Mr. Aguirre was given an acceptable rating, and \nMr. Hanson, on June 29, 2005, noted Mr. Aguirre's ``unmatched \ndedication'' to the Pequot investigation and ``contributions of high \nquality.'' These evaluations were submitted to the SEC's Compensation \nCommittee, which later approved Mr. Hanson's recommendation on July 18. \nDespite these favorable reviews, Aguirre's supervisors wrote a so-\ncalled supplemental evaluation on August 1, and this reevaluation on \nAugust 1 occurred 5 days after Mr. Aguirre sent supervisor Berger an e-\nmail saying that he believed the Pequot investigation was being halted \nbecause of Mr. Mack's political power.\n  There was an investigation by the inspector general of the SEC, and \nin my years in the Senate and hearing many inspectors general testify, \nI can't recall hearing an inspector general who said less, did less, \nand was more thoroughly inadequate in the investigation. For example, \nthe inspector general's staff said, ``we don't second guess \nmanagement's decisions. We don't second guess why employees are \nterminated.'' Well, that is precisely the purpose of having an \ninspector general. The purpose of having an inspector general is to \nreview those kinds of decisions.\n  The inspector general testified that he was given advice by the \nDepartment of Justice, which made absolutely no sense. This appears in \nsome detail in the record.\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\n  Then the inspector general initiated an attempt to take what was \nreally punitive action against Mr. Aguirre by seeking enforcement of a \nsubpoena for documents which were involving Mr. Aguirre's \ncommunications with Congress. Now, how can an individual communicate, \ntalk to an oversight committee, such as the Judiciary Committee or the \nFinance Committee, if those communications are going to be subject to a \nsubpoena by the SEC, by the inspector general? It is just preposterous. \nWe have constitutional oversight responsibilities, and we obviously \ncannot conduct those responsibilities if the information we glean is \ngoing to be subject to somebody else's review.\n  The subpoena wasn't pursued, but the lack of judgment--and it is hard \nto find a strong enough word which is not insensitive to describe the \ninspector general's conduct in trying to subpoena the records of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. It just \nmade absolutely no sense.\n  We hope that the SEC will reopen its investigation even though the \nstatute of limitations has run on criminal penalties. It has run \nbecause of the inaction of the SEC waiting so long to start the \ninvestigation, then not taking Mr. Mack's testimony until 5 days after \nthe statute of limitations had expired. Notwithstanding that, there are \nother remedies, such as disgorgement, which still may be pursued.\n  The oversight function of Congress, as we all know, is very \nimportant. Pursuing an investigation of this sort is highly technical, \nbut we have done so, so far, in a preliminary manner. We believe this \nmatter is of sufficient importance so that Senator Grassley and I have \ncome to the floor jointly today to make a statement.\n  On behalf of Senator Grassley and myself, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of the interim findings on the investigation of \npotential abuse of authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nbe printed in the Record, together with extensive documentation which \nsupports the findings.\n  Again, we acknowledge the cooperation of Chairman Cox and the SEC, \nand we ask that further investigation be undertaken there. It is a \nmatter of continuing oversight concern to Senator Grassley and myself \nand the respective committees where we now serve as ranking members.\n  Mr. President, I ask Senator Grassley, what did I leave out?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You didn't leave anything out, but we did ask unanimous \nconsent that this be put in.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    THE SPECTER-GRASSLEY INTERIM FINDINGS ON THE INVESTIGATION INTO \n POTENTIAL ABUSE OF AUTHORITY AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\n\n                                Overview\n\n       These findings follow the Judiciary Committee's December 5, \n     2006, hearing that examined allegations that the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission (SEC) abused its authority in \n     handling its now-closed investigation of suspicious trading \n     by the hedge fund Pequot Capital Management (``Pequot'' or \n     ``PCM''). We submit these preliminary findings based upon the \n     evidence received by both Committees to date because we \n     believe it is important to share with the full Senate.\n       Between July 2006 and the end of the 109th Congress, the \n     Senate Judiciary and Finance Committees conducted a joint \n     investigation into allegations raised by former SEC employee \n     Gary Aguirre. Mr. Aguirre contends that his efforts to \n     investigate potentially massive insider trading violations by \n     Pequot were thwarted by his superiors when his investigation \n     increasingly focused on current Morgan Stanley Chief \n     Executive Officer John Mack. Mr. Aguirre also alleges that \n     his insistence on taking Mr. Mack's testimony met resistance \n     within the SEC and ultimately led to his firing. In \n     addressing these allegations, we have focused on the internal \n     processes of the SEC. We have not attempted to decide the \n     merits of the underlying Pequot insider trading investigation \n     and, at this juncture, take no position on whether Pequot or \n     Mack violated any securities laws.\n       To date, Committee investigators have received and reviewed \n     over 9,000 pages of documents and interviewed nineteen (19) \n     key witnesses over the course of twenty-four (24) interviews. \n     The Judiciary Committee also held a series of three (3) \n     public hearings regarding this matter--most recently on \n     December 5--when the Committee heard detailed sworn testimony \n     from current and former SEC employees involved in the Pequot \n     investigation.\n       Based on our review of this evidence we have serious \n     concerns. As discussed further below, our primary concerns \n     involve: (1) the SEC's mishandling of the Pequot \n     investigation before, during, and after Aguirre's firing; (2) \n     the circumstances under which Aguirre was terminated; and (3) \n     the manner in which the SEC's Inspector General's office \n     handled Aguirre's allegations after he was fired. Viewing \n     these concerns as a whole, we believe a troubling picture \n     emerges. At best the picture shows extraordinarily lax \n     enforcement by the SEC. At worse, the picture is colored with \n     overtones of a possible cover-up. Either way, we believe the \n     SEC must take corrective and preventative action to ensure \n     that future investigations, internal and external, do not \n     follow the same path as the Pequot matter.\n\n                                Findings\n\n\n      The SEC's Investigation of Pequot was Plagued with Problems\n\n     The SEC Failed To Act on the GE/Heller Trades for Years\n       The alleged insider trading occurred in July 2001 when \n     Pequot CEO Arthur Samberg began purchasing large quantities \n     of Heller Financial stock while also shorting General \n     Electric (``GE'') stock a few weeks before the public \n     announcement that GE would purchase Heller. On January 30, \n     2002, the NYSE ``highlighted'' some of these trades for the \n     SEC as a matter that warranted further scrutiny and \n     surveillance. But it appears that the SEC did next to nothing \n     to investigate these trades until after Aguirre joined the \n     Commission over 2 years later on September 7, 2004. In fact, \n     it is clear to us that Aguirre was the driving force behind \n     the investigation of the GE-Heller trades that had otherwise \n     remained dormant at SEC since 2002.\n     The Circumstances Surrounding the Investigation of John Mack \n         as the Potential Tipper Are Highly Suspect\n       The evidence shows that Aguirre's immediate supervisors, \n     Branch Chief Robert Hanson and Assistant Director Mark \n     Kreitman, initially were enthusiastic about investigating \n     Pequot and Mr. Mack as the possible supplier of inside \n     information to Pequot. Indeed, after Aguirre developed a \n     plausible theory connecting Mack to the trades, Hanson wrote \n     on June 3, 2005, in an email that ``Mack is another bad guy \n     (in my view)'' (Attachment 1). And on June 14, 2005 Aguirre's \n     supervisors Hanson and Kreitman authorized him to speak with \n     federal prosecutors concerning the trades. Six days later on \n     June 20, 2005, in response to a more comprehensive analysis \n     of his theory regarding Mack, Hanson wrote: ``Okay Gary \n     you've given me the bug. I'm starting to think about the case \n     during my non work hours'' (Attachment 2).\n       What is troubling is how this enthusiasm waned after public \n     reports on June 23, 2005, that Morgan Stanley was considering \n     hiring Mack as its new CEO. Specifically, we are concerned \n     about the circumstances leading to the decision by Aguirre's \n     supervisors to delay taking Mack's testimony. The Judiciary \n     Committee received sworn testimony from Aguirre that he was \n     told in a face-to-face meeting with his immediate supervisor, \n     Hanson, that he could not take Mack's testimony because of \n     his ``powerful political contacts.'' While Hanson denied to \n     the SEC/IG and to the Committees that he ever said that, we \n     question his denial because of conflicting contemporaneous \n     emails. For example, Hanson admitted to a very similar \n     statement when he wrote to Aguirre on August 24, 2005, ``Most \n     importantly the political clout I mentioned to you was a \n     reason to keep Paul [Berger] and possibly Linda [Thomsen] in \n     the loop on the testimony'' (Attachment 3, emphasis added). \n     He also used the term ``juice'' when referring to Mack's \n     attorneys (Attachment 4). Another witness testified before \n     the Judiciary Committee that Hanson referred to Mack's \n     ``prominence'' as a reason for not taking his testimony \n     (Attachment 5).\n       To be sure, Hanson's supervisor, Mark Kreitman, also \n     referred to John Mack's ``prominence.'' Speaking about former \n     U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's contact with SEC Enforcement \n     Director Linda Thomsen regarding the Pequot investigation, \n     Kreitman told the Inspector General's Office, ``White is very \n     prestigious and it isn't uncommon for someone prominent to \n     have someone intervene on their behalf'' (Attachment 6). \n     Kreitman's supervisor, Associate Director Paul Berger, also \n     brought up the issue of prominence, when asked whether he \n     could remember examples of witnesses other than John Mack for \n     whom he required a staff attorney to prepare a memorandum to \n     justify the taking of investigative testimony (Attachment 7).\n       We also have reason to question Hanson's credibility given \n     certain inconsistent statements that he gave to the Judiciary \n     Committee during its December hearing. Specifically, we find \n     it difficult to reconcile Hanson's submitted written \n     statement to the Committee concluding that it was ``highly \n     suspect and illogical'' to link Mack as the tipper with his \n     prior writings that ``Mack is another bad guy (in my view)'' \n     (Attachment 8). Moreover, it bears noting that despite \n     Hanson's statement that Aguirre's theory was ``highly suspect \n     and illogical'' the SEC ultimately took Mack's testimony on \n     August 1, 2006. Furthermore, we are troubled by Hanson's \n     failure to recall a key investment that Mack entered into \n     with the help of Pequot prior to his alleged passing of \n     inside information to Pequot CEO Samberg regarding the GE-\n     Heller transaction. Hanson's failure to recall this \n     transaction at the hearing raises doubt as to whether \n     Aguirre's theory regarding Mack was ever taken seriously by \n     his supervisors at the SEC.\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\n       Moreover, we question the rationale advanced by Aguirre's \n     supervisors in not taking Mack's testimony: to get ``their \n     ducks in a row.'' While reasonable minds may disagree on an \n     appropriate investigative strategy, the SEC's rationale for \n     delaying the taking of Mack's testimony runs contrary to what \n     insider trading experts have told us and contrary to what \n     others within the SEC believed at the time. According to Mr. \n     Hilton Foster, an experienced former SEC investigator with \n     knowledge of the Pequot matter: ``as the SEC expert on \n     insider trading, if people had asked me, `when do you take \n     his testimony,' I would have said take it yesterday.'' In \n     addition, Joseph Cella, Chief of the SEC's Market \n     Surveillance Division, told Committee investigators, ``it \n     seemed to me that it was a reasonable thing to do to bring \n     Mack in and have him testify,'' and ``in my mind there was no \n     down side[.]''\n       The explanation offered by Aguirre's supervisors that \n     without direct evidence that Mack had knowledge of the GE \n     transaction--what Aguirre's supervisors referred to \n     as proving Mack went ``over the wall'' (Attachment 3)--the \n     deposition would consist simply of a denial by Mack is not \n     at all convincing. Indeed, although the SEC apparently \n     never found such direct evidence, the SEC did manage to \n     question Mack for over 4 hours when it finally took his \n     testimony on August 1, 2006, after the statute of \n     limitations had expired. And although Aguirre's \n     supervisors advance the rationale that taking Mack's \n     testimony in the summer of 2005 would have been merely \n     premature, this notion is contradicted by the staff \n     attorney who took the lead in the investigation after \n     Aguirre was fired. In particular, shortly before taking \n     Mack's deposition in August 2006, that attorney wrote \n     explicitly in a July 19, 2006, email that the rationale \n     for taking Mack's testimony was not a matter of being \n     ``premature'' but rather an issue of establishing the \n     necessary ``prerequisite'' of when Mack had obtained \n     inside information (Attachment 8).\n       The purpose of taking investigative testimony is not to \n     confront a witness with accusations of wrongdoing, as \n     Aguirre's supervisors seem to believe. Rather it is to gather \n     information that helps to either confirm or rule-out working \n     theories, which by their nature must be speculative at the \n     beginning of the investigation. One SEC witness who wishes to \n     remain anonymous told the Committees' investigators that SEC \n     training personnel teach new attorneys that:\n\n     it was important to immediately ``nail down'' the stories of \n     any individuals who possibly had been involved in the \n     suspicious trades so that the person could not adjust their \n     story to account for any information we later uncovered. This \n     also served to assist the direction of the investigation \n     because it allowed us to immediately identify whether or not \n     any subsequent evidence supported the individual's initial \n     statement thereby giving us a strong indication of whether \n     the initial statement appeared to be true and what, if any, \n     additional investigation needed to be conducted (such as the \n     need for more in-depth testimony if we found contradictions).\n\n       Although the SEC finally took Mack's testimony in August \n     2006, we are concerned about the circumstances under which it \n     was done. Mack's testimony was taken five days after the \n     statute of limitations expired, and only a few months after \n     we initiated our inquiry into this matter. We question why \n     the SEC failed to take this obvious step earlier. The \n     evidence suggests that his testimony was taken primarily to \n     deflect public criticism for not having taken it much \n     earlier. It took the SEC over a year to ask John Mack about \n     his communications with Arthur Samberg and Pequot's trading \n     in Heller and GE. By contrast, it took Mary Jo White only two \n     days to do so. On the Sunday after Morgan Stanley's Board of \n     Directors hired her and her firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, to \n     look into Mack's potential exposure in the Pequot \n     investigation, she quickly obtained documents and questioned \n     Mack about specific emails with Arthur Samberg. The SEC \n     should have been at least as curious about Mack's answers as \n     Mary Jo White was.\n     The Problems With the Pequot Case Are Amplified by the \n         Testimony of Other SEC Employees\n       Our concerns are further heightened by the testimony of one \n     key SEC employee who raised issues with the manner in which \n     the Pequot investigation was handled. Specifically, the \n     Judiciary Committee received compelling sworn testimony from \n     SEC Market Surveillance Branch Chief Eric Ribelin who sought \n     recusal from the Pequot investigation shortly after Aguirre's \n     termination because, as he alleged at the time, ``something \n     smells rotten.'' Ribelin also explained to the Judiciary \n     Committee that he believed Aguirre's supervisors, especially \n     Associate Director Paul Berger, failed to ``support the \n     aggressiveness and tenacity of [Aguirre]'' (Attachment 5). \n     This is significant testimony from a witness who felt it was \n     his duty to come forward and testify. As such, we trust that \n     Commissioners at the SEC will take every step to ensure that \n     no retaliation against Ribelin will occur.\n\n           The SEC's Termination of Aguirre is Highly Suspect\n\n       The documents and testimony adduced by the Committees show \n     that Aguirre, a probationary employee while at the SEC, was a \n     smart, hardworking, aggressive attorney who was passionately \n     dedicated to the Pequot investigation. These positive \n     attributes were noted in a June 1, 2005 ``Performance Plan \n     and Evaluation'' prepared by Kreitman which give Aguirre an \n     ``acceptable'' rating for numerous work criteria, and then \n     followed by a more detailed ``Merit Pay'' evaluation written \n     by Hanson on June 29, 2005, which noted Aguirre's ``unmatched \n     dedication'' to the Pequot investigation and ``contributions \n     of high quality.'' These evaluations were submitted to the \n     SEC's Compensation Committee which later approved Hanson's \n     recommendation (among others) on July 18, 2005.\n       Despite these favorable reviews, Aguirre's supervisors \n     (Kreitman, Hanson and Berger) wrote a so-called \n     ``supplemental evaluation'' on August 1 that spoke negatively \n     of Aguirre. Aguirre's supervisors never shared this \n     evaluation with Aguirre and indeed admitted that they are \n     ``fairly rare''. In fact, during the December 5, 2006 \n     hearing, current SEC supervisors could not recall other \n     instances where a supplemental evaluation was prepared for an \n     employee. We are skeptical of the supervisors' explanations \n     regarding the creation of this document. According to Hanson \n     and Kreitman, their initial positive evaluations covered only \n     the period ending April 30, 2005, thus suggesting that the \n     evaluation was accurate with respect to performance up to \n     that date. But these same supervisors also testified that the \n     initial evaluations were perhaps too generous, thus \n     suggesting that there were performance issues that should \n     have been addressed in the initial evaluation and Merit Pay \n     recommendation.\n       Rather than taking them at face value, we have attempted to \n     assess the credibility of the negative statements Aguirre's \n     supervisors made about him in his re-evaluation, in his \n     notice of termination, in interviews with the SEC/IG, in \n     interviews with Committee staff, and in their hearing \n     testimony. In doing so, we have noted the considerable \n     lack of contemporaneous documents corroborating the \n     concerns they raised.\n       For example, the IG's closing memo cites his supervisors' \n     concerns about subpoenas that Aguirre issued allegedly in \n     violation of law. While his supervisors now claim that this \n     was a significant error, which seriously undermined their \n     confidence in Aguirre, they have produced no documents to the \n     Committees suggesting that they viewed it that way at the \n     time. Another example is Hanson's allegation that Aguirre \n     behaved ``unprofessionally'' while taking the testimony of \n     Arthur Samberg. This allegation is based on second-hand \n     knowledge, as Hanson did not actually attend the testimony. \n     Moreover, the SEC has not produced records to the Committees \n     suggesting that Hanson or any of his other supervisors were \n     concerned at the time about the way Aguirre took the Samberg \n     testimony. In fact, Hilton Foster told the Committees that he \n     planned to use a portion of the transcript as a model for how \n     to take testimony in his training of new SEC attorneys. A \n     third former SEC employee told staff that the testimony of \n     current SEC supervisors at the December 5, 2006 hearing \n     concerning the reasons for terminating Aguirre were not \n     consistent with that employee's experience with Aguirre.\n       Aside from these inconsistencies, the greater concern is \n     with the timing of Aguirre's re-evaluation. Aguirre's \n     supervisors prepared the re-evaluation on August 1 after the \n     Compensation Committee (on which Berger sat) had already \n     approved the merit pay increase for Aguirre and most \n     significantly, 5 days after Aguirre sent Berger an email \n     saying that he believed the Pequot investigation of Mack was \n     being halted because of Mack's political power.\n       Finally, there are questions about Paul Berger's outside \n     employment with the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton--the \n     private firm that represented John Mack's prospective \n     employer during the time that Berger allegedly vetoed efforts \n     to take Mack's testimony. Although Berger testified recently \n     before the Judiciary Committee that he ``first approached \n     Debevoise in January of 2006'' (at which time he recused \n     himself from the Pequot investigation and all other matters \n     in which Debevoise had entered an appearance), Committee \n     investigators identified a September 8, 2005, email \n     suggesting that a contact was made on behalf of Berger \n     through an intermediary who was also seeking employment with \n     the same firm at the time. While we have found no proof of \n     actual quid pro quo for Berger's employment in exchange for \n     the favorable treatment of Mack, the SEC should take steps to \n     avoid the appearance of impropriety of the sort that this \n     email seems to suggest. This is especially true given that \n     this contact on Berger's behalf occurred just days after \n     Aguirre was fired and months before Berger recused himself \n     from the Pequot matter.\n\n\n   The Follow-Up SEC Inspector General's Investigation Was Seriously \n                                 Flawed\n\n       We are deeply troubled by what appears to us to be a \n     cursory investigation of Aguirre's allegations by the SEC's \n     Office of Inspector General, headed by Walter Stachnik. \n     Subsequent to SEC Chairman Cox's September 7, 2005, referral \n     of Aguirre's allegations to the IG, Stachnik failed to \n     interview Aguirre or any of the other SEC employees mentioned \n     in Aguirre's letter to Chairman Cox. The testimony of one \n     such witness, Eric Ribelin, saw the light of day only through \n     our investigation. Moreover, our concerns were further \n     enhanced when the IG's investigators repeatedly told our \n     staff that in investigating Aguirre's allegations of improper\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\n     motivation for his termination, ``we don't second guess \n     management decisions . . . we don't second guess why \n     employees are terminated.'' (Attachment 9). Such statements \n     are fundamentally incompatible with the mission and purpose \n     of the Office of Inspector General. This may explain why the \n     IG spoke only to Aguirre's supervisors, accepted everything \n     they said at face value, and reviewed only documents \n     identified by those supervisors. However, it is certainly not \n     a recipe for an independent and thorough investigation.\n       Furthermore, the IG initially attempted to take punitive \n     action against Aguirre by seeking enforcement of a subpoena \n     for documents in his possession--including confidential \n     communications with Congress. We are pleased that the scope \n     of the subpoena was subsequently narrowed to exclude \n     communications with Congress. Nevertheless, Stachnik's \n     continued insistence that his first investigation was \n     ``professional,'' and his refusal to answer the Committee's \n     questions about the subpoena at the instruction of the \n     Justice Department are similarly troubling. The SEC's IG is \n     supposed to provide employees an alternate, objective, open-\n     minded avenue for reporting abuse of authority or other \n     misconduct. At no time, before or after his termination, was \n     Aguirre able to obtain at the SEC an objective and thorough \n     consideration of his concerns. It is unfortunate that he had \n     to reach out to our Committees to obtain such a review.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The handling of the Pequot investigation, the basis for and \n     the timing of Aguirre's termination, and the woefully \n     inadequate IG investigation of serious allegations of abuse \n     of authority, present a very troubling picture. Based upon \n     the evidence we have reviewed to date, the SEC's handling of \n     the Pequot investigation shows either inexplicably lax \n     enforcement or possibly a willful cover-up. Either way, the \n     SEC must review this matter and take appropriate corrective \n     measures. Anything less will undermine public confidence in \n     our capital markets. We owe it to the public to ensure that \n     securities enforcement is rigorous and unbiased.\n       As such, we hope the SEC will consider re-opening its \n     investigation into the Pequot matter given our findings. \n     While the statute of limitations has run on criminal \n     penalties and civil penalties related to the underlying \n     trades, we understand that other remedies, such as \n     disgorgement, may still be pursued. There also may be \n     reasonable cause for the SEC or the Department of Justice to \n     investigate whether any testimony given in the underlying \n     Pequot investigation was false. We urge the SEC to take \n     Aguirre's allegations seriously and seek to improve the \n     management and operations of the Commission based on lessons \n     learned from this controversy. We anticipate transmitting \n     more detailed findings, conclusions and recommendations to \n     the Senate during the 110th Congress after we conclude our \n     assessment of the evidence adduced to date.\n\n                              Attachment 1\n\n     From: Hanson, Robert.\n     Sent: Friday, June 03, 2005 10:00 a.m.\n     To: Aguirre, Gary J.\n     Subject: Re: Possible tipper new Pequot Chairman?\n       Mack is another bad guy (in my view).\n\n       Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld\n     From: Aguirre, Gary J.\n     To: Ribelin, Eric; Foster, Hilton; Eichner, Jim; Conroy, \n         Thomas; Glascoe, Stephen; Miller, Nancy B.\n     CC: Hanson, Robert; Kreitman, Mark J.\n     Sent: Fri Jun 03 08:36:07 2005\n     Subject: Possible tipper new Pequot Chairman?\n       John Mack, who came up on radar screen as possible GE-\n     Heller tipper, has just become chairman of Pequot Capital, \n     according to WSJ article below. Mack moved from Morgan \n     Stanley, adviser in Heller acquisition, to CSFB, also adviser \n     in Heller, in late July 2001, the month of acquisition. The \n     are hundreds of Pequot e-mails referring to Mack, including a \n     dozen in July 2001. See e-mail below between Samberg and his \n     son referring to Mack (``It's nice to have friends in high \n     places . . .:)'' Is there something to this perverse logic: \n     Mack is the only person in the world who would have as much \n     to loose as Samberg if we could prove that he provided \n     material-nonpublic info to Samberg. Who safer for Samberg to \n     head Pequot and keep its secrets? Please note the happy face \n     which has already come up twice in relating to possible flow \n     of insider info. Ironically, Mack's article quoted below is \n     C-1 of WSJ, just as was when Samberg's exchanged e-mails \n     below.\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 3, 2005]\n\n         John Mack To Join Pequot Hedge Fund in Chairman's Role\n\n                  (By Gregory Zuckerman and Ann Davis)\n\n       In the latest example of a prominent financial figure \n     entering the hedge-fund world, former Wall Street heavy-\n     hitter John Mack is joining Pequot Capital Management Inc. as \n     chairman.\n       Mr. Mack, 60 years old, was co-chief executive of Credit \n     Suisse Group and CEO of that bank's Credit Suisse First \n     Boston until last year, and previously was president of Wall \n     Street firm Morgan Stanley. He will work with Pequot's \n     founder, Art Samberg, to help lead the firm into new markets, \n     recruit money managers and help guide the Westport, Conn., \n     firm. Hedge funds are lightly regulated investing pools, \n     traditionally for the wealthy and institutions.\n       [John Mack] Mr. Samberg, 64, an investor with a well-\n     regarded record, will remain chief executive of Pequot, which \n     manages about $6.5 billion, effectively running the firm day-\n     to-day. (Meanwhile, a British financial regulator, Gay Huey \n     Evans is joining a hedge fund run by Citigroup.)\n       Speculation about where Mr. Mack would land after he was \n     replaced last year at CSFB has been something of a parlor \n     game on Wall Street. Various companies put out feelers,\n     including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and he was approached as \n     a possible candidate to run mortgage giant Fannie Mae, among \n     other positions, according to people close to the matter. \n     Some expected Mr. Mack, who is active in politics, to seek an \n     office or ambassadorship.\n       But like many Wall Street traders and analysts lately, Mr. \n     Mack is heading for the hedge-fund world, where assets are \n     growing and the rewards can be lucrative. Hedge funds \n     generally charge a management fee and a percentage of the \n     firm's investment gains, meaning that stellar results bring \n     big paydays. In addition to a salary, Mr. Mack will receive \n     equity in Pequot, according to the firm.\n       Mr. Mack wouldn't address details of other possible job \n     offers but said in an interview that he was attracted to \n     Pequot because he and Mr. Samberg have been friends for more \n     than a decade, starting when Mr. Mack gave some money to Mr. \n     Samberg to invest. Mr. Mack also said he was eager to help \n     the firm push into new investment areas.\n       [Arthur Samberg] ``Many people who have called me for a job \n     want me to fix something, but I'd like to focus my job on \n     building,'' Mr. Mack said.\n       For Pequot, the hiring of Mr. Mack is part of a change in \n     recent years from traditional hedge-fund strategies, such as \n     buying and selling U.S. and European shares. Returns for some \n     hedge-funds have fallen, amid concern by some that too many \n     savvy ``hedge funds were seeking the same opportunities in \n     the market.\n       Hedge funds lost less than 1 percent this year through \n     April--results that topped the returns of the market though \n     they pale in comparison to the double-digit gains hedge funds \n     scored in recent years. Pequot's various hedge funds are up \n     about 3 percent in 2005, according to investors. But Mr. \n     Samberg predicts that the growth of the hedge-fund business \n     will lead to a shakeout that forces as many as 30 percent of \n     existing hedge funds to throw in the towel, even as \n     institutions continue to up their investments in so-called \n     alternative investments. At the same time, the market is \n     neither cheap nor especially expensive, presenting few \n     obvious opportunities. That is why Pequot has been looking \n     elsewhere lately, starting hedge funds focused on emerging \n     markets, parts of the debt world and other strategies.\n       As reported in The Wall Street Journal, Pequot recently \n     formed a joint venture with Singapore-based Pangaea Capital \n     Management to invest in distressed assets in Asia, including \n     real estate.\n       Mr. Mack's move effectively blunts speculation that he \n     might join a new investment-banking boutique with some \n     recently departed top Morgan Stanley executives. A group of \n     former Morgan alumni waged a loud campaign for the ouster of \n     Morgan CEO Philip Purcell this spring, after a management \n     shakeup and several executive departures. Mr. Mack, who \n     clashed with Mr. Purcell before he left the firm in 2001, has \n     kept a studied distance from the dissidents.\n       Mr. Mack's move effectively blunts speculation that he \n     might join a new investment-banking boutique with some \n     recently departed top Morgan Stanley executives.

Mr. Mack is expected \n     to help smooth the way for Pequot fund managers by \n     introducing them to company executives.\n       ``I see an opportunity to build something really great here \n     and John will be a big part of that,'' Mr. Samberg said.\n       Mr. Samberg's previous alliance with a high-powered partner \n     ended when Pequot co-founder Dan Benton quit the firm in \n     2001, taking about $7 billion of investor money with him to \n     his new firm, Andor Capital Management LLC. Mr. Samberg says \n     he is confident his new partnership with Mr. Mack will work, \n     in part because of his close relationship with Mr. Mack. In \n     recent months, Mr. Mack has been using spare space in \n     Pequot's New York office, weighing his options.\n       The move to bring in an established Wall Street executive \n     like Mr. Mack could signal that Pequot, like some other \n     hedge-fund firms lately, might be interested at some point in \n     selling itself, or part of the firm, to a mainstream Wall \n     Street firm or even going public through. a stock offering, \n     although Mr. Samberg says he has no plans to do so.\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\n     J.P.

Madam President, about a week ago, I think it was on the \n23rd, my colleagues, the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Ben Nelson, and the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and I, together with several \ncosponsors, put into the Record a resolution--I underline put into the \nRecord--so that all could have the benefit of studying it.\n  We three have continued to do a good deal of work. We have been in \nconsultation with our eight other cosponsors on this resolution, and we \nare going to put in tonight, into the Record--the same procedures we \nfollowed before--another resolution which tracks very closely the one \nthat is of record. But it has several provisions we believe should be \nconsidered by the Senate in the course of the debate. How that debate \nwill occur and when it will occur. I cannot advise the Senate, but I do \nhope it is expeditious. I understand there is a cloture motion that \ncould well begin the debate, depending upon how it is acted upon.\n  We have also had a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nlast Friday. We had a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nagain this morning. Friday was in open session. The session this \nmorning was in closed session. The three of us, as members of the Armed \nServices Committee, have learned a good deal more about this subject \nand, I say with great respect, the plan as laid down by the President \non the 10th of January. We believed we should make some additions to \nour resolution.\n  We have not had the opportunity, given the hour, to circulate this \namong all of our cosponsors so at this time it will not bind them, but \nsubsequently, tomorrow, I hope to contact all of them, together with my \ntwo colleagues, and determine their concurrence to go on this one. I am \noptimistic they will all stay.\n  But let me give the Senate several examples of what we think is \nimportant in the course of the debate--that these subjects be raised. \nWe put it before the Senate now in the form of filing this resolution, \nsuch that all can see it and have the benefit, to the extent it is \nreproduced and placed into the public domain. Because the three of us \nare still open for suggestions, and we will continue to have \nreceptivity to suggestions as this critical and very important subject \nis deliberated by the Senate.\n\n  Our objective is to hope that somehow through our efforts and the \nefforts\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\nof others, a truly bipartisan statement--I don't know in what form it \nmay be made--a truly bipartisan statement can evolve from the debate \nand the procedure that will ensue in the coming days, and I presume \ninto next week. We feel very strongly that we want to see our Armed \nForces succeed in Iraq to help bring about greater stability to that \ncountry, greater security to that country, so that the current elected \ngovernment, through a series of free elections--the current elected \ngovernment can take a firmer and firmer hand on the reins of \nsovereignty. We believe if for political reasons all Members of the \nSenate go over to vote with their party, and the others go over to vote \nwith their party, we will have lost and failed to provide the \nleadership I believe this Chamber can provide to the American people so \nthey can better understand the new strategy, and that the President can \ntake into consideration our resolution hasn't been changed.\n  We say to the President: We urge that you take into consideration the \noptions that we put forth, the strategy that we sort of lay out, in the \nhopes that it will be stronger and better understood by the people in \nthis country. Their support, together with a strong level of bipartisan \nsupport in the Congress for the President's plan, hopefully as slightly \nmodified, can be successful. We want success, Madam President. We want \nsuccess.\n  So that is the reason we come this evening. I am going to speak to \none or two provisions, and my colleagues can address others.\n  First, the unity of command. We have a time-honored tradition with \nAmerican forces that wherever possible, there be a unity of command \nfrom an American commander, whatever rank that may be, down to the \nprivate, and that our forces can best operate with that unity of \ncommand and provide the best security possible to all members of the \nArmed Forces that are engaged in carrying out such mission as that \ncommand is entrusted to perform.\n  A number of Senators, in the course of the hearing on Friday and the \nhearing this morning, raised questions about this serious issue of \nunity of command. I say serious issue because the President, in his \nremarks, described--and this is on January 10--described how there will \nbe an Iraqi commander, and that we will have embedded forces with the \nIraqi troops. Well, we are currently embedding forces, but I think the \nplan--and that is what I refer to, the President's announcement on \nJanuary 10 in the generic sense as the plan--will require perhaps a \nlarger number of embedded forces. But the plan envisions an Iraqi chain \nof command. The Iraqis indicated, in working with the President, this \nplan in many respects tracks the exchange of thoughts that the \nPresident and the Prime Minister have had through a series of meetings \nand telephonic conversations. So the plan embraces the goals of the \nPrime Minister of Iraq, the goals of our President.\n  But this is a unique situation where the Iraqis have a complete chain \nof command, from a senior officer in each of the nine districts in \nBaghdad, and the United States likewise will have a chain of command in \nthat same district or such segments of this plan as the military \nfinally put together--each will have a chain of command, the Iraqi \nforces and the United States forces.\n  In the course of the testimony that we received, particularly \ntestimony from the retired Vice Chief of the U.S. Army on Friday \nafternoon, he was concerned, as a number of Senators are concerned--and \nour provision literally flags this, and flags it in such a way that we \ncall upon the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff to look at that plan and to bring such clarification forward \nas may be necessary, and to do it in a way that will secure the safety \nof our forces, the protection of our forces, and yet go forward with \nthis idea of a greater sharing of the command responsibility in the \noperations to take place in Baghdad. So we simply call on the \nadministration to bring such clarification and specificity to the \nCongress and the people of the United States to ensure the protection \nof our force and that this command structure will work because I \nbelieve it doesn't have--I am trying to find a precedent where we have \noperated like this. I have asked the expert witnesses in hearings, and \nthus far those witnesses have not been able to explain the command \nstructure that we have conceived, the concept of the plan of January \n10, just how it will work.\n  Likewise, we put in a very important paragraph which says that \nnothing in this resolution should be construed as indicating that there \nis going to be a cutoff of funds. Given the complexity of this \nsituation, there has been a lot of press written on the subject of our \nresolution. Colleagues have come up to me and said: Well, can you \nassure me that this doesn't provide a cutoff of funds.\n  Now, the cutoff of funds is the specific power given under the \nConstitution to the Congress of the United States. I personally think \nthat power should not be exercised, certainly not given the facts and \nthe circumstances today where this plan--which I hope in some manner \nwill succeed and we are working better with the Prime Minister and his \nforces. So at this point in time I think it is important that our \nresolution carry language as follows:\n\n       The Congress should not take any action that will endanger \n     United States military forces in the field, including the \n     elimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field, as \n     such an action with respect to funding would undermine their \n     safety or harm their effectiveness in pursuing their assigned \n     missions.\n\n  So I think that very clearly eliminates any consideration there.\n  At this time I would like to yield the floor so that my colleagues \ncan speak, and maybe I will have some concluding remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I really feel, if we could more fully--\n--\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is just a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does it affect what we are trying to lay down in any way?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was just going to ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas a cosponsor of the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine. I didn't realize that was coming to pass. \nIt is late in the day, and I suppose we could anticipate a lot of \nthings. But anyway I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand, the resolution has not yet been sent to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. It momentarily will be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, tonight I believe we have \nseen the introduction of a resolution which not only has had bipartisan \nsupport in its prior form but will receive very strong bipartisan \nsupport in its current form, as amended.\n  I rise to support this resolution for a number of reasons. I think it \nis important that we continue to support our troops in the field and \nthose who support the troops across the world. I think it is important \nthat we thank them for their service and that we make it very clear \nthat this resolution does not impair their ability to move forward in \ntheir command.\n  It is also important to point out that while some of the cosponsors \nhaven't had the opportunity to review this, it is being circulated to \nthem so that they do have the opportunity to review it. And I am sure \nthey will become cosponsors with the new resolution.\n  It is important to point out that in this resolution, benchmarks are \nincluded that I believe will help break the cycle of dependence in Iraq \nby empowering and requiring the authority of the Iraqi Government and \nthe responsibility of the Iraqi Government to take a greater role in \nthe battle in Iraq, particularly as it relates to Baghdad. We generally \nbelieve that it is inappropriate for our troops to intercede in the \nbattle between the Sunnis and the Shias on a sectarian basis in battles \nthat are of a similar nature that\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\ncertainly do involve sectarian violence. There is a greater role for \nthe Iraqi Government and the Iraqi military. This resolution in its \npresent form will assure the assuming of that greater role, that \ngreater responsibility by the Iraqi Government and certainly by the \nIraqi Army.\n  It is a pleasure for me to introduce and thank our cosponsor, the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first let me thank Senator Warner and \nSenator Nelson for their continuing hard work in refining the language \nof this very important resolution, a resolution that I hope will garner \nwidespread bipartisan support when it is brought to the Senate floor \nand debated next week.\n  Since we first introduced our resolution last week, we have had the \nbenefit of further consultations with experts. We have had the benefit \nof conversations with our colleagues. We have had the benefit of \nalternative resolutions that have been proposed by other Senators, and \nwe have had the benefit, most of all, of additional hearings in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, including a classified briefing today. \nAll of this activity has confirmed my belief that our resolution as \noriginally proposed was on precisely the right track, but the benefit \nof these hearings, briefings, conversations and consultations has led \nus to improve our resolution by making four modifications that the \ndistinguished Senators have just explained.\n  Let me, for the benefit of our colleagues, run through them one more \ntime.\n  First, the resolution now makes very clear that nothing in it is to \nbe construed as advocating any lessening of financial support for our \ntroops. Indeed, it goes firmly on record as being opposed to cutting \noff funds that would be needed by our troops in Iraq. The language is \nvery clear on that.\n  Second, there has been a great deal of discussion about the need for \nthe Iraqis to meet certain benchmarks--benchmarks that in the past they \nhave not met. So we include language in this resolution that makes very \nclear that we expect the Iraqi Prime Minister to agree to certain \nbenchmarks; for example, to agree to work for the passage and achieve \nthe passage of legislation that would ensure an equitable distribution \nof oil revenues. That is a very important issue in Iraq.\n  It also includes a benchmark that the Iraqis are going to produce the \ntroops they have promised, and that they are going to operate according \nto the military rules of engagement without regard to the sectarian \ninformation or the sect of the people involved in the fighting. In \nother words, it doesn't matter whether an insurgent is a Sunni or a \nShiite; if he is violating the law, engaging in violence, the Iraqi \ntroops and our troops would be able to arrest and detain or otherwise \nbattle these individuals.\n  It clarifies the language regarding the troop increase that the \nPresident has proposed, and as the Senator from Virginia has explained \nto our colleagues, it calls for a clarification of the command and \ncontrol structure so that we don't have a dual line of command. We want \nto have a very clear chain of command, and we call for that. That isn't \nthe case now, and if you ask any military officer, he or she will tell \nyou that having a clear chain of command, a unity of command, is \nabsolutely essential. We have made these four changes in our \nlegislation, in the resolution. We hope our colleagues will take a \nclose look at it. I look forward to debating it more fully when we get \non this issue next week.\n\n  Again, I commend the distinguished Senators with whom I have been \nvery privileged to work on this: Senator Warner, the former chairman of \nthe Committee on Armed Services, my colleague, Senator Nelson, also a \nmember of the Committee on Armed Services. All three of us serve on \nthat committee. We have brought to bear our experience and what we have \nlearned in the last week as we continue to study this very important \nissue, perhaps the most vital issue facing our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nMaine.\n  It has been a hard work in progress, but we reiterate, perhaps \nMembers want to offer their own resolutions. We are open to \nsuggestions. We are not trying to grab votes, just make ours stronger.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleague, this is not to be construed \nas saying, Mr. President, you cannot do anything; we suggest you look \nat openings by which we could, hopefully, have substantially less \nUnited States involvement of troops in what we foresee as a bitter \nstruggle of sectarian violence.\n  The American GI, in my judgment, has sacrificed greatly, and their \nfamilies, in giving sovereignty to this Nation. Now we see it is in the \ngrip of extraordinary sectarian violence. Sunni upon Shia, Shia upon \nSunni. I am not trying to ascribe which is more guilty than the other, \nbut why should they proceed to try and destabilize the very government \nthat gives all Iraqis a tremendous measure of freedom, free from \ntyranny and from Saddam Hussein. Why should the American GI, who does \nnot have a language proficiency, who does not have a full understanding \nof the culture giving rise to these enormous animosities and hatreds \nthat precipitate the killings and other actions--why should not that be \nleft to the Iraqi forces?\n  We have trained upwards of 200,000. We have reason to believe today \nthere are 60,000 to 70,000 who are tested--in many respects they have \nbeen participating in a number of military operations, together with \nour forces. Let elements of that group be the principals to take the \nlead, as they proudly say, give them the lead, and go into the \nsectarian violence. That would enable our commanders, our President, to \nsend fewer than 20,500 into that area.\n  On the other hand, we support the President with respect to his \noptions regarding the Anbar Province and the additional forces.\n  Am I not correct in that?\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield on that point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The resolution we drafted very carefully distinguishes \nbetween the sectarian violence engulfing Baghdad, where the Senator and \nSenator Nelson believe it would be a huge mistake for additional \nAmerican troops to be in the midst of that, versus a very different \nsituation in Anbar Province.\n  In Anbar, the violence is not sectarian; the battle is with al-Qaida \nand with foreign fighters, the Sunni insurgencies, so we have Sunni \nversus Sunni. It is not sectarian. And what is more, local tribal \nleaders have recently joined with the coalition forces to fight al-\nQaida. It is a completely different situation in Anbar. I do support \nthe addition of more troops in Anbar. Indeed, the one American \ncommander whom I met with in December who called for more troops in \nAnbar was General Kilmer.\n  Mr. WARNER. You refer to the one commander you met. I wonder if the \nSenator would reference your trip in December and what others told you \nabout the addition of United States forces. I think that is important \nfor the Record.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, if the Senator will continue to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. It was a very illuminating trip with other Senators. It \nhas shaped my views on the issues before the Senate.\n  One American commander in Baghdad told me a jobs program would do \nmore good than additional American troops in quelling the sectarian \nviolence. He told me many Iraqi men were joining the militias or \nplanting roadside bombs simply because they had been unemployed for so \nlong they were desperate for money and would do anything to support \ntheir families. This was an American commander who told me this.\n  Prime Minister Maliki, in mid-December, made very clear he did not \nwelcome the presence of additional American troops and, indeed, that he \nchafed at the restrictions on his control of the Iraqi troops. So I \ndidn't hear it from Iraqi leaders, either.\n  The only place where I heard a request for more troops was in Anbar \nProvince where the situation, as we have discussed, is totally \ndifferent than the sectarian violence plaguing Baghdad.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague.\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n  In my trip in the October timeframe, I would see much the same \nexpression from military and civilian. Our codel visited, and it was \nfollowing my trip that I came back and said in a press conference, this \nsituation is moving sideways.\n  My observations, together with the observations of others--some in \nour Government, some in the private sector--induced the \nadministration--I am not suggesting we were the triggering cause, but \nwe may have contributed--to go to an absolutely, as you say in the \nNavy, ``general quarters'' to study every aspect of the strategy which \nthen was in place, and which now is clearly stated as late as yesterday \nby the admiral who will be the CENTCOM commander, wasn't working.\n  I commend the President for taking the study and inviting a number of \nconsultants. That whole process was very thorough.\n  The point the Senator is making, as late as December--mine in \nOctober, yours in December--we both gained the same impressions that no \none was asking for additional United States troops at that time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield on that point, since the \nSenator was the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, as well, I \nwould also share with our colleagues that the Senator presided over a \nhearing in mid-November at which General Abizaid, the central command \ngeneral, testified before our committee that more American troops were \nnot needed. He reported he had consulted widely with generals on the \nground in Iraq, including General Casey, in reaching that conclusion.\n  I say to our colleagues that I think the record is clear. If you look \nat the findings of your trip from October, the testimony before the \nCommittee on Armed Services from General Abizaid in November, what I \nheard in mid-December, I have to say, respectfully, I do not believe \nthe President's plan with regard to Baghdad--not Anbar but Baghdad--is \nconsistent with what we were told.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  We should add an important reference to work done by the Baker-\nHamilton commission. They have made similar findings. They mention a \nslight surge, but in my study of that one sentence in that report, I \ndon't think they ever envisioned a surge of the magnitude that is here.\n  They can best speak for themselves and, indeed, yesterday there was \ntestimony taken from two senior members of that commission, but I don't \nknow whether they were speaking for the entire commission, and whether, \nin their remarks, they may wish to amend portions of their report. I \nwasn't present for that testimony.\n  I hope someone in the Foreign Relations Committee can make that \nclear. Were they speaking for the entire commission? Did they wish to \nhave their remarks amend their report which we followed? It was one of \nthe guideposts we used, the important work of that group.\n  Again, we are doing what we think is constructive to help the Senate \nin preparing for its deliberations, to invite other colleagues to make \nsuggestions. We stand open to consider other options that may come \nbefore the Senate.\n  At this point in time, our resolution is the same form as the \nresolution we filed here a week or so ago. We are not changing any of \nthe procedures by which the Senate takes into consideration our points. \nWhether we will be able to utilize this as a substitute should other \namendments be called upon the floor, the rules are quite complex on \nthat matter, and I will not bring all of that into the record at this \npoint. But there are certain impediments procedurally as to how this \nspecific resolution could ever be actually used for the purposes of a \nsubstitute.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. MURRAY). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, in the colloquy I participated in with \nmy distinguished colleagues, Senator Ben Nelson of Kansas and Senator \nCollins of Maine--and I take responsibility--somehow we had a \nmisunderstanding about the status. We wish to send to the desk and ask \nthat this be numbered a new S. Con. Res. and, therefore, have the same \nstatus as the current S. Con. Res. we had submitted a week ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and referred.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1394-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1394-S1396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have already apologized to staff and \nothers for having to wait around so long, but sometimes it takes a long \ntime to get from here to there.\n  I, first of all, want to acknowledge the hard work of so many \ndifferent people that allowed us to get where we are today, which \ncertainly isn't the finish line, but it is a starting point.\n  People have heard me on other occasions, on other matters, talk about \nthe Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner. In my 25 years in the Congress--\nand I say this without any reservation--I have not had dealings with \nanyone who better represents, in my mind, what a Senator should be. Not \nonly does he look the part and act the part, but he is truly what our \nFounding Fathers had in mind when they talked about this deliberative \nbody.\n  So I appreciate very much the bipartisan work of the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner. He has worked with other Senators--I don't know \nwho he has worked with, but some I am aware of because I have read \nabout them: Senators Collins, Hagel, Ben Nelson, Snowe, Biden, Coleman, \nand I am sure there are others.\n  Today Senator Warner and others submitted a new version of his \nconcurrent resolution regarding the increase of troop levels in \nIraq. Senator Levin has taken that language, and tonight we will \nintroduce it as a bill. It will be introduced as a bill because that is \nthe only way we can arrive at a point where we can start a deliberate \ndebate on this most important issue. We will introduce this as a bill \nwhich will begin the rule XIV process in order to get it to the \ncalendar and allow the Senate to move to Senator Warner's legislation. \nWe would prefer to do it as a concurrent resolution; however, that \nwould only be the case if it would be open to complete substitute \namendments, for obvious reasons.\n\n  In order to permit the Senate to consider amendments which are \nappropriate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Senator Warner's concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. \n7, on Monday, February 5, at 12 noon, and that the entire concurrent \nresolution be open to amendments and that a cloture motion with respect \nto S. Con. Res. 2 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I would say to my \nfriend, the majority leader, about a week ago, the distinguished \nmajority leader indicated that we were going to follow the regular \norder, that the Biden resolution coming out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee would be the vehicle for our debate, and I gather, in \nlistening to the distinguished majority leader--if I might ask, without \nlosing my right to the floor, what is the status of the Biden \nresolution that came out of the Foreign Relations Committee?\n  Mr. REID. A motion to invoke cloture was filed on that. After we \ncomplete work on the minimum wage bill, automatically we will vote on \nthat. I say to my distinguished friend, cloture will not be invoked on \nthat. What I would like is unanimous consent that we not have to vote \ncloture, that we just vitiate that vote and move to the Warner \nresolution and do that Monday. But, as I know, the distinguished \nRepublican leader has only seen what I have given him, the last little \nbit, not because I didn't want to give it to him but I didn't have it. \nI certainly want\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\nthe leader to think about this during the night. I think it would be an \nexpeditious way to get to this.\n  It has taken a lot of time. I haven't been involved in any of the \nnegotiations. It was tempting, but I thought I would do more harm than \ngood. I haven't been involved in any of the negotiations with the \nSenators whom I have mentioned here. I think it would be to the best \ninterests of the Senate, majority and minority, to start Monday, as I \nhave suggested, and allow Senators--I will say, at a subsequent time, \nwhen the distinguished Republican leader yields the floor, I am going \nto say that I want to work with the Republican leader in setting up a \nprocess for making sure people have the ability to offer reasonable \namendments to this S. Con. Res. 7. That is my feeling. That is where we \nare with the Biden-Hagel-Snowe-Levin resolution that is before the \nSenate, or will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reclaiming the floor, reserving the right to object, \nso the Biden proposal which came out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--I hear the majority leader--is no longer in consideration. \nIf I understand the process correctly, it, too, could have been called \nup and an effort could have been made to turn it into a bill as well. \nIf we were to stay in bill status, would it be the intent of the \nmajority leader to fill up the tree?\n  Mr. REID. I will work with the Republican leader to take any \nsuggestion the Republican leader would have as to how we can begin a \ndebate. I would say in response to the statement, the reason I didn't \nput the Biden-Hagel matter in a rule XIV posture is that is not what we \nwant to start debate on. There is a bipartisan group of Senators who \nbelieve the more appropriate matter is the Warner amendment. I don't \nknow what happened in your caucus yesterday. In my caucus, there was \nnear unanimity for the Warner resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, \nSenator Warner has been working diligently on this issue and cares \ndeeply about it. We have had some discussions, but I had not seen \nSenator Warner's proposal until just tonight. I am not complaining \nabout that, but the text of it is new to me as well as to the \nDemocratic leader.\n  It is still my hope that we could, as we discussed over the last \ncouple of weeks in anticipation of this debate, enter into a consent \nagreement under which we would have had several different proposals in \ntheir entirety, realizing the difficulty of amending a concurrent \nresolution--several different proposals in their entirety that the \nSenate could consider. Maybe this is a better way to go, but it \noccurred to me that was probably the best way to go forward with this \nimportant debate.\n  Given the lateness of the hour and the newness of all of this, I am \ngoing to be constrained to object and will consider--I know we will \ncontinue this conversation in the morning in hopes of reaching some \nagreement that is mutually acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield to me for a minute?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to the Senator from Virginia, just making one \nbrief statement. I hope we can still do that. We still would like to do \nthat. I think this will be, as I said, a good place to start. I also \nwant the record to reflect tonight that the mere fact that this is in \nbill form is as a result of meeting the very stringent rules of the \nSenate to get it to the floor so we can have a vote on this matter on \nMonday; that at any time we would agree to take this not being bill \nlanguage and would be strictly a concurrent resolution language. We can \ndo that anytime. The reasons for that are quite obvious. We don't want \nthis--a concurrent resolution, the President doesn't have to sign it, \nwhatever happens on it. We will be happy to work on that, too.\n  I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join my leader in the objection because I do hope we \ncan work it out, that we do not have to resort to a bill status. \nEverybody knows what the rules are and how that would then involve the \nPresident in a bill status. This should be a matter handled by the \nSenate and the other body, should they so desire.\n  I say to my distinguished leader, I did mention this afternoon that I \nwas going to take these steps--basically the changes from the original \none, which we filed a week ago. Senator Nelson, Senator Collins, and \nmyself are still there. There is no major significant changes. We added \na provision regarding the serious problem I and other Senators see--and \nwe learned of it in the open session on Friday in the Armed Services \nCommittee and again this morning in closed session--of the need to \nclarify this question of how a dual command can take place in each of \nthe nine provinces of Baghdad between the Iraqi military and the U.S. \nmilitary. And, General Keane, on Friday, said he is going to urge \nGeneral Petraeus to try to work with that. I think that can be handled, \nbut it has to be clarified.\n\n  The other thing is that some colleagues thought maybe we were laying \nthe foundation of this body of the constitutional right of curtailing \nfunds. That was never the intention, and that is made quite clear. The \nrest of it are changes that I believe are not ones that in any way \naffect basically the thrust of the original resolution, which was to \ntry to put before the Senate as an institution the viewpoints of a \nbipartisan group--now 11 in number and others I think desiring to \njoin--such that if the Senate speaks in some way on this eventually, \nafter a debate, it represents to the American public the best efforts \nof this institution to reach a degree of bipartisanship on an issue \nwhich I think is one of the most important that I have visited in my \nnow 29th year in the Senate.\n  So I thank both leaders, and I join my distinguished leader at this \ntime in the objection because I do hope we do not have to resort to \nlegislative need of a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we can't get such consent, then we will \nhave to have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to Senator Levin's \nbill on Monday at 12 noon. As for consideration of an amendment, as I \nstated in our colloquy, and I state now to the Chair, we will work with \nthe Republican leader on an orderly process. He is an experienced \nlegislator, as we all are, working on this bill. The problem we have is \na narrow window of time because of the absolute requirement--absolute \nrequirement to finish the continuing appropriations resolution by \nFebruary 15 to avoid a total closure of the Federal Government--a total \nclosure of the Federal Government. There would be more time to debate \namendments, and I know the distinguished Republican leader is looking \nat this legislation tonight.\n  We didn't have to go through the cloture process on the motion to \nproceed to Senator Warner's legislation. We simply want the Senate's \nwill for the American people. I know that is what the minority wants, \nthat is what the majority wants, and we have to figure out a process to \ndo that. I am open to suggestions, but all I know, as I have told my \ntwo friends, there is no other way to get to the Warner resolution than \nhow we have done it tonight. If during the night we can work out \nsomething to move forward to a debate starting Monday, I think it would \nbe to the betterment of the Senate and the American people.\n  I repeat: It is done in bill form for the simple reason it is the \nonly way to get it to the floor. I repeat now for the second time in \nfront of the American people, at any time, either by unanimous consent \nor by a vote of the Democratic caucus, joining in with, I am sure, many \nRepublicans, we will strip that language so it doesn't have to go to \nthe President. We want this to be a resolution. This is something that \nis business within the family, the congressional family. The President \ndoesn't have to be involved in this--only indirectly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just briefly, I got the Warner \nresolution language about 7 o'clock. There are others on our side of \nthe aisle, including Senator McCain, Senator Graham,\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nSenator Cornyn, and others, who are deeply involved in this issue and \ninterested in how it is going to be disposed of. Senator Warner has \ndone his usual thoughtful job. He is probably the Senate expert on our \nside of the aisle in these matters, and his views of which way the \nSenate should proceed carry a lot of weight in the Senate. But I cannot \nat this late hour agree to this proposal tonight.\n  Having said that--and these will be my last thoughts, I believe, for \nthe evening--I do think there ought to be a way to work this out. We \nhave made considerable progress on our side of the aisle in narrowing \ndown the proposals that we might want to offer. And I still think the \npreferred way to do it--and I think the majority leader believes this \nas well--is to have a number of different concurrent resolutions in the \nqueue. The distinguished Senator from Virginia has made it clear that \nhe is very uncomfortable, as he just expressed himself a moment ago, \nwith taking the bill approach to this. The majority leader has \nindicated that is not his preference either. I think the message is: \nLet's see if we can't craft a unanimous consent agreement that is fair \nto both sides so that we can have this important debate on this \nexceedingly important issue next week.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join in that because I think the \noperative phrase is to let the Senate work its will. Those are the \nfirst words I used in connection with this resolution when I laid it \ndown last week. It is essential. This is one of the most important \nhistoric debates, as the distinguished leader--both leaders--have said. \nWe should let this body work its will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me commend the Senator from \nVirginia for his leadership and the contribution he has made to this \nhistoric debate, both for the Senate and for our Nation. Thank you \nbecause I think what you have presented in good faith is an effort to \nengage in a very important and historic debate. I thank you for that. \nThe fact that you have drawn so much support from both sides of the \naisle is a testament to the fine work you have done, and I am glad that \nyou are here this evening in an effort to continue that work.\n  I would say to the minority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, it is \nunderstandable that having been given this language and this \ninformation at this late hour that he wants a little more time to \nreflect on it, and I hope in the morning that we can come to the \nagreement that we all want. But to reiterate what the Senator from \nNevada, the majority leader, has said, what we are seeking to do is \nwhat the minority leader has expressed, and that is to create the \nappropriate forum and the appropriate vehicle for the debate on this \nissue.\n  We struggle because the procedures in the Senate make it difficult to \ntake resolutions and amendments. It is clumsy, it is awkward, it is \ndifficult to do. So what the majority leader has suggested is to treat \nthis resolution as a bill for the purpose of amendment but then to \nremove that bill status so that there is no question as to whether it \nis going to the President. That gives us a chance to work our will, as \nthe Senator from Virginia has said, using the bill-like approach to \namendment and gives the majority and minority leaders a chance to work \ntogether to find a reasonable number of reasonable amendments so that \nwe can, in fact, express our will on this critically important issue.\n  But I say to the minority leader from Kentucky, there is no guile in \nthis proposal. It is an effort to find a reasonable way for both sides \nof the aisle to address this historic debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1396-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1396-S1397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF ED GREELEGS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate today to say \nsomething I hoped I would never have to say. I am here to say thank you \nand farewell to my chief of staff for the past 17 years, Ed Greelegs, \nas he retires from the Senate.\n  This is the first time he has ever been on the floor of the Senate \nwhile it was in session. Ed is the kind of person who does his work \nwithout a lot of fanfare, without a lot of need for attention, but he \ndoes it so very well.\n  Some people are drawn to Congress because of what they think are the \nperks and power that come with the job. That is not what Ed Greelegs \nhas given so much of his life to. For Ed, being a good public servant \nhas always been privilege enough. The desire to help others, to try to \ntranslate our Nation's most cherished values into law and policies that \nmeet the challenge of our times--that is what brought Ed Greelegs to \nthe U.S. Congress and why he stayed all these years.\n  I will say without fear of contradiction that Ed is one of the most \nwell liked, even beloved figures on Capitol Hill. All you have to do is \nwalk down a hallway in the Capitol with Ed Greelegs and you will know \nwhat I mean. He knows everybody and everybody knows him. His easygoing \nnature and real caring for people means that he has made thousands of \nfriends on Capitol Hill. From those who do the important work of \nmaintaining and cleaning our offices to those at the highest levels, Ed \nknows them all.\n  We have a saying in our office, incidentally: Talk to Ed, he probably \nknows somebody. Whenever a new issue comes up, if you want to know who \nyou can turn to and trust, Ed invariably knows whom to call. The \nrelations he has made and nurtured on and off the Hill have been a \ngreat help to me for 17 years. I can't tell you the countless people \nwho have never met Ed but who have benefitted nonetheless from the \nalliances he has forged, the common ground he helped plow, and the laws \nhe helped pass.\n  One of Ed's great talents is recognizing and nurturing talent among \nothers. If I had a young person who came to me anytime in the last 17 \nyears who said, It has always been my dream to work on Capitol Hill, I \nwould say, I want you to meet Ed Greelegs. He would patiently take the \ntime to read the resume, talk to them, relate his life experience on \nCapitol Hill, and point them in a direction so they had a chance to \nrealize their dream, as he had. They come back to me, years later, \nafter success on the Hill or at some other branch of Government, and \nask, How is Ed? That is the most common question I run into.\n  Ed grew up in nearby Wheaton, MD, and graduated from the University \nof Maryland. He came to Capitol Hill as an intern in 1970. In the 20 \nyears between that first internship and becoming my chief of staff, Ed \nworked for Congressman Marty Russo of Illinois, Congressman Bob Eckhart \nof Texas on the House Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on \nInvestigations and Oversight, then for Congressman Sam Gejdenson of \nConnecticut, and finally back to Congressman Russo's office for most of \nthe 1980s. He worked briefly for the Consumer Federation of America and \nfor Fannie Mae. But when he left the Hill to go into the private \nsector, his heart was still here. He even told me stories of jobs in \nthe private sector where he never unpacked the boxes. He just never \nfelt comfortable. It was not where he wanted to be. He might have been \nmaking more money, but he wasn't happy. He found his way back to \nCapitol Hill.\n  It was the leadership he showed in the office of Marty Russo that \nreally brought Ed to my attention. In 1990, I persuaded him to come \nwork for me as my chief of staff in the House of Representatives. Six \nyears later, I decided to run for the Senate seat that belonged to my \nlongtime friend and mentor, Paul Simon. Ed Greelegs was at my side in \nthat effort.\n  I wondered how he would adjust, making that transition from the House \nto the Senate, but it was seamless. He knew just as many people on this \nside of the Hill as he continues to know on the House side.\n  For the 10 years I have served in the Senate, Ed Greelegs has been an \nunfailing source of wisdom and thoughtful advice. His quiet, wry sense \nof humor has helped to lighten the mood when things become too intense, \nand his decency, modesty, and great egalitarian spirit have helped \nremind everybody on our side of what is most important and why we are \nhere.\n  There are a few things Ed loves more than the Senate. Among them are \nhis wife Susan and his stepchildren Andrew and Amanda; another, his \nbooks. Ed has so many books you wouldn't believe it. He has a room, I \nunderstand, completely filled in his home. The fact that Susan stays \nwith him despite this obsession on books tells you what a strong \nmarriage they have. When I\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\nwould look in his office and see all of the books stacked up, I would \nthink, there is a guarantee he will never leave me because he just \ncan't bring himself to pack up all those books. But now he is going to \nhave to, I think.\n  Another one of Ed's loves is music. One of his favorite musicians is \nsinger-songwriter John Hiatt. Ed even persuaded Susan to include a John \nHiatt song at their wedding, entitled ``Have a Little Faith in Me.''\n  Over 17 years, I have come to have more than a little faith in Ed \nGreelegs--not just his knowledge but his character and his decency. \nWhat I know about him is that you never have to worry about his \nmotives. You never have to wonder if his advice is crafted to serve \nhimself or a friend more than it serves the common good. His goal has \nalways been the same: He wants the best for the people of Illinois and \nthe best for America. When things go well, as they often do when Ed is \ninvolved, he doesn't really care who gets the credit.\n  They say that behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in-\nlaw. I can tell you that behind every good Senator is a talented chief \nof staff. For the last 17 years, it has been my good fortune to have my \nfriend Ed Greelegs in that critical position in my office. I am \ngrateful to him for all he has done for me, for Illinois, and for our \nNation. I wish him the very best as he begins the next chapter of his \ncareer. I am sure it will be a successful chapter.\n  As you wander around Washington, you come to understand that there \nare some people whom everybody likes. Ed Greelegs is one of those \npeople.\n  My favorite story, which I want to add at this point, involves the \nfirst trip to Afghanistan after the Taliban were deposed. I joined with \nSenator Daschle and a number of other Senators. We went in on the first \ndaylight landing at Bagram Air Force Base in Kabul in Afghanistan. It \nwas very tense. There were armored personnel carriers in every \ndirection and troops with weapons to defend us as we came off the C-\n130. As I came down the ramp and got into an armored personnel carrier, \nthere was a man in civilian clothes standing there.\n  He asked: Are you Senator Dick Durbin?\n  I said: Yes.\n  He said: I am a friend of Ed Greelegs'.\n  I couldn't believe it. Here I am in the middle of a war zone, and I \nran into a friend of Ed Greelegs'.\n  Whether it is war or peace, whether it is on the Hill or off, time \nand again, everybody knows that Ed Greelegs is genuine. He is the real \nthing. I have been honored to have him at my side for 17 years. I wish \nhim the very best in his future pursuits.\n  Thanks, Ed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1397-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, Senator Landrieu and I come to the Senate \nfloor for a painful--for us--but necessary task, and that is to live up \nto our wager with colleagues from the great State of Illinois and \ncongratulate them on the Bears' defeat of the New Orleans Saints in the \nNFC championship game.\n  Of course, the Bears won fair and square 39 to 14, but that score \nreally doesn't reflect how the game was actually played. It was much \ncloser than that for a long time. The Bears' defense played \nexceptionally, hats-off to them, strong pass rush that really put the \nSaints' quarterback, Drew Brees, in some precarious situations. They \nalso played overall a really tough physical game, defensively and \noffensively. Because of some of the bone-crunching hits delivered by \nthe Bears' defenders, the Saints had multiple turnovers, and certainly \nthat was part of the problem from the Saints' perspective. But, really, \nI think the Chicago Bears won the game because of their incredible \nability to manage field position. Each time the Saints' offense took \nthe field, it appeared as if they had their back to the wall, including \nwhen a safety was scored against them.\n  So congratulations to the Chicago Bears. Again, Senator Landrieu and \nI are here to fulfill our commitment and pay our debt. By the way, we \njust served Senator Barack Obama's staff a lunch of great Louisiana \nfood, and we are about to do the exact same thing for Senator Durbin \nand his staff.\n  But as we give the Bears their due, I know both Senator Landrieu and \nI also want to praise the Saints for an absolutely unbelievable season \nwith the biggest turnaround in NFL history, going from a 3 in 13 last \nyear to the NFC championship game this year. Much more importantly than \njust that, they serve as a wonderful example of renewal and rebuilding \nfrom which we all can learn and emulate in terms of the rebuilding of \nthe gulf coast.\n  A lot of folks say it is just football, it is just sports, but \nparticularly in the context of everything folks in the greater New \nOrleans area are going through post-Katrina, the Saints meant an awful \nlot to us this season, and their example of leadership and integrity \nand great turnarounds and commitment is something we all took pride in \nand I think something we all learned from. That example is going to be \nrepeated in many other different walks of live as we spur on our \nrecovery on the gulf coast even further.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I again congratulate the Chicago Bears. \nI congratulate our two Senate colleagues from Illinois. I wish them all \nthe best in this Sunday's Super Bowl. But I also note, maybe they are \ngoing to need that good luck because they face another New Orleans \npowerhouse, Peyton Manning, in Miami. So good luck to them.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Speaking in my capacity as a Senator from \nMinnesota, I will say that our team, the Vikings, went four times and \nnever won the Super Bowl, so there is always hope.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for joining me this \nmorning to deliver some delicious, piping hot, and very spicy red beans \nand rice that he and I cooked through the night to deliver to our \ncolleagues, Senator Obama and Senator Durbin. I would like to \npersonally congratulate the Bears on their victory and say it was a \nhard-fought victory during a great game of icy and cold conditions, but \nour Saints stood up under the tremendous pressure of their defensive \nline.\n  As Senator Vitter said, the final score doesn't reflect the battle \nthat was actually played that day on that field. But we congratulate \nthe Bears on their victory and look forward to watching them in the \nSuper Bowl this Sunday.\n  But to the Saints, I have to say again, as I have said several times \non this Senate floor, thank you for being so reflective of and \nmirroring the spirit of the people from Louisiana, from New Orleans, \nfrom the region, and from south Louisiana who have struggled, and like \nyou, have been fighting back to bring our cities and our communities, \nlarge and small, urban and rural, back from the brink, in many cases, \nof utter destruction. The Saints have shown us the way, having \nexperienced themselves as players and family members the loss of their \nhomes, the loss of their places of worship, the loss of the schools \nwhere their children attended but, like so many hundreds of thousands \nof citizens, have literally marched their way back to victory. So we \nare very grateful for their inspiration and their encouragement, every \nmember of the team.\n  But to the Bears, led by Rex Grossman, who proved himself to be a \nSuper Bowl quarterback, to, again, their extraordinary defense on the \nfield, we congratulate them.\n  Senator Vitter and I love pizza. We were looking forward to that \nChicago pizza, but we ended up, because of what happened, having to \ndeliver our local favorite, red beans and rice, to Senator Durbin and \nSenator Obama. But our congratulations to them and to the people of \nChicago and to the citizens of Illinois who, I know, will be pulling \nfor their team.\n  I also want to say we will be looking forward to seeing Peyton \nManning on the field. He is a wonderful quarterback from a great family \nin New Orleans that has also helped us and inspired us a great deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1397-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1397-S1398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING GEORGE OMAS, CHAIRMAN, POSTAL RATE COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President. I rise to mark the retirement from Federal \nservice, of a loyal friend and Mississippian, and a fine public \nservant, George Omas.\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n  Word has reached me that George will soon be leaving the Postal Rate \nCommission, where he has been serving as Chairman since November 2001. \nHis leadership at the helm of that agency, which oversees the revenues \nand expenses of the U.S. Postal Service and recommends the appropriate \npostage rates, has done much to restore financial confidence in the \nPostal Service.\n  September 11 and the accompanying anthrax attacks rocked our U.S. \nPostal Service with unplanned for expenses to such a degree that an \nincrease in rates were badly needed to offset those expenses without \nreducing services to the American people. When the Postal Service made \ntheir request to the commission on September 24, 2001, George made \nhistory by thinking truly ``outside the box'' and proposed something \nnever done before but was highly needed at the time: a ``settlement \nagreement'' of a major rate case. No small task as it required the \nPostal Service, the Postal Rate Commission and almost 100 interested \nparties and representatives of the mailing industry to agree to forgo \nlengthy litigation of the pending case and meet and work out \ndifferences together.\n  He was told it was ``impossible'' there was too much money at stake \nfor parties to waive a good portion of their due process rights to \nachieve such an agreement. But, he felt strongly that September 11 was \nan extraordinary event and it called for extraordinary thinking on \neveryone's part, so on the first day of the hearings in that case after \nhe had read his opening statement, he added these remarks:\n\n       I have often heard it said that there could never be a \n     settlement in an omnibus rate case. There are too many \n     conflicting interests, and too much money is at stake. But it \n     seems to me that if there was ever a time when `business as \n     usual' was not an attractive course of action, and when \n     cooperative efforts to promptly resolve issues through \n     settlement might be the right course of action, that time is \n     now.\n\n  To everyone's surprise, even their own, the parties responded. In \napproximately two and a half months the many diverse interests that \nfrequently bitterly contest multiple issues in postal rate cases were \nable to negotiate, revise, and submit a stipulation and agreement as a \nproposed settlement. Instead of the normal 10 months, the entire case \nwas initiated, negotiated and agreed to within 6 months.\n  In the 2002 Annual Report of the Postal Service, the Postmaster \nGeneral and the Chairman of the Board of Governors explained the effect \nof those momentous remarks:\n\n       And, following a suggestion by the chairman of the Postal \n     Rate Commission, we approached our major stakeholders and \n     took a bold step that enabled us to implement new postage \n     rates in June, 2002, rather than in the fall. This gained us \n     an additional $1 billion in revenue. As a result, and despite \n     the impacts of the recession and the terror attacks, we were \n     able to close the year with a loss that was almost $700 \n     million below original projections and half of last year's. \n     None of the $762 million the Administration and Congress \n     generously appropriated to the Postal Service to protect the \n     security of the mail was used for operations.\n\n  George took the success of that effort and encouraged the Postal \nService to look beyond the historical friction existing at their two \nagencies and focus on new ways to help the Postal Service continue to \nbe successful. The Postal Service initiated a number of so-called \nnegotiated service agreements and the commission and interested parties \nprocessed such agreements that brought in new volumes of mail and \nadditional revenues to the Postal Service thus, extending the time \nneeded between rate increases.\n  George has been a very successful chairman at the commission and I \nwant to note his departure. I hope the legacy he leaves behind in the \npostal community and indeed, throughout government, is one of \ninnovative thinking and the knowledge that working together can solve \nseemingly insurmountable problems.\n  So now that I have told you about George and the good things he has \ndone, as a good Senator, I want to take credit for his good work by \nsaying that I have known George since our days together at The \nUniversity of Mississippi and that he served on my staff at various \ntimes in my career, including my time on the former House Committee on \nPost Office and Civil Service. When President Clinton nominated George \nas Postal Rate Commissioner in 1997, I was very pleased to introduce \nhim at his confirmation hearings and give him my support. Needless to \nsay, I was even more pleased when President Bush designated George as \nchairman of the commission in 2001.\n  George comes from good folks; his sister and her husband Bernadine \nand Ralph Marchitto, his niece Debra Lynn Wren, her husband John and \nGeorge's grand niece Rebecca Elizabeth Wren still reside in the Biloxi \narea. Almost everyone who lived in Biloxi in the 1950s to the 1980s \nknew his parents, Violet and Pete Omas.\n  I will add that while George may be leaving the Postal Rate \nCommission, I don't believe he will going far, he has too much left to \noffer and I look forward to continuing to follow his future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1398-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1398-S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have listened intently over the past \nfew weeks as the President, members of his Cabinet, and Members of this \nChamber have discussed Iraq, the war on terror, and ways to strengthen \nour national security.\n  For years, now, I have opposed this administration's policies in Iraq \nas a diversion from the fight against terrorism. But I have never been \nso sure of the fact that this administration misunderstands the nature \nof the threats that face our country. I am also surer than ever--and it \ngives me no pleasure to say this--that this President is incapable of \ndeveloping and executing a national security strategy that will make \nour country safer.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, because of our disproportionate focus \non Iraq, we are not using enough of our military and intelligence \ncapabilities for defeating al-Qaida and other terrorist networks around \nthe world, nor are we focusing sufficient attention on challenges we \nface with countries such as Iran, North Korea, Syria, or even China.\n  While we have been distracted in Iraq, terrorist networks have \ndeveloped new capabilities and found new sources of support throughout \nthe world. We have seen terrorist attacks in India, Morocco, Turkey, \nAfghanistan, Indonesia, Spain, Great Britain, and elsewhere. The \nadministration has failed to adequately address the terrorist safe \nhaven that has existed for years in Somalia or the recent instability \nthat has threatened to destabilize the region. And resurgent Taliban \nforces are contributing to growing levels of instability in \nAfghanistan.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. presence in Iraq is being used as a recruiting \ntool for terrorist organizations from around the world. We heard the \ntestimony of Dr. Paul Pillar, former lead CIA analyst for the Middle-\nEast, a few weeks ago in front of the Foreign Relations Committee. He \nsaid, and I quote:\n\n       The effects of the war in Iraq on international terrorism \n     were aptly summarized in the National Intelligence Estimate \n     on international terrorism that was partially declassified \n     last fall. In the words of the estimators, the war in Iraq \n     has become a ``cause celebre'' for jihadists, is ``shaping a \n     new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives,'' is one \n     of the major factors fueling the spread of the global \n     jihadist movement, and is being exploited by Al-Qa'ida ``to \n     attract new recruits and donors.'' I concur with those \n     judgments, as I believe would almost any other serious \n     student of international terrorism. [January 10th, 2007]\n\n  Retired senior military officers have also weighed in against the \nPresident's handling of this war. Retired commander of Central Command, \nGeneral Hoar, testified in front of the Foreign Relations Committee \nlast week. This is what the general said:\n\n       Sadly, the new strategy, a deeply flawed solution to our \n     current situation, reflects the continuing and chronic \n     inability of the administration to get it right. The \n     courageous men and women of our Armed Forces have been \n     superb. They have met all the challenges of this difficult \n     war. Unfortunately, they have not been well served by the \n     civilian leadership. [January 18th, 2007]\n\n  If we escalate our involvement in Iraq or continue the President's \ncourse, that means keeping large numbers of U.S. military personnel in \nIraq indefinitely. It means continuing to ask our brave servicemembers \nto somehow provide a military solution to a political problem, one that \nwill require the will of the Iraqi people to resolve.\n  Escalating our involvement in Iraq also means that our military's \nreadiness levels will continue to deteriorate.\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nIt means that a disproportionate level of our military resources will \ncontinue to be focused on Iraq while terrorist networks strengthen \ntheir efforts worldwide. The fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan, too, will continue to suffer, as it has since we invaded \nIraq. If we escalate our involvement in Iraq, we won't be able to \nfinish the job in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, the safety of our country would be uncertain, at best. \nTerrorist organizations and insurgencies around the world will continue \nto use our presence in Iraq as a rallying cry and recruiting slogan. \nTerrorist networks will continue to increase their sophistication and \nreach as our military capabilities are strained in Iraq.\n  These are only some of the costs of this ongoing war in Iraq. I have \nnot addressed the most fundamental cost of this war the loss of the \nlives of our Nation's finest men and women, and the grief and suffering \nthat accompanies their sacrifice by their families. We have lost 3,075 \nmen and women in uniform, and that number continues to rise.\n  These losses, and the damaging consequences to our national security, \nare not justified, in my mind, because the war in Iraq was, and \nremains, a war of choice. Some in this body, even those who have \nquestioned the initial rationale for the war, suggest that we have no \nchoice but to remain in Iraq indefinitely. Some here in this Chamber \nsuggest that there is no choice than to continue to give the President \ndeference, even when the result is damaging to our national security. \nSome argue it isn't the role of Congress to even debate bringing an end \nto this war.\n  That argument is mistaken. Congress has a choice, and a \nresponsibility, to determine whether we continue to allow this \nPresident to devote so much of our resources to Iraq or whether we \nlisten to the American public and put an end to this war, begin \nrepairing our military, and devote our resources to waging a global \ncampaign against al-Qaida and its allies. We cannot do both. The \nConstitution gives Congress the explicit power ``[to] declare War,'' \n``[t]o raise and support Armies,'' ``[t]o provide and maintain a \nNavy,'' and ``[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the \nland and naval Forces.'' In addition, under article I, ``No Money shall \nbe drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made \nby Law.'' These are direct quotes from the Constitution of the United \nStates. Yet to hear some in the administration talk, it is as if these \nprovisions were written in invisible ink. They were not. These powers \nare a clear and direct statement from the Founders of our Republic that \nCongress has authority to declare, to define, and ultimately, to end a \nwar.\n  Our Founders wisely kept the power to fund a war separate from the \npower to conduct a war. In their brilliant design of our system of \ngovernment, Congress got the power of the purse, and the President got \nthe power of the sword. As James Madison wrote, ``Those who are to \nconduct a war cannot in the nature of things, be proper or safe judges, \nwhether a war ought to be commenced, continued or concluded.''\n  The President has made the wrong judgment about Iraq time and again, \nfirst by taking us into war on a fraudulent basis, then by keeping our \nbrave troops in Iraq for nearly 4 years, and now by proceeding despite \nthe opposition of the Congress and the American people to put 21,500 \nmore American troops into harm's way.\n  If and when Congress acts on the will of the American people by \nending our involvement in the Iraq war, Congress will be performing the \nrole assigned it by the Founding Fathers defining the nature of our \nmilitary commitments and acting as a check on a President whose \npolicies are weakening our Nation.\n  There is little doubt that decisive action from the Congress is \nneeded. Despite the results of the election and 2 months of study and \nsupposed consultation--during which experts and Members of Congress \nfrom across the political spectrum argued for a new policy--the \nPresident has decided to escalate the war. When asked whether he would \npersist in this policy despite congressional opposition, he replied: \n``Frankly, that's not their responsibility.''\n  Last week Vice President Cheney was asked whether the nonbinding \nresolution passed by the Foreign Relations Committee that will soon be \nconsidered by the full Senate would deter the President from escalating \nthe war. He replied: ``It's not going to stop us.''\n  In the United States of America, the people are sovereign, not the \nPresident. It is Congress's responsibility to challenge an \nadministration that persists in a war that is misguided and that the \ncountry opposes. We cannot simply wring our hands and complain about \nthe administration's policy. We cannot just pass resolutions saying \n``your policy is mistaken.'' And we can't stand idly by and tell \nourselves that it is the President's job to fix the mess he made. It is \nour job to fix the mess, and if we don't do so we are abdicating our \nresponsibilities.\n  I have just introduced legislation, cosponsored by Senator Boxer, \nwhich will prohibit the use of funds to continue the deployment of U.S. \nforces in Iraq 6 months after enactment. By prohibiting funds after a \nspecific deadline, Congress can force the President to bring our forces \nout of Iraq and out of harm's way.\n  This legislation will allow the President adequate time to redeploy \nour troops safely from Iraq, and it will make specific exceptions for a \nlimited number of U.S. troops who must remain in Iraq to conduct \ntargeted counterterrorism and training missions and protect U.S. \npersonnel. It will not hurt our troops in any way--they will continue \nreceiving their equipment, training, and salaries. It will simply \nprevent the President from continuing to deploy them to Iraq and will \nprovide a hard deadline for bringing them home. By passing this bill, \nwe can finally focus on repairing our military and countering the full \nrange of threats that we face around the world.\n  There is plenty of precedent for Congress exercising its \nconstitutional authority to stop U.S. involvement in armed conflict. \nJust yesterday, I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing entitled \n``Exercising Congress's Constitutional Power to End a War.''\n  Without exception, every witness--those called by the majority and \nthe minority--did not challenge the constitutionality of Congress's \nauthority to use the power of the purse to end a war. A number of the \nwitnesses went further and said that Congress has not only the \nauthority but the obligation to take specific actions that are in the \ninterest of the nation.\n  I would like to read one quote by Mr. Lou Fisher of the Library of \nCongress. He said, and I quote:\n\n       In debating whether to adopt statutory restrictions on the \n     Iraq War, Members of Congress want to be assured that \n     legislative limitations do not jeopardize the safety and \n     security of U.S. forces. Understandably, every Member wants \n     to respect and honor the performance of dedicated American \n     soldiers. However, the overarching issue for lawmakers is \n     always this: Is a military operation in the nation's \n     interest? If not, placing more U.S. soldiers in harm's way is \n     not a proper response. Members of the House and the Senate \n     cannot avoid the question or defer to the President. \n     Lawmakers always decide the scope of military operations, \n     either by accepting the commitment as it is or by altering \n     its direction and purpose. Decision legitimately and \n     constitutionally resides in Congress.\n\n  There are significant historical precedents for this type of \nlegislation that I have introduced today.\n  In late December 1970, Congress prohibited the use of funds to \nfinance the introduction of ground combat troops into Cambodia or to \nprovide United States advisors to or for Cambodian military forces in \nCambodia.\n  In late June 1973, Congress set a date to cut off funds for combat \nactivities in South East Asia. The provision read, and I quote:\n\n       None of the funds herein appropriated under this act may be \n     expended to support directly or indirectly combat activities \n     in or over Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam \n     by United States forces, and after August 15, 1973, no other \n     funds heretofore appropriated under any other act may be \n     expended for such purpose.\n\n  More recently, President Clinton signed into law language that \nprohibited funding after March 31, 1994, for military operations in \nSomalia, with certain limited exceptions. And in 1998, Congress passed \nlegislation including a provision that prohibited funding for Bosnia \nafter June 30, 1998, unless the President made certain assurances.\n  Many Members of this body are well aware of this history. \nUnfortunately,\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\nmany Members of the Congress are still concerned that any effort to \nlimit the President's damaging policies in Iraq would have adverse \nconsequences.\n  Let me dispel a few myths that have been generated as a result of the \ndiscussion about the use of the power of the purse.\n  Some have suggested that if Congress uses the power of the purse, our \nbrave troops in the field will somehow suffer or be hung out to dry. \nThis is completely false. Congress has the power to end funding for the \nPresident's failed Iraq policy and force him to bring our troops home. \nNothing--nothing--will prevent the troops from receiving the body \narmor, ammunition, and other resources they need to keep them safe \nbefore, during, and after their redeployment. By forcing the President \nto safely bring our forces out of Iraq, we will protect them, not harm \nthem.\n  Others have suggested that using the power of the purse is \nmicromanaging the war. Not so. It makes no sense to argue that once \nCongress has authorized a war it cannot take steps to limit or end that \nwar. Setting a clear policy is not micromanaging; it is exactly what \nthe Constitution contemplates, as we have heard today. Congress has had \nto use its power many times before, often when the executive branch was \nignoring the will of the American people. It has done so without \nmicromanaging and without endangering our soldiers.\n  Some have argued that cutting off funding would send the wrong \nmessage to the troops. Our new Defense Secretary even made this \nargument last week with respect to the nonbinding resolution now under \nconsideration. These claims are offensive and self-serving.\n  Congress has the responsibility in our constitutional system to stand \nup to the President when he is using our military in a way that is \ncontrary to our national interest. If anything, Congress's failure to \nact when the American people have lost confidence in the President's \npolicy would send a more dangerous and demoralizing message to our \ntroops--that Congress is willing to allow the President to pursue \ndamaging policies that are a threat to our national security and that \nplace them at risk.\n  Any effort to end funding for the war must ensure that our troops are \nnot put in even more danger and that important counterterrorism \nmissions are still carried out. Every Member of this body, without \nexception, wants to protect our troops, and our country. But we can do \nthat while at the same time living up to our responsibility to stop the \nPresident's ill-advised, ill-conceived, and poorly executed policies, \nwhich are taking a devastating toll on our military and on our national \nsecurity. It is up to Congress to do what is right for our troops and \nfor our national security, which has been badly damaged by diverting so \nmany resources into Iraq.\n  As long as this President goes unchecked by Congress, our troops will \nremain needlessly at risk, and our national security will be \ncompromised. Congress has the duty to stand up and use its power to \nstop him. If Congress doesn't stop this war, it is not because it \ndoesn't have the power; It is because it doesn't have the will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1400-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1400-S1401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony \n     even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received \n     in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as \n     appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to \n     each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and \n     distributed electronically.\n\n\n         executive sessions for the purpose of marking up bills\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed data for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific \n     subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing \n     each bill or other matters to be considered and including:\n       (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session including, whenever \n     possible, an explanation of changes to existing law proposed \n     to be made.\n       2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the \n     committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide \n     each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of \n     any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee \n     with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1403-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1403-S1405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS RULES OF PROCEDURES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President it is both with deep gratitude and regret \nthat I announce the retirement of my Academies Coordinator, Teresa \nPoole, from the public sector.\n  Teresa Poole, a distinguished U.S. Senate staffer, is set to retire \nfrom the political arena on January 31, 2007. This year has been a \nmilestone, marking her thirtieth year of hard work and dedication to \nthe Federal Government, the citizens of southwest Missouri, and most \nimportantly the U.S. Senate offices of Danforth, Ashcroft, and Bond. We \nhave come together to honor and congratulate Teresa on her devotion, \nteam spirit, and the proficient skills she has provided the Springfield \noffice over the past 30 years. Teresa is to be envied and admired by \nall in government for her service to the public, which she has done \nwith a helpful heart.\n  In January 1977, Teresa Poole was member of the first U.S. Senate \nconstituent service office in southwest Missouri for Senator Danforth. \nLittle would Teresa know this would begin a remarkable 30-year trek \nwith the U.S. Senate. With her incredible knowledge of the inner \nworkings of government and her history with the U.S. Senate, Teresa has \nbeen a great source of information. She took pride in being able to \nguide effectively constituents, organizations, and coworkers through \nthe complex infrastructure of government.\n  Among the numerous achievements that Teresa has attained over the \nyears, her most remarkable was her enthusiastic commitment to the \nMilitary Academies. She has worked tirelessly to help students from \nacross Missouri to achieve their dreams of becoming officers in the \nU.S. military by guiding them through the process required to gain a \ncongressional nomination. Teresa has sifted through thousands of \nletters, applications, and grades, and made endless calls to hopeful \napplicants. All of this would be finally completed in December, only to \nstart over the next year with new names, faces, and challenges.\n  Teresa Poole has shown unwavering loyalty and dedication to her job \nover the past 30 years. From the day to day routine of compiling local \nclips to answering the phone, Teresa has approached every task with \nhard work and a positive attitude. She has delighted everyone she meets \nwith her love of antiques and finding good deals at various auctions \nand sales, her love of travel with her mother and daughter, her passion \nfor her family and heritage, and her impeccable spirit. We commend her \nfor a stunning and distinguished career with the U.S. Senate and wish \nTeresa the best in all her future endeavors.\n  Teresa, we have been honored to work with you for so many years. We \nwill miss you and we wish you and your family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1406-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GARRETT WALTON\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the power \nof volunteerism and how one person can--in the truest sense--make a \nlasting difference in the world.\n  The volunteer spirit helps to keep society civil; volunteers give of \nthemselves in a selfless manner. That spirit is exemplified by the acts \nof one of my own constituents, Mr. Garrett Walton.\n  Garrett Walton and volunteerism seem to be synonymous with one \nanother.\n  When Hurricane Ivan ravaged northwest Florida in September of 2004, \nWalton, a former attorney-turned-developer put his career on hold, and \ntook on a full-time volunteer role to help an entire region of our \nState recover.\n  While the eye of the storm came ashore at Gulf Shores, AL, its most \nsevere winds hit the Florida counties of Santa Rosa and Escambia. Those \nmost damaging of winds, exceeding 140 miles per hour, were a part of a \ncolossal hurricane that triggered more than 100 tornadoes, and also \nbrought a 13-foot storm surge.\n  Roughly 75,000 homes were damaged; 50,000 people were displaced; and \nof all of the damaged homes, 37,000 of them belonged to families whose \nhousehold incomes totaled less than $30,000 a year.\n  Garrett helped to lead a group of civic-minded citizens that met in \neach others' homes to discuss how they could rebuild the community.\n  What grew out of that was a volunteer organization known as REBUILD \nNorthwest Florida. It was a grassroots effort that grew into something \nextraordinary. More than 4,000 volunteers have contributed close to a \nquarter of a million hours of volunteer service. Garrett has himself \ncontributed close to 5,000 hours of service.\n  As of the first week of this year, REBUILD had completed more than \n1,350 projects. And as recently as this month, January of 2007, Mr. \nWalton has continued his relentless quest to rebuild communities in \nnorthwest Florida.\n  With the help of a few other volunteers, including Carolyn Appleyard, \nMiles Anderson, and Mark Ramos, this small contingent has taken it upon \nthemselves to help many of their fellow Floridians pick up their lives \nafter this awful natural disaster. Ivan caused widespread devastation; \nand as one of Florida's most deadly and costly storms, we knew the \nrecovery effort would be long and arduous. I commend Garrett Walton for \nrising to the challenge.\n  He put others ahead of himself--and not just for a day, a week, or a \nmonth, but for several years now. Thank you, Garrett, for your \ndedication to the people of Florida. You are an exemplar of the \nvolunteer spirit, and make us all very proud to be called \nFloridians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1406-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1406-S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVIS MORIUCHI\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish share with the Senate \na tribute to Mr. Davis Moriuchi, a leader in the Pacific Northwest who \nis retiring after 30 years of service with the Army Corps of Engineers. \nDuring his tenure with the Corps, Davis has left an indelible mark on \nthe environment, economy, and people of Washington State. His expertise \nand dedication will be sorely missed.\n  My work with Davis over the years has served as a reminder of the \ndifference dedicated individuals make in large and complex \norganizations like the Corps of Engineers. As we all know, the Corps \ntackles huge projects that have a widespread impact on our Nation. \nDavis's work has reaffirmed for me the importance of committed \nindividuals on the success of those projects. Our State has been lucky \nto have been able to rely on his personal touch and expertise for so \nmany years.\n  In Davis, my staff and I have also found an invaluable resource whose \ndevotion to the region is as great as ours. Time and again, Davis has \ntaken the time to explain even the most detailed aspects of Corps \ninitiatives. His patience, clarity, and honesty have allowed me to be a \nstronger advocate for programs that will have long-term consequences \nfor the Pacific Northwest.\n  While the extent of Davis's impact cannot be measured by projects \nalone, I would be remiss if I did not mention a few of the projects \nthat he has taken on. We in Washington State will particularly miss \nDavis's leadership on water resource projects. From the new Navigation \nLock at the Bonneville Dam to the ongoing Columbia River Channel \nImprovement Project, Davis's work on the health of our State's critical \nwaterways will have lasting effects.\n  Davis has also championed interim repairs of the Columbia River \njetties. It was a very exciting day last August, when Colonel \nO'Donavon, Davis, a host of other stakeholders and I stood at the mouth \nof the Columbia River and saw interim jetty repairs. Davis was \ninstrumental in making that day possible.\n  Davis is ending his career as the deputy district commander for \nproject management and the chief of Planning, Programs and Project \nManagement Division for the U.S Army Corps of Engineers, Portland \nDistrict. It is a title that, while long in syllables, does not begin \nto grasp at the immensity of his service. But then again, Davis has \nnever worked for titles or credit. His main concern has always been \nthat the work of the Corps is well-executed and timely.\n  Davis's devotion to the region will be truly missed. I would like to \nwish him\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\nthe best of luck in an enjoyable retirement and thank him for his \ndistinguished service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1407-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF JOE ALSTON\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service \nof the Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent, Joe Alston, who is \nretiring this week. Joe is a man of considerable integrity, ability, \nand achievement, and his presence at the Grand Canyon will be deeply \nmissed.\n  After 31 dedicated years, Joe Alston is retiring from the National \nPark Service. He has spent the last 6 years serving as the \nsuperintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park, the crown jewel of \nArizona and one of the Nation's oldest and most heavily visited \nNational Parks. Joe has held a wide variety of positions in the Park \nService beginning with his first job as a seasonal firefighter on the \nNorth Rim of the Grand Canyon. In the years that followed, Joe worked \nas a concessions specialist at Yellowstone National Park and later \nbecame the chief of the Concessions Management Division in the Alaska \nRegional Office. More recently, Joe Alston was the assistant \nsuperintendent of Yellowstone National Park and eventually served as \nsuperintendent at several major National Park units such as the Glacier \nBay National Park and Preserve, the Curecanti National Recreation Area, \nthe Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and the Rainbow Bridge \nNational Monument.\n  We are very fortunate to have benefited from the passion and \nexpertise that Superintendent Alston brought to the Grand Canyon. Joe \nwas challenged with many complex issues and longstanding conflicts \nranging from park transportation to aircraft overflights, yet he has \nmanaged them all with foresight, thoughtfulness, and resolve. Under \nJoe's leadership, the Park Service saw the completion of the Colorado \nRiver Management Plan, which protects park resources by implementing a \nnew river permitting system that balances competing commercial and \nrecreational interests. Despite its highly contentious nature, it was \nSuperintendent Alston's desire to hear and understand the views of \nriver runners and other constituents by affording the public every \nopportunity to provide input during the CRMP planning process. Few \nsuperintendents in National Park Service history have undertaken such \nan open nationwide approach that concluded with such remarkable \nsuccess.\n  The Grand Canyon has received many honors during Superintendent \nAlston's tenure. In 2004, Grand Canyon National Park was recognized for \na number of environmental accomplishments by EPA Administrator Mike \nLeavitt, including having the first EPA certified Leadership in Energy \nand Environmental Design ``green building'' owned and operated in a \nNational Park. Joe was the driving force behind the implementation of \nnew training programs that led to the reduction of visitor and employee \ninjuries which earned the Park the Regional Director's Safety \nExcellence Award and the Director's Safety Excellence Award for Public \nSafety Achievement in 2005. Among the many accolades Joe has received \nover the years, perhaps the most noteworthy came in 2005 when Secretary \nGale Norton awarded him the Meritorious Service Award, the second \nhighest honorary recognition granted to Interior Department employees.\n  Joe Alston's ties to the Grand Canyon extend beyond his outstanding \nprofessional career. Indeed, the Grand Canyon also happens to be where \nhe met his wife, Judy, who is a teacher with the Grand Canyon Public \nSchools System. Joe is regarded by those living in northern Arizona as \nan individual deeply connected to the community. Just last month, he \naccepted the Community Person of the Year award from the Grand Canyon \nRotary Club for ushering in a new era of partnership between the \ncommunities of Tusayan, AZ, and Grand Canyon National Park.\n  My son and I had the distinct pleasure of hiking the Grand Canyon rim \nto rim last year with the accompaniment of Joe Alston. I can think of \nfew others alive today who are as knowledgeable and devoted to the \nhistory and culture of the Grand Canyon than Superintendent Alston. I \nwish Joe the very best in his future goals and ambitions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1407-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SAINT PHOTIOS NATIONAL SHRINE\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I honor the 25th \nanniversary of the Saint Photios National Shrine, the only Greek \nOrthodox National Shrine in the country, located in Saint Augustine, \nFL.\n  As early as 1768 and under the leadership of Dr. Andrew Turnbull, \nGreek immigrants traveled to America to seek a better life in Florida. \nMany of these early Greek Americans migrated to Saint Augustine, where, \nover time, a strong Greek community has formed. Greek immigrants found \nrefuge there as many gathered for solace, fellowship, and worship at \nthe historic Averos House built in 1749 on Saint George Street. The \nAveros House was purchased by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in 1965, \nand in 1982, was opened as a National Greek Orthodox Shrine named after \nSaint Photios the Great, Patriarch of Constantinople.\n  The Saint Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine gives honor to the \nmemory of the first colony of Greeks in the Americas and the succeeding \ngenerations of Greek immigrants; it now serves as a connection and \npilgrimage point for Greek Americans and the Greek Orthodox Church in \nAmerica. It also serves to preserve, enhance, and promote the ethnic \nand cultural traditions of Greek heritage and the teachings of the \nGreek Orthodox Church in America.\n  The Shrine continues to be faithful in maintaining and perpetuating \nthe Greek Orthodox faith and Hellenic Heritage through its programs and \nactivities to all who pass through its historic doors.\n  Mr. President, February 4, 2007, will mark the 25th anniversary of \nthe Saint Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring the purposeful commitment and \nachievements of this religious and historical institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1407-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1407-S1408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING HANLEY DENNING\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I mourn the loss of Hanley \nDenning, a truly remarkable native of Maine who in word and deed \nrepresented the very best of our State and Nation.\n  Hanley was the visionary founder and executive director of Safe \nPassage, a Central American-based nonprofit agency which provides \nchildren who live in the Guatemala City garbage dump opportunity and \nhope through myriad forms, including education, nutrition, and health \ncare. Hanley founded Safe Passage in 1999 after having seen children \nexisting amid the squalor and destitution of refuse and trash. But \nwhere many would have seen a dead-end marked by desolation, Hanley saw \na need which soon after evolved into a calling that required conscience \nand action. She imagined a pathway out--and possessed the will, \ndetermination, and resolve to forge a plan to begin making that route a \nreality. Hanley took a dilapidated church near the waste dump and \ndeveloped a drop-in center where children could receive food and a safe \nhaven.\n  Hanley found that access to education of any kind was not a \npossibility for children who couldn't begin to afford the enrollment \nfees, school supplies, and books required by the Guatemalan public \nschools--not to mention requisite school uniforms and shoes. But thanks \nto Safe Passage, children have been able to attend a local public \nschool for at least a half-day term. And that experience is \ncomplemented by the additional educational reinforcement, care, and \nsupervision received at the center. Whether it is homework, hands-on \nlearning activities, nutrition, medical attention, or a range of other \nprograms, these at-risk youth are recipients of the care they deserve. \nToday, remarkably, Safe Passage serves as many as 600 children ages 2 \nto 19 years old.\n  Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw once famously wrote that ``You \nsee things; and you say, `Why?' But I dream things that never were; and \nI say, `Why not?' '' When Hanley saw despair, poverty, and \nindescribable hopelessness, she must have at first said, ``Why?'' But \nshe responded to an unforgivable, intolerable situation--not with \nindifference, resignation, or anger--but by saying, ``Why not?'' Why \nnot carve out a way forward for these children that leads from an \nabject condition to\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\none where the objective is a better way of life.\n  Hanley's response to the deplorable situation she found at the \nGuatemalan dump is emblematic of her overall approach to so much of her \nlife--one filled with a selfless care for others and a willful devotion \nto being an agent of good will and positive change. Although she hadn't \ncreated Safe Passage until 1999, Hanley had been offering a kind of \nsafe passage for so many during years prior to her arrival in \nGuatemala. Along with earning a master's degree along the way, Hanley \nwas also working at a mental health center, assisting children affected \nby AIDS, and teaching in a Head Start program.\n  With this shining example of service, it is little wonder Bowdoin \nCollege, her alma mater, recognized Hanley's extraordinary \ncontributions by honoring her with its 2002 Common Good Award. What was \nso exceptional about Hanley was her longstanding dedication and \nunfailing determination to address and improve the human condition. She \ntruly exemplified words spoken in 1902 by Joseph McKeen, first \npresident of Bowdoin:\n\n       . . . institutions are founded and endowed for the common \n     good and not for the private advantage of those who resort to \n     them for education. It is not that they may be able to pass \n     through life in an easy and reputable manner, but that their \n     mental powers may be cultivated and improved for the benefit \n     of society.\n\n  Hanley's greatest legacy and enduring cause will be memorialized in \nher name and with her spirit--in a thriving center given to helping \nthose who truly cannot help themselves; a center where, according to a \nPortland Press Herald account, just last year six Safe Passage students \nwere selected to enroll in Guatemala City's foremost private high \nschools, where the annual budget has grown from funds in the hundreds \nto $1.6 million and an employee base of 100, and where more than 500 \npeople from Greater Portland are counted among an emerging force for \ngood of Safe Passage volunteers.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Hanley's parents, Michael and \nMarina Denning, and her three brothers, Jordan, Seth, and Lucas.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for affording me the opportunity to speak \nabout this truly exceptional Mainer and American whose memory will be a \nlasting inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1408-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 49.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Biden, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 439. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain retired members of the uniformed services who have a service-\nconnected disability to receive both disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired \npay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related \nSpecial Compensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have a debate on Iraq, and \nit will be a historic debate about that war, a war that has demanded \nunparalleled sacrifices from our men and women in uniform.\n  While we have our disagreements with the President's conduct of the \nwar, all 100 Senators stand side by side in supporting our troops. They \nhave done everything asked of them, carrying out a difficult mission \nwith honor and skill. We as a country owe the brave men and women in \nour military a debt of gratitude and have responsibility to ensure our \nveterans receive both the thanks of a grateful nation and the benefits \nthey have earned,\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nand that is a subject I would like to discuss briefly this morning.\n  About 8 years ago, one of my staff came to me and said: Senator, do \nyou realize that if a person is disabled in the military and retires \nfrom the military, they cannot draw on both their benefits? I said: \nWhat? And he repeated that. If you are in the military and you become \ndisabled and you retire, you cannot draw both your benefits. I thought \nmy staffer didn't know what he was talking about, but he did. That was \nthe law in our country and had been for many years, and it was a wrong \nlaw. That law is still mostly in effect, and that is too bad.\n  When someone who is disabled retires from the U.S. military, he or \nshe cannot draw on both their benefits. If you retire from any other \nbranch of the Federal Government, such as the Bureau of Land \nManagement, you can draw both your disability pay and your retirement \npay but, no, not if you are in the military. These people have been \nrobbed of their benefits, in my opinion, and I refer specifically to \nthousands of men and women who have been denied their retirement \nbecause of an unfair policy referred to as concurrent receipt.\n  By law, disabled veterans, as I have said, cannot collect disability \npay and retirement pay at the same time. What does this mean? It means \nfor every dollar of compensation a disabled veteran receives as a \nresult of their injuries, they must sacrifice a dollar of their \nretirement pay they earned in the service of our Nation. In many cases, \nthis ban takes away a veteran's full retirement pay, wiping away the \nbenefits he or she earned in 20 or more years of service. That is \nwrong.\n  Concurrent receipt is a special tax on the men and women who keep us \nsafe. Few veterans can afford to live on their retirement pay alone. \nThose burdened with disability face an even greater struggle, often \ndenied any postservice work. They receive disability compensation to \npay for pain, suffering, and loss of future earnings caused by a \nservice-connected illness or injury. No other Federal retiree is forced \nto make forfeit of their retirement--only our disabled military \nretirees. This is not just an error, it is a disgrace.\n  Of course, concurrent receipt is not a new problem. I hope most \neveryone in the Senate knows about it. This is the seventh year I have \nintroduced legislation to give disabled veterans the support they have \nearned, and I will continue fighting until we succeed, ending this \nunacceptable policy.\n  I first of all want to suggest that the two managers of the Defense \nbill, every year since I have worked on this, have been Senator Warner \nand Senator Levin, and they have helped me. I appreciate that very \nmuch. They have been thoughtful and understanding in their approach to \nthis issue. What has happened these past 7 years is good but not really \ngood. We have chipped away at this unfair policy of concurrent receipt.\n  In 2000, I introduced legislation to eliminate this unfair policy for \nthe first time. I did it at the end of the 106th Congress. This \nlegislation passed the Senate but was removed by the House during \nconference. So I reintroduced the legislation in the 107th Congress, in \nboth 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, it was once again adopted by the \nSenate but removed in conference.\n  In 2003, I proposed legislation to allow disabled veterans with at \nleast a 50-percent disability rating to become eligible for full \nconcurrent receipt over a 10-year phase-in period. Despite veto threats \nfrom the Bush administration, Congress passed this very important \nversion of concurrent receipt.\n  In 2004, I took it a step further. I introduced legislation to \neliminate the 10-year phase-in period for veterans with a 100-percent \ndisability. The motivation here was to get concurrent receipt to the \nmost severely disabled veterans. We thought many of these veterans \nwould never see the benefits with a 10-year phase-in. They are old \nWorld War II veterans, where the average age is well over 80 now, and \nto think they would have to wait 10 years for a phase-in isn't very \nfair.\n  In 2005, we focused on the most severely disabled veterans and \nsuccessfully eliminated the 10-year phase-in for veterans listed as \nunemployable. I was pleased with the passage of that 2005 amendment but \ndisappointed that the conference committee chose not to enact this \nvaluable legislation for veterans rated as unemployable until 2009. So \nin 2006, I sought to get unemployable veterans immediate relief, but we \ndidn't act. Congress didn't act.\n  So here we are in 2007, back at it again. Today, concurrent receipt \nremains one of my highest priorities. It is a priority, I believe, in \nfairness. We need to continue to chip away at this policy, and I am \ncommitted to that goal 100 percent, so that 100 percent of disabled \nveterans get the money they earn in being part of the great fighting \nforce of this Nation.\n  We are blessed in this country to be defended by an All-Volunteer \nArmy. These patriots put their lives and safety on the line because \nthey love this country. I believe it is time for this country and this \nCongress to repay their service and sacrifice, and that is why I am \nreintroducing today the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for loan repayment for prosecutors and \npublic defenders; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the John R. \nJustice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007. I am honored \nto have the support and cosponsorship of Senator Leahy and Senator \nSpecter, the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, on \nthis important legislation. I look forward to working closely with \nChairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter to advance it through the \nJudiciary Committee and secure its enactment into law. I also \nappreciate the cosponsorship of Senator Smith, Senator Kerry and \nSenator Collins on this bipartisan bill.\n  Our bill seeks to enhance our criminal justice system by encouraging \ntalented law school graduates to serve as criminal prosecutors and \npublic defenders. The bill would establish a student loan repayment \nprogram for qualified attorneys who agree to remain employed for at \nleast 3 years as State or local criminal prosecutors, or as State, \nlocal, or Federal public defenders in criminal cases.\n  This legislation is supported by the American Bar Association, the \nNational District Attorneys Association, the National Association of \nProsecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n  For our criminal justice system to function effectively, we need to \nhave a sufficient supply of dedicated and competent attorneys working \nin prosecutor and public defender offices. However, many qualified law \nschool graduates who have a strong motivation to work in the public \nsector find it economically impossible due to the overwhelming burden \nof student loan debt.\n  The legal profession and our communities pay a severe price when law \ngraduates are shut out from pursuing public service careers due to \neducational debt. When prosecutor and public defender offices cannot \nattract new lawyers or keep experienced ones, their ability to protect \nthe public interest is compromised. Such offices may find themselves \nunable to take on new cases due to staffing shortages, and their \nexisting staff may be forced to handle unmanageable workloads. Cases \nmay suffer from lengthy and unnecessary delays, and some cases may be \nmishandled by inexperienced or overworked attorneys. As a result, \ninnocent people may be sent to jail, and criminals may go free.\n  Our bill, the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive \nAct, is designed to help remedy some of these problems. The \navailability of student loan repayment can be a powerful incentive for \nattracting talented new lawyers to public service employment. Our \nproposal complements loan forgiveness options that currently exist for \nFederal prosecutors. Passage of this bill will help make prosecutor and \npublic defender jobs at all levels of government more attractive and \nfinancially viable for law school graduates who have incurred \nsignificant educational debt.\n  Our bill is named after the late John R. Justice, former president of \nthe National District Attorneys Association and a distinguished \nprosecutor from the State of South Carolina. John Justice was \ninstrumental in promoting student loan repayment efforts for law school \ngraduates seeking to work in public service. This bill is a fitting \ntribute to his dedicated efforts.\n  The need for this legislation is evident. In recent years, the costs \nof a law school education have skyrocketed. Researchers found that \ntuition increased about 340 percent from 1985 to 2002 for private law \nschool students and for out-of-State students at public law schools. \nIn-State students at public law schools saw their tuition jump about \n500 percent during that time. In 2005, the average annual tuition was \n$28,900 for private law schools, $22,987 for nonresident students at \npublic law schools, and $13,145 for resident students at public law \nschools. These tuition costs do not include the costs of food, lodging, \nbooks, fees and personal expenses over 3 years of law school.\n  Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of law students--over 80 percent--\nmust borrow funds to finance their legal education. According to the \nAmerican Bar Association, the average total cumulative educational debt \nfor law school graduates in the class of 2005 was $78,763 for private \nschools and $51,056 for public schools. Two-thirds of law students \ngenerally carry additional unpaid debt from their undergraduate \nstudies. These education debts are serious financial obligations that \nmust be repaid, as any default on a loan triggers significant \nconsequences.\n  Many law students graduate with a deep commitment to pursuing a \ncareer in public service. However, they need a level of income \nsufficient to meet the demands of their educational loan liabilities, \nand public service salaries have not kept up with rising law school \ndebt burdens. From 1985 to 2002, while law school tuition increased 340 \npercent for private law school students and 500 percent for in-state \nstudents at public law schools, salaries for public service lawyers \nsuch as prosecutors and public defenders increased by just 70 percent. \nAccording to the National Association for Law Placement, NALP, the \nmedian entry-level salary for public defenders is $43,000. With 11 to \n15 years of experience, the median salary\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\nincreases only to $65,500. The salary progression for State prosecuting \nattorneys is similar, starting at around $46,000 and progressing to \nabout $68,000 for those with 11 to 15 years of experience.\n  Many law school graduates can earn much more and repay their student \nloans much faster by entering the private sector. According to a NALP \nsurvey, in 2005 the median salary for first-year attorneys at law firms \nranged from $67,500 in firms of 2 to 25 attorneys to $135,000 in firms \nof 500 attorneys or more. The median first-year salary for all firms \nparticipating in the survey was $100,000. When choosing between a \nprivate sector job and a job as a prosecutor or defender, talented law \ngraduates with large debt burdens must take into consideration this \nsalary differential.\n  It is clear that large student debt deters many law graduates from \npursuing public service careers. According to a national survey of \n1,622 students from 117 law schools conducted by Equal Justice Works, \nthe Partnership for Public Service, and NALP in 2002, 66 percent of \nrespondents stated that law school debt prevented them from considering \na public interest or government job.\n  Some law graduates initially accept public service jobs despite their \nhigh debt burdens. However, many attorneys cannot repay their loan \nobligations as well as pay all their other living expenses on a \ngovernment salary. Attorneys who begin careers in public service, and \nwho would like to remain, frequently leave after a few years when they \nfind their debts are hindering their ability to provide for themselves, \nmuch less support their families or save for retirement.\n  Many public service employers report having a difficult time \nattracting and retaining talented law graduates. Prosecutor and public \ndefender offices across the country have vacancies they cannot fill \nbecause new law graduates cannot afford to work for them. \nAlternatively, those who do hire law graduates find that, because of \neducational debt burdens, those whom they do hire leave just at the \npoint when they have acquired the experience to provide the most \nvaluable services. According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, \n24 percent of state prosecutors' offices reported problems in 2005 with \nrecruiting new attorneys, and 35 percent reported problems in retaining \nattorneys. Another survey administered by Equal Justice Works and the \nNational Legal Aid & Defender Association in 2002 found that over 60 \npercent of public interest law employers, including state and local \nprosecutor and public defender offices, reported difficulty in attorney \nrecruitment and retention.\n  I recently received a letter from Bernard Murray, President of the \nProsecutors Bar Association and Chief of the Criminal Prosecutions \nBureau for the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in Chicago. He \nwrote: ``[W]e are faced with enormous hurdles in attracting first-rate \ncandidates to pursue a career with the Cook County State's Attorney's \nOffice. We simply cannot afford to pay new assistants a salary high \nenough to offset the enormous debt load that follows them from their \nlaw school graduation.''\n  His letter also stated: ``We are observing an exodus of talent at \nabout the three to five year experience mark in the office when \nassistants are no longer able to postpone life events such as marriage, \nhome ownership, and starting a family. We are losing much of our best \ntalent before they even have a chance to put their skills to use in \nfelony cases.''\n  I also received a copy of a letter from Michael Judge, Chief Defender \nof the Los Angeles County Public Defender Office, the oldest and \nlargest such office in the Nation. His letter states the following \nabout his office's efforts to recruit new lawyers: ``It became \nnecessary to expand the ambit of recruiting from locally to statewide, \nto the western region of the country and now to the entire nation to \nensure the success of our recruiting in the face of the deterrent of \ncrushing student loan debt. . . .  In some sense we are `poaching' in \nthe territory of other defender offices. . . . I have experienced more \n`turndowns' of employment offers in the recent past than during my \nfirst 9 or 10 years as Chief Defender. I attribute that to the `ice \ncold water in the face syndrome' experienced by motivated candidates \nmaking the final net calculations and discovering a defender career can \nbe an adventure in deficit financing.''\n  It harms the public interest when communities face a shortage of \nattorneys who can effectively prosecute cases and provide criminal \ndefendants with their constitutional right to counsel. Sadly, these \nsituations occur all too frequently. We can--and should--do more to \nhelp prosecutor and public defender offices recruit and retain \nattorneys in the face of increasing student debt burdens and higher \nprivate sector salaries.\n  Our legislation would help by establishing, within the Department of \nJustice, a program of student loan repayment for borrowers who agree to \nremain employed for at least three years as State or local criminal \nprosecutors, or as State, local, or Federal public defenders in \ncriminal cases. It would allow eligible attorneys to receive student \nloan debt repayments of up to $10,000 per year, with a maximum \naggregate over time of $60,000. The bill would cover student loans \nmade, insured, or guaranteed under the Higher Education Act of 1965, \nincluding consolidation loans.\n  Under our bill, repayment benefits for public sector attorneys would \nbe made available on a first-come, first-served basis, and would be \nsubject to the availability of appropriations. Priority would be given \nto borrowers who received repayment benefits for the preceding fiscal \nyear and who have completed less than three years of the first required \nservice period. Borrowers could enter into an additional agreement, \nafter the required three-year period, for a successive period of \nservice which may be less than three years. Attorneys who do not \ncomplete their required period of service would be required to repay \nthe government.\n  In addition to covering those who agree to serve in State and local \nprosecutor and defender offices, our bill complements existing loan \nforgiveness programs that are currently available for Federal \nprosecutors by making loan relief available to Federal public defenders \nas well.\n  Our bill is modeled on a loan repayment program that has been created \nfor Federal executive branch employees and that has enjoyed growing \nsuccess. Federal law currently permits Federal executive branch \nagencies to repay their employees' student loans, up to $10,000 in a \nyear, and up to a lifetime maximum of $60,000. In exchange, the \nemployee must agree to remain with the agency for at least three years. \nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), during fiscal \nyear 2005 there were 479 lawyers working in Federal agencies who \nreceived loan repayments under this program, including 242 lawyers for \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and 85 attorneys for the \nDepartment of Justice. According to OPM, Federal agencies across the \nboard say that the program has been of tremendous benefit in recruiting \nand retaining attorneys.\n  As I have worked on behalf of our legislation, I have been moved by \nthe personal stories of attorneys who have been trying to embark on a \ncareer of public service but have been struggling because of student \nloans. One compelling letter I received came from Aisha Cornelius, an \nAssistant State's Attorney in Cook County, Illinois. Her letter said \nthe following: ``I am a full-time prosecutor in Cook County. I wanted \nthis job because I desired to use my law degree for public service. \nAlthough making a lot of money was not my primary goal, I had hoped at \nleast for financial stability. This, however, is difficult to \naccomplish as my student loan payments take up a considerable amount of \nmy income. I have more than $100,000 in student loan debt. I am also a \nsingle mother with a five-year-old daughter in kindergarten. In order \nto work, I have to pay for before- and after-school care for her. . . . \nI depleted my savings while studying for the bar exam last year and I \nessentially live check to check. In order to supplement my income, I \nsell cosmetics and skin care. I am also in the process of applying for \na part-time evening teaching position. I love my job and serving the \ngreater good. The only reason I would ever leave public service is if I \ncould no longer afford to stay. This is much more of a possibility than \nI would like it to be. Loan repayment assistance would help me stay \nlonger in a position\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\nthat allows me to serve the community during the day while giving me \nthe freedom and peace of mind to focus [on] my daughter at night.''\n  I appreciate Ms. Cornelius's willingness to share her story with me. \nBy enacting and funding this legislation, we can take a meaningful step \ntoward alleviating some of the financial burden for attorneys such as \nMs. Cornelius who choose careers as criminal prosecutors and public \ndefenders.\n  I know there are many other law graduates who, like Aisha Cornelius, \nwant to apply their legal training and develop their skills in the \npublic sector, but are deterred by the weight of student loan \nobligations. Passage of the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders \nIncentive Act will help them make their career dreams a reality. I urge \nits swift adoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \ncapitation grants to increase the number of nursing faculty and \nstudents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Education, Expansion, \n     and Development Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) While the Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) \n     helped to increase applications to schools of nursing by 125 \n     percent, schools of nursing have been unable to accommodate \n     the influx of interested students because they have an \n     insufficient number of nurse educators. It is estimated \n     that--\n       (A) in the 2006-2007 school year--\n       (i) 66.6 percent of schools of nursing had from 1 to 18 \n     vacant faculty positions; and\n       (ii) an additional 16.7 percent of schools of nursing \n     needed additional faculty, but lacked the resources needed to \n     add more positions; and\n       (B) 41,683 eligible candidates were denied admission to \n     schools of nursing in 2005, primarily due to an insufficient \n     number of faculty members.\n       (2) A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are \n     choosing careers outside of education. Over the last few \n     years, 22.5 percent of doctoral nursing graduates reported \n     seeking employment outside the education profession.\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\n       (3) In 2006 the average age of nurse faculty at retirement \n     is 63.1 years. With the average age of doctorally-prepared \n     nurse faculty at 54.7 years in 2005, a wave of retirements is \n     expected within the next 10 years.\n       (4) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not \n     producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to \n     meet the projected demand for nurses over the next 10 years. \n     While graduations from master's and doctoral programs in \n     nursing rose by 12.8 percent (or 1,369 graduates) and 13.1 \n     percent (or 56 graduates), respectively, in the 2005-2006 \n     school year, projections still demonstrate a shortage of \n     nurse faculty. Given current trends, there will be at least \n     2,616 unfilled faculty positions in 2012.\n       (5) According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and \n     replacement nurses will be needed by 2012.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to abolish the dealth penalty under Federal law; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Death \nPenalty Abolition Act of 2007. This bill would abolish the death \npenalty at the Federal level. It would put an immediate halt to \nexecutions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence \nfor violations of Federal law.\n  Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme \nCourt, there have been 1,060 executions across the country, including \nthree at the Federal level. During that same time period, 123 people on \ndeath row have been exonerated and released from death row. These \npeople never should have been convicted in the first place.\n  Consider those numbers. One thousand and sixty executions, and one \nhundred and twenty-three exonerations in the modern death penalty era. \nHad those exonerations not taken place, had those 123 people been \nexecuted, those executions would have represented an error rate of \ngreater than 10 percent. That is more than an embarrassing statistic; \nit is a horrifying one, one that should have us all questioning the use \nof capital punishment in this country. In fact, since 1999 when I first \nintroduced this bill, 46 death row inmates have been exonerated \nthroughout the country.\n  In the face of these numbers, the national debate on the death \npenalty has intensified. For the second year in a row, the number of \nexecutions, the number of death sentences imposed, and the size of the \ndeath row population have decreased as a growing number of voices have \njoined to express doubt about the use of capital punishment in America. \nThe voices of those questioning the fairness of the death penalty have \nbeen heard from college campuses and courtrooms and podiums across the \nNation, to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, to the United \nStates Supreme Court. The American public understands that the death \npenalty raises serious and complex issues. The death penalty can no \nlonger be exploited for political purposes. In fact, for the first \ntime, a May 2006 Gallup Poll reported that more Americans prefer a \nsentence of life without parole over the death penalty when given a \nchoice. If anything, the political consensus is that it is time for a \nchange. We must not ignore these voices.\n  In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in 1976 to allow capital \npunishment, the Federal Government first resumed death penalty \nprosecutions after enactment of a 1988 Federal law that provided for \nthe death penalty for murder in the course of a drug-kingpin \nconspiracy. The Federal death penalty was then expanded significantly \nin 1994, when the omnibus crime bill expanded its use to a total of \nsome 60 Federal offenses. And despite my best efforts to halt the \nexpansion of the Federal death penalty, more and more provisions seem \nto be added every year. While the use of and confidence in the death \npenalty is decreasing overall, the Federal Government has been going in \nthe opposite direction, making more defendants eligible for capital \npunishment and increasing the size of its Federal death row. Moreover, \nthere are now six individuals on Federal death row from States that do \nnot have capital punishment. The Federal Government is pulling in the \nwrong direction as the rest of the Nation moves toward a more just \nsystem.\n  On this very day eight years ago, Governor George Ryan took the \nhistoric step of placing a moratorium on executions in Illinois and \ncreating an independent, blue ribbon commission to review the State's \ndeath penalty system. The Commission conducted an extensive study of \nthe death penalty in Illinois and released a report with 85 \nrecommendations for reform of the death penalty system. The Commission \nconcluded that the death penalty system is not fair, and that the risk \nof executing the innocent is alarmingly real. Governor Ryan later \npardoned four death row inmates and commuted the sentences of all \nremaining Illinois death row inmates to life in prison before he left \noffice in January 2003.\n  Illinois is not alone. Seven years ago, then Maryland Governor Parris \nGlendening learned of suspected racial disparities in the \nadministration of the death penalty in Maryland. Governor Glendening \ndid not look the other way. He commissioned the University of Maryland \nto conduct the most exhaustive study of Maryland's application of the \ndeath penalty in history. Then faced with the rapid approach of a \nscheduled execution, Governor Glendening acknowledged that it was \nunacceptable to allow executions to take place while the study he had \nordered was not yet complete. So, in May 2002, he placed a moratorium \non executions. Although Governor Bob Ehrlich lifted that moratorium and \nallowed executions to resume during his tenure, Governor Martin \nO'Malley has indicated that he would approve a legislative repeal of \nthe death penalty and that he, like the majority in this country, \nfavors life without parole.\n  Other States also have taken important steps. New York's death \npenalty was overturned by a court decision in 2004 and has not been \nreinstated by the legislature, and New Jersey enacted a moratorium in \n2006. Along with New York and New Jersey, four other States that still \nhave the death penalty technically on their books have not executed any \nindividuals since 1976. In addition, there are 12 States, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, whose laws do not provide for capital punishment \nat all. And following in the footsteps of Illinois and Maryland, North \nCarolina and California both began legislative studies of their own \ncapital punishment systems this past year.\n  The more we learn about the death penalty through studies like those, \nthe more reasons we have to oppose it. For example, the Maryland \nstudy--released in January 2003--contained findings that should startle \nus all. The study found that blacks accused of killing whites are more \nlikely to receive a death sentence than blacks who kill blacks, or than \nwhite killers. According to the report, black offenders who kill whites \nare four times as likely to be sentenced to death as blacks who kill \nblacks, and twice as likely to get a death sentence as whites who kill \nwhites.\n  The Maryland and Illinois studies cannot be brushed aside as atypical \nor dismissed as revealing state-specific anomalies in an otherwise \nperfect system. Years of study have shown that the death penalty does \nlittle to deter crime, and that defendants' likelihood of being \nsentenced to death depends heavily on illegitimate factors such as \nwhether they are rich or poor. Since reinstatement of the modern death \npenalty, 80 percent of murder victims in cases where death sentences \nwere handed down were white, even though only 50 percent of murder \nvictims are white. Nationwide, more than half of the death row inmates \nare African Americans or Hispanic Americans. There is evidence of \nracial disparities, inadequate counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and \nfalse scientific evidence in death penalty systems across the country.\n  At least Maryland, Illinois, North Carolina, and California have \nbegun the process of investigating the flaws in their own systems. But \nthere are 36 other States that have death penalty provisions in their \nlaws, 36 other States with systems that are most likely plagued with \nthe same flaws. And these systems come at great additional cost to the \ntaxpayers. For example, a 2005 report found that California's death \npenalty system costs taxpayers $114 million in additional costs each \nyear. Similar reports detailing the extraordinary financial costs of \nthe death penalty have been generated for States across the Nation.\n  Moreover, there are growing concerns about the most common method of \nexecution, lethal injection. These concerns are so grave that eight \nStates and the Federal system all halted individual executions in 2006 \nto work through these problems. And these numbers are growing. Just \nthis last week, executions in North Carolina were halted because of \nchallenges to lethal injection. More and more research is emerging that \nsuggests that lethal injections are unnecessarily painful and cruel, \nand that this method of capital punishment--however sanitary or humane \nit may appear--is no less barbaric than the more antiquated methods \nlethal injection was designed to replace, such as the noose or the \nfiring squad, no less horrific than the electric chair or the gas \nchamber.\n  Nothing is more barbaric, of course, than the execution of an \ninnocent person, and it is clearer than ever that the\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nrisk is very real. Already, information has surfaced that suggests that \ntwo men put to death in the 1990s may have been innocent. This is a \nchilling prospect, one that illustrates the very grave danger in \nimposing the death penalty. The loss of just one innocent life through \ncapital punishment should be enough to force all of us to stop and \nreconsider this penalty.\n  And while we examine the flaws in our death penalty system, we cannot \nhelp but note that our use of the death penalty stands in stark \ncontrast to the majority of nations, which have abolished the death \npenalty in law or practice. There are now 123 countries that have done \nso. In 2005, only China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia executed more people \nthan we did. These countries, and others on the list of nations that \nactively use capital punishment, are countries that we often criticize \nfor human rights abuses. The European Union denies membership in the \nalliance to those nations that use the death penalty. In fact, it \npassed a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional global \nabolition of the death penalty, and it specifically called on all \nStates within the United States to abolish the death penalty. This is \nsignificant because it reflects the unanimous view of a group of \nnations with which the United States enjoys close relationships and \nshares common values. We should join with them and with the over 100 \nother nations that have renounced this practice.\n  We are a Nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of \njustice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a Nation that \nscrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. Historically, we \nare one of the first Nations to speak out against torture and killings \nby foreign governments. We should hold our own system of justice to the \nhighest standard.\n  As a matter of justice, this is an issue that transcends political \nallegiances. A range of prominent voices in our country are raising \nserious questions about the death penalty, and they are not just voices \nof liberals, or of the faith community. They are the voices of former \nFBI Director William Sessions, former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nReverend Pat Robertson, George Will, former Mississippi warden Donald \nCabana, the Republican former Governor of Illinois, George Ryan, and \nthe Democratic former Governor of Maryland, Parris Glendening. The \nvoices of those questioning our application of the death penalty are \ngrowing in number, they are growing louder, and they are reflected in \nsome of the decisions of the highest court of the land. In recent \nyears, the Supreme Court has held that the execution of juvenile \noffenders and the mentally retarded is unconstitutional.\n  As we begin a new year and a new Congress, I believe the continued \nuse of the death penalty in the United States is beneath us. The death \npenalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is \nimmoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' applies here in \nthe most fundamental way. Our Nation has long ago done away with other \nbarbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of \ncriminals. Just we did away with these punishments as contrary to our \nhumanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death penalty as we seek \nto spread peace and justice both here and overseas. It is not just a \nmatter of morality. The continued viability of our criminal justice \nsystem as a truly just system that deserves the respect of our own \npeople and the world requires that we do so. Our Nation's goal to \nremain the world's leading defender of freedom, liberty and equality \ndemands that we do so.\n  Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take \npatience, persistence, and courage. As we work to move forward in a \nrapidly changing world, let us leave this archaic practice behind.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great Nation. I also call on each State that \nauthorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us \ntogether reject violence and restore fairness and integrity to our \ncriminal justice system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide both \nState and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers \nduring internal investigations, interrogation of law enforcement \nofficers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, to ensure \naccountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due \nprocess rights of law enforcement officers, and to require States to \nenact law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due process laws; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State and Local Law \nEnforcement Discipline Accountability, and Due Process Act of 2007.\n  These are trying times for the men and women on our front lines who \nprovide our domestic security and public safety--our Nation's law \nenforcement personnel. Indeed, they face one of the most difficult work \nenvironments imaginable--an average of 165 police officers are killed \nin the line of duty every year. Our Nation's law enforcement officers \nput themselves in harms way on a daily basis to ensure the safety of \ntheir fellow citizens and the domestic security of our Nation. \nNevertheless, many times these brave officers do not receive basic \nrights if they become involved in internal police investigations or \nadministrative hearings. According to the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, ``[i]n roughly half of the states in this \ncountry, officers enjoy some legal protections against false \naccusations and abusive conduct, but hundreds of thousands of officers \nhave very limited due\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\nprocess rights and confront limitations on their exercise of other \nrights, such as the right to engage in political activities.'' \nSimilarly, the Fraternal Order of Police notes that, ``[i]n a startling \nnumber of jurisdictions throughout this country, law enforcement \nofficers have no procedural or administrative protections whatsoever; \nin fact, they can be, and frequently are, summarily dismissed from \ntheir jobs without explanation. Officers who lose their careers due to \nadministrative or political expediency almost always find it impossible \nto find new employment in public safety. An officer's reputation, once \ntarnished by accusation, is almost impossible to restore.''\n  The legislation being introduced today, which is endorsed by the \nFraternal Order of Police and of the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, seeks to provide officers with certain basic protections \nin those jurisdictions where such workplace protections are not \ncurrently provided. First, this bill allows law enforcement officials \nto engage in political activities when they are off-duty. Second, it \nprovides standards and procedures to guide State and local law \nenforcement agencies during internal investigations, interrogations, \nand administrative disciplinary hearings. Additionally, it calls upon \nStates to develop and enforce these disciplinary procedures. The bill \nwould preempt State laws which confer fewer rights than those provided \nfor in the legislation, but it would not preempt any State or local \nlaws that confer rights or protections that are equal to or exceed the \nrights and protections afforded in the bill. For example, my own State \nof Delaware has a law enforcement officers' bill of rights, and those \nprocedures would not be impacted by the provisions of this bill.\n  This bill will also include important provisions that will enhance \nthe ability of citizens to hold their local police departments \naccountable. The legislation includes provisions that will ensure \ncitizen complaints against police officers are investigated and that \ncitizens are informed of the outcome of these investigations. The bill \nbalances the rights of police officers with the rights of citizens to \nraise valid concerns about the conduct of some of these officers. In \naddition, I have consulted with constitutional experts who have opined \nthat the bill is consistent with Congress' powers under the Commerce \nClause and that it does not run afoul of the Supreme Court's Tenth \nAmendment jurisprudence.\n  I would also like to note that I understand the objections that many \nmanagement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice's, have to this measure. I have discussed this with them, and \nI've pledged that their views will be heard and considered as this bill \nis debated in Congress. It is my view that we must bridge this gap. \nWithout a meeting of the minds between police management and union \nofficials, the enactment of a meaningful law enforcement officers' bill \nof rights will be difficult. Law enforcement officials are facing \nunprecedented challenges, and management and labor simply must work \ntogether on this issue and the numerous other issues facing the law \nenforcement community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local Law \n     Enforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the rights of law enforcement officers to engage in \n     political activity or to refrain from engaging in political \n     activity, except when on duty, or to run as candidates for \n     public office, unless such service is found to be in conflict \n     with their service as officers, are activities protected by \n     the first amendment of the United States Constitution, as \n     applied to the States through the 14th amendment of the \n     United States Constitution, but these rights are often \n     violated by the management of State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (2) a significant lack of due process rights of law \n     enforcement officers during internal investigations and \n     disciplinary proceedings has resulted in a loss of confidence \n     in these processes by many law enforcement officers, \n     including those unfairly targeted for their labor \n     organization activities or for their aggressive enforcement \n     of the laws, demoralizing many rank and file officers in \n     communities and States;\n       (3) unfair treatment of officers has potentially serious \n     long-term consequences for law enforcement by potentially \n     deterring or otherwise preventing officers from carrying out \n     their duties and responsibilities effectively and fairly;\n       (4) the lack of labor-management cooperation in \n     disciplinary matters and either the perception or the \n     actuality that officers are not treated fairly detrimentally \n     impacts the recruitment of and retention of effective \n     officers, as potential officers and experienced officers seek \n     other careers, which has serious implications and \n     repercussions for officer morale, public safety, and labor-\n     management relations and strife and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce, interfering with the normal flow of \n     commerce;\n       (5) there are serious implications for the public safety of \n     the citizens and residents of the United States which \n     threatens the domestic tranquility of the United States \n     because of a lack of statutory protections to ensure--\n       (A) the due process and political rights of law enforcement \n     officers;\n       (B) fair and thorough internal investigations and \n     interrogations of and disciplinary proceedings against law \n     enforcement officers; and\n       (C) effective procedures for receipt, review, and \n     investigation of complaints against officers, fair to both \n     officers and complainants; and\n       (6) resolving these disputes and problems and preventing \n     the disruption of vital police services is essential to the \n     well-being of the United States and the domestic tranquility \n     of the Nation.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is \n     the purpose of this Act and the policy of the United States \n     to--\n       (1) protect the due process and political rights of State \n     and local law enforcement officers and ensure equality and \n     fairness of treatment among such officers;\n       (2) provide continued police protection to the general \n     public;\n       (3) provide for the general welfare and ensure domestic \n     tranquility; and\n       (4) prevent any impediments to the free flow of commerce, \n     under the rights guaranteed under the United States \n     Constitution and Congress' authority thereunder.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a National Foreign language Coordination \nCouncil; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the National \nForeign Language Coordination Act with my colleagues Senators Thad \nCochran, Christopher Dodd, and Russell Feingold. We are joined by\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nRepresentative Brian Baird, who is offering a companion bill in the \nHouse of Representatives today as well.\n  The legislation we introduce today would implement a key \nrecommendation of the 2004 Department of Defense, DOD, National \nLanguage Conference to establish a National Foreign Language \nCoordination Council, chaired by a National Language Director. An \nintegrated foreign language strategy and sustained leadership within \nthe Federal Government is needed to address the lack of foreign \nlanguage proficient speakers in government and in business. Without \nsuch a coordinated strategy, I fear that the country's national and \neconomic security will be at greater risk.\n  The communications failures of 9/11 clearly demonstrate that we can \nno longer ignore the consequence of our citizens being unable to \nconverse fluently in languages other than English. The fact that only \n9.3 percent of all Americans speak both their native languages and \nanother language fluently, compared with 56 percent of people in the \nEuropean Union is troubling. The Iraq Study Group reported last month \nthat of the 1,000 American embassy employees in Baghdad, only 33 speak \nArabic, and just 6 of them are fluent in this critical language. The \nshortfall of skilled linguists prompted the Iraq Study Group to \nrecommend that ``The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and \nthe Director of National Intelligence should accord the highest \npossible priority to professional language proficiency and cultural \ntraining, in general and specifically for U.S. officers and personnel \nabout to be assigned to Iraq.''\n  The Federal Government has an essential role to play by collaborating \nwith educators, State and local governments, foreign language \nassociations, and the private sector to increase the number of \nAmericans who speak and understand foreign languages. A National \nForeign Language Coordination Council brings these diverse interests \ntogether to shape a much needed, comprehensive approach. Just as I have \nadvocated the need for deputy secretaries for management at the \nDepartments of Defense and Homeland Security to direct and sustain \nmanagement leadership, I envision a National Language Director to be \nresponsible for maintaining and leading a cooperative effort to \nstrengthen our foreign language capabilities.\n  Our Nation's security is at risk without a sufficient number of \nforeign language proficient individuals. Counterterrorism intelligence \nwill go untranslated and opportunities will be missed. Equally \nimportant is preserving the economic competitiveness of the United \nStates. Globalization means that Americans must compete for jobs in a \nmarketplace no longer confined to the boundaries of the United States. \nIn short, both the security and economic vitality of the United States \nare tied to improving foreign language education. However, according to \nthe Committee on Economic Development, many of our schools do not have \nforeign language programs that address the educational challenges of \nthe 21st century. Many American students lack sufficient knowledge of \nother countries, languages, and cultures to compete effectively in the \nglobal marketplace.\n\n  Specifically, our bill ensures that the key recommendations of the \nDOD National Language Conference will be implemented by: Developing \npolicies and programs that build the Nation's language and cultural \nunderstanding capability; engaging Federal, State, and local agencies \nand the private sector in solutions; developing language and cultural \ncompetency across public and private sectors; developing language \nskills in a wide range of critical languages; strengthening our \neducation system, programs, and tools in foreign languages and \ncultures; and integrating language training into career fields and \nincrease the number of language professionals.\n  Last week, the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \nthe Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, which I chair, \nheld a hearing on the Federal Government's language strategy. Dr. Diane \nBirckbich1er, director of the Foreign Language Center and chair of the \nDepartments of French and Italian at Ohio State University, testified \nthat ``if there is a national language strategy, it isn't very well \nknown.'' She further recommended the development of a national language \npolicy to create a language-ready workforce for the future.\n  To strengthen the role of the United States in the world, our country \nmust ensure that there is a sufficient number of individuals who are \nproficient in languages other than their native languages. Increasing \nforeign language skills enhances national security, just as increasing \nforeign language skills enhances the ability of Americans to compete on \na more global playing field.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 451\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today that \nseeks to address the all-too-common efforts to deceive voters in order \nto keep them away from the polls.\n  It's hard to imagine that we even need a bill like this. But, \nunfortunately, there are people who will stop at nothing to try to \ndeceive voters and keep them away from the polls. What's worse, these \npractices often target and exploit vulnerable populations, such as \nminorities, the disabled, or the poor.\n  We saw countless examples in this past election. Some of us remember \nthe thousands of Latino voters in Orange County, California, who \nreceived letters warning them in Spanish that, ``if you are an \nimmigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that can result in \nincarceration.''\n  Or the voters in Maryland who received a ``democratic sample ballot'' \nfeaturing a Republican candidate for Governor and a Republican \ncandidate for U.S. Senator.\n  Or the voters in Virginia who received calls from a so-called \n``Virginia Elections Commission'' informing them--falsely--that they \nwere ineligible to vote.\n  Or the voters who were told that they couldn't vote if they had \nfamily members who had been convicted of a crime.\n  Of course, these so-called warnings have no basis in fact, and are \nmade with only one goal in mind--to keep Americans away from the polls. \nWe see these problems year after year and election and after election, \nand my hope is that this bill will finally stop these practices in time \nfor the next election.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Deceptive Practices and Voter \nIntimidation Prevention Act. It's a bill that makes voter intimidation \nand deception punishable by law, and it contains strong penalties so \nthat people who commit these crimes suffer more than just a slap on the \nwrist. The bill also seeks to address the real harm of these crimes--\npeople who are prevented from voting by misinformation--by establishing \na process for reaching out to these misinformed voters with accurate \ninformation so they can cast their votes in time.\n  Senator Schumer has joined me in introducing this legislation, and we \nare joined by our colleagues, Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and Senators Cardin, Feingold, Kerry, Feinstein \nand Clinton as original co-sponsors to this bill.\n  There are some issues in this country that are inherently difficult \nand political. Making sure that every American can cast a ballot \nshouldn't be one of them. There is no place for politics in this \ndebate--no room for those who feel that they can gain a partisan \nadvantage by keeping people away from the polls. It's time to get this \ndone in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe this bill can make it \nhappen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times editorial from January \n31, 2007, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 31, 2007]\n\n                          Honesty in Elections\n\n       On Election Day last fall in Maryland, fliers were handed \n     out in black neighborhoods with the heading ``Democratic \n     Sample Ballot'' and photos of black Democratic leaders--and \n     boxes checked off beside the names of the Republican \n     candidates for senator and governor. They were a blatant \n     attempt to fool black voters into thinking the Republican \n     candidates were endorsed by black Democrats. In Orange \n     County, Calif., 14,000 Latino voters got letters in Spanish \n     saying it was a crime for immigrants to vote in a federal \n     election. It didn't say that immigrants who are citizens have \n     the right to vote.\n       Dirty tricks like these turn up every election season, in \n     large part because they are so rarely punished. But two \n     Democratic senators, Barack Obama of Illinois and Charles \n     Schumer of New York, are introducing a bill today that would \n     make deceiving or intimidating voters a federal crime with \n     substantial penalties.\n       The bill aims at some of the most commonly used deceptive \n     political tactics. It makes it a crime to knowingly tell \n     voters the wrong day for an election. There have been \n     numerous reports of organized efforts to use telephones, \n     leaflets or posters to tell voters, especially in minority \n     areas, not to vote on Election Day because voting has been \n     postponed.\n       The bill would also criminalize making false claims to \n     voters about who has endorsed a candidate, or wrongly telling \n     people--like immigrants who are registered voters in Orange \n     County--that they cannot vote.\n       Along with defining these crimes and providing penalties of \n     up to five years' imprisonment, the bill would require the \n     Justice Department to counteract deceptive election \n     information that has been put out, and to report to Congress \n     after each election on what deceptive practices occurred and \n     what the Justice Department did about them.\n       The bill would also allow individuals to go to court to \n     stop deceptive practices while they are happening. That is \n     important, given how uninterested the current Justice \n     Department has proved to be in cracking down on election \n     season dirty tricks.\n       The bill is careful to avoid infringing on First Amendment \n     rights, and that is the right course. But in steering clear \n     of regulating speech, it is not clear how effective the \n     measure would be in addressing one of the worst dirty tricks \n     of last fall's election: a particular kind of deceptive \n     ``robocall'' that was used against Democratic Congressional \n     candidates. These calls, paid for by the Republicans, sounded \n     as if they had come from the Democrat; when a recipient hung \n     up, the call was repeated over and over. The intent was \n     clearly to annoy the recipients so they would not vote for \n     the Democrat.\n       While there are already laws that can be used against this \n     sort of deceptive telephone harassment, a more specific bill \n     aimed directly at these calls is needed. But the bill being \n     introduced today is an important step toward making elections \n     more honest and fair. There is no reason it should not be \n     passed by Congress unanimously.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Obama \nin introducing landmark legislation to protect the most sacred right of \nour democracy: the right to vote. The Obama-Schumer Deceptive Practices \nand Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 will end the deceptive \npractices that have become far too common in recent elections.\n  At the outset, I want to commend my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nObama, for his leadership on this important issue. It has been a great \npleasure to work with him to draft this bill. I am also proud that we \nare joined by Senators Leahy, Cardin, Feingold, Kerry, Feinstein, and \nClinton as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  We all know that there is an urgent need for this legislation. The \nright to vote is the wellspring of our democracy. Yet Americans have \nbeen profoundly shocked and disgusted in recent elections to see so \nmany cynical attempts to lie to voters in order to keep them from \ncasting their ballots.\n  Let me give just a few examples. In last year's mid-term election, \nletters in Spanish were sent to voters in Orange County, CA, stating \nthat it is a crime for an immigrant to vote. In fact, immigrants who \nare naturalized citizens have the right to vote just as any other \nAmerican citizen does.\n  In 2006, as well, fliers were handed out on election day in Maryland \nthat gave the impression that top Republican candidates for office were \nDemocratic candidates and were endorsed by prominent African Americans. \nThese fliers were a clear and deliberate attempt to mislead voters.\n  In Virginia, registered voters received recorded calls that falsely \nstated that the recipient of the call was registered in another State \nand would face criminal charges if they came to the polls.\n  These dirty tricks are not new. In 2002, fliers were distributed in \npublic housing complexes in Louisiana, telling people that they could \ncast their votes 3 days after election day if the weather was bad.\n  These schemes insult the intelligence of those they target, and they \ninsult our democracy. Yet they actually seem to be growing more common. \nThe shameful reality is that today, Federal law does not prohibit \nwrongdoers from spreading these lies.\n  It is high time for Congress to do something about this disgraceful \nstate of affairs. The Obama-Schumer bill creates a new offense of voter \ndeception. Under our legislation, anyone who intentionally lies to \nvoters about certain key information will now face both civil penalties \nand criminal punishment of up to 5 years in prison or a $100,000 fine.\n  The Obama-Schumer bill covers the facts that are most critical for \nreaching the polls--facts like where, when,\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nand how you can vote; whether you are eligible to vote; or whether an \norganization has actually endorsed a candidate. When voters are being \nmisled about these core facts, the right to vote is nothing more than a \nhollow promise. It is a real threat to the right to vote when criminal \nelements are deliberately lying about something as basic--yet as \nimportant--as the date of the election. These types of lies are the \npoll taxes of today. They are being used to build a barrier around \npolling places and to disenfranchise voters in the most cynical and \ndestructive way.\n  Even when misinformation campaigns are not successful, because voters \nare too smart and too determined to reach the polls, these deceptive \npractices make a mockery out of the great tradition of American \ndemocracy. These despicable attempts have gone unpunished for far too \nlong. The Obama-Schumer bill provides strong penalties to deter and \npunish the offense of voter deception.\n  The Obama-Schumer bill will also increase the maximum penalty for \nvoter intimidation from 1 year to 5 years in prison. Someone who tries \nto keep voters away from the polls with threats should not be released \nwith a slap on the wrist, and our bill will create real penalties for \nthis crime.\n  Finally, our legislation also ensures that lies do not go unanswered \nand pass for truth. Under the Obama-Schumer bill, the Department of \nJustice will be responsible for getting the correct information out to \nvoters so that they can get to the polls and cast their vote without \nundue confusion.\n  As a check on whether elections are being tainted by these practices, \nafter each election, the Attorney General will have to report to \nCongress about allegations of voter deception and how they were \nhandled. We want to make sure that the Department of Justice uses the \nnew tools that would be provided under this bill. The Attorney \nGeneral's reports will give us a foundation for vigorous oversight.\n  Let me also be clear about what this legislation does not do. Senator \nObama and I have taken great care to craft a bill that will not run \nafoul of the first amendment or prevent Americans from expressing their \npolitical opinions. Our bill strikes a balance between the need for \npolitical debate and the fundamental right to vote. It is narrowly \ntailored: it applies only to activities within 60 days prior to an \nelection, and it covers only the key facts that voters need to reach \nthe polls and cast their votes without interference. This bill will not \nlimit legitimate debate, and it will not punish honest mistakes. It is \nclear from the dirty tricks that America has witnessed in recent \nelections that the Congress has a compelling interest in protecting the \nright to vote by regulating false speech that disenfranchises voters. \nWe have a responsibility to act on that interest for the sake of all \nAmericans.\n  The Obama-Schumer Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation \nPrevention Act of 2007 will finally criminalize efforts to keep voters \naway from the polls with deliberate lies. I hope and trust that the \nCongress will take up our bill and pass it without delay.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I join Senators Obama, Schumer, \nCardin, Feinstein, Feingold, Clinton, and Kerry to introduce the \nDeceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007, a \nmeasure that would create new protections and expand existing \nprotections against the use of deceptive practices in elections.\n  There are few things as critical to the fabric of our Nation, and to \nAmerican citizenship, as voting. The right to vote and to have your \nvote count is a foundational right, like our first amendment rights, \nbecause it secures the effectiveness of other protections. The \nlegitimacy of our government is dependent on the access all Americans \nhave to the political process.\n  We saw last year in nearly 20 hearings in the House and Senate on the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act that there is a continuing \nneed for the vital voting rights protections that landmark civil rights \nlaw provides for all Americans. But our need to protect the effective \naccess of voters to the political process does not stop with those \nvital protections against discrimination. I am concerned about \nincreasing efforts on behalf of some candidates and political parties \nto interfere with recent elections and undermine the participation of \nmany voters. So today we take another step toward protecting the \nexercise of the effective exercise of voting rights by ensuring that \nthe access to vote is not undermined by those who would take away that \naccess through deceit and false information.\n  The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 \nwould provide additional tools and criminal penalties to help combat \nthe kinds of practices used during the 2006 midterms in places like \nMaryland and Virginia. In Maryland, Republican leaders admitted to \ndistributing misleading flyers in African-American communities on \nelection day suggesting that prominent African-American Democrats \nsupported Republican candidates. In Virginia, the FBI has investigated \ncalls received by many voters in heavily Democratic precincts directing \nthem to the wrong polling sites, giving incorrect information about \ntheir eligibility to vote, or encouraging them not to vote on election \nday. I supported a similar bill, S. 1975, in the last Congress, and I \nhope that we can move forward in this Congress.\n  Regrettably, the problems leading up to and on election day last year \nwere not limited to a few isolated incidents. In the ninth precinct in \nTucson, AZ, an area with a heavy percentage of Latino voters, it has \nbeen reported that three vigilantes armed with a clipboard, a video \ncamera, and a visible firearm stopped only Latino voters as they \nentered and exited the polls on election day, issuing implied and overt \nthreats. In Orange County, CA, Republican congressional candidate Tan \nNguyen admitted that his campaign staffer sent letters to 73,000 \nhouseholds, spreading misinformation about voting requirements \napparently designed to suppress Latino voter turnout.\n  In letters to the Attorney General and other officials at the Justice \nDepartment and in oversight hearings last November and 2 weeks ago, we \nhave asked the Justice Department for more information about what it \nhas been doing to investigate and combat these practices. In the \ninformation we have obtained so far, it is apparent that the Justice \nDepartment has not done enough and additional tools are needed.\n  The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 \nwould expand the conduct currently prohibited by law to include the \ndissemination of false information within 60 days of an election about \nthe time, place, and manner of the election, the qualifications for \nvoter eligibility, or the sponsor of public communications about an \nelection. In addition, it would provide new means of enforcing these \nprohibitions and combating such dissemination: it creates a private \nright of action for persons aggrieved by the dissemination of such \nfalse information; it provides criminal penalties for such false \ndissemination of up to 5 years and $100,000; and it provides that any \nperson may report such false dissemination to the Attorney General, and \nif it is determined that such information is false or deliberately \nmisleading, the Justice Department would be required to take action to \nprovide corrective information. In addition, this bill provides an \nadditional tool for effective oversight by requiring the Attorney \nGeneral to report to Congress on allegations of the dissemination of \nfalse information within 90 days of an election.\n  By passing this bill and enacting it into law, we can continue our \nmarch towards a more inclusive democracy for all Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Obama \nand our other colleagues in sponsoring the Deceptive Practices and \nVoter Intimidation Prevention Act, because it addresses an essential \naspect of voting rights. For too long, we've ignored the festering \nproblem of deceptive practices intended to intimidate and deceive \nvoters in our national elections and suppress the vote of certain \nminority groups for partisan gain. The problem is a continuing threat \nto our democracy, and it's up to our new Congress to outlaw such \npractices, and I commend the Senator from Illinois for his leadership \non this basic challenge.\n  In doing so, we must be vigilant to ensure that the bill does not \nerode the important division of responsibility in the Department of \nJustice between civil rights enforcement by the Civil Rights Division \nand the efforts by the Criminal Division to combat voter fraud. That \ndivision of responsibility is essential to convincing voters, \nparticularly those in poor or minority communities to have the trust \nnecessary to work with the Civil Rights Division and to inform it of \npossible civil rights violations. The bill should clearly provide that, \nas traditionally has been the case, the Voting Section of the Civil \nRights Division may not investigate matters of voter fraud, although it\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nmay provide technical advice and assistance to other parts of the \nDepartment in carrying out the requirements of this legislation.\n  We also need to guarantee that additional resources are appropriated \nto carry out the bill's requirements, so that resources will not be \ndiverted from other important law enforcement activities of the \nDepartment.\n  In addition, we must ensure that the bill's civil and criminal \nprovisions are not misused to erode voter participation even further, \nparticularly among poor and minority voters by wrongly targeting voter \nregistration activities or chilling legitimate get-out-the-vote efforts \nby organizations serving the public interest.\n  I look forward very much to working with my colleagues to deal with \nthese specific issues, and to enact this important new measure as part \nof our fundamental responsibility to protect the most basic right in \nour democracy, the right to vote.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 454. A bill to provide an increase in funding for Federal Pell \nGrants, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in order to expand \nthe deduction for interest paid on student loans, raise the \ncontribution limits for Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, and make \nthe exclusion for employer provided educational assistance permanent, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Improving \nAccess to Higher Education Act. This legislation would provide an \nincrease in the maximum Pell grant award to $5,100, as well as \nadditional benefits to help make higher education more accessible and \naffordable.\n  Our system of higher education is, in many ways, the envy of the \nworld, but its benefits have not been equally available. Unfortunately, \nfamily income still largely determines whether students will pursue \nhigher education. Students from families with incomes above $75,000 are \nmore than twice as likely to attend college as students from families \nwith incomes of less than $25,000.\n  To help remedy these inequities, the Federal Government has committed \nitself to a need-based system of student financial aid designed to help \nremove the economic barriers to higher education. Central to this \neffort over the past 30 years has been the Pell grant program.\n  The Pell Grant Program is the largest source of Federal grant aid and \nthe cornerstone of our Federal need-based aid system. In 2006, the Pell \nprogram provided approximately $13 billion in grant aid to more than \n5.3 million students. Students with the greatest need receive the \nmaximum Pell award, which is currently set at $4,050. And Pell grants \nare truly targeted to the neediest of students--Pell recipients have a \nmedian family income of only $15,200.\n  Because of the central role of the Pell Grant Program, I am deeply \nconcerned by the significant erosion in the purchasing power of the \nPell grant that has occurred in recent years. In 1975, the maximum Pell \ngrant represented approximately 80 percent of the costs of attending a \npublic, 4-year institution. Today, it covers only 33 percent of these \ncosts.\n  When lower levels of grant aid are available, students are forced to \nmake up the difference by taking on larger and larger amounts of debt \nto finance their education. Earlier this month, I met with two students \nfrom the University of Southern Maine who told me that students \ngraduating from 4-year institutions in Maine leave with an average debt \nof $20,239. As startling as this figure may be, it underestimates the \ntrue indebtedness of students, since it does not take into account \ncredit card debt or private loans that students use to help finance \ntheir education.\n  The decline in the value of grant aid and the growing reliance on \nloans have particularly negative consequences for low-income students. \nIn fact, the staggering amount of debt required to finance higher \neducation may force some low-income students to abandon their plans to \nattend college altogether.\n  As explained in a recent report by the Educational Policy Institute, \n``Grants for Students: What they do, Why they work,'' people from \nlower-income backgrounds often place a higher value on having money to \nmeet pressing current needs, and accordingly, are less likely to make \ninvestments where the financial return comes only in the long term. \nAccording to the report, ``[L]ong term poverty encourages short-term \nthinking and those who experience it tend to identify very strongly \nwith the expression `one in the hand is worth two in the bush.' '' This \nis just one reason why the availability of loans does not solve the \ncollege access problem for low-income students, and why grant aid is so \ncrucial.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation that will raise the \nmaximum Pell grant award to $5,100, an increase of more tha $1,000 in a \nsingle year. While I recognize that this represents a significant \nincrease in a single year, this increase is long overdue. The maximum \ngrant award has been essentially level-funded since Fiscal Year 2002. \nIf we do not act soon Fiscal Year 2007 will become the fifth year in a \nrow that the Pell maximum award has been level-funded.\n\n  By raising the maximum award to $5,100, my home state of Maine will \nreceive approximately $60 million in Pell grant funding, an increase of \nover $15 million from current levels. This level of funding would \nprovide Pell grants to more than 20,000 Maine students.\n  I recently met with Andrew Bossie, a first-generation college student \nfrom my hometown of Caribou, about the importance of Pell grants. \nAndrew is currently a student at the University of Southern Maine and \nwill graduate this spring, in large part, because of the help of Pell \ngrants. As Andrew told me, ``Without Pell grants, there is no doubt \nthat I would not have been able to attend college. Although the current \nPell grant award is a huge help, I still feel the stress of sometimes \nhaving to decide between a badly-needed new pair of shoes and making my \ntuition payments.'' Andrew is thriving academically--he is on the \nDean's list--and he is also the student body president and is active as \na community volunteer.\n  Increasing the maximum Pell award by $1,050 is going to make a real \ndifference for Andrew and other students in their ability to pursue \ntheir college dreams. While I recognize that an increase to $5,100 in a \nsingle year is an ambitious goal, it is a worthy one for a nation that \nunderstands the opportunities that a college education brings.\n  My legislation also amends the Higher Education Act to raise the \nminimum Pell award to $500, up from the current minimum of $400. The \nminimum award level has not been increased in over 10 years. I believe \nwe should ensure that every student who qualifies for a Pell receives \nat least $500.\n  In addition to our efforts on behalf of Pell grants, there are other \nimportant steps we can take to put higher education in the reach of \nmore families. Ten years ago, in my first year as a Senator, I \nintroduced S. 930, the ``College Affordability and Access Act,'' which \ncontained three provisions designed to expand access to higher \neducation, and reduce its cost. These three provisions were enacted \ninto law, in amended form, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The proposal I am submitting today builds upon each of those three \nprovisions. First, in recognition of the increased cost of higher \neducation, my proposal calls for an increase in the tax deduction \navailable for interest paid on higher education loans. Second, my \nproposal calls for a similar increase in the contribution limit for \ntax-free Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. Third, the bill would \nmake permanent the current tax-free treatment of employer-provided \neducational assistance programs.\n  The value of the tax relief we provided 10 years ago has not kept \npace with the rising cost of higher education. According to data from \nthe College Board, 4-year private colleges now charge $30,000 per year \nfor tuition, fees, room, and board. Even after taking inflation into \naccount, this represents an increase of more than $6,000 since the \n1996-1997 school year. Perhaps even more troubling, the College Board \nreports that the rate of increase has actually been sharper at public \n4-year institutions than their private counterparts. Ten years ago, \nstudents attending any of America's excellent public universities would \nhave paid, on average, just over $9,000 to cover tuition, fees, room, \nand board. Today, these\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nstudents can expect to pay nearly $12,800--an increase of 38 percent \nafter taking inflation into account.\n  By contrast, the student loan interest deduction we provided as part \nof the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 remains at $2,500. It is time that \nwe raise this cap to $3,750, a 50-percent increase. Doing so is a step \ntoward recognizing that investments in higher education are essential \nto the health of our economy in an increasingly global, competitive \nmarketplace.\n  I also believe it is necessary to increase the contribution limits \nfor Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. Under current law, taxpayers \nmay make contributions of up to $2,000 per year to these tax-free \nhigher education accounts. In light of the inflation in college costs \nthat I have already described, I believe this contribution limit ought \nto be increased to $3,000 per year.\n  Finally, my proposal would also extend current education benefits \nprovided to employees through their employers. Under current law, a \ntaxpayer may receive, tax free, up to $5,250 in education benefits \nthrough their employers each year. This provision helps both companies \nand their employees. Companies that provide this benefit get a \nworkforce that is current with the latest methods and technologies in \nthe field, while their employees get the training they need to advance \nthrough the ranks. Unfortunately, this provision expires on December \n31, 2010. I propose that it be made permanent.\n  Now is the time for us to make a commitment to raising the Pell \nmaximum award to $5,100, and to providing additional relief to families \nstruggling to afford higher education. Investing in higher education is \ncrucial to our economic future and competitiveness in the global \neconomy, and my legislation represents a sound investment towards \nmaking the dream of a college education a reality for more Americans. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 455. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief to active duty military personnel and employers who assist \nthem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Smith and I are introducing \nthe Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007. This legislation will \nhelp those who are valiantly serving their country and the families \nthat they leave behind.\n  The best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who \nwear the uniform of our country. That means giving our troops the \nresources they need to keep them safe while they are protecting us. And \nit means supporting our troops at home as well as abroad.\n  Currently, there are over 132,000 military personnel serving in Iraq \nand more are on the way. There are approximately 22,100 U.S. \nservicemembers in Afghanistan. Many of these men and women are \nreservists and have been called to activity duty, frequently for \nmultiple tours. Often they own, or are employed, by a small business \nand their activation results in hardship for the business.\n  Small businesses with less than 100 employees employ about 18 percent \nof all reservists who hold civilian jobs. Most large businesses have \nthe resources to provide supplemental income to reservist employees \ncalled up and to replace them with temporary employees. I applaud the \nbusinesses that have been able to pay supplemental income to their \nreservists, but it is not easy for small businesses to do the same.\n  Earlier today, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee held \na hearing on veterans' small business issues. A majority of our \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are Reserve and National \nGuard members--35 percent of whom are either self-employed or own or \nare employed by a small business.\n  We heard some disturbing statistics about the impact and unintended \nconsequences the callup of reservists is having on small businesses. \nAccording to a January 2007 survey conducted by Workforce Management, \n54 percent of the businesses surveyed responded that they would not \nhire a citizen soldier if they knew that they could be called up for an \nindeterminate amount of time. I am concerned that long callups have \nmade it hard for small businesses to be supportive of civilian \nsoldiers.\n  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 provides a tax credit \nto small businesses with fewer than 100 employees and the self-employed \nto help with the cost of paying the salary of their reservist employees \nwhen they are called to active duty. This legislation also provides an \nadditional tax credit to help offset the cost of hiring temporary \nemployees to fill vacancies left by the servicemembers.\n  Many reservists who own their own business return from duty to find \nthat their business is floundering. These tax credits will help \nreservists who own their own businesses to hire temporary employees for \nthe duration of their tour as well as to assist small businesses deal \nwith the impact of having an essential employee called up for active \nduty.\n  In addition to helping small businesses, the Active Duty Military Tax \nRelief of 2007 addresses concerns related to differential military pay, \nincome tax withholding, and retirement plan participation. These \nprovisions will make it easier for employers who would like to pay \ntheir employees supplemental income, above their military pay, and make \npension contributions. Our legislation would make differential military \npay subject to Federal income tax withholding. In addition, with \nrespect to the retirement plan rules, the bill provides that a person \nreceiving differential military pay would be treated as an employee of \nthe employer making the payment and allows the differential military \npay to be treated as compensation.\n  This bill also attempts to mitigate the financial strains placed on \nour military families while the family member is deployed. To help ease \nsome of this burden, the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 \nwould increase the standard deduction for active duty military \npersonnel by $1,000 for 2007 and 2008. In addition, this legislation \nwould make permanent the existing provision which allows taxpayers to \ninclude combat pay as earned income for purposes of the earned income \ntax credit (EITC). Without this provision some military families would \nno longer be eligible to receive the EITC because combat pay is \ncurrently not taxable.\n  Last Congress, Senator Smith and I introduced the Fallen Heroes \nFamily Savings Act, which we have incorporated into the Active Duty \nMilitary Tax Relief Act. This provision provides tax relief for the \ndeath gratuity payment that is given to families that have lost a loved \none in combat. This payment is currently $100,000.\n  Our current tax laws do not allow the recipients of this payment to \nuse it to make contributions to tax-preferred saving accounts that help \nwith saving for retirement, health care, or the costs of education. Our \nlegislation would allow military death gratuities to be contributed to \ncertain tax-preferred accounts. These contributions would be treated as \nqualified rollovers. The contribution limits of these accounts will not \nbe applied to these contributions.\n  Our service men and women need to know that we are honoring their \nvalor by taking care of those they leave behind. Helping ease the tax \nburden on the death gratuity will enable military families to save more \nfor retirement, education, and health care by allowing them to put the \npayment in an account in which the earnings will accumulate tax-free.\n  These changes to our tax laws will help our military families with \nsome of their financial burdens. It cannot repay the sacrifices they \nhave made for us, but it is a small way we can support our troops and \ntheir families at home as well as abroad.\n  The National Military Family Association, the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, and The Military Coalition (a consortium of veterans and \nmilitary organizations representing more than 5.5 million members plus \ntheir families and survivors) support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase and enhance law enforcement resources \ncommitted to investigation and prosecution of violent gangs, to deter \nand punish violent gang crime, to protect law-abiding citizens and \ncommunities from violent criminals, to revise and enhance criminal \npenalties for violent crimes, to expand and improve gang prevention \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch and \na bipartisan group of at least 15 original cosponsors in introducing \ncomprehensive antiaging legislation--the Gang Abatement and Prevention \nAct of 2007.\n  This bill will provide a comprehensive approach to gang violence by: \nhelping those on the front lines of enforcement, by adopting new \ncriminal laws and tougher penalties against those who commit gang-\nrelated and other violent acts; authorizing hundreds of millions of \ndollars for gang-related investigations and prosecutions, and new funds \nfor witness protection; and identifying successful community programs, \nand investing significant resources in schools and civic and religious \norganizations to prevent teenagers and other young people from joining \ngangs in the first place.\n  On January 10 of this year, officials in Van Nuys, CA, reported that \ntwo teenage boys were shot in a reported gang-related shooting.\n  A few weeks earlier, on December 29, Visalia, CA, law enforcement \nofficials reported two separate shootings and the wounding of two \nminors.\n  On December 24, San Diego officials noted how a 16 year old was shot \nin the leg in gang violence.\n  On December 22, a 9-year-old girl in Los Angeles was just washing \ndishes with her mom inside her home--until gang members exchanged fire \nacross the street, and a bullet tore through the front wall of her \nhouse and struck her in the head.\n  And that came 5 days after Cheryl Green, a 14-year-old black girl who \nwas talking to friends, was shot and killed by two Hispanic gang \nmembers.\n  The New York Times just reported on the Cheryl Green shooting, but \nunfortunately, I see gang violence in the news almost every day in \nCalifornia, with gang-related shootings of children almost too numerous \nto count. Perhaps the worst occurred last September, when Los Angeles \nexperienced a new low.\n  Three-year-old Kaitlyn Avila was shot point-blank by a gang member \nwho mistakenly thought her father was a member of a rival gang. The \ngang member shot and wounded her father, then intentionally fired into \nlittle Kaitlyn's chest.\n  It is the first time ever that law enforcement officials remember a \nyoung child being ``targeted'' in a gang-related shooting.\n  Unfortunately, this shooting is only a symptom of the disease that \nhas taken hold of our cities--gang violence. The violence perpetrated \nby gang members affects not only those associated with gangs, but also \npolice officers and innocent bystanders. It impacts not only \nindividuals, but also our communities.\n  It stops mothers from allowing their children to play outside. It \nprevents\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nthe elderly from taking walks in their neighborhoods. And it creates an \nenvironment of fear.\n  It is past time for the Federal Government to provide a hand of \nassistance to state and local law enforcement. And it is past time to \ncome to grips with our country's escalating levels of gang violence.\n  Just last month the FBI released its Uniform Crime Report for the \nfirst half of 2006. The news was disturbing.\n  The report showed an alarming increase in homicides, assaults, \nrobberies and other violent crimes across the U.S.--a surge of nearly \n3.7 percent for the first 6 months of 2006.\n  This, of course follows on the heels of the FBI's 2005 figures, which \nhad showed a 2.5 percent jump in violent crime.\n  At the time, those 2005 figures had represented the largest increase \nin violent crime in the U.S. in 15 years. But this newly announced \nincrease for the first half of 2006 is almost 50 percent higher.\n  Of course, a big part of this increase is due to gang violence. Just \nas we heard when the 2005 figures were released, criminologists point \nto the spread of violent street gangs as a major cause of the 2006 \nincrease in violent crime as well.\n  The warnings we have received about the links between the increase in \nviolent crime and gangs have been steady and consistent.\n  When the FBI announced its 2005 figures last June, the Washington \nPost reported how criminal justice experts specifically identified ``an \ninflux of gangs into medium-sized cities'' as a big reason for this \nincrease. According to the Los Angeles Times, Houston police attributed \ntheir 2005 increase to gang members who evacuated New Orleans after \nKatrina.\n  When the 2006 figures were announced, the Washington Post quoted \ncriminologist James Alan Fox, who described how ``[w]e have many high-\ncrime areas where gangs have made a comeback.'' The L.A. Times noted \nhow ``[e]xperts said the crime upsurge reflected an increase in gang \nviolence, particularly in midsized cities.'' Cities like Houston, which \nexperienced a massive 28 percent increase in violent crime.\n  The headline for the Sacramento Bee, reporting on the FBI's 31 \npercent reported increase in violent crime for that county, said it \nall: ``Gangs blamed for increase, which is part of [a] national hike in \nmayhem in '06.''\n  Even among the cities that experienced a 2006 reduction in violent \ncrime--such as Los Angeles, which moved into the ranks of the safest \ncities in the U.S.--Mayor Villairaigosa described gang violence as the \n``glaring exception.'' Gang crime was up by 14 percent in Los Angeles--\nand up 40 percent in San Fernando Valley, and 57 percent of Los \nAngeles' 478 homicides for 2006 were attributed to gangs--up 50 percent \nfrom 2005. And 86 percent of those murder victims were African American \nor Latino.\n  There can no longer be serious debate that gang violence is a big \npart of this problem.\n  The problem of gang violence in America is daunting. According to the \nFBI, there are now at least 30,000 gangs nationwide, with 800,000 \nmembers.\n  In California, the State attorney general now estimates that there \nare 171,000 juveniles and adults committed to criminal street gangs and \ntheir way of life. That's greater than the population of 28 California \ncounties.\n  From 1992 to 2003, there were more than 7,500 gang-related homicides \nreported in California.\n  In 2004, more than one-third of the 2,000 homicides in California--\n698--were gang-related.\n  And it is worse among teens and young adults. In that same year, \nnearly 50 percent of the murders of 18 to 29 year olds were gang \nrelated. And nearly 60 percent of the murders of teens under 18 were \ngang related.\n  The list of people murdered by gangs includes some of our finest law \nenforcement officers:\n  Oceanside Police Officer, Dan Bessant, gunned down from behind just \nlast month, in an incident described as eerily similar to a similar \nkilling in 2003, when Oceanside Police Officer, Tony Zepetella, was \nshot and killed by a known gang member.\n  Los Angeles Police Officer Ricardo Lizarraga, killed while responding \nto a domestic violence call, by a man who drew a gun and shot him twice \nin the back. The suspect was a known member of the Rollin20s Bloods.\n  Merced Police Officer Stephan Gray, a member of his department's gang \nviolence unit. Gray was shot and killed when a suspect--a gang member \nhe had encountered before--fired two bullets into his chest.\n  Los Angeles Sherriff's Deputy Jeffrey Ortiz: As a member of his \ndepartment's anti-gang task force, Ortiz had been going door to door in \na gang-plagued neighborhood of L.A. He had just knocked on a door and \nwas checking IDs when he was shot in the head at point-blank range. The \nalleged gunman is a suspected gang member wanted on an outstanding \nwarrant for attempted murder.\n  Burbank Police Officer Matthew Pavelka: Two gunmen whom he had \nstopped for driving without license plates got out and showered him \nwith gunfire. They were allegedly affiliated with the Vineland Boys \ngang.\n  California Highway Patrol Officer Thomas Steiner, killed after \nwalking out of the Pomona courthouse after testifying in a series of \ntraffic cases, by a 16-year-old intent on ``killing a cop'' to prove \nhimself to the Pomona 12th street gang.\n  San Francisco Police Officer Isaac Espinoza: The first San Francisco \npolice officer slain on duty in more than a decade, killed when an \napparent ``Westmob'' gang member fired 14 rounds from an AK-47 assault \nrifle.\n  Gang killings also impact children and families. Unfortunately, 3-\nyear-old Kaitlyn Avila is not alone: There is also 11-year-old Mynisha \nCrenshaw of San Bernardino, CA, a little girl shot and killed in \nNovember 2005;\n  Seven-week-old infant Glenn ``Baby G'' Molex, shot and killed on \nSeptember 28, 2003, by one of the ``Down Below'' Gang after 28 bullets \npenetrated his family's apartment in San Francisco's Bayview District;\n  Joseph Swift, a 13-year-old boy shot outside a home after attending \nchurch in Los Angeles in 2003; and\n  Eight-year-old Sunny Elijah Peralez, shot in East Los Angeles by the \nGhetto Boyz in 1999.\n  And this problem extends far beyond California--as evidenced by 8-\nyear-old Kyron Butler, killed by a stray bullet during a Jersey Park \nBoys gang shootout in Smithfield, VA, in 2003, and 9-year-old Genesis \nGonzalez, a little girl shot by a car of Crips gang members in Nevada \nin 2002.\n  As gangs have continued to spread across our country, increasing in \nviolence and power in every State, they are no longer just a big city \nproblem. They have metastasized from Los Angeles and Chicago to the \nmedium and smaller cities where they face less competition.\n  The FBI now estimates that gangs are having an impact on at least \n2,500 communities across the nation.\n  In the latest FBI statistics, violent crime and murder grew fastest \nin the midsized and smaller cities--not in our largest urban areas. The \naverage midsized city, in fact, had a surge in overall violent crime of \nmore than 5 percent in a single year.\n  It is clear that gangs engage in drug trafficking, robbery, \nextortion, prostitution, gun trafficking, and murder. They destroy \nneighborhoods, cripple families and kill innocent people.\n  Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton put it bluntly:\n\n       There is nothing more insidious than these gangs. They are \n     worse than the Mafia. Show me a year in New York where the \n     Mafia indiscriminately killed 300 people. You can't.\n\n  Our national gang problem is immense and growing, and it is not going \naway. Our cities and States need help. The many law enforcement \nofficers that have spoken to me and others in my office say one thing \nclearly--short-term infusions are great, but what they really need is a \nlong-term Federal commitment to combat gang violence.\n  A massive report just prepared for the City of Los Angeles even \nsuggested that what is needed is a ``Marshal Plan'' initiative to \ncombat gang violence.\n  Senator Hatch and I have been introducing comprehensive Federal gang \nlegislation for over a decade. Our gang bills have been modified and \nrefined over the years, most recently in legislation that we negotiated \nwith the House for possible inclusion in the DOD Authorization bill \nlast year.\n  The bill that we introduce today essentially takes that bill, but \nremoves\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nall of its new death penalties. It has no mandatory minimums, and we \nhave eliminated juvenile justice changes that previously proved to be \nan impediment to the larger bill's passage.\n  The bill that we offer today will provide a comprehensive solution to \ngang violence, combining enforcement and prevention efforts in a \ncollaborative approach that has proven effective in models like \nOperation Ceasefire, and in Modesto, CA.\n  This bill would establish new Federal gang crimes and tougher Federal \npenalties.\n  Today's Federal street gang laws are frankly weak, and are almost \nnever used. Currently, a person committing a gang crime might have \nextra time tacked on to the end of their Federal sentence. That is \nbecause Federal law currently focuses on gang violence only as a \nsentencing enhancement, rather than a crime unto itself.\n  The bill that I offer today would make it a separate Federal crime \nfor any criminal street gang member to commit, conspire or attempt to \ncommit violent crimes--including murder, kidnapping, arson, extortion--\nin furtherance of the gang.\n  And the penalties for gang members committing such crimes would \nincrease considerably.\n  For gang-related murder, kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse or \nmaiming, the penalties would range up to life imprisonment.\n  For any other serious violent felony, the penalty would range up to \n30 years--which in the Federal system means without parole.\n  And for other crimes of violence--defined as the actual or intended \nuse of physical force against the person of another--the penalty could \nbring up to 20 years in prison.\n  The bill would also create a new crime for recruiting juveniles and \nadults into a criminal street gang, with a penalty of up to 10 years, \nor if the recruiting involved a juvenile or recruiting from prison, up \nto 20 years;\n  Create new Federal crimes for committing violent crimes in connection \nwith drug trafficking, and increase existing penalties for violent \ncrimes in aid of racketeering;\n  Enact a host of other violent crime reforms, including closing a \nloophole that had allowed carjackers to avoid convictions, increasing \nthe penalties for those who use guns in violent crimes or transfer guns \nknowing they will be used in crimes, limiting bail for violent felons \nwho possess firearms, and in a number of other respects cracking down \nharder on those who commit violent crimes; and\n  Make a long-term Federal commitment to fight gangs, by authorizing \nover $1 billion in new funds over the next 5 years for enforcement, \nprevention, and witness protection.\n  This would include $500 million for the development of High Intensity \nInterstate Gang Activity Areas, or HIIGAAs.\n  These HIIGAAs would mirror the successful HIDTA--High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area model--under which Federal, State and local agents \ncoordinate investigations and prosecutions. And this $500 million would \nalso be split 50/50, so that for every dollar spent on law enforcement, \na dollar would be spent on prevention and intervention.\n  This balanced approach--of prevention and intervention plus tough \npenalties--will send a clear message to gang members: a new day has \narrived. This bill will provide them with new opportunities, with \nschools and social services agencies empowered to make alternatives to \ngangs a realistic option. But if gang members continue to engage in \nviolence, they will face new and serious Federal consequences.\n  I am pleased to report that this bill has already been endorsed by \nthe National Sheriff's Association, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, and the National Association of Police Officers.\n  For more than 10 years now, Senator Hatch and I have been trying to \npass Federal anti-gang legislation. There have been times when we have \ngotten close. Unfortunately, while Congress has failed to act, violent \nstreet gangs have only expanded nationwide and become more empowered \nand entrenched in other States and communities.\n  I believe this bill can pass the Senate and be enacted into law, \nespecially after these changes that we have made and our previous \nnegotiations conducted with members of the House and Senate.\n  The time has arrived for us to finally address this problem, and this \nbill is well-suited to help solve it. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 460. A bill to make determinations by the United States Trade \nRepresentative under title III of the Trade Act of 1974 reviewable by \nthe Court of International Trade and to ensure that the United States \nTrade Representative considers petitions to enforce United States Trade \nrights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, when reflecting on the attributes that have \nmade our great country prosperous--its free market system, its hard-\nworking and enterprising people, its treasured natural resources--we \nmust not overlook the rule of law as an equal, if not paramount element \nof the blessings we have secured. Since our Nation's founding, \nAmericans have recognized that the success of worthy enterprises in a \nfunctioning market require the government--rather than choosing winners \nand losers--to consistently and dispassionately enforce the rules that \nbind all actors.\n  While our legal system evolved over the course of centuries to \nprovide for the rule of law throughout our country, the fates of \nAmerican people and businesses have become increasingly bound to \ncounterparts in the world beyond our borders. Whether called \n``Globalization'', ``Internationalization'' or some other moniker, the \nrapidly growing number of connections between suppliers, consumers and \nfinanciers across national boundaries means that agreements breached \nand laws broken on the far side of the world can harm companies and \nworkers here at home.\n  Yet our government has failed to adapt to this new reality. While \nforeign governments engage in market-distorting currency manipulation, \nrefuse to protect intellectual property rights and turn a blind eye to \nlabor exploitation--each a violation of trade obligations to the United \nStates--ours demurs with communiques and consultations, rather than \nformal enforcement action. What makes this abdication of its duty to \ndefend the U.S. economy from unfair foreign practices especially \ntroubling is that the tools to do so already exist in the dispute \nresolution provisions of various trade agreements.\n  The distressing reality is that U.S. industry and labor groups are \noften rebuffed in attempts to petition the United States Trade \nRepresentative to initiate a formal investigation or bring a dispute \nresolution action under the relevant multilateral or bilateral trade \nagreement, as there seems to be considerable institutional momentum \namong senior officials at USTR and elsewhere in the Administration \nagainst bringing formal enforcement action against certain trade \npartners, and China in particular.\n  USTR's handling of the trade effects of China's currency manipulation \npractices is representative of the problem. In September 2004, a U.S. \nindustry coalition filed a petition under Section 301 of the Trade Act \nof 1974--the statute setting forth general procedures for the \nenforcement of U.S. trade rights--alleging that Chinese currency \nmanipulation practices constituted a violation of China's obligations \nto the United States under World Trade Organization rules, and calling \nfor USTR to conduct an investigation of such practices. USTR rejected \nthe petition on the day it was filed, contending that ``an \ninvestigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, \nand practices covered in the petition. The Administration is currently \ninvolved in efforts to address with the Government of China the \ncurrency valuation issues raised in the petition. The USTR believes \nthat initiation of an investigation under [the Section 301 process] \nwould hamper, rather than advance, Administration efforts to address \nChinese currency valuation policies.'' Shortly thereafter, in November \nof 2004, a Congressional coalition of 12 Senators and 23 \nRepresentatives filed a similar Section 301 petition, which was \nrejected by USTR on the same grounds.\n  As noted in USTR's rejection of these petitions, current law allows \nthe Executive to decline to initiate an industry-\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nrequested investigation where it determines that action under Section \n301 would be ineffective in addressing the offending act, policy or \npractice. The merits of USTR's determination are unreviewable under \ncurrent law. USTR used this loophole to avoid having to even \ninvestigate industry's claim, let alone take formal action against \nChina. And as we now know, the Administration's ``soft'' approach to \nChinese currency manipulation has itself proven ineffective in \naddressing the problem in the two years since these filings.\n  It is to prevent further disregard for U.S. businesses and workers \nseeking a fair and consequential hearing of their concerns with foreign \ntrade practices that Senator Rockefeller and I today introduce the \nTrade Complaint and Litigation Accountability Improvement Measures Act, \nor the ``Trade CLAIM Act''.\n  The Trade CLAIM Act would amend the Section 301 process to require \nthe United States Trade Representative to act upon an interested \nparty's petition to take formal action in cases where a U.S. trade \nright has been violated, except in instances where: the matter has \nalready been addressed by the relevant trade dispute settlement body; \nthe foreign country is taking imminent steps to end to ameliorate the \neffects of the practice; taking action would do more harm than good to \nthe U.S. economy; or taking action would cause serious harm to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  The bill would also grant the Court of International Trade \njurisdiction to review de novo USTR's denials of Section 301 industry \npetitions to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair \nforeign trade laws or practices. Such jurisdiction would include the \nability to review USTR determinations that U.S. trade rights have not \nbeen violated as alleged in industry petitions, and the sufficiency of \nformal actions taken by USTR in response to foreign trade laws or \npractices determined to violate U.S. trade rights.\n  The Trade CLAIM Act would give U.S. businesses and workers a greater \nsay in whether, when and how U.S. trade rights should be enforced. The \nbill would be particularly beneficial to small businesses, which--like \nother petitioners in Section 301 cases--currently have no avenue to \nformally challenge the merits of USTR's decisions, and are often \ndrowned out by large business interests in industry-wide Section 301 \nactions initiated by USTR.\n  By providing for judicial review of USTR decisions not to enforce \nU.S. trade rights, the bill provides for impartial third party \noversight by a specialty court not subject to political and diplomatic \npressures. In delinking discreet trade disputes from the mercurial \nmachinations of international relations, this Act would end the \nsacrifice of individual industries on the negotiating table, and leave \nit to the free market--uniformly operating under the trade rules to \nwhich our trading partners have already agreed--to decide their fate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 461.

A bill to approve the settlement of the water rights claims \nof the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in \nNevada, to require the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the \nsettlement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nresolve a Nevada water rights matter that has lasted more than a \ndecade.\n  This bill, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley Water Rights \nSettlement Act, would ratify an agreement reached last fall by the \nState of Nevada, the Tribes, many individual water users, and the \nUnited States. I am pleased that the parties came together, asserted \ntheir interests, made compromises, and reached an agreement. Each party \nhad different--and frequently conflicting--water claims, water needs, \nand ideas on water use and conservation. I appreciate the parties' hard \nwork and their commitment to end expensive litigation to reach an \nagreement that will permanently resolve the water rights matters along \nthe East Fork of the Owyhee River. This bill, if enacted, will ratify \nthe agreement reached by the parties.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to approve, ratify and confirm \nthe agreement that addresses the Tribes' water rights, the rights of \nupstream water users, and the implementation of a plan for the parties \nto exercise their water rights.\n  The Agreement quantifies the Tribes' surface water rights and \ngroundwater claims in Nevada. The Tribes will establish a water code \nand administer the quantified rights on the Reservation accordingly.\n  The Agreement also states that the water rights of the upstream water \nusers who live off the Reservation will be determined and administered \nby the State Engineer. Under the settlement, the parties have agreed to \na limitation on the number of acres that can be irrigated by the \nupstream water users.\n  The settlement's implementation plan describes how the rights of the \nrespective parties will be administered and disputes will be resolved. \nIt describes that the surface water basin will be closed, and provides \nthat a groundwater basin will be declared a basin in need of additional \nadministration under state law. The agreement further addresses \noperation of the system particularly during times of shortage. Under \nthis part of the plan, upstream water users gain a small amount of \nwater storage in the Wild Horse Reservoir.\n  The second purpose of this bill is to settle the Tribes' long-\nstanding claims against the United States for damages caused by the \nBureau of Reclamation's Duck Valley Irrigation Project, related Bureau \nof Indian Affairs projects, and the mismanagement of tribal resources, \nparticularly the destruction of the Tribe's salmon and steelhead trout \nfishing stock.\n  The Shoshone-Paiutes have a long history in Nevada and Idaho. The \nTribes roamed the region well before the Duck Valley Reservation was \nestablished by Executive Order in 1877. The Reservation today \nencompasses approximately 290,000 acres of land held in trust by the \nfederal government for the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.\n  The Reservation draws water from three primary sources: 1. the East \nFork of the Owyhee River that flows through the Reservation from south \nto north from the Nevada side; 2. Blue Creek, a tributary to the Owyhee \nthat flows north to south through the Reservation until it meets the \nOwyhee on the Idaho side of the Reservation; and 3. Mary's Creek, \nlocated in the northeastern part of the Reservation, flowing \nnortheasterly through the Reservation and into Idaho.\n  When the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Duck Valley Indian Irrigation \nProject was initiated in the 1930s, the project placed over 12,000 \nacres of land under irrigation. Like many Indian water projects, the \nProject was only partially completed and never fully funded, which \naccounted for the Projects' disrepair, resulted in reduced storage \ncapacity, and an inability to reach the goal of maximizing the acres in \nproduction.\n  With the construction of the Bureau of Reclamation's Owyhee \nIrrigation Project Dam in the 1930s, the Tribes' salmon runs were \ndestroyed.\n  The affects of these federal projects on the Tribes' resources and \nculture and the Federal Government's failure to protect tribal water \nrights require places the United States in the position of compensating \nthe Tribes for their loss. The Tribes value the loss to their resources \nand culture at level much higher than what Senator Ensign and I \npropose. While the United States can never fully compensate the Tribes \nfor their loss, I appreciate the Tribes' willingness to accept the \nsettlement figure and put an end to this painful part of our sovereign-\nto-sovereign relationship.\n  The bill, if enacted, would authorize two settlement funds--a \ndevelopment fund and a maintenance fund.\n  The development fund, to be authorized at $45 million over 5 fiscal \nyears, would fund tribal water development projects. After careful \nresearch and consultation with its members and advisors, the Tribes \nhave identified many projects to increase their economic opportunities. \nThe Tribes are preparing to rehabilitate the dilapidated Duck Valley \nIrrigation Project, increase the amount of irrigable lands in \nagricultural production, develop a Wildlife Habitat Project, and \nundertake other economic development projects to enhance the \nReservation economy and contribute to the permanent homeland purpose of \nthe Duck Valley Reservation.\n  The maintenance fund, authorized at $15 million over 5 fiscal years, \nwould fund the refurbishment and maintenance of the Reservation's water \ninfrastructure.\n  The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley Water Rights Settlement Act \nis important legislation. It reflects the compromises of our \nconstituents who worked hard to reach agreement on matters that affect \ntheir livelihoods and cultures. I believe this bill benefit the Tribes, \nthe ranchers and upstream water users, and those residents in the \nnorthern Nevada and southern Idaho region.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs to ensure timely review and passage \nof this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of \n     Duck Valley Water Rights Settlement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is the policy of the United States, in accordance \n     with the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian \n     tribes, to promote Indian self-determination and economic \n     self-sufficiency and to settle Indian water rights claims \n     without lengthy and costly litigation, if practicable;\n       (2) quantifying rights to water and development of \n     facilities needed to use tribal water supplies is essential \n     to the development of viable Indian reservation economies and \n     the establishment of a permanent reservation homeland;\n       (3) uncertainty concerning the extent of the right to water \n     of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes has limited the access of the \n     Tribes to water and financial resources necessary to achieve \n     self-determination and self-sufficiency;\n       (4) in 2006, the Tribes, the State of Idaho, the affected \n     individual water users, and the United States resolved all \n     tribal claims to water rights in the Snake River Basin \n     Adjudication through a consent decree entered by the District \n     Court of the Fifth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, \n     requiring no further Federal action to implement the Tribes' \n     water rights in the State of Idaho;\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\n       (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, proceedings to \n     determine the extent and nature of the water rights of the \n     Tribes are pending before the Nevada State Engineer;\n       (6) final resolution through litigation of the water claims \n     of the Tribes will--\n       (A) take many years;\n       (B) entail great expense;\n       (C) continue to limit the access of the Tribes to water, \n     with economic and social consequences;\n       (D) prolong uncertainty relating to the availability of \n     water supplies; and\n       (E) seriously impair long-term economic planning and \n     development for all parties to the litigation;\n       (7) after many years of negotiation, the United States, the \n     Tribes, the State, and the upstream water users have entered \n     into a settlement agreement to resolve permanently all water \n     rights of the Tribes in the State; and\n       (8) the Tribes have certain water-related claims for \n     damages against the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nclarify when organizations described in section 527 of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 must register as political committees, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again I am pleased to be joined by my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Feingold from Wisconsin in \nintroducing a bill to end the illegal practice of 527 groups spending \nsoft money on ads and other activities to influence Federal elections.\n  This bill is very simple. It would require that all 527s register as \npolitical committees and comply with Federal campaign finance laws, \nincluding Federal limits on the contributions they receive, unless the \nmoney they raise and spend is only in connection with non-Federal \ncandidate elections, State or local ballot initiatives, or the \nnomination or confirmation of individuals to non-elected offices.\n  Additionally, this legislation would set new rules for Federal \npolitical committees that spend funds on voter mobilization efforts \neffecting both Federal and local races and, therefore, use both a \nFederal and a non-Federal account under Federal Election Commission \n(FEC) regulation. The new rules would prevent unlimited soft money from \nbeing channeled into Federal election activities by these Federal \npolitical committees.\n  Under the new rules that would be established under this bill, at \nleast half of the funds spent on these voter mobilization activities by \nFederal political committees would have to be hard money from their \nFederal account. More importantly, the funds raised for their non-\nFederal account would have to come from individuals and would be \nlimited to no more than $25,000 per year per donor. Corporations and \nlabor unions could not contribute to these non-Federal accounts. To put \nit in simple terms, a George Soros could give $25,000 per year as \nopposed to $10 million to finance these activities.\n  It is unfortunate that we even need to be here introducing this bill \ntoday. This legislation would not be necessary if the FEC would enforce \nexisting law. As my colleagues know, a number of 527 groups raised and \nspent a substantial amount of soft money in a blatant effort to \ninfluence the outcome of the 2004 Presidential election. These \nactivities are illegal under existing laws,\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nbut, unfortunately, the FEC has failed to implement the regulations \nnecessary to stop these illegal activities.\n  According to an analysis by campaign finance scholar Tony Corrado, \nfederally oriented 527s spent $423 million to affect the outcome of the \n2004 elections. The same analysis shows that ten donors gave at least \n$4 million each to 527s involved in the 2004 elections and two donors \neach contributed over $20 million. Let me be perfectly clear on one \npoint here. Our proposal will NOT shut down 527s. It will simply \nrequire them to abide by the same Federal regulations every other \nFederal political committee must abide by in spending money to \ninfluence Federal elections.\n  Opponents of campaign finance reform like to point out that the \nactivities of these 527s serve as proof that the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act (BCRA) has failed in its stated purpose, which is to \neliminate the corrupting influence of soft money in our political \ncampaigns. Let me be perfectly clear on this. The 527 issue has nothing \nto do with BCRA, it has everything to do with the Federal Election \nCampaign Act of 1974 and the failure of the FEC to properly regulate \nthe activities of these groups.\n  The bill Senator Feingold and I are introducing today is designed to \nput an end to the abusive, illegal practices of these 527s. I urge my \ncolleagues to support swift passage of this bill and put an end to this \nproblem once and for all.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be working once again \nwith my partner in reform, the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, to introduce the 527 Reform Act.\n  Our purpose is simple--to pass legislation that will do what the FEC \ncould and should do under current law, but, once again, has failed to \ndo. Current Federal election law requires these groups to register as \npolitical committees and to stop raising and spending soft money. But \nthe FEC has failed to enforce the law, so we must act in the Congress. \nThis bill will make it absolutely clear that the federal election laws \napply to 527 organizations.\n  We had to something similar with BCRA, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform \nAct, which passed in 2002, closing the soft money loophole that the FEC \ncreated in the late '70s and expanded in the '90s. That struggle took \nseven years. We have now been seeking to bring 527s within the law for \nfour.\n  This bill will require all 527s to register as political committees \nunless they fall into a number of narrow categories. The exceptions are \nbasically for groups that Congress exempted from disclosure \nrequirements because they are so small or for groups that are involved \nexclusively in State election activity. Once a group registers as a \npolitical committee, certain activities, such as ads that mention only \nFederal candidates, will have to be paid for solely with hard money.\n  Under current rules, the FEC permits Federal political committees to \nmaintain a non-Federal account to pay a portion of the expenses of \nactivities that affect both Federal and non-Federal elections. Our bill \nsets new allocation rules that will make sure that these allocable \nactivities are paid for with at least 50 percent hard money.\n  Finally, the bill makes an important change with respect to the non-\nfederal portion of the allocable activities. We put a limit of $25,000 \nper year on the contributions that can be accepted for that non-federal \naccount. This means no more million dollar soft money contributions to \npay for get-out-the-vote efforts in the presidential campaign.\n  Nothing in this bill will affect legitimate 501(c) advocacy groups. \nThe bill only applies to groups that claim a tax exemption under \nsection 527.\n  Having laid out the central components of the bill, let me discuss \nhow this bill has evolved, and the differences between this bill and \nthe bill we introduced in 2005. In the last Congress, we made a great \ndeal of progress working with the Senator from Mississippi, who at the \ntime chaired the Rules Committee. Prior to taking the bill to a markup \nin the spring of 2005, Senator Lott worked with us to clarify the bill \nand address some of the concerns that had been raised about it. The \nbill we are introducing today is identical to the ``Chairman's Mark'' \nthat Senator Lott brought before the Rules Committee last year.\n  While the original bill exempted 527s engaged exclusively in state \nelections from the registration requirement, it denied the exemption to \ngroups that carry out ``voter drive activities''--defined as get-out-\nthe vote, voter ID, or voter registration--during a federal election \nyear. This made the exemption too narrow, so we looked for another way \nto ensure that state 527s that only work on behalf of non-Federal \nofficeholders will not have to become Federal PACs.\n  The Chairman's Mark, and this year's bill, completely exempt \norganizations of State and local candidates or officeholders. Groups \nsuch as the Democratic Governors Association, Republican Governors \nAssociation, or a state legislative caucus would be exempt, as long as \ntheir voter drive activities only mention state candidates or ballot \nissues. These groups do not qualify for the exemption, however, if they \nmention Federal candidates in their communications.\n  Second, the bill provides a slightly narrower exemption for State \nPACs that are active only in State elections. The only additional \nrequirements for these PACs to qualify for an exemption are that they \ncan only be active in a single State, and they cannot have a candidate \nfor Federal office or Federal officeholder controlling or participating \nin the organization or raising money for it.\n  Finally, we made a number of changes to ensure that Federal PACs that \nallocate expenditures can use non-Federal money for expenditures \ndesigned only to assist State candidates even if they make an \nincidental reference to a Federal candidate or political party.\n  The changes to the legislation that we made last year working with \nSenator Lott prior to the Rules Committee markup have been carried \nforward in the bill we introduce today. They improved and strengthened \nthe bill. Unfortunately, other amendments were added during the Rules \nCommittee consideration of the bill that we could not support. So the \nbill that we are introducing today is the same as the bill that went to \nmarkup in 2005, not the bill that was reported.\n  In closing, let me remind my colleagues that the soft money loophole \nwas first opened by FEC rulings in the late '70s. By the time we \nstarted work on BCRA, the problem had mushroomed and led to the \nscandals we saw in the 1996 campaign. When we passed BCRA, I said we \nwould have to be vigilant to make sure that the FEC enforced the law \nand that similar loopholes did not develop. That is what we are trying \nto do here.\n  I have no doubt that if we don't act on this 527 problem now, we will \nsee more problems explode into scandals over the next few election \ncycles. In the 2004 cycle, Federal-oriented 527s spend $423 million. In \nfact, there were two donors who each contributed over $20 million. We \ncannot afford to wait until another presidential campaign season is in \nfull bloom before addressing this problem. This FEC-ordained loophole \nthreatens to further undermine the federal election laws. We must close \nit this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida):\n  S. 464.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of an end-of-life planning consultation as part of \nan initial preventive physical examination under the Medicare program; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, death is by no means an easy subject \nto talk about; nonetheless, end-of-life care continues to be a \ncontroversial topic that must be addressed. Today, I am introducing \nthree bills that I hope will go a long way to improve end-of-life care \nin this country. Senator Susan Collins and I are reintroducing our \nAdvance Planning and Compassionate Care Act, comprehensive legislation \nthat would ensure that patients' final wishes for end-of-life care are \nknown, respected, and complied with. This legislation has been \nintroduced in each Congress since the 105th Congress. I am hopeful that \nwe will be able to move it this year.\n  I am also introducing the Medicare End-of-Life Care Planning Act with \nSenators Lugar and Bill Nelson. This important bill is based on an \namendment that I introduced during the Finance Committee's \nconsideration of the Deficit Reduction Act in 2005. It would require \nphysician consultation regarding advance directives during the initial \n``Welcome to Medicare'' physician visit. An end-of-life care \nconsultation during a Medicare recipient's first contact with the \nprogram would emphasize the importance of advance planning and give him \nor her the tools necessary to understand advance directives, the \nMedicare hospice benefit, and other end-of-life care concerns. Having \nsuch a benefit in Medicare would undoubtedly improve patient care and \nquality at the end-of-life.\n  The final bill that I would like to talk about today is the Advance \nDirectives Improvement and Education Act, legislation that I am \ncosponsoring with Senators Bill Nelson and Richard Lugar. The Advance \nDirectives Improvement and Education Act complements both of the bills \nI am introducing today. It includes my language on the ``Welcome to \nMedicare'' doctor's visit, which I believe is critical, but it also \nincludes two other important provisions. It improves the policies for \nuse and portability of advance directives across state lines, and it \ndirects the Secretary of HHS to conduct a public education campaign on \nthe importance of end-of-life planning.\n  I am happy to be an author of each of these bills. As we have seen \nrecently with the well-publicized case of Terri Shiavo, end-of-life \ndecision making can be confusing and cause added anguish to an already \nsorrowful situation. The delicate nature of life and love make it very \ndifficult to create strict rules governing end-of-life care, nor should \nwe want to. In its present form, however, end-of-life planning and care \nfor most Americans is perplexing, disjointed, and lacking an active \ndialogue. We can, and must, take action to make this process as easy as \npossible.\n  It is not surprising that we face this problem. Health care \nprofessionals frequently use terms that are too technical or confusing \nfor the average person. Patients who appear too sick to participate in \nthe discussions may be excluded from determining their own destiny. And \nall too often the entire conversation never happens due to the \ndiscomfort of all parties involved. As a result, patients and families, \nsuffer needlessly during these already difficult times. A report issued \nby the Institute of Medicine Committee on Care at the End of Life \nstated that, and I quote, ``suffering arises when the aggressive use of \nineffectual or intrusive interventions serves to prolong the period of \ndying unnecessarily or to dishonor the dying person's wishes about \ncare. Too often, dying people and their families are either not aware \nof these care options, not fully apprised of the probable benefits and \nburdens of these various options, or are the recipients of care that is \ninconsistent with their wishes as expressed in written or oral \ndirectives.''\n  Despite these shortcomings, the evidence tells us that most people \nwant to discuss advanced directives when they are healthy and they want \ntheir families involved in the process. According to the American \nPsychological Association, almost 60 percent of individuals 65 or older \nstate that they want their family to be given choices about treatment \nshould they become incapacitated rather than leaving the decision up to \nphysicians. How can we allow these serious problems to persist when \ndealing with the lives of our family and friends?\n  Death is hard to think about. Death is hard to talk about. And the \nfinal period of time leading up to our death is hard to plan. But we \nmust encourage our family, our friends, and our loved ones to discuss \nthis difficult topic in an open and effective manner in order to avoid \nany additional pain when a loved one passes away. We must also provide \nthem the best tools to do so.\n  The legislation I am introducing today accomplishes this objective by \ndeveloping standards for end-of-life care, facilitating opportunities \nfor patients to discuss end-of-life issues with a trained professional, \nand authorizing funds for demonstration projects on innovative \napproaches to end-of-life care.\n  Death is a serious, personal, and complicated issue that is \neventually relevant to each and every one of us. Americans deserve end-\nof-life care that is effective in fulfilling individual wishes, \navoiding unnecessary disputes, and, most importantly, providing quality \nend-of-life care. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join us in \nimproving end-of-life care and reducing the amount of grief that \ninevitably comes with losing those who we hold dear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of each of these bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Advance Directives \n     Improvement and Education Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADVANCE DIRECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n     Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n     hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n     illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 \n     out of every 3 deaths.\n       (2) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n     decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n     reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n     refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n     stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n     safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable \n     of deciding for themselves.\n       (3) A survey published in 2005 estimated that the overall \n     prevalence of advance directives is 29 percent of the general \n     population, despite the passage of the Patient Self-\n     Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health care \n     providers tell patients about advance directives.\n       (4) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n     stipulating their health care decisions in the event that \n     they become unable to speak for themselves. Through the \n     execution of advance directives, including living wills and \n     durable powers of attorney for health care according to the \n     laws of the State in which they reside, individuals can \n     protect their right to express their wishes and have them \n     respected.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to improve \n     access to information about individuals' health care options \n     and legal rights for care near the end of life, to promote \n     advance care planning and decisionmaking so that individuals' \n     wishes are known should they become unable to speak for \n     themselves, to engage health care providers in disseminating \n     information about and assisting in the preparation of advance \n     directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \n     attorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n       (c) Medicare Coverage of End-of-Life Planning and \n     Consultations as Part of Initial Preventive Physical \n     Examination.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1861(ww) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(ww)) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraph (2),'' and \n     inserting ``paragraph (2) and an end-of-life planning \n     consultation (as defined in paragraph (3)),''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `end-of-life \n     planning consultation' means a consultation between the \n     physician and an individual regarding--\n       ``(A) the importance of preparing advance directives in \n     case an injury or illness causes the individual to be unable \n     to make health care decisions;\n       ``(B) the situations in which an advance directive is \n     likely to be relied upon;\n       ``(C) the reasons that the development of a comprehensive \n     end-of-life plan is beneficial and the reasons that such a \n     plan should be updated periodically as the health of the \n     individual changes;\n       ``(D) the identification of resources that an individual \n     may use to determine the requirements of the State in which \n     such individual resides so that the treatment wishes of that \n     individual will be carried out if the individual is unable to \n     communicate those wishes, including requirements regarding \n     the designation of a surrogate decision maker (health care \n     proxy); and\n       ``(E) whether or not the physician is willing to follow the \n     individual's wishes as expressed in an advance directive.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to initial preventive physical examinations \n     provided on or after January 1, 2008.\n       (d) Improvement of Policies Related to the Use and \n     Portability of Advance Directives.--\n       (1) Medicare.--Section 1866(f) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(f)) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``and if presented by \n     the individual (or on behalf of the individual), to include \n     the content of such advance directive in a prominent part of \n     such record'' before the semicolon at the end;\n       (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon at the end;\n       (iii) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the \n     end and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (iv) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(F) to provide each individual with the opportunity to \n     discuss issues relating to the information provided to that \n     individual pursuant to subparagraph (A) with an appropriately \n     trained professional.'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``a written'' and \n     inserting ``an'';

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues and cosponsors Senators Jay Rockefeller and Richard Lugar as \nwe introduce the Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of \n2007.\n  The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007 has a \nsimple purpose: to encourage all adults in America, especially those 65 \nand older, to think about, talk about and write down their wishes for \nmedical care near the end of life should they become unable to make \ndecisions for themselves. Advance directives, which include a living \nwill stating the individual's preferences for care, and a power of \nattorney for health care, are critical documents that each of us should \nhave. The goal is clear, but reaching it requires that we educate the \npublic about the importance of advance directives, offer opportunities \nfor discussion of the issues, and reinforce the requirement that health \ncare providers honor patients' wishes. This bill is designed to do just \nthat.\n  The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007 would \nencourage new Medicare beneficiaries to prepare advance directives by \nincluding a physician consultation on advance directives in each \n``Welcome to Medicare'' physical exam. This initial consultation would \ncover the importance of preparing advance directives, when these \ndocuments are most likely to be used, and where to find additional \nresources and information. The conversation will also enable physicians \nto learn about their patients' wishes, fears, religious beliefs, and \nlife experiences that might influence their medical care wishes. These \nare important aspects of a physician-patient relationship that are too \noften unaddressed.\n  Another part of our bill would provide funds for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, to conduct a public education campaign \nto raise awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end \nof life. This campaign would explain what advance directives are, where \nthey are available, what questions need to be asked and answered, and \nwhat to do with the executed documents. HHS, directly or through \ngrants, would also establish an information clearinghouse where \nconsumers could receive State-specific information and consumer-\nfriendly documents and publications.\n  The bill also contains language that would make all advance \ndirectives ``portable,'' that is, useful from one State to another. If \nan out-of-State directive is presented, it will be presumed valid \nunless the health care provider can reasonably demonstrate that it is \nnot an authentic expression of the individual's wishes concerning his \nor her health care.\n  We all know about the tragic situation that occurred in Florida with \nTerri Schiavo and her family. She was\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\na young woman who was the subject of a debate about her treatment \nbetween her husband and her parents, a debate that was a court case and \na legislative quagmire. Most experts agree that if she had an advance \ndirective that made her wishes clear and named a health care proxy, \nthere would have been no question as to who could decide the course of \nher care.\n  One of the great legacies of Terri Schiavo's life will be that she \nbegan a national dialogue about end-of-life care and got people \ndiscussing living wills. Regardless of our views on the ethical, legal \nand constitutional issues surrounding her case, we all can agree that \nmore people now than ever know the importance of having end-of-life \ndiscussions with their family, doctor, clergy or attorney. This bill \nwould build upon this national dialogue and encourage more Americans to \nlearn about and fill out advance directives.\n  This body is a legislative institution, not a medical one. We cannot \nlegislate good medical care or compassion. What we can do, what I hope \nwe will do, is to enact this bill so that the American public can \nparticipate in improving end-of-life care. If we can do that, we will \nhave done a great deal.\n\n                                 S. 466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to expand the \nclinical trials drug data bank; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 468. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to drug safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Access to \nClinical Trials (FACT) Act. I want to begin by thanking Senators \nGrassley, Wyden, Bingaman, Durbin, and Harkin for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation. I also would like to recognize the \nleadership of Senator Johnson who was involved in the crafting of this \nlegislation from the beginning and who has been a long-standing \nsupporter of the FACT Act.\n  Our bill will create an electronic databank for clinical trials of \ndrugs, biological products, and medical devices. Such a databank will \nensure that physicians, researchers, the general public, and patients \nseeking to enroll in clinical trials have access to basic information \nabout those trials. It will require manufacturers and other researchers \nto reveal the results of clinical trials so that clinically important \ninformation will be available to all Americans, and physicians will \nhave all the information necessary to make appropriate treatment \ndecisions for their patients.\n  Events of the past few years have made it clear that such a databank \nis needed. For example, serious questions were raised about the \neffectiveness and safety of antidepressants when used in children and \nyouth. It has now become clear that the existing data indicates that \nthese drugs may very well put children at risk. However, because the \ndata from antidepressant clinical trials was not publicly available, it \ntook years for this risk to be realized. In the meantime, millions of \nchildren have been prescribed antidepressants by well-meaning \nphysicians. While these drugs undoubtedly helped many of these \nchildren, they also led to greater suffering for others.\n  The news is similarly disturbing for a popular class of painkillers \nknown as Cox-2 inhibitors. These medicines, taken by millions of \nAmericans, have been associated with an increased risk of \ncardiovascular adverse events, such as heart attack and stroke. It has \nbeen suggested that one of these medicines, which has since been pulled \nfrom the market, may have been responsible for tens of thousands of \ndeaths.\n  Most recently, a drug manufacturer acknowledged that it did not \ninform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the public about the \nresults of a 67,000 person study it conducted of an FDA-approved drug \nused commonly during heart surgery to reduce the need for a \ntransfusion. The study revealed the drug may increase patients' risk of \ndeath, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure, and stroke.\n  Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of stories that have \nbecome all too common. It has been suggested that negative data might \nactually have been suppressed; and if this is discovered to be the \ncase, those responsible should be dealt with harshly. However, because \nof what is known as ``publication bias,'' the information available to \nthe public and physicians can be misleading even without nefarious \nmotives. The simple fact is that studies with a positive result are far \nmore likely to be published, and thus publicly available, than a study \nwith a negative result. Physicians and patients hear the good news. \nRarely do they hear the bad news. In the end, the imbalance of \navailable information hurts patients.\n  Our bill would correct this imbalance in information, and prevent \nmanufacturers from suppressing negative data. It would do so by \ncreating a two-part databank, consisting of an expansion of \nclinicaltrials.gov--an existing registry that is operated by the \nNational Library of Medicine (NLM)--and a new database for clinical \ntrial results.\n  Under the FACT Act, the registry would continue to operate as a \nresource for patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials for drugs \nand biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening \nconditions--and for the first time, it would also include medical \ndevice trials. The new results database would include all trials \n(except for preliminary safety trials), and would require the \nsubmission of clinical trial results data.\n  Our legislation would enforce the requirement to submit information \nto the databank in two ways. First, by requiring registration as a \ncondition of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, no trial could \nbegin without submitting preliminary information to the registry and \ndatabase. This information would include the purpose of the trial, the \nestimated date of trial completion, as well as all of the information \nnecessary to help patients to enroll in the trial.\n  Once the trial is completed, the researcher or manufacturer is \nrequired to submit the results to the database. If they refuse to do \nso, they are subject to monetary penalties or, in the case of \nfederally-funded research, a restriction on future federal funding. It \nis my belief that these enforcement mechanisms will ensure broad \ncompliance. However, in the rare case where a manufacturer does not \ncomply, this legislation also gives the FDA the authority to publicize \nthe required information.\n  Let me also say that any time you are collecting large amounts of \ndata and making it public, protecting patient privacy and \nconfidentiality is\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nparamount. Our legislation would in no way threaten patient privacy. \nThe simple fact is that under this bill, no individually-identifiable \ninformation would be available to the public.\n  I believe that the establishment of a clinical trials databank is \nabsolutely necessary for the health and well-being of the American \npublic. But I would also like to highlight two other benefits that such \na databank will have. First, it has the potential to reduce health care \ncosts. Studies have shown that publication bias also leads to a bias \ntoward new and more expensive treatment options. A databank could help \nmake it clear that in some cases less expensive treatments are just as \neffective for patients.\n  In addition, a databank will ensure that the sacrifice made by \npatients who enroll in clinical trials is not squandered. We owe it to \npatients to make sure that their participation in a trial will benefit \nother individuals suffering from the same illness or condition by \nmaking the results of the trial public, no matter the outcome of the \ntrial.\n\n  The problems associated with publication bias have recently drawn \nmore attention from the medical community, and there is broad consensus \nthat a clinical trials registry is one of the best ways to address the \nissue. Accordingly, the American Medical Association (AMA) has \nrecommended creating such a databank. Additionally, the major medical \njournals have established a policy that they will only publish the \nresults of trials that were registered in a public database before the \ntrial began. Our legislation meets all of the minimum criteria for a \ntrial registry set out by the International Committee of Medical \nJournal Editors. In fact, our bill closely follows recommendations \nissued by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its recent report on drug \nsafety.\n  To its credit, the pharmaceutical industry has also acknowledged the \nproblem, and has created a database where manufacturers can voluntarily \nsubmit clinical trials data. I applaud this step. However, if our \nobjective is to provide the public with a complete and consistent \nsupply of information, a voluntary database is unlikely to achieve that \ngoal. Some companies will provide information, but others may decide \nnot to participate. We need a clinical trials framework that is not \njust fair to all companies, but provides patients with the peace of \nmind that they will receive complete information about the medicines \nthey rely on.\n  The American drug industry is an extraordinary success story. As a \nresult of the innovations that this industry has spawned, millions of \nlives have been improved and saved in our country and around the globe. \nDue to the importance of these medicines to our health and well-being, \nI have consistently supported sound public policies to help the \nindustry succeed in protecting the public's health and well-being. This \nlegislation aims to build upon the successes of this industry, and help \nensure that the positive changes to our health care system that \nprescription drugs have brought are not undermined by controversies \nsuch as the ones surrounding antidepressants and Cox-2 inhibitors, \nwhich are at least in part based on a lack of public information. This \nbill will help ensure that well-informed patients will use new and \ninnovative medicines.\n  Creating a clinical trials databank is a critical step toward \nensuring the safety of drugs, biological products, and medical devices \nin this country--but it should not be the end of our efforts. However, \nother steps are necessary to fully restore patient confidence in the \nsafety of the medicines they rely on.\n  That is why today I am also introducing the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety Act (FDASA) with Senator Grassley. We are joined \nby Senators Mikulski and Bingaman in introducing this legislation and \nthank them for their support for reforming our nation's system to \nensure that FDA-approved drugs being used by millions are safe and \neffective.\n  Our legislation would enhance the FDA's drug-safety monitoring system \nby setting up an independent center within the FDA called the Center \nfor Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics (CPER). \nThis Center would be responsible for monitoring the safety of drugs and \nbiologics once they are on the market, in consultation with other \nexisting Centers at the FDA, and would have the authority to take \ncorrective action if a drug or biologic presents a risk to patients. \nUnder the bill, the Center Director is authorized to require \nmanufacturers to conduct post-market clinical or observational studies \nif there are questions about the safety or efficacy of a drug or \nbiologic once it is already on the market. The Center Director can take \ncorrective actions to include labeling changes, restricted \ndistribution, and other risk management tools if an unreasonable risk \nis found to exist. The bill also gives the Center Director the \nauthority to review drug advertisements before they are disseminated, \nand to require certain disclosures about increased risk, and in extreme \ncases, the authority to pull the product off the market. Our bill \nauthorizes $500 million over the next 5 years to provide the new center \nwith the resources necessary to carry out the critically important \nprovisions of this legislation.\n  Under our legislation, the Director of CPER will report directly to \nthe FDA Commissioner. Our bill will ensure that CPER consults with the \nother Centers at FDA as it conducts risk assessments, benefiting from \ntheir knowledge and expertise, but not being beholden to them if \ncorrective action is needed.\n  These new authorities will allow the FDA to act quickly to get \nanswers when there are questions about the safety of a drug, and to act \ndecisively to mitigate the risks when the evidence shows that a drug \npresents a safety issue. With these authorities, we will never again \nhave a situation where a critical labeling change takes 2 years to \ncomplete, as was the case with Vioxx. When we are talking about drugs \nthat are already on the market and in widespread use, any delay can put \nmillions of patients in harm's way.\n  By creating CPER we hope to restore confidence in the medicines that \nso many Americans rely on to safeguard their health and well-being. \nPatients should have the peace of mind that the drugs they take to help \nthem will not hurt them instead. We must restore public confidence in \nthe words ``FDA-Approved.'' Unfortunately, events of the past few years \nhave seriously tarnished the FDA's image and put millions of patients \nat undue risk. Recent developments have cast into doubt the FDA's \nability to ensure that the drugs that it approves are safe--especially \nonce they are on the market. These concerns are bad for patients, bad \nfor physicians, and bad for the pharmaceutical industry.\n  Like many Americans, I have been deeply disturbed by the revelations \nof the significant risk associated with widely-used medications to \ntreat pain and depression. These revelations raise legitimate questions \nabout the safety of drugs that have already been approved. It would be \none thing if these drugs were in a trial phase, but safety issues are \nbeing identified in drugs once they are on the market and in widespread \nuse. Health risks significant enough to remove drugs from the market or \nsignificantly restrict their use are becoming clear only after millions \nof Americans have been exposed to real or potential harm.\n  It has been estimated that more than 100,000 Americans might have \nbeen seriously injured or killed by a popular pain medication, while \nmillions of children have been prescribed antidepressants that could \nput them at risk. This recent spate of popular medicines being \nidentified as unsafe underscores the need to take additional steps to \nmonitor and protect patient safety after a drug has been approved. \nAllowing the status quo on drug safety at the FDA is unacceptable. Real \nreform is needed now.\n  An internal study conducted by the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) Office of the Inspector General in 2002 revealed that \napproximately one-fifth of drug reviewers were pressured to approve a \ndrug despite concerns about safety, efficacy, or quality. In addition, \nmore than one-third said they were ``not at all'' or only ``somewhat'' \nconfident that final decisions of the Center for Drug Evaluation and \nResearch (CDER) adequately assessed safety. A more recent survey of 997 \nFDA scientists conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the \nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility found that 420\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nFDA scientists reported that they knew of cases in which HHS or FDA \npolitical appointees inappropriately injected themselves into FDA \ndeterminations or actions.\n  I look forward to working with industry, physicians, medical \njournals, patient groups, and my colleagues--including the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi--to move this legislation forward. \nThese bills have already been endorsed by Consumers Union, the U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group (PIRG), the National Women's Health \nNetwork, and Public Citizen. I thank these organizations for lending \ntheir expertise as we crafted these bills. I also want to recognize the \nNew England Journal of Medicine and the American Psychiatric \nAssociation for their support in the crafting of the FACT Act.\n  Clinical trials are critically important to protecting the safety and \nhealth of the American public. For this reason, clinical trial results \nmust not be treated as information that can be hidden from scrutiny. \nRecent events have made it clear that a clinical trials databank is \nneeded. Patients and physicians agree that such a databank is important \nto our public health. At the same time, there have been disturbing \nreports that suggest the FDA does not place enough emphasis on drug \nsafety, and that concerns raised by those in the Office of Surveillance \nand Epidemiology (formerly the Office of Drug Safety) at CDER are \nsometimes ignored and even suppressed. Our legislation will ensure that \nthose who are responsible for monitoring the safety of drugs already on \nthe market at the FDA will have the independence, resources, and \nauthority to ensure medicines intended to help patients won't instead \nend up causing them harm. I urge my colleagues to support these bills, \nand I am hopeful that they will become law as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American Psychiatric \nAssociation supporting the FACT Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Psychiatric Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 31, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The American Psychiatric Association \n     (APA) would like to commend and congratulate you on your \n     efforts to strengthen and improve clinical trial registries. \n     The FACT Act's goals of revamping the Food and Drug \n     Administration's post-marketing surveillance by ensuring that \n     access to clinical trials information is accessible and \n     available to the scientific community and the general public \n     is a goal shared by the APA.\n       The APA is the national medical specialty society \n     representing more than 37,000 psychiatric physicians \n     nationwide who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of \n     mental and emotional illnesses and substance use disorders. \n     APA advocates for patient access to information and supports \n     further post-market research of medications to ensure the \n     safety of patients. APA member David Fassler, M.D. testified \n     before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n     Committee on March 1, 2005 and subsequent FDA Advisory \n     Committee meetings. Dr. Fassler's testimony focused on key \n     recommendations to improve the FDA's drug approval process \n     outlining: The importance of access to comprehensive clinical \n     trial data including negative trials and unpublished results \n     to be housed in a publicly accessible registry; The need for \n     ongoing post-marketing surveillance with increased funding \n     for follow up; and The necessity of a workforce of \n     researchers, including experts who can assist with the \n     design, oversight, interpretation and reporting of clinical \n     research.\n       The APA thanks you again for your dedication and commitment \n     to enhance the nation's drug safety monitoring system. We \n     look forward to working with you in ensuring that clinical \n     trial data is transparent and accountable in order for \n     patients to make well informed decisions.

Madam President, I am pleased to have bipartisan \nsponsorship of two very important bills with Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut that are being introduced today, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety Act of 2007 and the Fair Access to Clinical \nTrials Act of 2007.\n  These bills are part of a sustained effort to restore public \nconfidence in the Federal Government's food and drug safety program and \nto make sure the agency does all it can to protect the public.\n  Enactment of those two bills would provide doctors and patients with \nmore information about the risks and benefits of their medicines and \nbring about greater transparency and accountability of the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  I am sure my colleagues realize I have been involved in oversight of \nthe Food and Drug Administration for now at least 3 years, and it has \nbeen in response to concerns about the reluctance of the Food and Drug \nAdministration to provide information to the public about the increased \nsuicide risks for young people taking antidepressants.\n  In November 2004, I chaired a groundbreaking hearing on drug safety \ninvolving the Food and Drug Administration and the drug Vioxx. That \nhearing and other critical drug safety concerns that have come to light \nsince then highlight the need for comprehensive and systematic reforms \nas well as more stringent oversight of the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Over the past 3 years, it has become increasingly apparent that the \nFood and Drug Administration has repeatedly failed to protect the \npublic from an industry that focuses all too often on profits, even \nwhen those profits come at the expense of ``John Q. Public.''\n  In 2005, then, and because of this, Senator Dodd and I introduced \nalmost identical companion bills to advance serious reforms at the Food \nand Drug Administration. In the 2 years following the introduction of \nthose bills, however, the Food and Drug Administration failed to take \ncomprehensive and systematic steps toward restoring public confidence \nin that agency, as well as the necessity of strengthening public \nsafety.\n  Yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration released its response to \nthe Institute of Medicine's 2006 report on drug safety. The two safety \nbills introduced today are not intended to supplant the plans \narticulated in the Food and Drug Administration's response but, rather, \nto augment those plans and to provide the FDA with additional \nenforcement tools, something they now lack.\n  In fact, one of our bills is intended to specifically address a \nserious problem that was also identified by the Institute of Medicine. \nDr. Alta Charo, a member of the Institute of Medicine committee that \nwrote the report on drug safety, stated in the newspaper USA Today:\n\n       I have to confess I'm disappointed that they--\n\n  Meaning the FDA--\n\n     ignored one of our most critical recommendations.\n\n  According to the USA Today article, she was referring to the \nInstitute of Medicine's recommendation that the Food and Drug \nAdministration give more clout to the office that monitors drugs after \nthey go to market. I want you to know I agree with Dr. Charo.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2007 would then \nestablish an independent center within the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The name of the center would be the Center for \nPostmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics. The \ndirector of this center would report directly to the Food and Drug \nAdministration Commissioner and would be responsible for conducting \nrisk assessments for approved drugs and biological products.\n  The new center would also be responsible for ensuring the safety and \neffectiveness of drugs once they are on the market. Unfortunately, the \nproblem we are trying to solve is that now at the FDA, the office that \nreviews drug safety postmarketing is a mere consultant and under the \nthumb of the office that puts the drugs on the market in the first \nplace.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that those who speak out of line are \ntargeted. Whistleblowers, as we call them, are targeted. They are very \nhelpful to Congress in ferreting out wrongdoing, that laws are not \nbeing faithfully executed, that money is not being spent according to \ncongressional intent. So they speak out at the FDA and point out a lot \nof things that are wrong. And what do they get for it? They are treated \nlike a skunk at a picnic. They are targeted.\n  So this legislation we put before us would provide the new center \nwith the independence and authority to promptly identify serious safety \nrisks and take necessary actions to protect the public, and I hope \neliminate some of the intimidation against whistleblowers.\n  At the same time, the intra-agency communication is essential in \naddressing drug safety. So this legislation would encourage \ncommunication between the center and other centers and offices, or \nlet's say subagencies at the Food and Drug Administration that handle \ndrugs and biological products, to do what is best for the consumer and \nnot have big PhRMA having undue influence.\n  The second bill we are introducing would expand an existing Web site, \nwww.clinicaltrials.gov, to create a publicly accessible national \ndatabank of clinical trial information. The databank would be comprised \nof a clinical trial registry and a clinical trial results database of \nall publicly and privately funded clinical trials so that everything is \nout there for the public to consider, not letting somebody choose: \nWell, if this is a little negative toward our drug, we will not make \nthat public. All the positive stuff, of course, we will make public.\n  So I think this legislation is going to foster transparency. But it \nis going to bring about a great deal of accountability in health \nresearch and development and ensure that the scientific community and, \nmost importantly, the general public whom we are trying to protect have \naccess to basic information about clinical trials, about new drugs \ngoing out on the market.\n  The legislation would also create an environment that would encourage \ncompanies from withholding clinically important information about their \nproducts from the Food and Drug Administration and from the public.\n  By the way, the information that is coming out now about Vioxx in the \nnewspapers today will even tell you that a long time before Vioxx went \non the market there were scientists within the company who were raising \nquestions about whether it was going to cause harm to the heart. All of \nthis information should be out there. The public ought to know it. Your \ndoctor ought to know it. Transparency and accountability should not \nhurt anybody in an open society such as we have in\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nAmerica. Oh, there might be some legitimate reasons for intellectual \nproperty privacy, but nothing beyond that.\n  If we have learned anything over the last few years, it is that the \nFood and Drug Administration is a troubled agency that lost sight of \nits fundamental function. That fundamental function is to protect the \nsafety and the efficacy of new prescription drugs.\n  Two very important things for them to answer: Are the drugs safe for \nyou? Are they effective?\n  Unfortunately, the public has good reason to doubt the Food and Drug \nAdministration's ability to do its job. And experts from all over the \ncountry have expressed concern. These two bills, then, that Senator \nDodd and I are introducing--and let me parenthetically say for the \npublic, people are always thinking that Democrats are hitting on \nRepublicans and Republicans are hitting on Democrats. There is a lot \ngoing on around here you never see on evening television that is \nbipartisan because there is not controversy about it, or at least there \nis no controversy between Republicans and Democrats. But what they want \nto put in the news media every night is when some Republican is \nfighting some Democrat. So our constituents get a view about this \nCongress that is very distorted.\n  I would like to have people read on a regular basis about how Senator \nBaucus and I meet on a regular basis to determine the agenda for the \nFinance Committee. I would like to have them read about how he and I \nhave put out bipartisan bills for the last 6 years--whether he was \nchairman or I was chairman--and that every one of them got to the \nPresident to be signed. But you do not hear those things.\n  So I want to emphasize, this is a Dodd--and Senator Dodd is a \nDemocrat from Connecticut--and a Grassley bill--and Grassley is a \nRepublican Senator from Iowa. So this bill is being introduced to \nensure the safety and efficacy of new prescription drugs, not to do \nsomething new for the FDA, just to give them the tools to do what they \nhave had a responsibility to do for several decades.\n  So the public has doubts about the FDA's ability to do it. These two \nbills will help put the FDA back on the path to fulfilling its mission \nand, most importantly, put the American consumer first.\n  So, Madam President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that my \nstatement in the Record that I give today be coupled with the statement \nof Senator Dodd, which will be given later today, regarding the \nintroduction of these important bills.\n  By giving me this unanimous consent, it will assure the public, when \nthey read about these bills, knows that Dodd is a Democrat, Grassley is \na Republican, and they are bipartisan bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the special rule for contributions of qualified conservation \ncontributions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nHeritage Conservation Extension Act of 2007, along with my good friend \nSenator Grassley from Iowa.\n  As we all know, the country, and my home State of Montana, are losing \nprecious agricultural and ranch lands at a record pace. While providing \nMontana and the Nation with the highest quality food and fiber, these \nfarms and ranches also provide habitat for wildlife and the open \nspaces, land that many of us take for granted and assume will always be \nthere. Montana has begun to recognize the importance of these lands. We \ncurrently have 1,573,411 acres covered by conservation easements. To \nsome, that may seem like a large amount, but this is Montana, a State \nthat covers 93,583,532 acres, making the conservation easements \ncoverage a mere 1.68 percent of all of our lands.\n  To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future \ngenerations, we must help our hardworking farmers and ranchers preserve \nthis precious heritage and their way-of-life.\n  Conservation easements have been tremendously successful in \npreserving open space and wildlife habitat. Last year, the Congress \nrecognized this by providing targeted income tax relief to small \nfarmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a \nqualified conservation easement. The provision allows eligible farmers \nand ranchers to increase the amounts of deduction that may be taken \ncurrently for charitable contributions of qualified conservation \neasements by raising the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitations to 100 \npercent and extending the carryover period from 5 years to 15 years. In \nthe case of all landowners, the AGI limitation would be raised from 30 \npercent to 50 percent.\n  The Rural Heritage Conservation Extension Act of 2007 would make this \nallowable deduction permanent, building on the success of conservation \neasements. Our farmers and ranchers will be able to preserve their \nimportant agricultural and ranching lands for future generations, while \ncontinuing to operate their businesses. Landowners, conservationists, \nthe Federal Government, and local communities are working together to \npreserve our precious natural resources.\n  This legislation is vitally important to Montana, and to every other \nState in the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Illinois \nState University, ISU, as it marks its 150th year of providing an \noutstanding college education to students in the State of Illinois.\n  Illinois State University commemorates its 150th anniversary this \nyear with a year-long celebration that begins with Founders Day on \nFebruary 15, 2007. ISU was founded as Bloomington-Normal in 1857. The \nschool was Illinois's first public university and is one of the oldest \ninstitutions of higher education in the Midwest. Abraham Lincoln \nhimself drew up the legal papers to establish the University, which has \ngrown from a small teachers' college to a premiere liberal arts \nuniversity. The University now serves more than 20,000 talented \nundergraduate and graduate students from across the country and from 88 \nnations.\n  For 150 years, Illinois State University has prided itself on \nproviding a high quality education at a cost within the reach of most \nstudents. In fact, ISU is ranked nationally as one of the 100 ``best \nvalues'' in public higher education, according to Kiplinger magazine. \nISU students can choose the program that best fits their academic needs \nfrom among 63 undergraduate programs in more than 160 fields of study. \nIn particular, I commend Illinois State for its successful College of \nEducation, which continues the University's long tradition of educating \nteachers. ISU is one of the 10 largest producers of teachers in the \nNation. In fact, nearly 1 in 7 Illinois teachers holds a degree from \nISU. By educating future teachers, Illinois State University has played \nan invaluable role in shaping the education of Illinois children.\n  Illinois State hosts a large and successful athletics program. During \nthe past 23 years, the ISU Redbirds have won 125 league titles in 19 \nintercollegiate sports. Redbird competitors have gone on to be \nprofessional athletes, Olympians, and World Series Champions, as in the \ncase of pitcher Neal Cotts, an ISU alumnus and member of the 2005 World \nChampion Chicago White Sox team.\n  Students at Illinois State are encouraged to embrace the University's \nmotto, ``Gladly we Learn and Teach,'' both in and outside the \nclassroom. Many students choose to take part in public service and \noutreach programs that provide learning and service experiences beyond \nthe classroom. ISU also participates in the American Democracy Project, \nan initiative that prepares students to be engaged in a competitive \nglobal society.\n  Illinois State University has proven itself to be a tremendous asset \nto the students and citizens of Illinois for the past 150 years. I \ncongratulate the University on its 150th anniversary, and I look \nforward to many more years of excellence in education and academic \nadvancement in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1458-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1458-S1459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 54--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                 HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\n                               S.

Res. 61\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a long-standing tradition with modern \n     applications in which an adult provides guidance, support, \n     and encouragement to help with a young person's social, \n     emotional, and cognitive development;\n       Whereas research provides strong evidence that mentoring \n     can promote positive outcomes for young people, such as an \n     increased sense of industry and competency, a boost in \n     academic performance and self-esteem, and improved social and \n     communications skills;\n       Whereas studies of mentoring further show that a quality \n     mentoring relationship successfully reduces the incidence of \n     risky behaviors, delinquency, absenteeism, and academic \n     failure;\n       Whereas mentoring is a frequently used term and a well-\n     accepted practice in many sectors of our society;\n       Whereas thanks to the remarkable creativity, vigor, and \n     resourcefulness of the thousands of mentoring programs and \n     millions of volunteer mentors in communities throughout the \n     Nation, quality mentoring has grown dramatically in the past \n     15 years, and there are now 3,000,000 young people in the \n     United States who are being mentored;\n       Whereas in spite of the strides made in the mentoring \n     field, the Nation has a serious ``mentoring gap,'' with \n     nearly 15,000,000 young people currently in need of mentors;\n       Whereas a recent study confirmed that one of the most \n     critical challenges that mentoring programs face is \n     recruiting enough mentors to help close the mentoring gap;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2007 as National \n     Mentoring Month will help call attention to the critical role \n     mentors play in helping young people realize their potential;\n       Whereas the month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more organizations across the Nation, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations and faith \n     institutions, foundations, and individuals to become engaged \n     in mentoring;\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most importantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and encourage more individuals \n     to become mentors, helping close the Nation's mentoring gap; \n     and\n       Whereas the President has issued a proclamation declaring \n     January 2007 to be National Mentoring Month and calling on \n     the people of the United States to recognize the importance \n     of mentoring, to look for opportunities to serve as mentors \n     in their communities, and to observe the month with \n     appropriate activities and programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2007 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults who are already serving as mentors \n     and encourages more adults to volunteer as mentors; and\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that \n     promote awareness of, and volunteer involvement with, youth \n     mentoring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1463-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 62--RECOGNIZING THE GOALS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK \n  AND HONORING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 62\n\n       Whereas Catholic schools in the United States have received \n     international acclaim for academic excellence while providing \n     students with lessons that extend far beyond the classroom;\n       Whereas Catholic schools present a broad curriculum that \n     emphasizes the lifelong development of moral, intellectual, \n     physical, and social values in the young people of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Catholic schools in the United States today educate \n     2,363,220 students and maintain a student-to-teacher ratio of \n     15 to 1;\n       Whereas the faculty members of Catholic schools teach a \n     highly diverse body of students;\n       Whereas the graduation rate for all Catholic school \n     students is 95 percent;\n       Whereas 83 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on \n     to college;\n       Whereas Catholic schools produce students strongly \n     dedicated to their faith, values, families, and communities \n     by providing an intellectually stimulating environment rich \n     in spiritual character and moral development; and\n       Whereas in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic \n     education, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops \n     stated, ``Education is one of the most important ways by \n     which the Church fulfills its commitment to the dignity of \n     the person and building of community. Community is central to \n     education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an \n     ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, \n     therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; \n     for the education of the individual Christian is important \n     not only to his solitary destiny, but also the destinies of \n     the many communities in which he lives.'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the goals of Catholic Schools Week, an event \n     cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational Association \n     and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that \n     recognizes the vital contributions of thousands of Catholic \n     elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and\n       (2) commends Catholic schools, students, parents, and \n     teachers across the United States for their ongoing \n     contributions to education, and for the vital role they play \n     in promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1463-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 63--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                        RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non Rules and Administration; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                               S.

Res. 6\n\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson, \n     Wyoming, is devoted to inspiring global recognition of fine \n     art related to nature and wildlife;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art is an excellent \n     example of a thematic museum that strives to unify the \n     humanities and sciences into a coherent body of knowledge \n     through art;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art, which was \n     founded in 1987 with a private gift of a collection of art, \n     has grown in stature and importance and is recognized today \n     as the world's premier museum of wildlife art;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art is the only \n     public museum in the United States with the mission of \n     enriching and inspiring public appreciation and knowledge of \n     fine art, while exploring the relationship between humanity \n     and nature by collecting fine art focused on wildlife;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art is housed in an \n     architecturally significant and award-winning 51,000-square \n     foot facility that overlooks the 28,000-acre National Elk \n     Refuge and is adjacent to the Grand Teton National Park;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art is accredited \n     with the American Association of Museums, continues to grow \n     in national recognition and importance with members from \n     every State, and has a Board of Trustees and a National \n     Advisory Board composed of major benefactors and leaders in \n     the arts and sciences from throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the permanent collection of the National Museum of \n     Wildlife Art has grown to more than 3,000 works by important \n     historic American artists including Edward Hicks, Anna Hyatt \n     Huntington, Charles M. Russell, William Merritt Chase, and \n     Alexander Calder, and contemporary American artists, \n     including Steve Kestrel, Bart Walter, Nancy Howe, John Nieto, \n     and Jamie Wyeth;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art is a \n     destination attraction in the Western United States with \n     annual attendance of 92,000 visitors from all over the world \n     and an award-winning website that receives more than 10,000 \n     visits per week;\n       Whereas the National Museum of Wildlife Art seeks to \n     educate a diverse audience through collecting fine art \n     focused on wildlife, presenting exceptional exhibitions, \n     providing community, regional, national, and international \n     outreach, and presenting extensive educational programming \n     for adults and children; and\n       Whereas a great opportunity exists to use the invaluable \n     resources of the National Museum of Wildlife Art to teach the \n     schoolchildren of the United States, through onsite visits, \n     traveling exhibits, classroom curriculum, online distance \n     learning, and other educational initiatives: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     National Museum of Wildlife Art, located at 2820 Rungius \n     Road, Jackson, Wyoming, should be designated as the \n     ``National Museum of Wildlife Art of the United States''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1464-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1464-S1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 7--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON \n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nLevin, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas, we respect the Constitutional authorities given a \n     President in Article II, Section 2, which states that ``The \n     President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of \n     the United States;'' it is not the intent of this resolution \n     to question or contravene such authority, but to accept the \n     offer to Congress made by the President on January 10, 2007 \n     that, ``if members have improvements that can be made, we \n     will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust;''\n       Whereas, the United States' strategy and operations in Iraq \n     can only be sustained and achieved with support from the \n     American people and with a level of bipartisanship;\n       Whereas, over 137,000 American military personnel are \n     current1y serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since \n     March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent \n     with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, \n     and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they \n     have strongly;\n       Whereas, many American service personnel have lost their \n     lives, and many more have.been wounded, in Iraq, and the \n     American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor \n     their families;\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their \n     Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with \n     components of the other branches of the military, are under \n     enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq \n     and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, these deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, retention \n     and readiness of our nation's all volunteer force;\n       Whereas in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2006, the Congress stated that ``calendar year \n     2006 should be a period of significant transition to full \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq;''\n       Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, \n     approved November 28, 2006, ``determin[ed] that the situation \n     in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international \n     peace and security;''\n       Whereas, Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating and ever-\n     widening problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian violence \n     based upon political distrust and cultural differences \n     between some Sunni and Shia Muslims;\n       Whereas, Iraqis must reach political settlements in order \n     to achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas, the responsibility for Iraq's internal security \n     and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces;\n       Whereas, U.S. Central Command Commander General John \n     Abizaid testified to Congress on November 15, 2006, ``I met \n     with every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     Commander, [and] General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future;''\n       Whereas, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006 that ``The crisis is political, and the \n     ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting \n     of innocents are the politicians;''\n       Whereas, there is growing evidence that Iraqi public \n     sentiment opposes the continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq, \n     much less increasing the troop level;\n       Whereas, in the fall of 2006, leaders in the Administration \n     and Congress, as well as recognized experts in the private \n     sector, began to express concern that the situation in Iraq \n     was deteriorating and required a change in strategy; and, as \n     a consequence, the Administration began an intensive, \n     comprehensive review by all components of the Executive \n     Branch to devise a new strategy;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly;''\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, following consultations with \n     the Iraqi Prime Minister, the President announced a new \n     strategy (hereinafter referred to as the ``plan''), which \n     consists of three basic elements: diplomatic, economic, and \n     military; the central component of the military element is an \n     augmentation of the present level of the U.S. military forces \n     through additional deployments of approximately 21,500 US. \n     military troops to Iraq;\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, the President said that the \n     ``Iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two \n     deputy commanders for their capital'' and that U.S. forces \n     will ``be embedded in their formations;'' and in subsequent \n     testimony before the Armed Services Committee on January 25, \n     2007, by the retired former Vice Chief of the Army it was \n     learned that there will also be a comparable US. command in \n     Baghdad, and that this dual chain of command may be \n     problematic because ``the Iraqis are going to be able to move \n     their forces around at times where we will disagree with that \n     movement,'' and called for clarification;\n       Whereas, this proposed level of troop augmentation far \n     exceeds the expectations of many of us as to the \n     reinforcements that would be necessary to implement the \n     various options for a new strategy, and led many members of \n     Congress to express outright opposition to augmenting our \n     troops by 21,500;\n       Whereas, the Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to \n     assume a greater share of security responsibilities, disband \n     militias, consider Constitutional amendments and enact laws \n     to reconcile sectarian differences, and improve the quality \n     of essential services for the Iraqi people; yet, despite \n     those promises, little has been achieved;\n       Whereas, the President said on January 10, 2007 that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not openended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       Whereas, the recommendations in this resolution should not \n     be interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in, \n     or withdrawal of, the present level of forces: Now therefore \n     be it--\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Senate disagrees with the ``plan'' to augment our \n     forces by 21,500, and urges the President instead to consider \n     all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic \n     goals set forth below;\n       (2) the Senate believes the United States should continue \n     vigorous operations in\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\n     Anbar province, specifically for the purpose of combating an \n     insurgency, including elements associated with the Al Qaeda \n     movement, and denying terrorists a safe haven;\n       (3) the Senate believes a failed state in Iraq would \n     present a threat to regional and world peace, and the long-\n     term security interests of the United States are best served \n     by an Iraq that can sustain, govern, and defend itself, and \n     serve as an ally in the war against extremists;\n       (4) the Congress should not take any action that will \n     endanger United States military forces in the field, \n     including the elimination or reduction of funds for troops in \n     the field, as such an action with respect to funding would \n     undermine their safety or harm their effectiveness in \n     pursuing their assigned missions;\n       (5) the primary objective of the overall U.S. strategy in \n     Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \n     compromises that will foster reconciliation and strengthen \n     the unity government, ultimately leading to improvements in \n     the security situation;\n       (6) the military part of this strategy should focus on \n     maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying \n     international terrorists a safe haven, conducting \n     counterterrorism operations, promoting regional stability, \n     supporting Iraqi efforts to bring greater security to \n     Baghdad, and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take full \n     responsibility for their own security;\n       (7) United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals, and should charge the \n     Iraqi military with the primary mission of combating \n     sectarian violence;\n       (8) the military Rules of Engagement for this plan should \n     reflect this delineation of responsibilities, and the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff should clarify the command and control arrangements in \n     Baghdad;\n       (9) the United States Government should transfer to the \n     Iraqi military, in an expeditious manner, such equipment as \n     is necessary;\n       (10) the United States Government should engage selected \n     nations in the Middle East to develop a regional, \n     internationally sponsored peace-and-reconciliation process \n     for Iraq;\n       (11) the Administration should provide regular updates to \n     the Congress, produced by the Commander of United States \n     Central Command and his subordinate commanders, about the \n     progress or lack of progress the Iraqis are making toward \n     this end.\n       (12) our overall military, diplomatic and economic strategy \n     should not be regarded as an ``open-ended'' or unconditional \n     commitment, but rather as a new strategy that hereafter \n     should be conditioned upon the Iraqi government's meeting \n     benchmarks that must be delineated in writing and agreed to \n     by the Iraqi Prime Minister. Such benchmarks should include, \n     but not be limited to, the deployment of that number of \n     additional Iraqi security forces as specified in the plan in \n     Baghdad, ensuring equitable distribution of the resources of \n     the Government of Iraq without regard to the sect or \n     ethnicity of recipients, enacting and implementing \n     legislation to ensure that the oil resources of Iraq benefit \n     Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in \n     an equitable manner, and the authority of Iraqi commanders to \n     make tactical.and operational decisions without political \n     intervention:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1465-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1465-S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 61\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a long-standing tradition with modern \n     applications in which an adult provides guidance, support, \n     and encouragement to help with a young person's social, \n     emotional, and cognitive development;\n       Whereas research provides strong evidence that mentoring \n     can promote positive outcomes for young people, such as an \n     increased sense of industry and competency, a boost in \n     academic performance and self-esteem, and improved social and \n     communications skills;\n       Whereas studies of mentoring further show that a quality \n     mentoring relationship successfully reduces the incidence of \n     risky behaviors, delinquency, absenteeism, and academic \n     failure;\n       Whereas mentoring is a frequently used term and a well-\n     accepted practice in many sectors of our society;\n       Whereas thanks to the remarkable creativity, vigor, and \n     resourcefulness of the thousands of mentoring programs and \n     millions of volunteer mentors in communities throughout the \n     Nation, quality mentoring has grown dramatically in the past \n     15 years, and there are now 3,000,000 young people in the \n     United States who are being mentored;\n       Whereas in spite of the strides made in the mentoring \n     field, the Nation has a serious ``mentoring gap,'' with \n     nearly 15,000,000 young people currently in need of mentors;\n       Whereas a recent study confirmed that one of the most \n     critical challenges that mentoring programs face is \n     recruiting enough mentors to help close the mentoring gap;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2007 as National \n     Mentoring Month will help call attention to the critical role \n     mentors play in helping young people realize their potential;\n       Whereas the month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more organizations across the Nation, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations and faith \n     institutions, foundations, and individuals to become engaged \n     in mentoring;\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most importantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and encourage more individuals \n     to become mentors, helping close the Nation's mentoring gap; \n     and\n       Whereas the President has issued a proclamation declaring \n     January 2007 to be National Mentoring Month and calling on \n     the people of the United States to recognize the importance \n     of mentoring, to look for opportunities to serve as mentors \n     in their communities, and to observe the month with \n     appropriate activities and programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2007 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults who are already serving as mentors \n     and encourages more adults to volunteer as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that \n     promote awareness of, and volunteer involvement with, youth \n     mentoring.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1467-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n                         CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.

Community is central to \n     education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an \n     ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, \n     therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; \n     for the education of the individual Christian is important \n     not only to his solitary destiny, but also the destinies of \n     the many communities in which he lives.'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the goals of Catholic Schools Week, an event \n     cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational Association \n     and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that \n     recognizes the vital contributions of thousands of Catholic \n     elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and\n       (2) commends Catholic schools, students, parents, and \n     teachers across the United States for their ongoing \n     contributions to education, and for the vital role they play \n     in promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1467-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.J.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come \nbefore the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of Senator Snowe of Maine, the Senate stand adjourned under the \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I want to speak \nbriefly to the resolution that has been introduced by our most \nrespected Member of the Senate, Senator Warner, regarding Iraq.\n  I first ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. For the record, I know the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Michigan have had numerous conversations. The proposed \nchanges in the resolution that was introduced this evening by the \nSenator from Virginia certainly reflect many of the concerns of those \nof us who are the cosponsors of the Biden-Hagel-Levin resolution \nregarding the troop surge. The changes in the proposed resolution now \nreinforce the opposition to troop increases. It does enhance the \nposition. It solidifies the unified view of those of us who have \nadopted a position in opposition to the troop surge. It also helps to \nadvance this debate. Now we can begin on a course of deliberation \nwithin the Senate.\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\n  I join the concerns of Senator Warner and our Republican leader that \nwe should proceed in consideration of a resolution and not proceed out \nof order on the Warner resolution. It was introduced as a resolution. \nIt should be debated and voted upon as a resolution here in the Senate. \nI am pleased, because I think it does unite us now that we have had \nthese types of changes that I think go a long way to making a strong \nstatement with respect to the President's proposed strategy of \nincreasing troops in Iraq.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for offering this resolution as \nmodified so we can proceed and embark on the deliberations that not \nonly consistently are the traditions of this institution but also are \nconsistent with the views of the people of this country that this \nissue, which is the preeminent one of our time, deserves a full and \nopen debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague from Maine. I share \nher views, as I expressed them with our leader here, that it was \ncertainly always the intention of the Senator from Virginia that this \nmatter should be kept in a resolution status, thereby precluding any \nnecessity for the President to become involved in the sense of a \nlegislative process. I feel confident that what we have put forth are \nrecommendations--not orders to the President, not contravening the \nPresident's constitutional authority in any way, but they are the \nheartfelt thoughts of Senators as to how there could be further \nmodifications in the new strategy in such a way as to hopefully lower \nthe profile of the United States Armed Forces in the Baghdad operation \nand, thereby, hopefully, wherever possible, not inject them into this \nsectarian violence which can be better handled by the Iraqis, who \nunderstand the Iraqis, who have a far better understanding of the \ncultural differences that give rise to so much of this sectarian strife \ntoday. I am optimistic that can come to pass and we can treat this in \nthe resolution status and that Senators can work their free will. There \nmay be ideas far better than what I have embraced in this resolution, \ntogether with my colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Ben Nelson. We \nare open to ideas. It is best that those ideas be exhibited right here \non the Senate floor in full view of all to determine their merit.\n  I thank my colleague. I am honored the Senator sees fit to join us as \na cosponsor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from \nVirginia, because I do think this resolution reinforces the position of \nthose of us who oppose the troop surge. I couldn't agree with the \nSenator more about the concerns we have involving the sectarian strife, \nparticularly at a time in which the Iraqi Government has not \ndemonstrated the political resoluteness to confront its own militias, \nto disarm and demobilize them, to proceed with a political process that \nwould advance in unifying the country. That is long overdue. The time \nhas come for the Iraqi Government and its people to step up and assume \nthose responsibilities. That is why I had for the last few months the \ndeep concern about the increase in the level of troops at a time in \nwhich sectarian strife has enveloped the country.\n  It is time for the Iraqi Government, the Iraqi Army to begin to \nproceed to take responsibility for the internal problems that are \ndeveloping. We obviously should move in a different direction and place \nthe pressure on them to do what is right.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague. I also note the Senator from Maine \nwas present on the floor in the course of the colloquy between the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, and our distinguished \nleader, Mr. McConnell. I think they are both working toward trying to \nfind the basis on which this matter can be treated as a resolution, \nwhich has been my desire from the first. I believe the Senator shares \nthat view very strongly.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Absolutely. And I have indicated that concern about \nintroducing this resolution in the form of a bill. I also understand \nthat at some point that bill would obviously be converted to a \nresolution. But I think we should proceed in regular order and have a \nfull and open debate, as the Senator from Virginia has recommended. I \nthink that is consistent with the traditions and practices of the \nSenate. And certainly this issue is deserving of open debate for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I am glad she, once again, pointed \nout that if it were to go into bill status, there is a point in time \nwhen I--and I presume you would join me--and others would move to try \nand have that bill status once again returned to the resolution status \nbefore any final action on this or other measures that may come before \nthe Senate in this debate. Senator McConnell all along to all his \ncolleagues has said, me included, that he wanted to try to provide an \nopportunity for as many viewpoints to be heard, either by resolution or \nby amendment, as possible.\n  I also note the Presiding Officer was an original cosponsor on the \nresolution that I and Senator Nelson and Senator Collins put forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/31/senate-section/article/S1468-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
