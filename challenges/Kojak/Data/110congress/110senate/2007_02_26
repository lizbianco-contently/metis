Pursuant to the order of the Senate \nof January 24, 1901, as modified on February 5, 2007, the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Corker, having been appointed by the Vice President, \nshall now read Washington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am thankful for this opportunity. It is \nquite an honor, something from which many Americans can draw a great \ndeal of wisdom. I will begin this great Farewell Address that has been \nour custom now for many years.\n  Mr. CORKER, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n  To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nthat retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength \nof my inclination to do this, previous to the last election, had even \nled to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature \nreflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs \nwith foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to \nmy confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\ndanger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; \nand, what is of inestimable value! they must derive from union an \nexemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so \nfrequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same \ngovernment, which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to \nproduce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and \nintrigues would stimulate and embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid \nthe necessity of those overgrown military establishments, which under \nany form of government are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be \nregarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense \nit is, that your Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your \nliberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the \npreservation of the other.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\nto seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; \nand, sooner or later, the chief of some prevailing faction, more able \nor more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the \npurpose of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\ninto a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without \nadequate inducements or justifications. It leads also to concessions, \nto the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt \ndoubly to injure the nation making the concessions, by unnecessarily \nparting with what ought to have been retained and by exciting \njealously, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from \nwhom equal privileges are withheld. And it gives to ambitious, \ncorrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite \nnation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own \ncountry, without odium, sometimes even with popularity gilding with the \nappearances of virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference \nfor public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or \nfoolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\nit probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may \nbe, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to \nwhich they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my \ncountry will never cease to view them with indulgence and that, after \nforty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright \nzeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to \noblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Mr. President, as I listened this last week to media \nreports about a reported plan by Senate Democrats to deauthorize the \nIraq war resolution, my first reaction was that they cannot be serious; \nthey cannot want to have Senators managing the war on terror from the \nfloor of the Senate. We would be telling our commanders and our troops \nhow to do their jobs.\n  Under the latest Democratic proposal--which, incidentally, is now the \nfifth resolution that they have brought forward--that was unveiled last \nweek, there would be no combat role for our troops in Iraq. Yet we \nwould still allegedly have some number of troops there for training, \nsupport, and logistics.\n  I think the question you have to ask with a policy such as that is, \nWhat if those troops are fired upon? Can they not return fire because \nthe Senate says they are not to have a combat role?\n  Just when I thought this debate had reached the low point on the \ndepth chart, the Senate Democrats have drained a little more out of the \npool. For weeks now, they have been attacking Republicans for blocking \na debate on Iraq when nothing could be further from the truth. \nRepublicans welcome a debate about Iraq. The only difference is we \nbelieve it should be a full, fair, and open debate. The Democratic \nleaders tried to prevent that by blocking any Republican amendments. \nThe Democrats want a rigged, one-sided debate that has nothing to do \nwith substance and everything to do with political theater. That is \nwrong, and it is wrong for a couple of reasons.\n  Firstly, it is wrong because it undermines the unique role our \nFounders designed for the Senate, a place where debate is welcome, a \nplace that is deliberative, and a place where the power to amend is \nrecognized. Under the Democrats' rigged approach, only their proposal \ngets heard. Republicans asked for just one alternative, one amendment, \nand it was rejected by the Democratic leadership. Now, I would ask, \nwhere is the fairness in that? Where is the openness in that?\n  Secondly, and more importantly, it is wrong because it sends entirely \nthe wrong message to our troops and to our enemies. Our troops need to \nknow that they are supported and that their mission is supported. Our \nenemies need to know we are serious about winning. The action taken by \nSenate Democrats on this issue has trivialized this very serious \ndebate, and I believe we owe it to those who have sacrificed so much, \nand to their families, to give this new strategy a chance to succeed.\n  I visited a number of soldiers last week at Walter Reed Hospital. I \nthink that is my fourth trip up there. I have also had the opportunity \nto visit with soldiers injured on the battlefield at the hospital in \nLandstuhl, Germany, at Ramstein Air Force Base. These are men who have \nlost limbs due to IEDs and EFPs. They are an amazing group of people, \nan amazing inspiration, and they want to know their sacrifice has not \nbeen in vain.\n  This strategy which has been proposed is a change. It originated with \nour commanders, and it is supported by our commanders. It calls for \nseveral things. It calls for some additional troop strength in the \nregion, primarily in Baghdad and also some out in Anbar Province. It \ncalls for different rules of engagement in that fight, and it calls for \nmore Iraqi involvement in several different ways:\n  Militarily. It gets the Iraqis more into the fight. They take the \nlead, and the United States takes more of a support role.\n  Economically. There are requirements that the Iraqi Government invest \nin infrastructure in their country and that they come up with a way of \ndividing the oil revenues so that all the different locations in the \ncountry can benefit from this great resource they have available to \nthem.\n  It puts in place political benchmarks as well. They need to hold \nprovincial elections.\n  All these things--military, economic, and political benchmarks--are \nthings the Iraqis have to meet. I believe we will know in a matter of \nmonths whether this new strategy is working. I want it to work. I want \nto see our troops succeed, and so do most Americans.\n  A nonbinding resolution signaling a lack of support was bad enough, \nbut now the Democrats in Congress have taken what in my view is a far \nmore dangerous turn. They have embarked on a course which is binding, \nwhich has the force of law, and which would have Congress managing a \nwar. That is a very frightening prospect, but that is exactly what this \nlatest Democratic proposal would do.\n  In fact, listen to what was said yesterday by the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee. He was asked on ``Meet the Press'' by Tim \nRussert about how many troops would be left behind under their \nproposal, and he said a limited number. Mr. Russert said: 10,000, \n20,000? The distinguished Senator, chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, said:\n\n       I don't want to put a specific number on it because that \n     really should be left to the commanders, who decide how many \n     would be needed to carry out those limited functions.\n\n  I am glad there is going to be some role for General Petraeus. I am \nglad he will be deciding some things in the theater over there.\n  When the question was asked later on by Mr. Russert: Aren't you tying \nthe hands of the Commander in Chief, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin, said:\n\n       Well, we hope to put a cap on the number of troops. If I \n     had my way, I would cap them. Of course, if I had my way, we \n     would never have gone there to begin with. But of course we \n     are trying to tie the hands of the President and his policy.\n\n  I want my colleagues to listen to the proposal that has been offered \nin the House of Representatives and just recently, this last week, was \ndiscussed and debated over there. Essentially, what that plan would \nentail is that the Congress would decide the particulars when it comes \nto which troops can go on combat tours and which ones can be extended \nbeyond the year. To be sent into battle, troops would have to have a \nyear's rest between combat tours, and soldiers in Iraq could not have \ntheir tours extended beyond a year. The Pentagon's stop-loss policy, \nwhich prevents some officers from leaving the military when their \nservice obligations are up, would end.\n  These are very troubling developments and proposals, particularly \nwhen they are considered in light of what the constitutional role of \nthe Congress is when it comes to these types of matters. Congress does \nnot have the expertise or the constitutional authority to micromanage \ntactics in a war.\n  I want to read something for my colleagues from an op-ed in the Wall\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\nStreet Journal from a few weeks back. It was written by David Rivkin \nand Lee Casey, and it says this:\n\n       The Constitution vests Congress with formidable authority \n     to affect how the President fights wars. Congress has the \n     power to declare war, formally rupturing international legal \n     relations between the U.S. and a belligerent enemy nation, \n     and to prescribe rules governing military discipline and \n     regulating the capture of military property. If it determines \n     to withhold funding for an ongoing conflict, it can compel \n     the President to withdraw U.S. forces. What Congress cannot \n     do, however, is direct how a President prosecutes a \n     particular war, including decisions about how many of the \n     available forces to introduce into a theatre of conflict.\n\n  Would someone on the other side of the aisle please step forward and \nremind me that there is logic and common sense and that liberal \ninterest groups have not taken over our colleagues on the Democratic \nside. These actions are stunningly transparent, designed to embarrass \nthe President and to woo liberal interest groups. Let us not go down \nthat road. Our troops and their families and the American people \ndeserve better.\n  There are a number of Members of the Senate who have served their \ncountry and who are veterans. I have the highest respect for the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, who is among those who have seen \ncombat and understands what it entails and the chain of command. I \ncan't imagine any Member of the Senate who has been involved in combat \nwho would condone having politicians here in Washington, DC, Members of \nthe Senate, no matter how well intended, directing and managing \nmilitary conflict and getting in the way of our commanders and our \ntroops and their ability to conduct and perform their mission and to do \ntheir job.\n  I think it terribly unfortunate what has happened here in the Senate. \nI do believe it has trivialized what should be a very serious debate. I \nhave maintained all along that this is a debate we ought to have \nbecause this is the dominant issue of our time about which people \nacross this country have incredibly strong feelings. Irrespective of \nhow we got there and what one thinks about that, it is important now \nthat we evaluate seriously, that we examine, and that we analyze how \nbest to proceed and move forward.\n  There is a plan. It is being implemented. I want to see it succeed. I \nhope and pray, for the sake of our troops in the theater, that it does \nsucceed. What we cannot afford to have happen in this Congress is to go \ndown this path where one side is trying to one-up the other side and \nframe the debate, to define the terms of the debate in a way that is \npolitically advantageous to them. That is wrong.\n  That is why I am here today, to say we ought to have a debate. It \nought to be a full, fair, and open debate, in keeping with the \ntradition and the history of the Senate and in keeping with the \ncommitment we have made to the men and women we have put in harm's way \nand who wear the uniform of the United States of America. They deserve \nto have our support not only of them but of the mission they are \nundertaking. They need to know that we believe they can succeed, that \nwe believe they can win, that we believe they can achieve victory. If \nwe fail in that important mission, future generations are going to pay \na dear price. The global war on terror is not going away. It is \nimportant that here in the Senate we dignify the great service of those \ngreat Americans by having a dignified debate that is full, that is \nfair, that is open, and that is not intent on micromanaging and \ndirecting the affairs of our military leadership and telling our \ncommanders what they can and cannot do when it comes to winning this \nvery important war.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as of this month, it has been 2 full years \nthat the position of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the \nDepartment of the Interior has been vacant--2 full years. There has \nbeen a Federal position specifically assigned for the responsibilities \nfor Indian affairs since the year 1806.\n  In the year 1849, that position was transferred from the Defense \nDepartment--or then the Department of War--to the Interior Department. \nThe Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs and the Department of the \nInterior is responsible for managing the BIA, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, and all of the programs that are important to the trust \nresponsibilities and the fiduciary obligations the U.S. Government has \nto tribes. We do indeed have obligations to tribes through treaties and \nthrough other approaches, trust responsibilities. This Congress, and \nprevious Congresses, and future Congresses, have obligations to tribal \ngovernments that we must meet. Those obligations are important.\n  As I said, it has been 2 full years since we have had a person in the \nposition of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in the Interior \nDepartment. For 2 years it has been vacant, which is unbelievable to \nme.\n  We have a man who has been nominated now named Carl Artman, who is a \nmember of the United Tribe of Wisconsin. Mr. Artman is a very capable, \ndistinguished person. I met with him a couple times. President Bush \nsent his nomination down to the Congress last year. Apparently, a hold \nwas put on his nomination and it did not move. The President re-sent \nthe nomination recently. I chaired the hearing, and we moved his \nnomination out of the Indian Affairs Committee and now it is before the \nfull Senate.\n  My understanding is it has not moved because there has been a hold \nput on it once again. I spoke to the Secretary of the Interior today \nagain about that subject, and my hope is--I indicated to him, and I \nthink his hope is--this week we can find a way to resolve these issues \nand get Mr. Carl Artman confirmed by the Senate for the position of \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. It is a very important \nposition.\n  We have a full-blown crisis in health care, housing, and education on \nIndian reservations. I have been doing listening sessions with Indian \ntribes. With respect to education, as an example, they tell about a \nyoung schoolkid who is living in a house, a 3-bedroom home with 23 \npeople. That describes the housing conditions on some of the \nreservations.\n  But what about a young kid who is living in a 3-bedroom home with 23 \nother people? What kind of homework do you think gets done there? What \nkind of opportunity is it for that young child to quietly be able to \nopen a book and to learn a lesson?\n  We have a crisis in housing. I have described it many times on the \nfloor of the Senate. We have a crisis in health care. It is almost \nunbelievable to me, but we had a hearing recently in which a doctor \ndescribed a woman who had a very serious knee injury who required \nsurgery. She went to the doctor on the Indian reservation and was told: \nWrap it in cabbage leaves for 3 or 4 days. That is right: Wrap it in \ncabbage leaves for 3 or 4 days. It needed to be operated on. It was a \ntorn ligament. ``Wrap it in cabbage leaves''--that is health care? Not \nwhere I come from.\n  Or a man who had a bad arm, a bad shoulder, a torn ligament, and for \n4 years he could not get it fixed on the Indian reservation because it \nwas not ``life or limb''--4 years. This was a rancher. What do you \nthink a one-armed rancher is able to do on a ranch? Haul hay? I do not \nthink so.\n  I told the story on the floor about the woman who was having a heart \nattack--an Indian woman--and was transported by ambulance to a \nhospital. She was hauled into the hospital on a gurney--having a heart \nattack--and they discovered there was a piece of paper taped to her \nthigh. What the paper said was: You should understand, hospital \nadministrators, this person is not covered under the Indian Contract \nHealth Services. We are out of money. So, therefore, if you admit this \nperson, you are on your own.\n  Imagine that: a woman having a heart attack, brought in on a gurney \nto a hospital with a piece of paper taped to her thigh that says: \nBeware. We won't pay for this treatment. That is unbelievable.\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n  We have a lot of problems we need to address in these areas dealing \nwith Indian tribes and the first Americans. I understand the Indian \nHealth Service is attached to Health and Human Services. But I also \nunderstand the issues of housing, education, and all of the other \nrelated issues belong to the Interior Department. That position in the \nInterior Department responsible for these issues has been vacant for 2 \nfull years, and I believe it is shameful. I hope this Senate, this \nweek, can resolve this issue and get it done. I am going to push to see \nif we can't get that confirmation done this week.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 684 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, when we began the 110th Congress, I said:\n\n       The American people want change, and it is up to us--\n     Democrats and Republicans--to deliver that change.\n\n  Two months later, the Senate has delivered. Democrats, Republicans, \nwe have moved America in a new direction. As our first order of \nbusiness, we changed the way Washington works literally, passing the \ntoughest lobbying and ethics reform legislation in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Next, we ended the national disgrace of the $5.15 minimum wage and \ngave America's poorest workers a raise for the first time in 10 years.\n  After the minimum wage, we passed an important continuing resolution \nto keep our Government fully funded and running. This Congress, the \n110th Congress, inherited a fiscal mess, but by setting tough spending \nlimits, eliminating earmarks, and working together, we have begun to \nput our country's fiscal house in order. It was done with the support \nof the Republicans. We could not have done the continuing resolution as \nwe did; that is, settling the country's financial problems, but for the \nsupport of Republicans. We could have done it, but it would have been a \nreal knockdown, drag-out battle. We didn't have to have that. So as I \nhave said a number of times, I commend the Republicans for working with \nus.\n  Finally, before recess, we held an important Iraq vote where a \nbipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate expressed its opposition to the \nPresident's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. That debate and that vote \nwere just the start. The Senate, sometime in the future, will continue \nto work its will on the issue until there is a change of course in \nIraq.\n  In the last election, we promised that the days of the do-nothing \nCongress were over, and it is a promise we have kept. But I have to \nsay, we were unable to keep it on our own. We needed the support of the \nRepublicans, and we got that.\n  At this time in the 109th Congress, the Senate had passed one piece \nof legislation and some nominations. This year, the Senate passed three \nsignificant legislative items--ethics, minimum wage, and the continuing \nresolution--and a number of judges, including a circuit court judge.\n  On every one of these items, we have had the support of the minority, \nthe Republicans. This year, the Senate has ended 4 years of \ncongressional silence on Iraq. Senate committees have held almost 40 \nIraq hearings, where we asked questions and held the administration \naccountable for its policies. In the last Congress, you could count \nmeaningful Iraq hearings on one hand. In the first 6 weeks of this \nyear, the Senate has had 52 rollcall votes. By comparison, the 109th \nCongress during the same time period had 11 rollcall votes. It is a \ngood start, but there is so much more to do, which is why this week the \nSenate will set its sights on extremely important work--keeping our \ncountry and our families safe by implementing the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  Following the terrible attacks of September 11, 2001, our country \nturned to a respected group of Democrats and Republicans, the 9/11 \nCommission, to review the lessons of that tragic day and to find a \nbetter way to fight the war on terror. Under difficult circumstances, \nincluding a lack of cooperation from the White House, the Commission \ndid a fine job and, in July 2004, made a number of recommendations to \nCongress and the administration about how best to secure the homeland \nfrom al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. Their ideas included \nimproving security at our ports, on our rails, and in cargo holds, \ngiving our first responders the tools they need to communicate with \neach other during the crisis--something the Presiding Officer has \ntalked about many times in the Senate floor--and streamlining our \nintelligence community to help it better prevent another attack. These \nwere commonsense solutions designed to keep America safe. \nUnfortunately, 2\\1/2\\ years later, too many have been ignored and too \nmany of our communities remain dangerously unprepared to prevent or \nrespond to another terrorist attack.\n  We all feel so fortunate that we have not suffered another terrible \nincident like that of 9/11. In the last Congress, Democrats tried to \nmove forward with tough and smart solutions to keep the homeland safe. \nUnfortunately, those of us who tried to follow the Commission's roadmap \nhit nothing but speed bumps. In 2005, we tried to increase funding for \nfirst responders by $1.6 billion. Our effort was rejected on a party-\nline vote. Days later, we tried to restore $1 billion to the COPS \nProgram, so important for law enforcement throughout the country. We \nwere rejected again along party lines. In July 2005, just days after \nthe subway bombings in London, the Senate considered legislation that \nwould have improved security on rails. Again, with a party-line vote, \nwe went down. That same day, the Senate voted on legislation to \nallocate money to secure our ports. The measure fell along party lines. \nThe end result of this obstruction: America today is not as safe as it \ncan be, should be, or must be.\n\n  For 6 years, this White House and past Congresses have talked a good \ngame about protecting America, but while they were distracted and \nconsumed with staying the course in Iraq, they failed to heed the \nlessons of September 11, 2001--that we must do more to protect and \nsecure our communities from the real terrorist threat here at home.\n  The suggestions I have made today are not something I came up with. \nThey are not Democratic proposals but were led by two patriotic \nAmericans, Governor Kean, a Republican Governor of New Jersey, and \nCongressman Lee Hamilton, Democratic Congressman from Indiana, the \nleaders of the Commission. Last year, the 9/11 Commission released a \nreport, grading Congress and the President on the job they had done in \nsecuring the homeland. It was a report card any child would be \nembarrassed to take home to their parents. It included 12 Ds, 5 Fs, and \ntwo incompletes: requiring proper screening of airline passengers, F; \nallocating homeland security funds based on risk, F; sharing \ninformation with State and locals, a little better but a D.\n  Turning these and other failing grades into passing grades is what \nthe Senate will focus on on a bipartisan basis this week. We will work \ntogether. We will take steps to protect America from the greatest \nthreat we face--nuclear terrorism. We will enhance the security of our \ntransportation system and our ports. We will provide America's first \nresponders with the technology they need to communicate with each other \nduring a crisis. In the process, we will make America more secure. Five \nand a half years after 9/11, we don't have a day to waste.\n  I end where I started. We have had a good year. We have done \ntremendous work, such as our efforts on lobbying reform. We have done \ngood work on the minimum wage. We have done good work on getting the \nfinancial house of this country in order. It has been done on a \nbipartisan basis. I look forward to this next week and the following \nweek to make sure that the 9/11 Commission recommendations are \nimplemented.\n  When we get to this bill--and I have said this publicly when we were \non the\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\nIraq issue before we left for recess--it is going to be open for \namendment. I have said it privately to the distinguished Republican \nleader. I say it here on the floor. The bill will be open to amendment. \nWe have amendments we think will improve the bill. I know the \nRepublicans think they have amendments that will improve the bill. I \nlook forward to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say briefly, in response to my good \nfriend, the majority leader, I appreciate his observations about how he \nintends to proceed on the 9/11 legislation. We have a number of, \ncertainly, relevant and important amendments to be considered in the \ncontext of that debate. As he may have indicated before I came on the \nfloor, we are in the midst of a discussion about how to go forward on \nthat legislation and at what point we can go forward on it. But I am \noptimistic that we will be able to work that out sometime in the next \nday or two and get started so that our Members will have an opportunity \nto lay down their amendments and get started. We will have a good \ndebate on a very important issue confronting the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/26/senate-section/article/S2229-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/26/senate-section/article/S2229-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/26/senate-section/article/S2229-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 976.

A bill to develop the next generation of parental control \ntechnology; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 639. A bill to establish digital and wireless networks to advance \nonline higher education opportunities for minority students; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two \ncommunications bills.\n  First, I am introducing the Child Safe Viewing Act, a bill to develop \nthe next generation of parental control technology. Last year, \nfollowing several hearings and forums on decency, I concluded that the \nV-Chip is not an adequate solution for parents to prevent their \nchildren from viewing adult content, especially in a world of 500 \nchannels and video streaming.\n  During the 1996 Telecommunications Act debate, President Clinton \nurged inclusion of a mandatory V-Chip device, and in collaboration with \nCongress, the FCC, and the entertainment industry, the V-Chip was born. \nThe V-Chip was an important beginning to control child access to adult \nmaterial. Over a decade has passed since the 1996 Act, and the world of \ncommunications has changed. However, the issues that inspired the V-\nChip continue to exist today for not only television but for the \nInternet and other video streaming devices.\n  The Child Safe Viewing Act is a pragmatic approach to addressing the \npitfalls of video content not intended for kids, and it acts on current \nlaw. It simply directs the Federal Communications Commission to begin a \nproceeding on the requirements in Section 551 of the V-Chip law. \nSection 551 states that the Commission shall take action on alternative \nblocking technology as it is developed. This mandate is clear and the \ntime has come. We must engage in this issue now to ensure that families \nhave the tools to keep inappropriate and sometimes dangerous material \nout of their children's view.\n  I am also introducing ED 1.0, a bill to advance online higher \neducation opportunities for minorities. Last Congress, Senator Allen \nand I introduced a bill that would establish a digital and wireless \nnetwork technology program for minority-serving institutions, and it \nwas reported favorably by the Commerce Committee. Regrettably, I am \nconcerned that the cost of the bill will prohibit it from moving in \nthis Congress. But the needs of this Nation's minorities are not \nstanding still.\n  ED 1.0 would allow some of our goals to move forward now by creating \na pilot online degree program at four minority-serving institutions. \nAfrican-American, Hispanic, and Tribal serving colleges and \nuniversities in socially and economically disadvantaged areas would be \neligible to participate in this program to help define what works in \nensuring that minorities are obtaining higher education degrees\n  With the high costs of networks and limited availability of \nresources, the program would provide a national ``lessons learned'' \nabout how to develop and implement flexible degree programs in fields \nsuch as health or education, which are currently underserved in the \ndisadvantaged community. The goals of ED 1.0 will make education a \nreality for thousands of Americans, and I hope this bill will have the \nsupport of my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 602\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Safe Viewing Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Video programming has a direct impact on a child's \n     perception of safe and reasonable behavior.\n       (2) Children imitate actions they witness on video \n     programming, including language, drug use, and sexual \n     conduct.\n       (3) Studies indicate that the strong appeal of video \n     programming erodes the ability of parents to develop \n     responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.\n       (4) The average American child watches 4 hours of \n     television each day.\n       (5) Seventy-five percent of adults surveyed believe that \n     television content marketed toward children should be subject \n     to compulsory principles.\n       (6) Ninety-nine and nine-tenths percent of all consumer \n     complaints logged by the Federal Communications Commission in \n     the first quarter of 2006 regarding radio and television \n     broadcasting were because of obscenity, indecency, and \n     profanity.\n       (7) There is a compelling government interest in empowering \n     parents to limit their children's exposure to harmful \n     television content.\n       (8) Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires \n     the Federal Communications Commission to promote the safety \n     of life and property through the use of wire and radio \n     communications.\n       (9) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \n     authorized Parental Choice in Television Programming and the \n     V-Chip. Congress further directed action on alternative \n     blocking technology as new video technology advanced.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to clarify the authority of the Secretary of the \nInterior with respect to the management of the elk population located \nin the Theodore Roosevelt National Park; to the Committee of Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week I was in my State of North \nDakota where we have a wonderful national park. It is named after Teddy \nRoosevelt. He is the conservation- minded President who established the \nNational Park System. What a remarkable man he was. What a remarkable \nleader for this country.\n  We have a national park in the Badlands called the Theodore Roosevelt \nNational Park. I picked up a newspaper to read that there are too many \nelk in the park, an overpopulation of elk, which is going to be a \nserious problem for the national park. The Park Service has had some \ndiscussion about what they might want to do to thin out or cull the elk \nherd in the national park. It has grown dramatically. They were talking \nin the newspaper article I read about considering hiring Federal \nsharpshooters to kill some elk and then use helicopters to remove their \ncarcasses from the national park, for meat, I guess.\n  It occurred to me there are times when the Government is completely \ndevoid of common sense. I understand the Park Service says there is a \nprohibition on hunting in the national parks. On the other hand, it \nseems to me if you are hiring Federal sharpshooters to kill elk, they \nare going to be hunting those elk. It would make a lot more sense, to \nme, for a limited opportunity for qualified hunters to be able to hunt \nthe elk in cooperation with Federal and State authorities. You do not \nneed Federal sharpshooters to be paid. You do not need helicopters to \nhaul the carcasses out of the park. All you need are hunters with a \npickup truck or two, and you will be fine.\n  Today I am introducing a piece of legislation that would allow the \nPark Service to allow local hunters in my State to work on a \ncooperative basis with the Federal and State authorities to thin that \nelk herd. Culling or thinning the elk herd, apparently, is a necessity. \nIt is going to happen. The question is how. Do we spend a lot of money \nhiring sharpshooters and helicopters or do we do this in a commonsense \nway and allow hunters to go in, in a coordinated way and a careful way, \nto thin and cull that elk herd? It seems to me the latter is the better \napproach.\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\n  The Park Service, by the way, at the moment also says my State is \nshort of prairie dogs. Of course, that is not the case. We have far \nmore prairie dogs than we know what to do with. The prairie dogs were \nborn--I should say luckily for them--with a button nose and fur on \ntheir tail. Otherwise, they would essentially look like a rat. But we \nhave a lot of prairie dogs.\n  We are told by Federal authorities we need more prairie dogs, not \nbecause they think prairie dogs are cute, but apparently because they \nwant to reintroduce something called the black-footed ferret in my \nState. The last person to spot a black-footed ferret in my State \nallegedly spotted a black-footed ferret some 20 years ago and was \nwidely thought, according to local folklore, to have been drinking at \nthe time.\n  So there apparently are no black-footed ferrets that live in my \nState. They apparently went to warmer climates in the South some long \ntime ago. Now we are told by Federal authorities we need more prairie \ndogs as food for black-footed ferrets who are going to be reintroduced \nto North Dakota.\n  It is no small wonder, then, I look at some of these Federal agencies \nand wonder if there is any reservoir of common sense left. That is what \npersuaded me, last week, as I read the newspaper article about hiring \nFederal sharpshooters to shoot elk and hiring helicopters to take the \ndeer meat out of our national park--a national park proudly named after \none of the great hunters ever to occupy the White House, Teddy \nRoosevelt--I wondered whether there might be any common sense that \nmight be applied that very simply says if we are going to thin or cull \nthe elk herd in the Teddy Roosevelt National Park, let's do it the way \nTeddy Roosevelt would have anticipated it be done.\n  No, I do not suggest opening up all national parks to hunting. I \nsuggest in this limited circumstance that thinning and culling the elk \nherd in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park can best be done without a \nmassive cost to the taxpayers and with an opportunity for qualified \nhunters who live in my State.\n  I recognize that these issues pale in comparison to larger issues \nlike the Iraq war and the health care crisis and fiscal policy that is \noff track, but it seems to me there are times when we ought to call \nattention even to comparatively small things that do not seem right.\n  What I read last week about sharpshooters and helicopters not only \nreminded me of the lack of common sense with respect to this little \nissue, but it annoyed me once again with respect to the subject of \nprairie dogs. I spoke about prairie dogs long ago on this Senate floor \nwhen the prairie dogs took over a small picnic area, and the response \nof the Park Service was to decide to spend a quarter of a million \ndollars to move the picnic area rather than hire a couple of 16-year-\nold kids to tell the prairie dogs they have to be elsewhere.\n  But having said all that, I am introducing a piece of legislation \ndealing with the Theodore Roosevelt National Park--a park I am \nenormously proud of--and an elk herd that needs thinning and an \nopportunity for qualified North Dakota hunters who will use a \nsubstantial amount of common sense to solve a problem that can be \nsolved quickly and easily.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 685. A bill to establish an expedited procedure for congressional \nconsideration of health care reform legislation; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, in introducing legislation \nthat requires Congress to act on what may be the most pressing domestic \npolicy issue of our time, namely health care reform.\n  I believe we can find a way to make universal coverage work in this \ncountry. Universal coverage doesn't have to be defined by what's in \nplace in other countries or by what's been attempted in the past. What \nuniversal coverage does mean is ending a system where more than 46 \nmillion Americans are uninsured, and where too many of those who are \ninsured are struggling to pay their premiums, struggling to pay for \nprescription drugs, and struggling to find long term care.\n  Over the years I have heard many different proposals for how we \nshould change the health care system in this country. Some propose \nusing tax incentives as a way to expand access to health care. Others \nthink the best approach is to expand public programs. Some feel a \nnational single payer health care system is the only way to go.\n  I favor an American-style health care reform, where we encourage \ncreative solutions to the health care problems facing our country, \nwithout using a one-size-fits-all approach. I believe that States have \na better idea about what the health care needs of their residents are, \nand that they understand what types of reform will work best for their \nState. So I am in favor of a State-based universal health care system, \nwhere States, with the Federal Government's help, come up with a plan \nto make sure that all of their residents have health care coverage, and \nI am working with Senator Graham to develop a bipartisan bill that will \nhelp States do just that. If we are finally going to fix our broken \nhealth care system, we need to be open to good, new ideas.\n  And this brings us to the legislation Senator Graham and I are \nintroducing today, because, the reason we haven't reformed our health \ncare system isn't because of a lack of good ideas. The problem is that \nCongress and the White House refuse to take this issue up. Despite the \noutcry from businesses, from health care providers, and from the tens \nof millions who are uninsured or underinsured or struggling to pay \ntheir premiums, the Federal Government refuses to address the problem \nin a comprehensive way.\n  That is why we are introducing this bill. Our legislation will force \nCongress to finally address this issue. It requires the Majority and \nMinority Leaders of the Senate, as well as the Chairs of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, to \neach introduce a health care reform bill in the first 30 days of the \nsession of Congress following enactment of the bill. This bill provides \nan expedited process for considering reform legislation. Similar \nprocedures are established for House consideration.\n  I want to emphasize that my bill does not prejudge what particular \nhealth care reform measure should be debated. There are many worthy \nproposals that would qualify for consideration, and this bill does not \ndictate which proposal, or combination of proposals, should be \nconsidered.\n  But what my bill does do is require Congress to act.\n  It has been over 10 years since the last serious debate over health \ncare reform was killed by special interests. I am disappointed that \nCongress still has not acted to reform our health care system, and \nbusinesses and workers are crying out as never before for Congress to \naddress the country's health care crisis.\n  It has been over 10 years since we've had any debate on comprehensive \nhealth care reform. We cannot afford any further delay. The cost of \ninaction is too great. I urge my colleagues to support the Reform \nHealth Care Now Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reform health Care Now \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historical \nTrail; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, 225 years ago, on October 17, 1781, a \nfew thousand American and French soldiers laid siege to Yorktown, \nforced the surrender of General Cornwallis and his British regulars, \nand won American independence.\n  Although we often remember the victory at Yorktown, too often we lose \nsight of the heroic efforts that made it possible. Too often we forget \nthat this victory was the culmination of a miraculous campaign--when \ntwo nations, two armies, and two great men put aside their differences \nand worked together for a common purpose.\n  I, along with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Biden, Clinton, Dodd, \nMenendez, Reed, Specter, and Whitehouse, am privileged to call for the \ncommemoration of the events leading to our victory at Yorktown and the \nend of the American Revolution with the designation of the Washington-\nRochambeau Revolutionary Route as a National Historic Trail.\n  The Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route is 600 miles of \nhistory, winding from Providence, RI, to Yorktown, VA. In the opinion \nof my colleagues and me, it is worthy of designation as a National \nHistoric Trail. Let us document the events in the cities and towns all \nalong the road to Yorktown and the birth of this great Nation. Let us \ncelebrate the unprecedented Franco-American alliance and the superhuman \nefforts of Generals George Washington and Jean Baptiste de Rochambeau \nto preserve that alliance in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. \nLet us create a National Historic Trail along whose\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\ncourse we can pause and remember these heroes, their travels, and \nsacrifices--from the journey's beginning when Rochambeau led the French \narmy out of Newport and Providence, RI, into New York where he joined \nWashington's troops, and through a cross section of colonial America to \nits culmination at Yorktown.\n  Each of the nine States on the trail makes its own unique \ncontribution to the tale of the journey. In my own State of \nConnecticut--the two generals met and through a translator planned \ntheir strategy. In Phillipsburg, NY, the French and American armies \nfirst joined together and faced off against the British in New York \nCity. Here, Washington and Rochambeau planned their high risk \nstrategy--abandoning established positions in the north and racing \nhundreds of miles south to surprise and trap an unsuspecting British \narmy. In Chatham, New Jersey, the French made a show of storing \nsupplies and building bread ovens in order to disguise their march \ntowards Cornwallis in Virginia. They moved on through Princeton and \nTrenton, New Jersey--sites of previous colonial victories against great \nodds.\n  The trail goes through Philadelphia, PA--then capital of the \ncolonies. Here Washington and Rochambeau stopped their men outside \ntown, had them clean off the dirt of the trail and marched them through \ntown with drums beating and flags unfurled before the Continental \nCongress and the people of Philadelphia. The grandeur of their new \nEuropean ally helped restore the spirit of America during this very \nuncertain time.\n  A few days later in Chester, PA, Washington, the normally reserved \ncommander-in-chief, literally danced on the dock when he learned the \nFrench fleet had arrived in the Chesapeake and trapped the British at \nYorktown. For the first time, it seemed that victory for the colonies \nwas possible. The armies marched on to Wilmington, DE and Elkton, MD, \nwhere American troops were finally paid for some of their efforts, \nusing money borrowed by the bankrupt Continental Army from General \nRochambeau.\n  Our Nation's capital region also played its part in this story. \nTroops camped in Baltimore near the site of today's Camden Yards. Some \ncrossed the Potomac near Georgetown, while others camped in Alexandria, \nVA. Along the way, General Washington made a triumphal return to Mount \nVernon, and hosted a celebration for his French allies. All along the \nroute, towns were touched and thrilled by the passage of the army and \nevents swirling around them.\n  The armies marched on through Williamsburg, VA until they reached \npositions outside Yorktown in late September. Washington and Rochambeau \nand their troops went on to win this battle and the war. Let us take \nthe time to better remember the heroes of our past, those who \nsacrificed so much for our freedom today, deserve no less. This bill \nensures that this history, in all its rich detail, is not forgotten.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Joe Lieberman, in introducing legislation to designate \nthe historic route undertaken by General George Washington and General \nJean-Baptiste de Rochambeau to trap the British army at Yorktown, VA, \nas a national historic trail.\n  This proposed national historic trail traces the 600-mile route that \nFrench troops under the command of General Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau \ntook from Newport, RI, to Yorktown, VA, during the Revolutionary War. \nAmerican troops under the command of General George Washington joined \nthe French force outside of New York City and, later that year, on \nOctober 17, the combined armies defeated British General Charles \nCornwallis at Yorktown with the help of the French fleet commanded by \nAdmiral Francois de Grasse.\n  This historic trail would celebrate the Franco-American alliance and \nthe heroic effort undertaken by these two great nations to ensure \nAmerican independence. Led by their courageous and brilliant leaders, \nGenerals Washington and Rochambeau, these two armies changed the course \nof history with their victory over the British at Yorktown. This \nnational historic trail would recognize this historic route and educate \nthe public at large about the contributions of these men and their \narmies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation, and I \nthank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Washington-\nRochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/26/senate-section/article/S2235-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                 COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Because of various clerical problems and just \nthe way the Senate works, the bulk of the homeland security work we are \ngoing to be doing--probably 65 percent of it--deals with the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Lieberman. The ranking member \nis Senator Collins. About 15 percent of what we are going to be doing \ndeals with Banking and about 20 percent or thereabouts--these are all \nrough estimates--deals with the Commerce Committee.\n  We are going to invoke cloture on the Commerce aspect--an effort to \nmove it forward by 1 day--because with the first amendment, after we \ngot on this legislation, we would move to put the homeland security \nlegislation in, which basically has it all in it anyway.\n  I have spoken at some length with the distinguished Republican \nleader, and it was felt by both of us it would be better if we could \nspeak to our two caucuses tomorrow during the lunch hour to see how we \nshould proceed tomorrow afternoon. That is why we changed the time for \nvoting from in the morning until 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote occur \ntomorrow at 2:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Tomorrow, the Senate will conduct a period of morning \nbusiness until the time when the Senate recesses for the conference \nwork periods. I will continue to discuss the schedule with the \nRepublican leader with respect to the 9/11 Commission legislation, as I \nindicated. So for scheduling purposes, Members should be here at 2:30 \nfor the cloture vote. If we are able to vitiate that vote, Members will \nbe notified in a timely fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/26/senate-section/article/S2236-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
