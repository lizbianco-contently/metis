Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the following bills en bloc: \nCalendar No. 832, S. 2766, and S. 3298, introduced earlier today by \nSenator Murkowski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bills by \ntitle.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2766) to amend the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act to address certain discharges incidental to the \n     normal operation of a recreational vessel.\n       A bill (S. 3298) to clarify the circumstances during which \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and \n     applicable States may require permits for discharges from \n     certain vessels, and to require the Administrator to conduct \n     a study of discharges incidental to the normal operation of \n     vessels.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills \nen bloc.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support legislation \nthat will provide a 2-year moratorium on National Pollution Discharge \nElimination System permits for all commercial fishing vessels of any \nsize and for all other commercial vessels less then 79 feet. The \nlegislation requires the EPA, working with the Coast Guard, to conduct \na 15-month study during the\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nmoratorium period to evaluate the impacts of various discharges from \nvessels and report their findings to Congress for the purposes of \nmaking final decisions on vessel discharge permit requirements.\n  Discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels have been \nexempt from NPDES permits under the Clean Water Act since 1973. The \nNational Pollution Discharge Elimination System was developed for \nindustrial sources of pollution and was not designed for mobile \nsources. In 2006, the U.S. District Court for Northern California ruled \nthat the EPA exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act in \nexempting these discharges and issued an order revoking the exemption \nand requiring the agency to permit these discharges by September 30, \n2008. The EPA has appealed the decision, but in the meantime, the \nagency has proposed to permit both recreational and commercial vessels \nunder two general permits. While the EPA has proposed a general permit \nsystem that does not require individual permits, all commercial and \nrecreational vessels would still be subject to the regulations, fines, \nand enforcement and citizen lawsuits of the Clean Water Act. \nConsidering incidental discharges for these vessels have been exempt \nfor the past 35 years, it is hard to support permitting when we have \nsuch a dearth of information about what the discharges are, especially \nfor small commercial and recreational boats.\n  The commercial moratorium bill directs the EPA to study the \nincidental discharges of commercial vessels to determine the volume, \ntype and frequency of various categories and sizes of vessels. It is my \nsincere hope that after the results of the study are reported to the \nSenate Environment and Public Works and Commerce Committees, and the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congress will take \naction to exempt commercial vessels, as we are now doing for the \nrecreational sector under the Clean Boating Act. The commercial vessels \nthat will be included are commercial fishing vessels of any size and \nother commercial vessels less then 79 feet. I need to clarify that it \nis my understanding that a commercial fishing vessel is one that \npreviously or is presently engaged in the harvesting, taking or \ncatching of commercial fish. Many commercial fishing boats in the \nUnited States also work as fish tenders and it is my intention that the \nfishing vessels working in this capacity are also included in the \ncovered vessels under the commercial moratorium bill.\n  I also support S. 2766, the Clean Boating Act of 2008. This \nlegislation exempts recreational vessels from the NPDES permitting \nwhile the EPA develops best management practices for this sector. \nNeither category of vessels has documented discharge levels that have \nbeen shown to be harmful to the environment. The court case that \nrequired the EPA to develop this permit system was focused on invasive \nspecies and ballast water. Neither recreational nor small commercial \nvessels have ballast tanks and very few are ocean-going vessels.\n  Enactment of this legislation, together with the Clean Boating Act \nwill provide the recreation sector an exemption and commercial boats a \ntwo year waiver with the possibility for exemptions based on the \noutcome of the discharge study.\n  It was a collaborative, negotiated process that developed the Clean \nBoating Act and the commercial moratorium legislation. I ask my \ncolleagues to support both of these bills and I ask that they both pass \nby unanimous consent today.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bills be \nread a third time and passed, en bloc, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, en bloc, and \nthat any statements relating to the bills be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bills were ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, were read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2766\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today the Senate will continue debate \non the No. 1 domestic issue facing the Nation, but it now seems clear \nthat the majority is not interested in a full and open debate, is not \ninterested in good ideas from all sides, and is designing floor debate \nthat is designed to fail. That is simply unacceptable. I was disturbed \nto read this morning that our friends on the other side are considering \nonly a brief and limited consideration of this bill. It is troubling \nthat at a time of $4.06-a-gallon gas, the Senate would treat the issue \nas if it is some technical corrections bill. Let me assure my friends \nit is not.\n  Let's be absolutely clear, Republicans will not accept a perfunctory \napproach to the problem. We are not content with a check-the-box \nexercise. More important, the American people will not accept a timid \napproach to such a major problem. This is the biggest issue in the \ncountry by far. The only thing I can recall in recent years that rivals \nit was terrorism right after 9/11. The Republican conference is \ninterested in a solution. We are not interested in holding a pair of \nvotes so that we can go home with political cover to blame the other \nside for our collective lack of accomplishment.\n  Let's be clear, speculation-only legislation is a very little piece \nto a massive problem. Americans are facing\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\nthat problem every day at the pump. The American people are speaking \nvery clearly about what needs to be done, and the Senate has the \nability to answer their call. Americans are going to continue to demand \na serious solution that gets at both supply and demand. Nothing less \ncan be seen as a solution. Nobody can say with a straight face that \nsimply addressing speculation, a very narrow part of the problem, is a \nserious approach.\n  The majority seems less concerned with passing a bill which can bring \ndown the price of gas and more concerned with just passing some bill. \nBut it wasn't too long ago that the majority party, regardless of which \nparty was in control, welcomed an open debate on energy legislation.\n  Let's look back to last year. Last year, when the Senate considered \nthe Energy Independence and Security Act and when gas was $3.06 a \ngallon, 49 amendments were agreed to out of the 331 which were filed. \nOf those amendments, 16 received rollcall votes. In 2005, when the \nprice of gas was $2.26 a gallon, a Republican majority allowed 19 \nrollcall votes on amendments during debate on the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. A total of 57 amendments were agreed to out of 235 proposed. \nNeither of these bills was rushed through in less than a week. We spent \n15 days on the floor debating last year's Energy bill and 10 days in \n2005 because we wanted to make sure we got it right, that ideas from \nboth sides were considered, that the legislation would have the needed \nimpact.\n  We need to do that again. The current cost of gas is a serious \nproblem that requires a very serious approach. The Senate insults the \nAmerican people if it treats this problem with anything less than the \nseriousness such a big problem requires. We need to find more and use \nless. We need to consider good ideas from all sides, and we need to \ntake seriously that energy is the No. 1 issue facing our country and \nact on it now. We simply can't go through a failed process, claim \ncredit for trying, and then go home. Americans know better, and \nAmericans expect more.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S6984-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the code word is that all Democrats want to \ndo something ``perfunctory.'' That is code for blocking another bill. \nWe are up to 83. They have blocked those. Obviously, they are now going \nto block this oil legislation.\n  Look at this picture. The Republicans introduced their bill on what \nto do about the energy problems. Part of that bill deals with \nspeculation. We, the Democrats, think speculation is part of what is \ndriving up these oil prices. But we didn't just dream this up. \nAcademics, economists say that the cost of oil is 20 to 50 percent \nspeculation. My friend the Republican leader said it is a little issue, \nspeculation. If the price is 20 to 50 percent speculation, according to \nwhich economist or academic one talks to, that is a pretty big deal. If \nyou lower the price of oil by 20 percent, that lowers gasoline well \nbelow $4 a gallon; 50 percent knocks it to $2 a gallon. That sounds \nlike a pretty big issue to me.\n  I don't think it is just by chance that once we introduced this bill, \noil prices started to drop, because much of the speculation takes place \nby people who have no inkling they will ever use the oil. Prior to \n2006, it was against the law, but the Republican-dominated Congress \npassed a law saying you don't have to take possession of the oil; you \ncan just go ahead and buy it. That is what has happened. That is why \nspeculation is an important piece of legislation.\n  Let's assume that is all we did, nothing but speculation. Remember, \nit is part of their bill, and we think it is a big part of what is the \nproblem in America today. Let's assume we only did that. That would \nseem to be a pretty big step in the right direction, if we were able, \nwith a piece of legislation, to lower the price of oil even by the \nsmall amount of 20 percent and maybe by the 50 percent some say. But \nthey obviously do not want us to do that.\n  Let's go to the next step.\n  We see ads being paid for all over the country by whom? Oil \ncompanies. Oil companies are saying: Join with our Republican \ncolleagues in the Senate and drill more, drill more, drill more. You \nget the picture? Oil companies, Republicans in the Senate? Republicans \nare looking at these ads paid for by the big oil companies, full-page \nads.\n  They can afford them. They made $250 billion last year.\n  We Democrats are not opposed to drilling. Right now, there is 68 \nmillion acres available onshore and offshore. In addition, there is a \nlot of oil in other places. All the Interior Department has to do is \nlease the land. They have the authority to do that. There is no \nmoratorium on any of that. In Alaska alone, there is 25 million \nadditional acres which oil people say is a gold mine for oil. They can \ngo drill there now. What the Republicans want--and we see what they are \ndoing here--is to protect the oil companies. Just as Bush and Cheney \nhave done for 8 years, the most oil-friendly administration in our \nhistory is now being supported by their friends, as they have for 8 \nyears, Republicans in the Senate.\n  Republicans in the Senate, the oil companies, they want yesterday \nforever. We want to change. That is why someone like T. Boone Pickens \nhas joined with Al Gore. Get that picture again. T. Boone Pickens and \nAl Gore? They have joined together saying: Oil is not where it is. We \nhave to get away from our addiction to oil. We have to get rid of our \naddiction to oil. Al Gore says that. He lays out the problem very well. \nHere comes T. Boone Pickens with a solution. He says we should have a \nlittle bridge, after a few years of using natural gas, and then it \nshould be all renewable energy.\n  We have tried now for months to get a renewable energy tax credit. \nSenator Durbin asked me to meet with one of his constituents yesterday. \nI was so impressed with this man. He is an immigrant to the United \nStates from the Ukraine. He has made a couple fortunes. He is now a big \nplayer in windmills.\n  He has 2,000 megawatts of electricity being produced from windmills. \nThat is a lot of electricity--a lot of electricity. It is much larger \nthan the coal-fired generating plant which was one of the largest in \nthe country in Mojave in Nevada which just closed because it was so \ndirty. It is bigger than that. It is huge what he is doing. But he came \nto us and said: I am about to lose everything--everything--because the \nbanks are going to withdraw my loans because the tax credit is not here \nnext year.\n  So here is the picture--again, talking about a picture for the third \ntime. The Republicans have obviously told us they are going to block \nlegislation dealing with oil. We have said: Let's do speculation. They \nhave talked now for weeks about drilling. They have talked about what \nthe oil companies are advertising they want to do with full-page ads. \nThey want to drill. They want to leave the decision to be made by the \nGovernors.\n  We have said now for more than a week: Let's vote on that. No, that \nis not what we want to do. The Republican whip yesterday told the \nDemocratic whip they have 28 amendments. That is not a serious effort \nto move forward on this legislation. They have been saying and \nfollowing the lead of the oil companies saying: We want to use less, \ndrill more. And we are saying: Let's vote on your proposal. They are \nsaying, no, no way, because we are filibustering another piece of \nlegislation--83.\n  So the American people understand we have people over there on that \nside of the aisle who have joined with big oil. They are very happy \nthey are running the ads. They are saying: No, we are not going to do \nanything about speculation, and even though we have talked about this \ngreat panacea to all the problems America faces, we will drive down \nprices immediately with our amendment on drilling. We are saying: Fine, \nlet's vote on your amendment. They say: No, thanks.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for one question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished majority \nleader,\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nI am informed he had stated in his earlier remarks that 20 percent of \nthe problem we have with high oil prices now is the result of \nspeculation. I was wondering if the distinguished majority leader \nwould--that is the first time I had heard that figure. I wonder if he \ncould provide a citation or some place----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, if it is the first \ntime you have heard it, with all due respect, you have not been \nlistening to what has been going on on the Senate floor. I am not the \nonly one who has said it. Many people have said it. I would be happy to \nplace in the Record--and the first person we will place in the Record \nis somebody who was a high-ranking official with the commodity futures \ntrading organization, where he says it is 50 percent. Now, that is in \nthe Record already. I will be happy to repeat his name, and we will \nspread this all through the Record. He says 50 percent. Many others say \nit is 20 percent. That is why we believe speculation is an important \npiece of this legislation.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, as I said earlier, if the man who says \nit is as much as 50 percent wrong, and it is only 20 percent, that is \nstill a big chunk out of this, and it must mean it is worthwhile \npursuing because in the Republicans' proposal you have in your proposal \na speculation piece.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would respond briefly and say to the \ndistinguished majority leader, I have been listening. I have been on \nthe floor literally every day talking about this issue. But I will say \nwhat surprised me about the 20-percent figure is that Warren Buffett, \nthe CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said it is not speculation that is \ndriving up the price of oil, it is supply and demand.\n  So that is why I was asking for a citation because it is the first \ntime I have heard it. I do not think I am the only one, and I have been \nlistening.\n  Mr. REID. Before I leave the floor, Mr. President, I will simply say \nthat Warren Buffett is a great guy. I like him very much. But keep in \nmind, he has not made his money in oil. He has made his money selling \nfurniture and insurance and other things of that nature. Warren Buffett \nis a great person. I have great respect for his ability to make money. \nBut he has not made it in oil. I think we need to look at some of the \nother experts in this regard.\n  I repeat, there must be some substance to it. The Republicans have it \nin their legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S6985-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3268, \nwhich the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 3268) to amend the \n     Commodity Exchange Act to prevent excessive price speculation \n     with respect to energy commodities, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees prior to the vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, later this morning, we are scheduled to \nvote on the motion to proceed to the legislation that the majority \nleader was referring to. This legislation is entitled the Stop \nExcessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008. This is legislation that is \ndesigned to shed additional light on trading activities in global oil \nmarkets.\n  I hope very much the Senate will vote to invoke cloture this morning \nand that we can proceed, and do so in a bipartisan fashion, to debate \nthe legislation. The topic of speculative investment in our energy \nmarkets has been the subject of many hearings throughout many \ncommittees of the Senate.\n  In our own committee, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee that I chair, along with a handful of other committees, we \nhave had something approaching 30 or 40 hearings during the 110th \nCongress on this subject. We have heard testimony from industry \nanalysts, traditional producers and consumers of petroleum products, \nthat the recent runup in crude prices can be attributed, at least in \npart--and there is debate about whether it is 20 percent or more or \nless, but this runup in prices can be attributed, at least in part, to \nwhat are referred to by some of the experts as the ``new fundamentals'' \nin our energy markets.\n  We had Dan Yergin, from Cambridge Energy Associates, who testified at \na workshop we had in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last \nweek, and he talked about the new fundamentals, as he has now for some \ntime. These new fundamental forces include nontraditional investment \nflows into energy commodity markets, as asset managers seek to hedge \nagainst inflationary risks and hedge against the decline in the value \nof the dollar.\n  This flight of investments into commodities is a symptom of our \nailing economy in general. But it also poses a number of serious \nquestions from an energy market perspective. Among those are whether \nand how the influx of billions of dollars in relatively passive \ninvestment is impacting the fundamental price-discovery functions these \nfinancial markets are intended to perform; that is to say, to some \npension fund managers and index investors taking positions in the oil \nmarkets, the price of a barrel of oil on any given day may not be very \nimportant. Whether the price is $5 or $500 per barrel, their oil market \npositions are designed to balance the risk they have in other parts of \ntheir portfolio, and they have made a policy judgment to put 10 percent \nof their portfolio in commodity markets, the oil market being prime \namong those.\n  So the question for policymakers is whether this investment--this new \nfundamental: the demand for paper barrels, as it was referred to at our \nworkshop last week--has begun to swamp the price signals that are \ngenerated by the more traditional hedgers, the large producers, and \nconsumers of petroleum products in tune to the real-time dynamics of \nsupply and demand. Supply and demand is still a significant factor in \nthe price of oil. There is no question about that. But these new \nfundamentals are also a significant factor in the view of many experts \nwho have testified to our committee.\n  During the course of the multiple hearings we have held in the Energy \nCommittee, through a series of related correspondence we have had with \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and in the ensuing debate in \nthe Senate, I believe that a compelling case has been made that the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission requires more authority, needs \nmore authority, needs more resources, needs more explicit direction \nfrom Congress to examine these issues in detail.\n\n  That is what Senator Reid's legislation tries to accomplish. Senator \nReid's legislation would provide the CFTC, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, with the tools to do that. It does several things. \nLet me mention a few.\n  It codifies recent CFTC initiatives related to the conditions under \nwhich the United States will allow traders access to foreign boards of \ntrade on which energy commodity contracts are listed. That is an \nimportant signal to the market that the United States will take a \nstronger stand on efforts to circumvent domestic trading rules.\n  The second thing it does is it provides much greater transparency in \nover-the-counter markets. This is another key building block to putting \nin place forward-leaning regulatory policies adapted to the \nincreasingly global and electronic environment in which energy is \nbought and sold.\n  The third thing this legislation does is it includes a number of \nprovisions designed to shine additional light on the nexus, or \nconnection, between the physical commodity and the financial energy \nmarkets, and to ask some of the same questions about natural gas \nmarkets that we have been asking about petroleum over the last few \nmonths. I believe this is an important effort. Particularly it is an \nimportant effort in light of what may prove to be a very difficult \nwinter heating season.\n  There are clearly ways in which this underlying legislation can be \nimproved\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nif we have the bipartisan will to do so. In addition, I know some on \nthe other side of the aisle would like to expand the debate on the \nenergy speculation bill to address, in addition, supply and demand-\nrelated issues. I believe Senator Reid has indicated an openness to \nhaving that done as well, if we can come together on a plan for \nconsideration of amendments.\n  It is clear to me there is indeed more we can do on the topic of \ncurtailing demand and expediting the availability of domestic supply in \nthe United States. I hope we can offer proposals along these lines in \nthe days ahead. Hopefully, we can find some areas of commonality on \nthose measures as well.\n  The first step toward getting to this serious debate--which I think \nwe all believe should occur--the first step to achieving consensus in \nthe Senate is to invoke cloture this morning on the motion to proceed \nto the energy speculation bill that Senator Reid has brought forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Energy Committee, who is very knowledgable on this subject. I do \nsay to him that I do believe that I and others on this side of the \naisle will vote to invoke cloture on the speculation provision. But I \ndo have some questions about it.\n  First of all, I asked the majority leader how much of the problem of \nthe high price of oil was caused by speculation. He said some people \nsay 20 percent. I cited to him Warren Buffett, a multibillionaire, \nsomebody who knows a lot about financing, and he said he thought it was \nsupply and demand. T. Boone Pickens, one of my constituents, who has \nmade a lot of waves here recently, talking about the importance of wind \nenergy and talking about the importance of natural gas, said that \nfocusing on speculation is a waste of time.\n  Now, I do not know whether it is a waste of time or whether it is 20 \npercent. But I would ask the majority leader, why are we only going to \nfocus--assuming you are right and speculation is 20 percent of the \nproblem--why are we only going to focus on a 20-percent solution? Why \nnot focus on the 80 percent he is leaving on the table by not talking \nabout supply and demand?\n  Of course, while Congress continues to not do things that might have \nan impact, we have seen, since January 4, 2007--since the Democratic \nmajority took power--the price of gasoline, which was $2.33 a gallon, \ntoday has dropped just a little bit, dropped a nickel, to $4.06 a \ngallon.\n  Here is what Warren Buffet, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire-\nHathaway, told us:\n\n       It's not speculation, it is supply and demand.\n\n  I am not saying this, but let's say somebody would say he is wrong \nand Senator Reid is right, it is 20 percent. How come we are not \ntalking about that remaining 80 percent? That, frankly, is what our \nside of the aisle would like to talk about. We would like to talk about \na 100-percent solution, assuming that is humanly possible.\n  I was in Texas this weekend. Yesterday I hosted a press conference at \nthe Flying J truckstop on I-35 in Waco, TX. I must tell you, all I hear \nfrom my constituents back home is how the high price of gasoline is not \nonly pinching their budget but making it harder for them to get by.\n  I also went to the North Texas Food Bank in Dallas. Of course I \ntalked to a lot of the volunteers and other staff there who are doing \ngreat work providing food for people who are hungry. What they are \ntelling me is that the high price of fuel is increasing the cost of \nfood. Using ethanol, using corn for fuel, is causing additional \npressure on food prices. We are finding that not only are people \nsuffering more at the pump when they go to fill up their tank, actually \nthey are finding it harder to put food on the table, putting more and \nmore pressure on charitable organizations such as the North Texas Food \nBank.\n  Try as we might, there is one law that we simply can no longer refuse \nto acknowledge, and that is the law of supply and demand. We know world \ndemand is going up because rising economies such as China and India, \ncountries of more than 1 billion people each, want more of what we \nhave. They want to be able to buy cars, they want to be able to drive \nthose cars, they want the prosperity that comes with access to energy \nthat we in America have had pretty much to ourselves for a long time.\n  It is important for Congress to realize the one power we do have, \nfrankly, is the power to lift the moratorium on the 85 percent of the \nOuter Continental Shelf where we know there are vast supplies of oil \nand natural gas. For every barrel of oil that we produce in America, \nthat is one barrel less we have to buy from the Middle East, including \nOPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which includes \ncountries such as Iran, or from countries such as Venezuela, from Hugo \nChavez, someone who obviously does not wish us well.\n  We know there are ways to come up with new sources. Unfortunately, \nevery time we bring up new energy sources to try to bring down the \nprice of oil by producing more supply at home we are told we cannot do \nthat; that is, offshore exploration was blocked, oil shale was blocked, \nwhich reportedly accounts for about 2 million additional barrels of oil \nthat we can produce in America, in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. ANWR, a \n2,000-acre postage stamp in a huge expanse of land in the Arctic that \ncould produce as many as 1 million barrels of oil a day, that is \nblocked.\n  It does not just stop there. We say we need to do something about \nrising electricity costs as well, so why can't we build some nuclear \npowerplants? We have been told we cannot do that either; that is \nblocked.\n  Why can't we figure a way to use the coal we have in America? We have \nbeen called the Saudi Arabia of coal. The problem is, coal is dirty. \nBut we have the technology, we have the know-how, I believe, using good \nold-fashioned American ingenuity and our world class institutions of \nhigher education to do the research, to learn how to use it cleanly. \nClean coal research and technology--that has been blocked as well.\n  Increasingly, it sounds as though either we are engaged in a \nnonsolution, if you believe Mr. Buffet--and the majority leader is \ngoing to confine us simply to a speculation provision--or, at best, \naccording to the majority leader's own words, we are only going to be \ndealing with 20 percent of the problem. I think we ought to deal with \n100 percent of the problem. Unfortunately, it seems as though every \ntime we bring up the issue of more domestic supply, our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, who control the floor and control the agenda \nby virtue of their being in the majority, have simply said: No. No.\n  Unfortunately, no new energy continues to mean higher prices for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  On this side of the aisle we have introduced a bill that has the \nsupport of 46 Republicans. We skinnied it down to try to eliminate \ncontroversial issues, and we said: Let's look at the speculation \ncomponent. Let's look at greater transparency. Let's look at putting \nmore cops on the beat, more human resources to make sure we supervise \nand we analyze and we make sure we police the commodity futures market \nfor abuses. But we don't just stop there. We don't stop with a 20-\npercent solution. We provide a comprehensive solution by saying yes to \ndomestic oil supply, using what God has given us in this country in a \nway that will allow us to be less dependent on imported oil from the \nMiddle East.\n  As we continue to do that--and this is the other component of the gas \nprice reduction bill I am referring to, that has 46 cosponsors--we say \nlet's continue to do the research on renewable and alternative fuels \nbecause one day it may well be that we are all driving battery-powered \ncars that we literally plug into the wall socket at night to charge \nthose batteries. That is what the major car companies are going to be \nintroducing into the marketplace in 2010.\n  As we continue to do research in wind energy or solar to generate \nelectricity, we continue to do research into how to use coal to \ntransform it into liquid so we can turn it into aviation fuel. Believe \nit or not, that is what the U.S. Air Force is doing right now. It is \nflying some of its most sophisticated airplanes using synthetic fuel \nmade\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nfrom coal, coal to liquid. The challenge we have, of course, is to try \nto make sure we can sequester the carbon dioxide produced from that.\n  I don't know why every time we try to find more and we try to talk \nabout the importance of conservation that our Democratic friends, \nincluding the majority leader, just simply say no. Why they would offer \neither a nonsolution or a 20-percent solution, depending on whether you \nwant to believe T. Boone Pickens or you want to believe the majority \nleader--T. Boone Pickens, who said just addressing speculation is a \nwaste of time; Warren Buffet, who said it is not speculation but supply \nand demand that is the problem. But let's say the majority leader is \nright, and both of them are wrong. At best we have a 20-percent \nsolution. I think America needs better than that.\n  The strange thing about it is I don't know why we would resist going \nonto this bill and offering amendments that would provide a 100-percent \nsolution to America's energy problems. Find more and use less is the \nformula we would like to see enacted in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is fascinating to come out here and \nlisten to false choices. Let me describe this issue of find more, drill \nmore. I am for drilling. I am for everything. But that is yesterday \nforever. It is the same folks who every 10 years show up and say: Let's \nkeep doing what we have been doing, that sure is good, except the hole \nkeeps getting deeper. If we don't have something that is game changing, \n10 years from now they will be back talking about ``find more.''\n  The false choice is this: This chart shows the National Petroleum \nReserve Alaska. We have made all 23 million acres of it available for \ndrilling. Only 3.8 million acres have been leased. There is more oil in \nthe National Petroleum Reserve Alaska than exists in ANWR. An estimated \n9 million barrels of oil and 60 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are \navailable in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska. Yet some \npolicymakers trot out their little horn ornament called ANWR and say: \nYou have to agree to drill in ANWR or you are not for drilling.\n  How about this? How about this 23 million acres? It is a canard and \nfalse choice to come out and suggest that somehow, as my colleague \nsaid, Democrats are against drilling. That is absurd. It is just not \nthe case.\n  What we need to be for, it seems to me, is something that is game \nchanging, something that says let's not be in this same position 10 \nyears from now. John F. Kennedy didn't say let's try to go to the Moon \nor I would like to think about going to the Moon or maybe we will make \nan effort to go to the Moon. He said: We are going to put a man on the \nMoon by the end of a decade.\n  That is what we ought to do with respect to the change in energy \npolicy. You will get no change from those who come to the floor of the \nSenate and say let's keep doing what we have been doing even though the \nhole is getting deeper.\n  Here is what is happening. We need to do first things first. The \nfirst hurdle in front of us is to shut down the dramatic speculation on \nthe oil futures market. Speculators were 37 percent of the people in \nthe oil futures market in the year 2000. Now oil speculators are 71 \npercent of the market. They have broken the market. There is nothing my \ncolleagues can point to in the last 12 months that happened in supply \nand demand that would justify a doubling of the price of oil--nothing. \nYet, interestingly enough, 47 Members of the other side of the aisle \nhave said speculation is at least part of the problem. In fact, there \nis a provision on speculation in the bill of Senator McConnell, the \nminority leader's bill that was offered in the Senate.\n  If 47 of them believe speculation is part of the problem, let's at \nleast address that first. It seems to me if you are running the \nhurdles, you jump the hurdles in front of you. Why not do this first, \neven as we work on a wide range of other issues as described by my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman? We are drilling, and we should continue to \ndrill in a responsible way in certain areas of the country.\n  I was one of four Senators who helped open lease 181 in the Gulf of \nMexico. It was a big fight. Guess what. It has been open now for a \ncouple of years, and there is not one drilling rig on it because the \noil folks aren't there. Yet they send folks to the floor of the Senate \nto say we need to get Democrats to allow us to drill more. There are 8 \nmillion acres we opened in the Gulf of Mexico. There is substantial new \noil and gas available on those 8 million acres. Yet they are not there \ndrilling. Why?\n  The entire master narrative in this debate in the Senate is the \nminority wanting to say somehow the majority doesn't support drilling. \nIt is a false choice, and they know it.\n  The question is this: Will they support shutting down the excessive \nrelentless speculation in the oil futures markets? Will they support \nthat? Are they going to stand on the side of the oil speculators and \nsay we kind of like what is going on; we like seeing the price of oil \ndouble in a year?\n  Let me point out again that there is nothing that has happened in \nsupply and demand that would remotely justify the doubling of the price \nof oil in a year. Yet they come to the floor with their charts and say: \nProduce more.\n  I am for producing more. It is a false choice to suggest they support \nproducing more and we do not. But the question is, what are you going \nto do to deal with the problem today? Then, what are you going to do as \nwe go forward to suggest something that is really game changing, that \nallows us to be free and escape from the need to rely on Saudis to ship \nus oil?\n  My colleague just described a quote from T. Boone Pickens. He must \nhave forgotten the quote from R. Boone Pickens that says: You can't \ndrill your way out of this mess. You can't drill your way out of this. \nWhat we need to decide as a country is we are not going to have to go \nbegging for oil from the Saudis, from Venezuela, Iraq, and elsewhere \nbecause we have changed our energy mix.\n  So if 47 members of the minority have talked about speculation being \na problem, perhaps we can at least address this first issue. Then we \nshould work on the wide range of other things--substantial \nconservation; substantial new initiatives with respect to energy \nefficiency; yes, more production; and most important, dramatic moves \ntoward renewable energy: wind energy, solar, geothermal, biomass.\n  It is long past the time for this country to decide we are going to \nchange our energy mix. How are you ever going to get to hydrogen fuel \ncell vehicles--or, in the interim, to electric vehicles--if you do not \nget serious about deciding we are going to change our energy future? If \nyou want to be yesterday forever, God bless you, but don't count me \namong you. I don't want to be here 10 years from now--I don't know that \nI would be--but I don't want to be here every single decade to see the \nsame folks coming to the Senate floor to say let's keep digging the \nsame hole. How? Just because drilling is the only answer.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, day after day record-high oil and gasoline \nprices are hurting millions of American consumers and businesses. \nUnless we act, the record-high prices will continue to reverberate \nthroughout our economy, increasing the prices of transportation, food, \nmanufacturing and everything in between, endangering the economic \nsecurity of our people and our Nation.\n  The price of crude oil recently reached a record high price of about \n$147 per barrel. Sky-high crude oil prices have led to record highs in \nthe price of other fuels produced from crude oil, including gasoline, \nheating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. The national average price of \ngasoline is at a record high of about $4.11 per gallon. Jet fuel costs \nnearly $4.30 per gallon. The price of diesel fuel, which is normally \nless expensive than gasoline, has soared to a record high of nearly \n$4.85 per gallon.\n  Rising energy prices greatly increase the cost of getting to work and \ntaking our children to school, traveling by car, truck, air and rail, \nand growing the food we eat and transporting it to market. Rising \nenergy prices greatly increase the cost of producing the\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nmedicines we need for our health, heating our homes and offices, \ngenerating electricity, and manufacturing industrial and consumer \nproducts. The relentless increase in jet fuel prices has caused airline \nlayoffs, fare increases, and service cuts. ``If fuel continues to go \nup, this industry cannot survive in current form,'' the president of \nthe Air Transport Association said recently. Rising diesel prices have \nplaced a crushing burden upon our Nation's truckers, farmers, \nmanufacturers, and other industries.\n  My Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has conducted four \nseparate investigations into how our energy markets operate. Last \nDecember, we had a joint hearing with Senator Dorgan's Senate Energy \nSubcommittee on the role of speculation in rising energy prices. As a \nresult of these investigations and hearings, I have proposed several \nmeasures to address the rampant speculation and lack of regulation of \nenergy markets which have contributed to sky high energy prices.\n  These investigations have shown that one key factor in price spikes \nof energy is increased speculation in the energy markets. Traders are \ntrading contracts for future delivery of oil in record amounts, \ncreating a demand for paper contracts that gets translated into \nincreases in prices and increasing price volatility.\n  Much of this increase in trading of futures has been due to \nspeculation. Speculators in the oil market do not intend to use oil; \ninstead they buy and sell contracts for crude oil in the hope of making \na profit from changing prices. The number of futures and options \ncontracts held by speculators has gone from around 100,000 contracts in \n2001, which was 20 percent of the total number of outstanding \ncontracts, to almost 1.2 million contracts, which represents almost 40 \npercent of the outstanding futures and options contracts in oil on \nNYMEX. Even this understates the increase in speculation, since the \nCFTC data classifies futures trading involving index funds as \ncommercial trading rather than speculation.\n  There are now, as a result, 12 times as many speculative holdings as \nthere were in 2001, while holdings of non-speculative or commercial \nfutures and options are up but 3 times. According to the basic law of \nsupply and demand, the more demand there is to buy futures contracts \nfor the delivery of a commodity, the higher the price will be for those \nfutures contracts.\n  Not surprisingly, therefore, this massive speculation that the price \nof oil will increase, together with the increase in the amount of \npurchases of futures contracts, has, in fact, helped increase the price \nof oil to a level far above the price that is justified by the \ntraditional forces of supply and demand.\n  The president and CEO of Marathon Oil recently said, ``$100 oil isn't \njustified by the physical demand in the market. It has to be \nspeculation on the futures market that is fueling this.'' Mr. Fadel \nGheit, oil analyst for Oppenheimer and Company describes the oil market \nas ``a farce.'' ``The speculators have seized control and it's \nbasically a free-for-all, a global gambling hall, and it won't shut \ndown unless and until responsible governments step in.'' In January of \nthis year, as oil hit $100 a barrel, Mr. Tim Evans, oil analyst for \nCitigroup, wrote ``the larger supply and demand fundamentals do not \nsupport a further rise and are, in fact, more consistent with lower \nprice levels.'' At the joint hearing on the effects of speculation we \nheld last December, Dr. Edward Krapels, a financial market analyst, \ntestified, ``Of course financial trading, speculation affects the price \nof oil because it affects the price of everything we trade . . . It \nwould be amazing if oil somehow escaped this effect.'' Dr. Krapels \nadded that as a result of this speculation, ``There is a bubble in oil \nprices.''\n  The need to control speculation is urgent. The presidents and CEOs of \nmajor U.S. airlines recently warned about the disastrous effects of \nrampant speculation on the airline industry. The CEOs stated ``normal \nmarket forces are being dangerously amplified by poorly regulated \nmarket speculation.'' The CEOs wrote, ``For airlines, ultra-expensive \nfuel means thousands of lost jobs and severe reductions in air service \nto both large and small communities.''\n  As to reining in speculation, the first step to take is to put a cop \nback on the beat in all our energy markets to prevent excessive \nspeculation, price manipulation, and trading abuses. In the spring of \n2001, when my Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations began \ninvestigating our energy markets, the price of a gallon of gasoline had \nspiked upwards by about 25 cents over the course of the Memorial Day \nholiday. We subpoenaed records from major oil companies and interviewed \noil industry experts, gas station dealers, antitrust experts, gasoline \nwholesalers and distributors, and oil company executives. We examined \nthousands of prices at gas stations in Michigan, Ohio, California, and \nother States. In the spring of 2002, I released a 400-page report and \nheld 2 days of hearings on the results of the investigation.\n  The investigation found that increasing concentration in the gasoline \nrefining industry, due to a large number of recent mergers and \nacquisitions, was one of the causes of the increasing number of \ngasoline price spikes. Another factor causing price spikes was the \nincreasing tendency of refiners to keep lower inventories of gasoline. \nWe also found a number of instances in which the increasing \nconcentration in the refining industry was also leading to higher \nprices in general. Limitations on the pipeline that brings gasoline \ninto my home State of Michigan were another cause of price increases \nand spikes in Michigan. The report recommended that the Federal Trade \nCommission carefully investigate proposed mergers, particularly with \nrespect to the effect of mergers on inventories of gasoline.\n  The investigation discovered one instance in which a major oil \ncompany was considering ways to prevent other refiners from supplying \ngasoline to the Midwest so that prices would increase.\n  In March 2003, my subcommittee released a second report detailing how \nthe operation of crude oil markets affects the price of not only \ngasoline, but also key commodities like home heating oil, jet fuel, and \ndiesel fuel. The report warned that U.S. energy markets were vulnerable \nto price manipulation due to a lack of comprehensive regulation and \nmarket oversight.\n  For years I have been working with Senators Feinstein, Dorgan, Snowe, \nBingaman, Cantwell, and others on legislation to restore some \nregulatory authority in the energy markets that had been exempted from \nregulation because of an ``Enron loophole'' that was inserted at the \nlast minute into an omnibus appropriation bill in December 2000. For 2 \nyears we attempted to close the Enron loophole, but efforts to put the \ncop back on the beat in these markets were unsuccessful, due to \nopposition from the Bush administration, large energy companies, and \nlarge financial institutions that trade energy commodities.\n  In June 2006, I released another subcommittee report, ``The Role of \nMarket Speculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put a Cop on \nthe Beat.'' This report found that the traditional forces of supply and \ndemand didn't account for sustained price increases and price \nvolatility in the oil and gasoline markets. The report concluded that, \nin 2006, a growing number of trades of contracts for future delivery of \noil occurred without regulatory oversight and that market speculation \nhad contributed to rising oil and gasoline prices, perhaps accounting \nfor $20 out of a then-priced $70 barrel of oil.\n  That subcommittee report, again, recommended new laws to provide \nmarket oversight and stop excessive speculation and market \nmanipulation. I coauthored legislation with Senators Feinstein, Snowe, \nCantwell, Bingaman, and others to improve oversight of the unregulated \nenergy markets. Once again, opposition from the Bush administration, \nlarge energy traders, and the financial industry prevented the full \nSenate from considering this legislation.\n  In 2007, my subcommittee addressed the sharp rise in natural gas \nprices and released a fourth report, entitled ``Excessive Speculation \nin the Natural Gas Market.'' Our investigation showed that speculation \nby a single hedge fund named Amaranth had distorted natural gas prices \nduring the summer of 2006, and drove up prices for average consumers. \nThe report also demonstrated how Amaranth had shifted its speculative \nactivity to unregulated markets to\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\navoid the restrictions and oversight in the regulated markets, and how \nAmaranth's trading in the unregulated markets contributed to price \nincreases.\n  Following this investigation, I introduced a new bill, S. 2058, to \nclose the Enron loophole and regulate the unregulated electronic energy \nmarkets. Working again with Senators Feinstein and Snowe, and with the \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee in a bipartisan effort, we finally \nmanaged to include an amendment to close the Enron loophole in the farm \nbill that was then being considered by the Senate. Although the CFTC's \nnew enforcement authority over these electronic markets was effective \nupon passage of this legislation, much of the CFTC's new oversight \nauthority will have to be implemented through CFTC rulemaking.\n  Although the legislation to close the Enron loophole is important to \nreduce speculation in energy markets, it is not sufficient because a \nsignificant amount of U.S. crude oil and gasoline trading now takes \nplace in the United Kingdom, beyond the direct reach of U.S. \nregulators. So we have to address that second loophole too.\n  One of the key energy commodity markets for U.S. crude oil and \ngasoline trading is now located in London, regulated by the British \nagency called the Financial Services Authority, FSA. However, the \nBritish regulators traditionally have not imposed any limits on \nspeculation like we do here in the United States, and the British do \nnot make public the same type of trading data that we do, i.e. it is \nless transparent. This means that traders can avoid the limits on \nspeculation in crude oil imposed on the New York exchanges by trading \non the London exchange. This is what is referred to as ``the London \nloophole.''\n  The Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act--Energy Speculation Act--\nwhich the majority leader and others recently introduced to address \nhigh prices and reduce speculation, includes a number of provisions \nthat will help stop rampant speculation and increase our access to \ntimely and important trading information and ensure that there is \nadequate market oversight of the trading of U.S. energy commodities no \nmatter where the trading occurs. One of the key provisions in the \nEnergy Speculation Act would close the London loophole.\n  The Energy Speculation Act would close the London loophole by \nrequiring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to determine \nwhether a foreign exchange imposes comparable speculative limits and \ncomparable reporting requirements on speculators that the CFTC imposes \non U.S. exchanges prior to allowing traders in the U.S. trading U.S. \nenergy commodities to access that exchange through a terminal located \nin this country. It would also give the CFTC authority to take action, \nsuch as by requiring traders to reduce their holdings, in the event \nthat traders exceed these limits.\n  The legislation in the Energy Speculation Act to close the London \nloophole is very similar to legislation I previously introduced with \nSenators Feinstein, Durbin, Dorgan and Bingaman, S. 3129, to close this \nloophole. The legislation we introduced was also incorporated into \nlegislation introduced by Senator Durbin, S. 3130, which, like the \nprovisions of the Energy Speculation Act, would give the CFTC more \nresources and to obtain better information about index trading and the \nswaps market.\n  After these two bills were introduced, the CFTC imposed more \nstringent conditions upon the ICE Futures Exchange's ability to operate \nin the United States--for the first time insisting that the London \nexchange impose and enforce comparable position limits in order to be \nallowed to keep its trading terminals in the United States. This is the \nvery action our legislation called for.\n  Although the CFTC has taken these important steps that will go a long \nway towards closing the London loophole, Congress should still pass the \nlegislation to make sure the London loophole is closed. The Energy \nSpeculation Act would put into statute the conditions the CFTC has \nstated the London exchange must meet before it will allow it to operate \nits terminals in the United States, and it would ensure that the CFTC \nhas clear authority to take action against any U.S. trader who is \nexcessively speculating through the London exchange or manipulating the \nprice of a commodity, including requiring that trader to reduce \nholdings.\n  There is also concern that some large traders may be avoiding the \nlimits on holdings and accountability levels that apply to trading on \nthe regulated futures exchanges by trading in the unregulated OTC \nmarket. In the absence of data or reporting on the activity in the OTC \nmarket, however, it is difficult to estimate the impact of this large \namount of unregulated trading on commodity prices. Moreover, even if we \nwere to get better information about unregulated over-the-counter \ntrades, the CFTC has no authority to take action to prevent excessive \nspeculation or price manipulation resulting from this unregulated \ntrading.\n  The legislation to close the Enron loophole placed OTC electronic \nexchanges under CFTC regulation. However, this legislation did not \naddress the separate issue of trading in the rest of the unregulated \nOTC market, which includes bilateral trades of swaps through voice \nbrokers, swap dealers, and direct party-to-party negotiations.\n  I recently introduced, along with Senator Feinstein, the Over-the-\nCounter Speculation Act, legislation that addresses the rest of the OTC \nmarket, a large portion of which consists of the trading of swaps \nrelating to the price of a commodity. Generally, commodity swaps are \ncontracts between two parties where one party pays a fixed price to \nanother party in return for some type of payment at a future time \ndepending on the price of a commodity. Because some of these swap \ninstruments look very much like futures contracts--except that they do \nnot call for the actual delivery of the commodity--there is concern \nthat the price of these swaps that are traded in the unregulated OTC \nmarket could affect the price of the very similar futures contracts \nthat are traded on the regulated futures markets. We don't yet know for \nsure that this is the case, or that it is not, because we don't have \nany data or reporting on the trading of these swaps in the OTC market.\n  The Energy Speculation Act introduced by the Majority Leader and \nothers includes this legislation to give the CFTC oversight authority \nto stop excessive speculation in the over-the-counter market. These \nprovisions in the Energy Speculation Act and in our Over-the-Counter \nSpeculation Act represent a practical, workable approach that will \nenable the CFTC to obtain key information about the OTC market to \nenable it to prevent excessive speculation and price manipulation.\n  This legislation will ensure that large traders cannot avoid the CFTC \nreporting requirements by trading swaps in the unregulated OTC market \ninstead of regulated exchanges. It will ensure that the CFTC can take \nappropriate action, such as by requiring reductions in holdings of \nfutures contracts or swaps, against traders with large positions in \norder to prevent excessive speculation or price manipulation regardless \nof whether the trader's position is on an exchange or in the OTC \nmarket. The approach in this bill is both practical and workable.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to proceed to the Stop \nExcessive Energy Speculation Act. This legislation contains several \nimportant provisions that will address the problem of excessive \nspeculation that has been contributing to high commodity prices.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to use the remaining time, including the remaining leader's \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is good to be with you today to talk \nabout this. Before we begin a vote on a serious subject matter, it is \ngood to talk to you about a few issues and thoughts I have about what \nis happening and what should be happening during the next 2 weeks in \nthe Congress.\n  This morning millions of Americans woke up to another costly commute \nto their workplace. They paid over $4 per gallon to fill their tanks. \nYou will recall that 18 months ago it cost them about $2.60 to purchase \nthe same amount of gasoline.\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\n  Family budgets are hurting. On average, the American family will \nspend $2,200 more for gasoline this year compared to last year. A \nnumber of surveys suggest that Americans are driving less because the \nincreased price at the pump is too much a strain on their lives. They \nare turning to us, their elected representatives, and they are looking \nfor real leadership. Sometimes I wonder whether they have given up or \nwhether they actually expect us to do something. I suggest we ought to \ndo something, and any effort on the part of the majority to make this a \ncouple a day event with a vote on each side or perhaps no votes or no \namendments by Republicans, let me say that will not be accepted with \nvery much enthusiasm by the minority, and the Republicans will insist \nthat we stay here until we have had an opportunity to vote on \nsignificant amendments that we think the American people are entitled \nto have put before the Senate.\n  It seems to me the American people are turning to us, their elected \nrepresentatives, and asking and looking for some leadership. In \noverwhelming majorities, the American people are clamoring for more \nenergy production at home. If any oil production or natural gas \nproduction exists that we own, which we are not allowing to be \nproduced, the American people are saying: Why not? In fact, they are \nsaying why not open it; let's see what it yields, what it does for us.\n  The message is clear: Americans are saying we need to drill for more \nAmerican oil. Now, anything short of allowing up-or-down votes on \namendments that will determine whether we honor the request of the \nAmerican people to drill for more American oil--whether we are going to \nbe permitted to do that is obviously in the hands of the Democratic \nleader. But I believe we will do our share as the minority--49 of us--\nto make sure the American people understand whether they are getting a \nfair shake by us getting a fair shake here on the floor on amendments \nthat would inure to the benefit of the American people. The majority \nhas offered a speculation bill, so far, and that is all we have seen. \nIn the midst of this clarion call from the American people, it now \nappears my friends on the other side of the aisle might have to be \ndragged kicking and screaming to even debate whether we need to produce \nmore energy.\n  After a litany of stale proposals that were rejected--including a \nwindfall profits tax, price gouging, manufacturing taxes, cap-and-trade \ntaxes, and lawsuits against OPEC--the majority seems content to hang \nits hat on the speculation bill, and a possible ``use it or lose it'' \npolicy. As I speak, it appears that the majority drafts in secret a \npolicy that claims to advocate lower prices while not actually \nincreasing production, and the American people, I believe, will grow \nmore and more impatient, and it will not be hard for them to understand \nwhat we are saying as we tell them their impatience is justified.\n  I wish to address the ``use it or lose it'' issue. You understand \nthat the other side is saying, as far as offshore drilling, there are \nalready leases that exist, where we have given oil companies, large and \nsmall, the right to drill for oil or gas under the conditions of the \nleases that went forth. They were obtained by the oil companies, large \nand small, by bids. Some bids were very high, some were not so high. \nAll in all, there are a lot of oil companies that have the right to \ndrill. So the other side is asking, how many acres do they have the \nright to drill upon? And now they are sitting around trying to draft \nlegislation that says they are not using that land they leased from us; \nthey are not using it as much as they should, and we want to pass a law \nthat says: Use it as we prescribe in this new law or lose it.\n  They are going to try to tell the American people that is the way to \nget more oil out of parts of the coastal areas of America--\nunderstanding they are already leased. Oil companies already have paid \nmoney and oil companies are probably already doing everything they can \nto maximize their return on those leases. Yet, since there are a lot of \nacres, some of which have not yet produced, they are saying let's look \nat them and that is where we can get this new oil for America.\n  We say that is not true. Those leases are time-certain leases, all of \nthem. They are either 5-year or 8-year or 10-year leases. However many \nmillions of acres it is, that is what they are. If you don't produce \nwithin the timeframe allowed in the leases--5, 8, or 10 years--then you \nlose the lease. That is already the law. You already lose it based upon \nthe leases you have.\n  Let's talk about this idea a little more. This idea was dreamed up in \nan argument first originated by the Wilderness Society. They claimed \nthat oil companies were sitting on leases, and that if those companies \ndeveloped those areas, we would not need to open new ones. If only that \nwere true, what a wonderful bonanza we would have for the American \npeople. It is not true. The other side is now saying oil companies must \nuse it or lose it when it comes to these leases. They have proposed \nadding a tax on companies to punish them for not producing fast enough. \nThis Wilderness Society argument demonstrates a fundamental lack of \nunderstanding of how we explore for oil and gas in this country. And \nthe fact that this argument originates with a group that has led at \nleast four major lawsuits in the past 4 years to prevent development in \nthese very same areas speaks to how disingenuous it is. Part of the \nreason it takes so long for companies to produce is because groups such \nas the Wilderness Society keep throwing up roadblocks.\n  Companies are paying lots of money for the right to explore on a \nlease and are given a short period of time to produce oil. That is the \nway it is today already. We don't need a new law for that. We don't \nneed new legislation now, when we have a limited amount of time--\nperhaps 2 or 3 weeks--to debate energy legislation. With the cost of \noil at $135 per barrel now, why on Earth would a lessee intentionally \nsit on a lease and choose not to make money on it?\n  Why would a company pay money essentially to rent a tract of land and \nthen not use it? I heard the claim that 41 million acres is leased on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf and that acreage, 33 million acres, is not \nbeing produced. The use of this statistic shows a fundamental lack of \nunderstanding of the long, risky process that begins even before \nbidding on a lease and hopefully ends with production. The other side \nis saying that unless oil is literally coming out of the ground on an \nacre, it doesn't count. Even if the acre is being explored or is in the \nprocess of getting an environmental permit or is in any way part of a \nprocess that is going on, it doesn't count. Additionally, the use of \nthis argument by groups that consistently go to court to prevent \ndevelopment on existing lease areas speaks volumes about the intent \nhere. Congress currently restricts access to 574 million acres in the \nOuter Continental Shelf. It actually is clear by any measurable \nassessment that the majority in Congress is ``sitting on'' far more oil \nthan the oil companies themselves.\n  There are many different steps toward producing oil, and that, at any \ngiven moment, may not be producing but is active and under development. \nIn the 5, 8, and 10 years that a company holds a lease, environmental \nassessments could be underway. Lessees could be trying to secure \npermits. The leasing agency could be challenged in litigation and could \nbe reviewing seismic data. All of this takes time. So you look out \nthere and say: It is leased, but it isn't producing yet. Of course not. \nIf somebody tried to produce too quickly, they would be challenged for \nnot spending enough time under the environmental permit laws doing what \nis required before one can drill.\n  There are many upfront costs that leaseholders take, that they have \nto do if they are going to acquire an oil and gas lease. Bonus payments \nand production, rental payments often cost millions of dollars, and \nthese capital investments are only being made for the ultimate \ndevelopment and production of oil to return a profit on their \ninvestment. Simply put, if oil is not produced from a lease, the \ncompanies lose money on it.\n  To claim that companies are ``sitting on'' $135 oil simply ignores \nthe historical fact that because you lease lands does not necessarily \nmean you are able technically or economically to produce on them or \neven that there is oil under your lease. But you are entitled to keep \nit and try to make it productive for the length of time that the lease \nprescribes within the contents and terms of the document--5 years, 8 \nyears, or 10 years.\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\n  Finally, we should point out that the majority already has a ``use it \nor lose it'' policy. If you are not producing when the term of the \nlease expires, you turn it back. So this argument really is a fallacy. \nI have said this before on the floor. It seems as if the more it is \nsaid, the more it is documented, the more the other side claims that \nthere are many leases that we should force the lessees to give the land \nback or produce under some new slogan called ``use it or lose it.''\n  As the specter of a limited debate lingers with minimal or no \nopportunity for amendment on this bill, the American family budget \ncontinues to be squeezed. Mr. President, 83 days after introducing the \nAmerican Energy Production Act of 2008, I continue offering a new \ndirection.\n  In 2006, we opened 8 million acres in the Outer Continental Shelf for \nleasing. This area contained an estimated 1.2 billion barrels of oil \nand nearly 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. In March of this year, \ntwo lease sales on the eastern and central Gulf of Mexico attracted \nmore than $3.2 billion in high bids, upfront bids--a very high payment. \nThe first sale in the central gulf was the largest sale in the history \nof deepwater OCS leases.\n  This area is America's new frontier. Today, there are more than 7,000 \nleases in the Gulf of Mexico that provide 25 percent of the oil \nproduced in the United States and 15 percent of the natural gas \nproduced in the country. The Department of Interior estimates that \n300,000 jobs are directly related to gulf energy exploration and the \nproduction that comes from that exploration.\n  As a result of the Gulf of Mexico Security Act, the coastal States \nstand to reap great benefits from the production of gas through revenue \nsharing of oil and gas. The following rough estimate provides a window \ninto the opportunity available to other States. According to the \nMinerals Management Service, Gulf States could receive more than $425 \nmillion in oil and gas revenues by 2013, $2.6 billion over the coming \ndecade, and over $30 billion over the next 30 years. Yes, those are \naccurate estimates. That is what other States--not all of them but some \nother States--that are on our coasts that might agree to let us look in \nexchange for giving them the same kind of return we gave Louisiana, \nMississippi, and the surrounding States, that is what they could look \nfor. These are huge sums that will be raised and returned to the States \nthrough the production of our own energy resources.\n  They seek to allow coastal States on the Atlantic and Pacific to \nshare in the energy opportunity. I know there are various opinions as \nto how many we will find there, but we will never know so long as we \nkeep it locked up, which we have done for 26 to 27 years, where nobody \nwould know and tried to hide it from the American people as if it did \nnot belong to them and it was not any good. The truth is, it is theirs \nin absolute honest-to-God ownership, and it can produce crude oil of \nthe best type and oil in large quantities.\n  Let's hope that what we do in this area is equal to nearly all the \noil produced in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 50 years and is greater \nthan all the oil imported into the United States from the Persian Gulf \nin 15 years.\n  This is a big opportunity for the American people, but the majority \nseems content with small ideas. Within two Congresses, we have passed \ntwo major pieces of energy legislation. These two bills were monumental \nundertakings and required months of deliberation to bring to fruition.\n  Last Congress, we had EPACT05 on the floor of the Senate for 10 days. \nWe had 23 rollcall votes on the bill, including 19 just for amendments. \nWe had filed 235 amendments to that bill; 57 of them were accepted. \nThat bill took 4 months from the introduction before we sent it to the \nPresident.\n  Last year's Energy bill took almost a year before we had something we \ncould send to the White House. That bill was on the Senate floor for 15 \ndays and had a total of 22 rollcall votes. We filed 331 amendments to \nthat bill and accepted 49 of them.\n  The majority leader seeks to limit the amendment process in a \nsignificant way. I trust we will have the staying power to at least \nhave an opportunity for multiple amendments in the area we are speaking \nof because the American people deserve it and the American people \nshould have it.\n  I have completed my remarks. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 10 minutes \nunder the order. I yield 5 minutes of that time to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, all of us who go home and listen to our \nconstituents each weekend know one thing and one thing only is on their \nmind these days; that is, the rising price of gas. I have made a habit \nof writing down what I pay each weekend when I fly out to Washington \nState, and when it hit $4 a month or so ago, I was aghast. Imagine what \neveryone filling their tank in Washington State is thinking now that \nthe price in my home State is pushing $4.50 a gallon. We need action. \nWe need action now.\n  For months, Democrats have been trying to address this problem by \nproviding short-term relief along with a long-term strategy. For \nmonths, we have heard only two things from our friends on the other \nside of the aisle: No, and drill. Democrats know there is no silver \nbullet to this crisis. It is going to take a series of steps, both \nshort term and long term, to bring some sanity back to the situation.\n  Today, we are going to vote on another of those short-term solutions, \nand we are going to try to end excessive speculation in the markets. \nDemocrats believe we have to rein in Wall Street and our traders who \nare unfairly driving up these oil prices. With regard for nothing but \ntheir own profits, some traders are bidding up oil prices by buying \nhuge quantities of oil just to resell it at an even higher price. For \nnearly 8 years now, the Bush administration has turned a blind eye and \nlet these questionable practices continue with virtually no oversight. \nSome experts are saying this kind of trading now accounts for 20 to 30 \npercent of what we pay at the pump.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, was on the floor earlier and \nasked for specific citations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record remarks from a series of economists, such as \nGerry Ramm of the Petroleum Marketers Association, the Acting Chairman \nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the former Director of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and others.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Economist Mark Zandi Said Speculation Played a Role in \n     Driving Up Oil Prices. Asked if he believed speculation \n     played a role in driving up oil prices, Zandi responded, \n     ``Yes, I believe so, yes. The oil market has become a \n     financial market. And it's affected by all kinds of \n     speculators, momentum players, people just betting on prices \n     increasing or falling, in this case, obviously, increasing. \n     And so they ran in quickly and drove up the price. And that \n     clearly has played a role. I mean, you don't see a $10 move \n     in the price of oil without some financial speculation in-\n     volved, as well.'' [PBS Online Newshour,\n     6/6/08]\n       Gerry Ramm of the Petroleum Marketers Association of \n     America Blamed Speculation for Driving Up Oil Prices. \n     ``Excessive speculation on energy trading facilities is the \n     fuel that is driving this runaway train in crude oil prices \n     today.

Walter Lukken, Acting \n     Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \n     conceded that crude \n     oil markets are ``ripe for those wanting to \n     illegally manipulate the markets.'' [CNBC,\n     06/17/08]\n       Former Director of Commodity Futures Trading Commission's \n     Trade Division Michael Greenberger Said Speculation Went \n     Beyond Supply-and-Demand Problem in Oil Market. Michael \n     Greenberger, a former top staffer at the Commodities Futures \n     Trading Commission, said, ``There can be no doubt that there \n     is a supply-and-demand problem at work here. But many \n     believe, including me, that there's a speculative premium \n     that goes beyond what supply-and-demand factors dictate. And \n     that's what could be drained with aggressive United States \n     regulation.'' [McClatchy, interview of Michael Greenberger, \n     6/17/08]\n       Greenberger Calculated 70 Percent of Oil Market is Driven \n     by Speculators, Rather Than Those With Commercial Interests. \n     ``My calculation is right now that about--at least 70 percent \n     of the U.S. crude oil market is driven by speculators and not \n     people with\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\n     commercial interests. Most of those speculators do not have \n     spec limits. They can buy whatever they want.''

When Michael Greenberger, a \n     former top staffer at the Commodities Futures Trading \n     Commission, was asked how much oil speculation increased \n     costs per barrel of oil, he replied, ``Well, there have been \n     various estimates--anywhere from 25 percent to 50 percent.'' \n     [CBS News, 06/17/08]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act \nof 2008 that the Senate is going to move to proceed to will shine a \nlight on those trading markets. It will increase oversight and \nreporting on oil trading, and it will significantly improve the \nresources available to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While \naddressing speculation is not the silver bullet that will bring prices \ndown at the pump, we do believe that by increasing our oversight and \nregulation, we will ensure that consumers are better protected in the \nmonths and years to come.\n  Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, our friends on the other side \nhave their message down pretty pat now. They say no to any reasonable \nsolutions we offer, and then they turn around and say we just need to \ndrill more. We say fast-track our domestic production. They say no. We \nsay increase the supply of oil now. They say no. We say accelerate \ninvestments in alternative energy to help break that addiction to oil. \nThey say no. And now we say end excessive speculation. I hope they \nwon't say no again.\n  Do they offer anything more than no? Well, yes. They say drill, \ndrill, and drill--a plan that even their party's leaders said has \nmainly psychological benefits, a plan that even President Bush's own \nteam says will not affect our oil prices, and a plan that will not \nproduce a drop of oil for 7 to 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, their plan on that side is nothing more than a \ncontinuation of the Bush-Cheney big oil love affair that got us into \nthis mess in the first place. Republicans seem committed to fattening \nbig oil's bottom line. Well, Democrats are more worried about your \nbottom line.\n  The oil companies made $250 billion last year. It is time for us to \ndeal with consumer prices. We have tried to do things the Republican \nway for 8 years now and unfortunately what we hear from them today is \nmore gimmicks and tired old ideas, the same status quo.\n  With record gas prices and our economy spiraling deeper into \nrecession, Democrats think it is long past time for a bold new \ndirection. We hope our Republican counterparts will join us today and \nmove this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to use leader time to complete my \nstatement over and above the 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American people, I am sure, viewing our \nproceedings here in the Senate or from the visitors gallery or on C-\nSPAN must think they are watching an episode of the ``Twilight Zone.'' \nThe reason I say that is yesterday morning, Senator McConnell and I \nboth opened with statements about our national energy crisis. We both \ntalked about the plan we had and the pain that high gas prices are \ncausing the American people.\n  Recently, I mentioned a public school teacher--he delivered the \nSaturday address for us--and his wife who live in upstate New York who \nare now spending all of the money they saved for their children's \ncollege education to pay for gasoline.\n  Senator McConnell, for his part, talked about the frustration of \ntruckers, stay-at-home parents, commuters, and vacationers. Anyone \nwatching our two sides talk about the gas prices must have gotten a \nlittle confused. They must have been saying to themselves: If they both \nagree on the problem, why can't they work together to find a solution? \nThe reason for that is very simple: Republicans and Senate Republicans \nrefuse to join in negotiating in any way. They refuse to legislate. \nThey, in fact, refused to take ``yes'' for an answer. We are shortly \nvoting on cloture to proceed on legislation to stem the excessive \nspeculation on Wall Street that is contributing to high gas prices.\n  Is this the only problem? Of course not. But it is a problem, \nabsolutely. Democrats have said from the start that curbing speculation \nis not a panacea and will not solve all of our energy problems with the \nsnap of our fingers.\n  But there was a Republican Senator on the floor today who asked a \nquestion: Who is saying this speculation accounts for 20 to 50 percent \nof the price of gasoline? We have laid those names in the Record. There \nis no doubt that it is a major part of the problem. The Republicans \nacknowledged that by putting that provision in their so-called energy \nbill.\n  But with experts saying that speculation accounts for 20, 30, even 50 \npercent of the price of gasoline, there is no doubt there is a major \nproblem. How does excessive speculation drive up prices in the short \nterm? Wall Street traders simply buy oil, sell it, and I repeat, as \nthey do: They buy, they sell, they buy, bidding the price ever higher. \nThey never intend to actually own or use the oil they buy, they only \nkeep buying and selling and pocketing the profits. The problem is the \nAmerican people are stuck paying the bill every time we fill our gas \ntanks.\n  This kind of unlimited energy speculation was not even legal 8 years \nago for traders who never intended to buy or sell or use the commodity. \nBack then you would have to actually take delivery of the oil you \nbought or face position limits on your trading. Few Wall Street firms \nwanted tankers pulling up to their front doors with barrels of oil.\n  The market price of oil was decided by honest people in the \nmarketplace, the so-called supply-and-demand factor. Then the \nRepublican Congress stepped in and allowed oil to be traded back and \nforth without even delivery of the oil. That effort was led by former \nSenator Phil Gramm, chairman of the Banking Committee, a long-time \nmember of the Finance Committee, the same Phil Gramm who served as \nSenator McCain's economic adviser until yesterday, and recently called \nAmerica a nation of whiners.\n  This is the same guy who has set forth his speculation aspect of what \nis hurting the market so badly. Senator Gramm's bill created a mouse \nclick; that is, you touch your computer and you can buy lots of oil you \nwill never use and never want to use.\n  The Bush administration has done nothing to oversee this. Now the \nAmerican people are suffering the consequences. Nothing is ever certain \nin the energy market. But if our legislation to provide new consumer \nprotections on speculation becomes law, it should immediately and \nsustainably lower prices.\n  Democrats are not the ones who think so. I do not know the party \naffiliation of the people whose names I am going to list, the experts: \nFormer CFTC Trade Division Director and current economics professor at \nthe University of Maryland, Michael Greenberger. He says the price is \nfrom 20 to 50 percent because of speculation.\n  Consumer advocate Mark Cooper says the same. And even the senior vice \npresident of ExxonMobil, Stephen Simon, says speculation is part of the \nproblem; even Exxon. We have a man who serves as the chief executive \nofficer of United Airlines, Glenn Tilton. Here is a man who was \npresident of Texaco, vice chairman of Chevron, and he says speculation \nis a big problem and we have to do something about it and do it right \naway.\n  So my Republican colleagues who say speculation is not an issue, here \nare a few of the people who agree with us. And obviously, the \nRepublicans must have thought in the old days, a couple of weeks ago, \nthat it was a problem because they stuck it in their legislation. Now \nthey say it is not important.\n  But my friends on the other side of the aisle have said in speeches \nand press conferences that we should do something about speculation--\nthat is what they used to say. It has been a component of their energy \nplan. In fact, Senator McConnell said on the floor yesterday, \n``strengthening regulation of the futures market is a worthwhile piece \nof the legislative effort.''\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\n  The American people must be thinking, Democrats and Republicans do \nnot agree on much, but they seem to agree that curbing excessive energy \nspeculation is part of the solution. If we did nothing else but pass \nthe speculation bill, the American people would be very happy, and the \nmarkets would be struck quickly and the price of oil would go down.\n  Yet now that a reasonable and responsible speculation bill has \nreached the floor, Republicans seem to be scurrying into the corners \nand shadows of this Capitol complex. Now that we have an opportunity to \nactually do something to deliver some relief to the American people, \nall Republicans want to talk about now is drilling. They are so happy \nthat the oil companies are running full-page ads about drilling.\n  Democrats have shown how serious we are about addressing this \nproblem. We have said to the Republicans: Along with our speculation \nbill, let's vote on your offshore drilling. That is what you said is \nthe problem. Let's drill some more. Let the Governors decide what \nshould happen on the Outer Continental Shelf. They said that is what \nthe problem is. Let's do something about it.\n\n  And we said: Okay, let's vote on that. Well, they say: No, that is \nnot a good idea. Even though we believe in that and we have talked \nabout for months how important drilling is, we want 27 other \namendments. We do not want to do anything about speculation, and we do \nnot even want to have a vote on drilling unless you give us 27 other \namendments.\n  Let's assume that Republicans would allow a vote on their amendment, \nand we have a vote on a Democratic drilling amendment. You see, we are \nnot opposed to drilling. Democrats are not opposed to drilling. We \nbelieve the future is ahead of us, and we believe the oil companies \nshould use the 68 million acres they now have; the 8.3 million acres \nthat we worked on less than 2 years ago to give them the ability to \ntake a look in the Gulf of Mexico. They said it was so important to do \nthat. They have not done anything about that. I do not think they have \ngone fishing out there, let alone doing any exploration out there. \nThere are 8.3 million acres; they have not done a thing with it. We \nhave 25 million acres in Alaska that are subject to being drilled right \nnow. All the White House has to do is let some more of these leases.\n  So we are not opposed to drilling. But we are saying: Use the 68 \nmillion acres. Take a look at all the other land available. This \ndrilling is a political thing for the Republicans. Simple math \nindicates we control, counting ANWR--which, by the way, McCain is now \nagainst; he does not want to drill in ANWR. But let's assume you take \nANWR and all the other offshore issues they are talking about. That is \nless than 3 percent of the oil in the world. We use more than 25 \npercent of the oil every day. We cannot drill our way out of the \nproblems we have.\n  So we think it does not make sense to start giving up more acres of \nAmerican coastline in addition to the 68 million, plus the 25 million \nacres in Alaska. We believe it makes sense to open more coastal areas \nfor drilling. We say: Go ahead and do that. The President has the \nauthority to do that.\n  Time Magazine this week, the one that is on the newsstands today--I \ntore a page out of it: The offshore waiting game. They have a little \npiece of literature here. They say it is going to take a long time. \nHere is why: It will take up to 2 years for oil companies to survey \nsites and bid on available leases. It will take up to 2 years for the \nhighest bidders to do seismic tests and analyze the results. It will \ntake up to 3 years for exploratory drilling. It will take up to 2 years \nif oil is discovered; plans for platforms and pipelines are submitted \nfor Government review. It will take another year to review that. It \nwill take up to 3 years for oil companies to build platforms and \npipelines. And finally the oil is pumped out.\n  Add those numbers together and it is about 15 years. Well, what we \nsay, we are not opposed to drilling, but there are lots of places we \ncan be drilling right now. So the American people cannot wait all of \nthese years. Increasing production is important, but even Republicans \nmust admit it will do absolutely nothing to lower prices in the near \nterm.\n  Nevertheless, Republicans have called for a vote on their offshore \ndrilling plan. We are willing to give them what they want. They are not \nwilling to take ``yes'' for an answer.\n  I hope all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, would vote to invoke \ncloture on the speculation bill, that we can go forward with that, have \na vote on their drilling, and we have read all of the ads the oil \ncompanies have paid for, and the Republicans have followed step by step \nwhat the oil companies want. We are willing to give them a vote on \nthat. I do not know how we can be more fair than that. All we want is \nthe opportunity to vote on what we think is important too.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\n12:30 be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, \nand that the time during the caucus recess count postcloture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I now seek recognition in my own right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there is a buzz on the floor. I would \nlike regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Can I get the Chamber to come to \norder, please.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The reason I have asked to be heard is because my constituents want \nto be heard. I am here today to speak on the Senate floor about the \nskyrocketing high prices at the pump, which are really hurting my \nconstituents. They are hurting families, they are hurting small \nbusinesses, and they are hurting all of our volunteer efforts.\n  Gas prices in my State have dramatically increased. In March of last \nyear, 2007, gas prices were at $2.50 a gallon. They have now \nskyrocketed to $4 a gallon. There has been a $1.50 increase in a little \nover a year. My Maryland families are now paying $5,000 per year on \ngas. That is up from $3,200 a year when George Bush took office.\n  In the Federal Government's budget, $2,000 might not be a lot, but in \na family budget it is a budget buster. Look what you can do for $2,000. \nNo. 1, if you are a senior, it pays for the doughnut hole so you can \nget your prescriptions filled. If you are a family, that is enough to \nsend one of your children to a community college.\n  Yes, $2,000 makes a big difference. Maryland families are stretched \nand strained. Gas prices drive their lives, and they feel as though \nthey are running on empty. Gas and groceries go together. When gas goes \nup, so do groceries because of just the added cost of delivering them.\n  When you talk to families, they are struck with incredible anxiety, \nwondering where is this going to end. The cost of commuting has more \nthan doubled or is even close to tripling for many of our families.\n  Families are now asking how do they get their kids to school or to \nsoccer practice or to other activities.\n  Seniors are wondering how do they cluster their medical appointments \nso if they live in the rural part of my State, they can drive to the \ndoctor they need, while wondering about how they are going to fill up \ntheir gas tank.\n  The seniors I represent say: If I have to fill up my tank, I don't \nknow if I can fill my prescription or even get to the doctor.\n  We have to do something.\n  As to the impact on business--from the taxicab driver, where the \ncosts are going up, to the florist making deliveries, to the trucker \ndelivering goods--what we see is they either have to pass the cost on \nto the consumer or go broke. We cannot let people go broke because of \nskyrocketing gasoline prices.\n  A sector that is very near and dear to me is the volunteer sector. \nLook at the impact of rising gas prices on Meals on Wheels. Nearly 60 \npercent of the Meals on Wheels programs have lost volunteers who cannot \nafford gas. Did you hear that? Sixty percent of the people who deliver \nMeals on Wheels have said they have to take a pass because they cannot \nafford gas. Most of the people who deliver Meals on Wheels are seniors \nthemselves. Senator Cardin has a bill to alleviate that.\n  So everything from Meals on Wheels to volunteer firefighters, who are \ntrying to figure out how to pay for the gas for their firetrucks, we \nare in a serious crisis. So we have to act.\n  Now, there are those who say: Drill here and drill now. I will talk \nabout drilling on another day because I support smart drilling that is \nenvironmentally safe, achieves productivity, and, if we drill, stays \nhere. I believe we have 68 million acres already owned by the oil \ncompanies. So if they want to drill, drill where they have it.\n  But what I want to talk about today is what we know is driving up the \ncost per barrel by as much as $80. This bill is about speculation. This \nbill that is pending for discussion in the Senate is about casino \neconomics, and that is what is going on now. We have people trading in \nthe energy market not to be able to buy the futures in oil for their \nown use--whether you are a local government or whether you are a \nrefinery. It is about trading in futures and building it up like a \npyramid scheme. They do this casino economics by doing a lot of their \ntrading through loopholes, one of which is called the London loophole.\n  The London loophole is about an exchange called the InterContinental \nExchange. It is in London. It is owned by an Atlanta company to evade \nAmerican laws and regs. Did you get that loophole, Mr. President? The \nLondon loophole is about an intercontinental exchange in which 30 \npercent of American energy futures are traded. It is owned by an \nAtlanta company.\n  Why do they do this through London? Because it evades American laws \nand regs against speculation.\n  Well, we can immediately deal with the gouging and the excessive \nspeculation by closing that London loophole. That is part of the bill \nthat, if we move past cloture, we can get. We need to close that London \nloophole so investors cannot exploit the market by avoiding U.S. law \nand avoiding U.S. regulation. If you are going to trade as an American \ncompany, go by American rules.\n  The legislation we propose makes sure the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission sets tough limits on speculators. By the way, that group, \nthe CFTC, is the regulator for commodities. It is called the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. We want them to be able to have the legal \nauthority to set limits to deal with excessive speculation.\n  We also want to give them the resources they need. In 2003, the \nfutures market was $13 billion. Today, it is $260 billion. That is \n``b'' like in ``Barb,'' not ``million'' like in ``Mikulski.'' So we \nhave seen this enormous increase, but we do not have the professional \nstaff to be the cops on the beat to deal with speculation and illegal \nactivity. So our legislative proposal calls for 100 more professionals. \nWe want to detect excessive speculation and fraud. We want to prevent \nit, and we want to prosecute it.\n  Markets need to work for free enterprise, not for freewheeling \nexploitation. Closing the London loophole and putting caps on \nspeculators to stop the casino economics is recommended, and it is \npredicted we could lower the cost per barrel by as much as $80. So if \noil is trading at $130 or $140 a barrel, we could bring it down, \ngenerally, to a more reasonable market-based price of about $60 a \nbarrel.\n  That would be stunning. That would be absolutely stunning. It would \nget us back to where we were last year. It would give us an important \npath forward to help our economy, which is in a deep recession. We know \nwe have to do more. We Democrats believe in conservation. That is why \nwe increased the CAFE standards, which go to greater full utilization \nin passenger vehicles and trucks and buses. We know we have to develop \nalternative fuels. We need to do research and pass tax incentives so we \npower our homes with wind and solar. We also know we need to stop price \ngouging.\n  We have to roll up our sleeves and get the job done. It is one thing \nto debate ideas, it is another thing to have a filibuster. I believe in \ndebating ideas, taking a vote, and letting the majority win. I am ready \nto duke it out on the idea.\n  My constituents and I are pretty sick of the tyranny of 60. I thought \nin this country in a body of 100, 51 was a majority. We have these \narcane rules that we can play games with to hide behind our true \nthinking. I call it the tyranny of the 60. It is slowing down what we \nneed to face up to, which is real debate and real votes.\n  I believe energy will determine our destiny, our security, our \neconomy, and our standing in the world. This is a serious matter. For \nthe last 18 months, with the Republican obstructionism, what we have \nfound is that when all is said and done, more gets said than done. \nLet's end the filibuster, let's end the parliamentary games, and let's \nget serious about what the American public wants us to do, which is \nroll up our sleeves and present the best idea for arriving at \nsolutions. Let a real majority win and, most of all, let's start \nputting America first, putting America over political parties. I am a \nmember of the Democratic Party, but a\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nlarger party I belong to is the red, white, and blue party. I think we \nshould have to start acting that way. Let's get the job done, bring \nthis to a vote, and let's stop the speculation, stop the cronyism, and \nlet's get real value for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, when I am approached about the energy \ncrisis we are facing--and I am approached frequently by constituents \nand even family and friends--you can tell that people are feeling at \nthe least very uneasy about this situation. There is a weight that \ncomes with soaring prices on fuel, food, and everything else that is \npart of our daily spending habits. Every time Americans fill up their \ntanks, check-out at the grocery store, or make a decision about where \nto cut spending, that weight gets heavier and heavier.\n  The American people are looking to us for solutions. We have a \nresponsibility to make difficult decisions here in order to provide \nthem much needed relief at home. For many months, Republicans have been \nworking to provide that relief. We have been focused on a three-pronged \napproach: boosting renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency, and \ngrowing our American supply of energy. This line of attack balances the \nneed for us to be responsible stewards of our environment with the need \nfor reliable, affordable energy to fuel our lives and our economy. We \nare not in a position to rely on any one solution to lift us out of \nthis crisis.\n  However, the Democrats are focusing their efforts on a single idea to \nrespond to the pleas of Americans. Rather than dedicate this body to \nbuilding a comprehensive energy plan that provides real solutions for \nthe future, Democrats have put forward a plan to curb speculation. This \napproach does little, if anything, about high gas prices. Instead, the \nDemocrats' speculation bill could hurt our economy by eliminating \ninvestment options that our Nation's retirees depend on, make American \nbusinesses less competitive, and ultimately drive U.S. jobs overseas. \nThe only way to significantly lower the price of gas is to increase \nsupply.\n  Let me repeat that. The only way to significantly lower the price of \ngas is to increase supply. Let's harness the power of our commodities \nmarkets and take concrete steps to expand the future supply of American \nenergy. The market will take this into account, and I am certain we \nwill see prices at the pump fall.\n  This plan to blame all of our troubles on speculators does nothing to \nbring down prices at the pump, which means it does nothing to bring \ndown the price of food, clothing, or any other consumer goods that are \naffected by the price of gasoline. It will not provide relief for \nstruggling Americans, and it lacks the vision and the leadership our \ncountry needs on this issue. All it does is delay other efforts that \nwould make a difference.\n  One thing the Democrats are doing successfully is blocking the \nefforts of Republicans to fully participate in shaping this \nlegislation. The problem is bigger than speculation. Good ideas from \nall sides should be considered.\n  We are talking about one of the greatest challenges facing our \nNation, and our constituents have no voice in this process. They need \nto have their voices heard. Countless constituents have taken time to \nshare their personal stories with me, and there is a common thread in \ntheir messages. Fixed-income seniors worry about driving to the doctor, \nbuying their medicine, and paying for food. They are asking for real \nsolutions. Many Nevadans cannot afford to travel to visit ailing \nrelatives, and our entire tourism industry in the United States is \nbeing hurt by the high cost of fuel. The airlines are in trouble and \nwill be cutting jobs. Manufacturers are cutting jobs. Families have to \ncut spending a little deeper each week to balance their budgets. They \nare asking for real solutions, and they are asking for them now.\n  There is a real solution. It is a plan that reflects the innovative \nspirit of our country and the commitment we all have to preserving the \nenvironment. It involves going back to that balanced approach that \nboosts renewable energy, encourages energy efficiency, and grows our \nAmerican energy supply.\n\n  With families tightening their budgets more and more, with seniors \nstruggling month to month, Americans do not want to hear that there are \ntrillions--literally trillions--of barrels of American oil off limits \nto meet their energy needs. Trillions of barrels--not in Saudi Arabia \nor Venezuela, or in some other country that hates us--but right here in \nthe United States, under our control.\n  At least 10 billion barrels are up in ANWR; at least 8.5 billion \nbarrels in deep sea exploration; by some estimates, 1.8 trillion \nbarrels of oil from oil shale in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. We also \nhave a 230-year supply of coal and great potential in nuclear energy. \nThese American sources, combined with conservation and aggressive \ninvestment in renewable and green energy--solar, wind, geothermal, \nhydropower, fuel cells, and electric vehicles--are the key to setting \nus on a course to energy independence and security.\n  There are some who argue that increasing American energy supply will \nprovide no immediate relief. They argue that ANWR, deep sea \nexploration, and oil shale are years away from producing sizable \namounts of energy. The same could be said for renewable energy \ndevelopment. But these changes would lower prices and would do so \nquickly because the market will react to expected energy supply \nincreases. The American people would react to the fact that we have \nshown vision and accomplished something for their good.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Even so, when has instant gratification been the mantra \nof investing in American innovation? Highways and bridges aren't built \nin a day, but we know they are an investment in our infrastructure. \nSchools and libraries aren't built in a day, but we don't throw our \nhands in the air and say ``never mind.'' We plan for the future.\n  Standing around talking about how long it will take to get these \nprojects on line doesn't help get the process started any faster. The \ntime for talk passed as quickly as $3.50 a gallon came and went. Enough \nis enough. The American people are looking to us to provide much needed \nrelief. We must rise to the occasion.\n  I ask my colleagues across the aisle, what is the magic number for \ngasoline per gallon before they are willing to act on a comprehensive \nenergy strategy? The American people want to know how much longer they \nmust suffer, while we stand here debating oil speculation.\n  Bill Clinton vetoed ANWR 10 years ago in a bill passed by a \nRepublican Congress. If he had signed that bill into law, at least 1 \nmillion barrels of oil per day would be coming to the United States. \nGas prices would be lower.\n  Let's not miss another opportunity for action, and let's not ignore \nthe cries of frustration from our constituents. Let's show them we \nunderstand the difficult choices that they are making, and that there \nare solutions on the horizon. Let's act now.\n  We need to extend renewable energy tax incentives before they expire. \nIf we fail to act, we will be responsible for the end of American \nrenewable energy innovation.\n  We need to improve the barriers that stand in the way of our new \nAmerican energy frontier. Let's send our enemies in the Middle East a \npink slip that we won't be requiring their services any longer. Isn't \nit time to stop subsidizing their economies? We send them $700 billion \na year and, at the very least, they are teaching a new generation to \nhate America. At the worst, they are funding the weapons used against \nAmericans. A comprehensive energy plan means that our economy and \nlivelihoods won't be held hostage any longer.\n  That is the day I look forward to and that all Americans look forward \nto. But to get to that day, we have to act. On behalf of the more than \n2.7 million Nevadans, who need us to do something, I ask you to make \ncomprehensive energy legislation something we can all be proud of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eight minutes.\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are at a seminal moment in America. \nAmerican consumers are being battered by high oil prices, high home \nheating oil prices, all high energy prices. The average middle-class \nperson is squeezed more than ever before. People are not going to \ncollege, people are not taking jobs, people are not visiting grandkids, \nand it is all because of high oil prices. It is changing the way we \nlive--and not for the better. Americans are crying out.\n  What is the answer? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nstuck in the past. They talk about drilling more. Of course they do; \nthey always do what big oil wants. Big oil now, big oil forever. That \nis the Republican motto. Do what they want and nothing else, while \nconsumers foot the energy bill.\n  We cannot drill our way out of this problem, we know that. We have 3 \npercent of the oil and 25 percent of the consumption. We cannot drill \nour way out of the problem. Are there good, constructive ways we can, \nin the short term, increase domestic production? Absolutely.\n  I was one of the Democrats who rallied us to drill in the gulf on a \nlarge tract of oil. There are plenty of places, as my colleague from \nNorth Dakota talked about, in Alaska, but make no mistake about it, the \nprice of oil will not come down until we reduce our dependence on it.\n  Democrats are fighting for a new future, not looking at the past, \nfinding one little bit of oil here, one little bit of oil there, and \npraying it will solve our problems. We are looking for alternative and \nrenewable sources of energy to play a major role in our energy supply, \nfreeing us from oil: No more OPEC. The Republican plan would reduce \ndependence on OPEC from 50 percent to 45 or from 60 percent to 55. It \nis not going to do a darn thing. Particularly, every bit of new oil we \nfind here--and I hope my colleagues will say all the new oil we find \nhere should be used only in the United States. But China and India will \nconsume far more than we find in the next 10 or 15 years.\n  Let me say this: There will be more new cars in China and India in \nthe next decade or so than we have cars in America. We cannot drill our \nway out of the problem.\n  I understand my colleagues' desire for their program. It helps big \noil. That is what we have done all along when the Republicans have been \nin charge. Big oil now, big oil forever. America knows that is not \ngoing to work. We are in a new world where there is not enough oil to \nmeet our needs.\n  What are we doing on our side? We are for increasing domestic \nproduction in the short term in a rational way, but we are not \ndepending on it. It is not the main part of what we are talking about \nbecause we know that will simply lead to higher oil prices. It will \nnever reduce the cost of oil enough to bring relief to the American \nfamily.\n  What should we be doing? What are Democrats proposing? We are \nproposing reducing our dependence on oil and foreign oil in particular. \nWe are proposing incentives for alternative energy--wind and solar. T. \nBoone Pickens, a big oilman, says we cannot drill our way out of the \nproblem.\n  We are proposing dramatic changes in our automobiles. You can have an \nelectric car that drives just as far and long as a gasoline-driven car \nand rides more smoothly with the same power and the same torque. Why \naren't we pushing that? Big oil companies don't want it. They won't be \nselling those batteries. The big oil companies don't want wind power or \nsolar power. They are not involved in those issues.\n  The head of ExxonMobil told our Judiciary Committee a year and a half \nago that they do not believe in alternative energy. Of course they \ndon't. They are making record profits, and the greater demand and the \nless supply, the higher their profitability.\n  We have tried in the past to reduce dependence on oil. We have a \nrenewable portfolio standard so our utilities will not just depend on \noil and fossil fuels. We have tried to push tax changes, take the tax \nbreaks away from big oil and give them to wind, solar, bio, thermal, \nand cellulosic ethanol. Again, we are blocked by the other side of the \naisle. In other words, if big oil wants it, that is good, says our \ncolleagues. If big oil is against it, we are against it. We will come \nup with some reason.\n  But what we will be doing on this Energy bill is looking at the \nfuture, not at the past. What we will be doing on this Energy bill is \nrecognizing that 10 years from now, demand in America should go up for \nenergy because we have to grow, but it cannot come from oil. What we \nare looking at is a future where our cars do not need gasoline. We are \nlooking at a future where our homes are powered by the Sun and the wind \nand other more natural forces. We are looking at a future where we \nconserve, an issue of passion to me.\n  In 1978, California passed building standards to increase energy \nefficiency in homes and buildings. Do you know California has the \nlowest per capita consumption of energy--even with all their car use--\nin these United States? It is not New York with our mass transit; it is \nCalifornia because so many of their buildings are now efficient. Forty \npercent of the energy we consume goes into heating and cooling \nbuildings, 35 percent into gasoline, of total energy consumption.\n  I have been advocating that we adopt California standards nationwide. \nIt is a rather painless way to go. Where are we? It is not going to \nproduce results in 6 months, but it sure will in the next several \nyears. California has led the way.\n  Why don't we do the same for appliances? Why don't we do the same for \nutilities and require them to be more efficient? We cannot be \nprofligate. We can grow and live better and consume less energy at the \nsame time.\n  There are so many breakthroughs about to occur, and we should be \nencouraging them with Government policies and tax breaks, and instead \nwe hear from the other side: Do what big oil wants; just drill.\n  The bottom line is we cannot drill our way out of the problem, I say \nto my colleagues, we cannot, and we must have an energy policy that \nlooks at the future.\n  In conclusion, I say this: Republicans equal big oil equals the past. \nDemocrats equal alternative energy. We are the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the price of \ngasoline and diesel fuel, a price that is affecting all Americans. High \nprices at the pump challenge many Americans who travel great distances \nfor work, for school, or to shop for groceries. This is especially \nacute in sparsely populated States such as Wyoming.\n  These prices are resulting in dramatic impacts to our economy. \nAmerica is now importing more than 65 percent of the oil we consume. We \nare sending hundreds of billions of dollars overseas to foreign nations \nthat are not necessarily our friends.\n  It is well beyond time for Congress to act and to adopt meaningful \nshort-term, medium-term, and long-term solutions. As a matter of \nprinciple, I believe the Senate must act on a set of solutions rather \nthan pursue a piecemeal approach.\n  I am an original cosponsor of two pieces of legislation that include \na range of solutions--S. 2958, the American Energy Production Act, and \nS. 3202, the Gas Price Reduction Act. Combined, these bills include \nprovisions on advanced technology, on speculation, and on added supply. \nThe bottom line is, we need to find more and use less.\n  Today, I wish to speak on two points. One is limiting market \nspeculation, and the other is increasing domestic production.\n  Based on a range of testimony, it is clear to me that there is \ndramatic disagreement on the extent to which excessive speculation \ncontributes to the runup in oil prices. As a physician, I am quite \nconcerned that some may have misdiagnosed the energy crisis. In my \nview, it is a classic misdiagnosis where policymakers focus too much \nattention on the symptoms of the predicament rather than the underlying \ncauses of the problem.\n  I am absolutely convinced that the fundamental issue here is one of \nsupply and demand. Simply because market speculation is a symptom of \nthat larger problem does not mean we should shy away from addressing it \nhead-on. Dealing with speculation, however, is not the full answer. We \nmust combine these efforts with meaningful action to expand domestic \nsupplies and to encourage conservation and energy efficiencies.\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\n  On the issue of market speculation, I have concluded three \nfundamental points: One, American consumers should not bear the burden \nof those who seek to manipulate markets. Two, the United States should \nnot push our financial services trading to foreign countries. We should \nnot replace excessive speculation with excessive regulation. And three, \nwe should strengthen the futures trading markets. This can be done \nthrough investing in additional research, requiring transparency, \nputting more cops on the beat, and strengthening requirements on \nforeign boards of trade.\n  Efforts to address market manipulation require a careful balance. \nIncreased visibility into transactions must not turn into onerous \nregulations.\n  More importantly, steps to curtail speculation must be combined with \nreal solutions to address the underlying fundamental of domestic supply \nand demand. We must insist on efforts to increase our energy supplies, \npromote conservation, and encourage energy efficiencies. We would be \nfailing the American people if we did not talk about increasing the \ndomestic supply of energy.\n\n  I must comment on proposals to punish companies that some believe are \nnot developing leases as quickly as they should. This is a ludicrous \nargument. Frivolous lawsuits and substantial administrative hoops \ndramatically delay oil and gas exploration and production even on valid \nexisting leases. These punishing tactics being proposed are akin to \nleasing an apartment, only to have your landlord withhold the keys and \ncomplain about why you haven't moved in yet. Rather than punishing \nexisting operators, we can and should streamline the permitting \nprocess.\n  Recently, I was in the part of Wyoming known as the Powder River \nBasin. It is in the northeastern part of the State. I heard firsthand \nabout the obstacles people are facing when they try to find more oil \nand gas. American producers are routinely faced with rules and \nregulations that limit drilling for one reason or the other.\n  Typical restrictions are related to both occupancy of the land and \nthe time during the year American producers can operate. Examples of \nprohibitions include extensive restrictions for bird roosting, for bird \nnesting, for migration, and for wildlife feeding.\n  The seasonal prohibitions currently limit exploration to a small \nfraction of the year in many areas. As we can see from this chart, some \nareas are off limits to produce for all but 10 weeks of the year, from \nAugust 16 through October. This is the only time of the year they can \nproduce. If this calendar represented the blackout dates for using our \nfrequent flier miles rather than the dates blacked out for finding the \nenergy that powers our airlines, I guarantee you that outraged citizens \nall across this country would be pounding down the doors. Let's take a \nlook. January blacked out. February blacked out. March blacked out, \nApril--go through the calendar--May blacked out, June, July. And the \ncharge from the other side of the aisle is that companies are not \nproducing on their leases fast enough.\n  The bottom line is, there are many reasons why there may not be \nactive exploration and production on lands already under lease. If \nCongress is serious about producing oil on existing leases, then \nCongress needs to critically review the process needed to develop oil \nand gas wells.\n  As of late June in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, there were 2,589 \napplications to drill that were awaiting approval by Federal \nbureaucrats. These are on land where the company has already paid for \nthe lease but is not yet permitted to drill. They have paid the rent, \nbut they have not yet been given the keys to move in.\n  The vast majority of the applications face extensive administrative \ndelays. What is the current law? The current Federal law requires that \npermits be either issued or deferred within 30 days of the day the \nGovernment receives the completed application. That is right, the law \nsays Federal bureaucrats must give an answer in 30 days. Well, there \nare many instances where there is not even the acknowledgment that the \nsubmitted application was received. Moreover, the applications sit for \nmonths and months, in some cases even over a year, and still Federal \nbureaucrats have not processed the application to drill.\n\n  In a small provision that was slipped into this year's consolidated \nappropriations act, these production companies now have to, in addition \nto all the paperwork, pay $4,000 every time they request a permit to \ndrill--a permit that is on land that they have already leased and paid \nfor, a permit that is not being processed in a reasonable, timely \nmanner, and a permit that may not be processed for months or even \nyears.\n  There are over 850 drilling permits, just in Wyoming, that have been \nspecifically delayed due to policy development, environmental delays, \nand even litigation. For people to say that oil and gas operators are \nsitting on leases without any intent to drill is intentionally \nmisleading. In my State, the producers want to drill and they are \nwaiting to drill. They are simply waiting for the Government traffic \ncops to give them the green light.\n  For people who claim they want to increase domestic supply of energy \non leases that have already been paid for, there is a place you can \nfocus your effort. Focus on the thousands of permits nationwide, and \nespecially in my home State--permits that have not yet been granted, \npermits that are being held up while waiting for the Government \nbureaucrats to act. The leases have been paid for, the workers are \nready, and literally, today, standing by ready to work. All we are \nwaiting for now is for the Government paperwork.\n  This is no way to run a country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest for a quorum?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I will withhold the request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S6997-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the legislation that is \nbefore us, on the question of dealing with energy and in particular the \nprice of gasoline. We have had months now of nonstop talk in Washington \nabout gas prices.\n  Across the country, in my home State of Pennsylvania and in the \nPresiding Officer's home State of Delaware and in so many other places \naround the country, people are frustrated. They do not feel Washington \nhas been responsive to the concerns they have, and it is about time we \ndid a lot less talking and do some acting and some legislating. It is \nfor that reason I stand before you to talk about this issue in a broad \nsense, but in a particular sense, in terms of the legislation we have a \nchance to vote on this week or next week and certainly no longer than \nthat.\n  I wish to commend Senator Reid, the majority leader, and Senator \nDurbin, the assistant majority leader, and others for bringing a number \nof measures to the floor aimed at addressing the high prices of \ngasoline. Since we started working on gas price legislation 2 months \nago, prices in Pennsylvania have risen 40 cents, from $3.60 to $4.00. \nThe average Pennsylvania family now is spending $2,792, almost $2,800 \nmore on gasoline than they were just 7 years ago, at the beginning of \nthe current administration.\n  On top of that, people in Pennsylvania, who are the second largest \nusers of home heating oil in the whole country, are eyeing the \napproaching cold-weather months and wondering how they will be able to \nafford to heat their homes, especially older citizens and low-income \npeople living in rural areas, where they have to travel far distances \nto go to the grocery store or to go to work or to live their lives. A \nfew weeks ago, I met with some home heating oil retailers from \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, in my home area. That\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nis where I live and that is where they live. Now, these are retailers, \nnot some people in Washington but retailers in northeastern \nPennsylvania, and their No. 1 request was to end excessive oil \nspeculation.\n  These retailers are on the frontlines of this oil crisis, and they \nsee families struggling to pay all their bills. One of the people I met \nwith was Ron Kukuchka, and he told me the story of a customer last \nwinter who stood in his store and literally counted out three piles of \ncash: The first one was for this woman's home heating oil, the second \nwas for her prescription medication, and the third pile of cash she had \nto put on the table, literally, was for food. At the end of her \ncounting, she had $30 to pay for the next month's rent.\n  Tammy May, a woman from Pleasant Gap, PA, was quoted in the paper \nlast week--and I read her brief statement to Chairman Bernanke in \ntalking about the issue of recession and the economy--and this is what \nTammy May said. And keep in mind this isn't some Washington analyst, \nsome politician or someone here debating this issue. This is the \nreality Pennsylvania families are facing. Tammy May said:\n\n       The house payment is first, then day care, then we worry \n     about gas, then food.\n\n  That is the life of Tammy May, and that is the life of too many \nAmerican families. It is unconscionable--it defies description to even \nsay it--it is unconscionable to allow this to happen to families living \nin the richest country in the world. Is it any wonder people across \nthis country are fed up, and in some cases angry, about no action in \nCongress?\n  So once again, a lot of people in this Chamber, but especially I \nthink on this side of the aisle, are trying to pass a bill to deal with \nthe high price American families are paying at the pump while we \ncontinue to work as a nation to implement long-term energy solutions. \nThat is why I am proud to cosponsor the Stop Excessive Energy \nSpeculation Act of 2008, because I think it is a proposal with the \npotential to impact gas prices. It is not a magic wand, it is not some \nquick fix for gas prices, but it has the potential to have a positive \nimpact on this issue.\n  Here is some testimony to that effect. Last month, the managing \ndirector and senior oil analyst of Oppenheimer & Company said:\n\n       The surge in crude oil price, which more than doubled in \n     the last 12 months, was mainly due to excessive speculation \n     and not due to an unexpected shift in market fundamentals.\n\n  So says an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. And the CEO of Marathon \nOil, not some Democrat who is trying to make a point or some Washington \npolitical scientist, the CEO of Marathon Oil said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market. It has to be speculation on the futures market that \n     is fueling this.\n\n  So for those who want to make the case that speculation is irrelevant \nto this debate, I think there is more than ample evidence to suggest \nthey are wrong, and there is other evidence to suggest they are \ndeliberately misleading people. Let's be honest about it. \nUnfortunately, the counterproposal in this Chamber and down the street \nin the House is to simply drill our way to energy independence. We know \nthat will do nothing to lower gas prices.\n  The Bush administration's own Energy Information Association has \nclearly stated that if we opened the entire Outer Continental Shelf \n``any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be \ninsignificant.'' Insignificant. Again, that is the Bush \nadministration's energy information office.\n  Aside from the larger issue of world oil prices and limited American \noil reserves, there are practical reasons that drilling would not work. \nThe world's fleet of drill ships, which are used for exploratory \ndrilling of new oil and gas wells, are booked solid for the next 5 \nyears--5 years. Even if we waived every environmental law, oil \ncompanies would be unable to start pumping oil for years.\n  President Bush has acknowledged that increased domestic drilling \nwould not lower gas prices at the pump. It is merely, in his words, \n``psychological.'' Psychological. Well, psychology is not going to \nsolve our energy problem, and neither will gimmicks and some of the \nthings that have been pushed in this Chamber recently.\n  A series of goals to reduce gasoline consumption through efficiency \nand alternative fuels is our only hope, and the only way to achieve \nthose goals is to map out a strategy, and then, as the advertising \ntells us, do it. Do it and pass legislation. That is what the people in \nPennsylvania and all of America are expecting and demanding of \nCongress--leadership to chart a course that gives us real solutions, \nalong with some immediate relief.\n  The bill we are debating will bring some sunlight--it is not a magic \nwand--to the futures market so regulators will have the information \nthey need to rein in excessive speculation and detect price \nmanipulation.\n  Will this bill solve all our energy problems? No, it will not. But it \nhas the potential to provide relief to families who are paying to line \nthe purses of the futures market middlemen while we implement a long-\nterm solution to end our reliance on oil, and in particular to end our \nreliance on foreign oil.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and I hope we can work \nin a collaborative way across the aisle and across the Capitol, in the \nHouse of Representatives, to lay out real solutions for the problem \nthat is facing American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in this \nsegment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is unlimited.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is the energy \nissue, and, of course, America would expect that. If I went back to my \nhome State of Illinois--if I went to any State--and stopped the average \nperson on the street and said: Got any problems? They would say: How \nabout gas prices, Senator? Are you paying attention? Because if you are \npaying attention, you will notice that as we drive down the street in \nthe morning on the way to work or back home from getting the kids from \nschool, you take a look at the signs at gas stations and they are \nstartling. They are going up all the time. When you pull in to fill up, \nif you can afford it, you are putting more money on the counter than \nyou have ever done in your life. People are saying: What is going on \nhere in America? We can't afford this anymore.\n  I took my little Ford pickup truck to a Shell station in Springfield, \nIL, a couple of weeks ago, and at the end of the day, it cost $61 to \nfill up that little pickup truck. I thought to myself: Glad I don't \nhave to do this very often. But some people have to do it once a week--\nand sometimes more often--and it is a serious problem. It is real cash \nmoney coming out of their pockets as they are struggling to keep up \nwith the cost of living.\n  What is going on here? Well, over the last several years, several \nthings have happened. One of the things that has happened, we know for \nsure, and there is no question about this, the big oil companies have \nsteadily increased their profits since President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney came to office, dramatically increasing them to the \npoint where these businesses--the oil companies--are making more money \nthan any business in the history of the United States--not just in the \noil business but any business. They have broken the records in \nreporting these profits.\n\n  Of course, they want to explain it to us, and so they buy full-page \nads, if you take the time to read them in the newspaper, explaining we \nare not making that much money. They compare themselves to other \nindustries and companies, and yet the bottom line is there is pretty \ndramatic increases in their profit-taking. In fact, they are breaking \nall records. This ad, of course, was paid for by, as they say, the \npeople of America's oil and natural gas industry--something called \nenergytomorrow .org.\n  Most of these ads are being sponsored and paid for by the people who \nare making the money. The American Petroleum Institute is one of the \nmajor sponsors of this advertising, saying: We are not making that much \nmoney. But Americans think differently, because in addition to this \nchart showing the oil company profits, this one tells us what has \nhappened to the price of gasoline since President Bush took office. It \nis not current because it still shows\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nthe price of gasoline below $4 a gallon. I know in my hometown of \nSpringfield and in Chicago, the price is way over $4. It may be closer \nto $4.50. I wish it were not going up, but I am afraid it might.\n  So we have seen oil company profits rise and the price of gasoline go \nup as well. There are various ways to look at this. You can say to \nyourself: Something is wrong and I need a solution and--most people \nsay--I need it right away because I have to fill up again next week. So \nwhat are you going to do right now to deal with it? Well, honest \npeople, in responding to that, will tell you there is little we can do \ntoday to change the price of gasoline tomorrow. But there are things we \ncan do in the short-term that will have an impact.\n  The Republican side of the aisle has one approach, the Democratic \nside of the aisle a slightly different approach. The Republican side of \nthe aisle is arguing we should drill now--we need to drill for more \noil, right now. The obvious argument being that if the supply should \nincrease, prices should go down. That, of course, is their argument. \nThey overlook what the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned a few \nminutes earlier--if we decided today, if we picked out one piece of \nterritory in the United States or off our shore and said: We think \nthere is oil here, and so we are going to drill for it, we are going to \nbring it up out of the ground, take it to the refinery and turn it into \ngasoline and we will feel the impact on price, it would take us, the \nestimates are, anywhere from 8 to 14 years for that to happen.\n  It is a pretty massive investment to go into drilling, with all the \nsorts of seismological and geological testing that has to be done, and \nthey have to secure the equipment in a market that is now kind of \npushed to the limit.\n  It takes a long time. So to argue ``drill now'' is to say ``drill in \n8 to 10 to 12 years and then hope that it makes a difference in the \nmarketplace.''\n  Many people are arguing that point of view. They are arguing that we \nshould be drilling for more oil. In fact, the same ``people of \nAmerica's oil and natural gas industry'' are buying full-page ads in \nmany newspapers around the country saying: Smart energy policies and \ngood energy politics involve drilling more now.\n  So the industry that wants to benefit from the drilling, the industry \nthat is to profit at a record level from the drilling is buying the \nadvertising, and our Senators on the other side of the aisle have \naccepted this battle slogan. This is what they tell us we need to do is \nto drill now. But, of course, there are some realities they often \noverlook in making this drilling now argument. Here is one that you \ncannot ignore.\n  It is the reality that we have to be very sensitive to--it is this. \nThis is the percentage of world oil reserves. And if you look, the \ncountry with the largest percentage is Saudi Arabia, 20 percent of \nknown oil reserves. Then you look at the United States, 2 percent; some \nsay 3 percent. That is an estimate of all of the possible oil we could \ndrill, if we could drill everywhere, all the time, and do it as quickly \nas possible--2 to 3 percent.\n  Now, that is an eye opener to think that so little of the world's oil \nreserves are actually within the control of the United States of \nAmerica. So to say drill now is to give access to 2 percent of the oil. \nWell, is it enough? Take a look at the oil consumption. The U.S. \nconsumes about 24 percent, almost one-fourth of all of the oil that is \nproduced and refined, and the rest of the world: 76 percent; 2 percent \nof the supply, 24 percent of the consumption. To argue that we cannot \ndrill our way out of it is fairly clear. We do not have enough oil in \nthe command and reach of the United States to solve our economy's \nneeds. We are going to have to look beyond drilling for oil into other \noptions as well.\n  I think that is one of the realities the other side of the aisle has \nnot acknowledged. But there is oil available and land available to be \ndrilled. There are 68 million acres of Federal land, controlled by our \nGovernment, by us as taxpayers, that has been leased to the oil and gas \ncompanies.\n  We have said to them: Would you be interested in drilling on this \nland for oil and gas? They have put money on the table, signed leases \nto have that right to 68 million acres of land. We believe that acreage \ncould produce 4.8 billion barrels of oil. That would nearly double the \ntotal U.S. oil production. That 4.8 billion barrels of oil equals more \nthan six times the estimated peak production of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, which is another thing that is brought up often.\n  So, currently, of the 68 million acres under lease from the Federal \nGovernment for oil and gas, the obvious question is, why are not the \noil and gas companies drilling there? They believe there is oil and \ngas, they paid the lease to do it, but they are not using it. They have \nset this aside and they are not using it. They are not drilling on this \nland. And we have not stopped offering land to the oil and gas \ncompanies.\n  Just recently, since January of 2007, we made 115 million acres of \nFederal land available for the oil companies to bid on oil and gas \ncompanies, to drill for more oil and gas, 115 million acres offered. \nWhat is that the equivalent of?\n  Well, this little line represents the line of I-80 across the \ncontinental United States from New Jersey to California. And the 115 \nmillion acres is the equivalent of taking a 62-mile-wide swath along I-\n80 from coast to coast 62 miles wide. That is how much land we have \nmade available to the oil and gas companies to bid on for exploration.\n  How much have they actually bid on? Only 12 million acres--12 million \nacres. When the other side argues there is not an opportunity for more \noil and gas, to say, well, why did they not bid on the acres that were \noffered? Why are they not drilling on the acreage they currently lease, \nsomething this next map will kind of show you from a viewpoint of the \nWestern United States what I am talking about.\n  All of the colored portions of this map of the Western United States \nrepresent Federal lands that are being leased for oil and gas \nexploration. If you will look carefully, the black sections are those \nthat have been leased and are in production. The red, which dominates \nand overwhelms this map, is federally leased lands that oil and gas \ncompanies are not actively using. They have set the lands aside. So to \nargue that they do not have opportunity for oil and gas drilling \nignores the obvious; they do.\n  Then they say: Well, what about the Outer Continental Shelf? This \ngets sensitive because there are communities along the Gulf of Mexico \nand the Western United States that have environmental concerns about \noffshore drilling.\n  The fact is, a lot of offshore land under the control of the Federal \nGovernment has been available for oil and gas exploration for a long \ntime. There are 68 million acres leased to oil companies. Of that, 33.5 \nmillion are offshore. Again, the red sections are leased lands, Federal \nlands, leased to oil and gas companies that they are not touching, that \nthey are leaving to sit idle as they come to Congress and argue: We \nneed more millions of acres to explore.\n  These are lands they are paying to lease, and they are not exploring. \nThis is the situation where we have a real challenge, a challenge that \nreflects the reality of what we are up against.\n  The reality is this. There are opportunities to responsibly drill for \noil and gas. We think those opportunities are there now, and we can add \nto them in a sensible way. So exploration and production is part of the \nanswer to the gasoline and oil prices that we face today. But it is not \nenough. It is not enough.\n  We know in this long time lag between deciding to drill and actually \nbringing up oil, we have to think about what we can do now to make a \ndifference. Well, here is one idea: We have what we call the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. It is 700 million barrels of oil that we have set \naside for the safety and security of the United States. We have said, \nif the time ever comes when something awful occurs, we cannot bring the \noil from overseas that we currently need, we have this little \nstockpile--not so little stockpile--of strategic petroleum that is \navailable.\n  We are making the suggestion that we take 10 percent of it, some 70 \nmillion barrels of sweet crude oil, and release it over a period of \nmonths on the market. The belief is, if the Federal Government sells \nthat, first it will bring in money. That is oil that we paid less for. \nNow it is commanding higher prices. And, secondly, more supply on the \nmarket in the short term\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nshould bring down the price of a barrel of crude oil and the price of \nthe products made with that crude oil, whether it is gasoline or jet \nfuel.\n  So immediately it will start bringing down prices. The Democratic \nside is calling for continued exploration in the millions of acres that \nare already available to oil and gas companies; and, secondly, selling \nout of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 70 million barrels or so of oil \nto bring down the market price and to make gasoline and other products \nmore affordable.\n  That could have an immediate impact. Is it the answer to our \nconcerns? No. It is a temporary move, but we need it. At a time when \nairlines are cutting back 20 percent of their schedule and laying off \n20 percent of their employees and more to follow, at a time when \nbusinesses are struggling against the possible recession, and the \nturnaround in our economy, we need to provide that help.\n  But we need to do more. We have to look beyond exploration and even \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the real honest challenge we face; \nthat is, coming up with an energy policy so we do not find ourselves in \nthe predicament we are in today with the Republicans arguing, keep on \ndrilling and do not worry about tomorrow, and others coming up with \nsolutions that might have a temporary benefit but not a long-term \nbenefit.\n  What is the long-term answer? Well, the long-term answer can be found \nfrom a number of people, one of whom is a fellow whose name you can \nhardly ever forget: T. Boone Pickens. Mr. T. Boone Pickens, who has \nmade several billion dollars in the oil industry, is now spending some \nof his money on television advertising. You can hardly miss him if you \nare in Washington and other parts of the country.\n\n  Here is what Mr. Pickens recently said: I have been an oilman all of \nmy life, but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of. But \nif we create a new renewable energy network, we can break our addiction \nto foreign oil.\n  What he is saying is what we all instinctively know: there are ways \nfor us to reduce our consumption of energy and still have a strong \neconomy and a good life in America. The changes are not going to be \ndramatic; they have to be thoughtful.\n  First, we need cars and trucks that are more fuel efficient. My wife \nand I bought a Ford Escape hybrid a few years ago. It is no Prius. It \ngets about 27 miles a gallon. That is pretty good by most standards. If \nyou drive a Prius, you might get 45 miles a gallon, to give you a \ncomparison. So we can do better when it comes to cars and trucks that \nwe build, make them more fuel efficient.\n  I read in this morning's New York Times that Ford Motor Company has \ndecided to get away from the SUVs and heavy trucks and start building \nmore fuel-efficient cars and trucks. That is long overdue. If they had \nbeen moving on this before, they would not be in the situation they are \nin today. So making more of those vehicles available is a smart move.\n  Mr. Pickens believes we should have more of these vehicles fueled by \nnatural gas. It would have less of a negative impact on the \nenvironment, it is more plentiful in the United States, and it could, \nin fact, fuel our economy.\n  There are those who argue we should move to another technology, plug-\nin hybrids. You come home at night, you plug in your car, your truck, \nit is good for 40 miles in the morning, which is all we need each day, \nbefore the gas engine kicks in, and it does not pollute. In the \nprocess, you get electricity from sources that are also clean.\n  Yesterday in my office was a man who is involved in wind energy. My \nState, which I never dreamed would be a major player when it comes to \nwind energy, has wind farms popping up all over, literally hundreds of \nthose wind turbines generating electricity without polluting.\n  The opportunity across America is almost limitless to replicate that \ntechnology once we have made an investment in the infrastructure of \ntransmission and distribution lines. But that is part of the overall \npicture.\n  America's energy policy involves renewable and sustainable sources of \nenergy. We cannot talk about the energy issue without raising two other \nimportant issues. One is our Nation's security. As long as we are \ndependent on Saudi Arabia and the Middle East for our oil, we are going \nto be drawn into foreign policy choices that we do not want to face. We \nwill be drawn into wars and challenges domestically and diplomatically \nthat we never would have faced if we were not so dependent.\n  So reducing our dependence on foreign oil is a small thing from our \ncountry from a security point of view and also from the environmental \nside. I am one who believes in global warming. I believe it is a \nserious problem that is getting worse. If we do not do something about \nit, we are going to leave a much different world to our children and \ngrandchildren. So as we think about our energy challenge, we need to \nput together with that challenge an answer which meets the \nenvironmental challenges to reduce our pollution. I think we can do \nthat. I think we can put these things together. And in combining them \ninto an integrated energy policy, we can find ways to reduce our energy \nconsumption without compromising our quality of life or the growth of \nour country.\n  I have listened carefully to the other side as the Republicans have \ncome to the floor. And there are two things which you will never hear \nas they get up and speak: First, they are not critical of speculators. \nThey are not critical of those who are speculating in the energy \nfutures market.\n  Many people believe, and I am one of them, that there is excessive \nspeculation, perhaps even manipulation, in some of these markets. Our \nbill says, and I think we should, put more regulators in charge of the \nenergy futures industry to make sure everyone is playing by the rules, \nto make sure some of the major traders are not pushing up the prices \nstrictly for profit taking.\n  I cannot see what the problem is with that kind of regulation. We \nsupport that. We want more and more markets to be disclosing. I want to \nknow who is trading in these massive amounts on energy futures and \ndriving up the price of a barrel of oil.\n  Regulating that is a sensible thing to do. I want to make sure the \nmarkets are available for commercial applications so that if an airline \nsuch as Southwest, which has received quite a bit of attention--if \nSouthwest does try to protect its future cost of jet fuel by hedging or \nbuying futures in the oil market, that is a good thing. And the markets \nshould be there for them. But if some wealthy investment bank decides \nthey want to move around a couple of billion dollars and play the \nmarket on oil prices, and people across America are paying higher \ngasoline prices as a result, I am not sure I am going to stand by and \napplaud that.\n  I want to make sure there is a sensible market, well regulated, with \nreasonable limits in trading. So we believe speculation is an important \npart of this issue. Time and again, Republicans have come to the floor \nover the last several days saying: Oil speculation is not the problem. \nI disagree.\n  The second thing is, we have to address the oil companies. The profit \ntaking that is going on there is hardly ever criticized on the other \nside of the aisle. It should be. The oil companies are doing quite \nwell, at the expense of average families, businesses, and farms. So \nputting together a comprehensive energy package involves responsible \nexploration and production. It involves releasing oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve to bring prices down on a temporary basis.\n  Also, we need investments in technology and research so the cars and \ntrucks we drive are more fuel efficient. We need ways to make sure \nbuildings and others things we invest in are greener and more energy \nefficient. We need to be thinking about new technology and research \nthat moves the Nation forward so the economy grows but not at the \nexpense of the average person trying to pay gasoline bills and not at \nthe expense of an environment children will need to live in to have the \ngood life we have had in this world.\n  I hope we can have a comprehensive approach. We have offered \nRepublicans one basic procedural opportunity, but I think it couldn't \nbe fairer. We have a speculation bill. We have offered them: Bring a \nspeculation bill before us. You can have your debate. We will face the \nsame vote. Let's see who wins. We have an energy bill. Bring your \nenergy bill before us. Let's have a debate. Let's\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nhave the same vote one way or the other. Let's see who wins. How much \nfairer could it be? They get to devise their own amendments, put what \nthey want in, and bring it for a vote. That is fair. I hope they will \naccept it, and I hope this important debate will start soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate many of Senator Durbin's \nremarks. I don't see why in the world we can't reach some sort of \nbipartisan consensus on how to go forward with the national crisis that \nis hitting us today.\n  He and others have hinted that they are willing to produce more \nenergy in America rather than spend $700 billion a year of our wealth \nexporting it to countries such as Venezuela or Saudi Arabia to purchase \nthe 60 percent of oil we use. But they don't propose that. The only \nlegislation they have proposed is the speculation bill. I suspect there \nare a lot of things we can do to deal with speculators who are acting \nimproperly. I support that and don't have any problem with them, \nalthough I think we want to be careful and not only repeal the futures \nmarket, apparently, as some would suggest we should do. I think we \nshould move on it, and we have a lot to do in that area.\n  But I have been asking myself, why is it that we are not seeing any \nsubstantive effort on the majority side to deal with the clear crisis \nwe have? And the crisis is that the entire world is using more oil and \ngas; Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and other countries are reducing their \nproduction, even Russia, I understand, and Mexico. As a result, we have \nshortages. That is how speculators manipulate. They are able to \nmanipulate when there is a shortage. We need to fundamentally--do \nsomething about the shortage. When we have a choice--and we clearly \ndo--we should produce our energy from America, keeping all that wealth \nhere and not sending it abroad to countries, many of which are not our \nfriends. That is so basic, it goes beyond logic.\n  I had a little idea, maybe, as to what is going on here. It came to \nme when former Vice President, former Democratic President Al Gore, in \nhis speech this week, renounced all fossil fuels and declared that this \nNation ought to have as its policy to eliminate fossil fuels totally \nfrom making electricity in 10 years. That is one of the most \nbreathtaking statements I have ever heard. Fifty percent of our \nelectricity today is coal; 20 percent is natural gas. What he is saying \nis, we don't produce any more, and we are going to make all of our \nelectricity in 10 years from renewables--wind, solar, and biofuels. We \nhave already hit 5 percent of our fuel for gasoline from corn ethanol. \nMost people--I think everybody agrees--agree we are at about the max we \ncan possibly get from corn. So I think there is some real potential \nwith cellulose wood products. Senator Isakson and I have talked about \nthat. Our States have a good bit of waste wood in the forest that could \nbe a nice improvement, and perhaps produce a good bit more, even than \ncorn ethanol.\n  But I want to go back to the situation. Are our colleagues on the \nother side who claim to be interested in helping America get through \nthis terrible economic time not going to discuss with us how to produce \nmore energy at home? I can't believe that. The only thing that is \nconsistent with that policy, which we have seen for some time now, is \nthe consistency of former Vice President Gore's statement this week \nthat he wants to take all of our electricity and produce it from \nnonfossil fuel sources, which is unthinkable. Unless there is some \nmonumental breakthrough, it is not possible. It is not going to happen. \nIt cannot be the basis of a sound energy policy by any responsible \nofficial in America, it seems to me. Maybe I am wrong, but I don't \nthink so.\n  After the price of gasoline spiked, we ended up with our majority \ncolleagues offering a cap-and-trade bill that they wanted to pass that, \nin effect, would be a major tax on energy, which the EPA said would \nraise the price of gasoline by $1.50 a gallon and could double the \nprice of electricity. This is what we are seeing here. I don't think \nthat is reasonable.\n\n  Our goal should be to change the extent to which we have to use \nfossil fuels. I am for limiting them. I am for better efficiency. I am \nfor geothermal. I am for solar, if we can make it work. I am for wind, \nif we can make it work. The whole Southeast is generally recognized as \nnot a place where any wind energy can be efficiently produced.\n  What we have to do is be realistic about the multiplicity of steps it \ntakes to be independent and to reduce our CO2 emissions, our \nglobal warming gases, and to make our environment cleaner.\n  I will take a moment and ask the desk how much time I have used. I \nwould like to be notified when I have used 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nChair will be pleased to notify the Senator when 3\\1/2\\ minutes is up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time allocated to the Republican \nside be limited to 10 minutes per speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Durbin did say we need to have an opportunity \nto offer amendments and vote on amendments and let's talk about how to \ndevelop a national energy policy. I take that as a good statement. The \nonly thing I am worried about is that will be one of these deals in \nwhich we on both sides say: Your amendment has to have 60 votes to pass \nand our amendments have to have 60 votes to pass. We do that a lot of \ntimes because we know neither side will get 60 votes. What we need is \nsome bipartisan participation, and we need to do some things.\n  Eighty-five percent of our offshore oil and gas is under a \nmoratorium. We have blocked the Air Force's ability to use synthetic \nfuels produced from coal. We--I say ``we,'' I mean the Democratic \nmajority, in truth--slipped that through in the last Energy bill that \npassed.\n  Our colleague, Senator Obama, a Member of this Senate, the nominee of \nthe Democratic Party for President, praised Vice President Gore's \nspeech and has not made, to my knowledge, one specific criticism of it. \nIn the former Vice President's speech, he did not in any way suggest \nnuclear power as one of the solutions to the difficulty we are in, \nwhich is pretty much unthinkable, if one gets my drift. It has to be \ndone.\n  Nuclear power is making a comeback around the world. According to the \nWorld Nuclear Association, 129 plants are currently on order or under \nconstruction in 41 countries and 218 more have been proposed. We have \n104 in America. It makes 20 percent of our electricity. Fifty percent \nis coal, 20 percent is natural gas, 20 percent is nuclear, 10 percent \nis all the rest, with less than 1 percent coming from wind at the \npresent time. These European countries, advanced countries, have come \nto clearly recognize that nuclear power is the best way to produce \nclean base load power without it emitting pollutants. England, the \nUnited Kingdom, has recently commissioned eight new reactors, reversing \nits recent policy to abandon nuclear power. Germany's Chancellor Angela \nMerkel has also recognized the importance of nuclear power in meeting \ntheir challenges, calling for a halt to the odd plan they had to close \ndown their existing reactors. The American people also support the \nexpansion of nuclear power. Of course, France has 80 percent of its \npower coming from nuclear, and Japan is soon to pass the 50-percent \nmark. According to an MSNBC poll, 67 percent of the American people \nsupport building more nuclear powerplants.\n  I see the Chair is calling my time, and other Members are here to \nspeak. I do believe that in any component to move to clean, \nnongreenhouse-gas-emitting energy, nuclear power has to be a part of \nit. I have not seen that in my colleagues' plan, zero from the \nDemocratic side on this issue. It is something we must do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in just short of 2 weeks, the Senate will \nleave for what is the traditional August recess. There is one thing \nabout which every Member of this Senate today agrees upon, not a single \ndissenting statement from anybody--the largest problem and biggest \nissue facing the American people today is the rising cost of energy and \nspecifically the high\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\ncost of gasoline. It would be sad and disappointing if this Senate \nadjourned for a recess in August without having addressed the energy \nproblem in a meaningful, bipartisan, multifaceted way.\n  In the speech I made on the floor 3 weeks ago, I made the statement \nthat it was time for Republicans and Democrats to put the elephants and \nthe donkeys in the barn. It is time for us to find a way to find common \nground, set aside those divided issues, and put on the table those \nissues which both of us know will help to solve the rapidly increasing \nprice of energy and the long-term problems it portends.\n  Last Thursday, Senators Bingaman and Domenici brought to the Senate \ntwo renowned experts on economics and energy. They testified for over 4 \nhours in Dirksen room 50. About halfway through that testimony, Senator \nConrad of North Dakota posed the following question to both of them. He \nasked: Gentlemen, if you could, please tell me, where is it America has \ngone wrong? After pausing for a minute, the economist leaned back and \nsaid: For 25 years, the United States has encouraged consumption and \ndiscouraged production. We should be encouraging production and \ndiscouraging consumption.\n  The lightbulb went off in my mind. He is exactly right. The policies \nof this Congress, of our leadership, Republican and Democratic, have \nlooked the other way. We looked the other way when we dodged the bullet \nof the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. We forgot about the lines, the \nshortages, the caps. Somehow, we looked out to another day to solve the \nproblem.\n  That other day has come. I suggest to you there are multiple things \nwe all agree upon, if we will put our partisanship aside and do it. I \nencourage the majority leader to allow, when we get to cloture, all \namendments to be offered and debate to be open and free-flowing and for \nus to be willing to put all issues on the table.\n  Let me begin. S. 3268, the bill before us, deals with speculation. I \nhave read through the bill. I want to commend two parts of it.\n  No. 1, I commend transparency. Most of us in this body are not \nfamiliar with speculation or the speculative markets or commodities. We \nall need a better education and more facts to get it, and the exchanges \nought to have absolute transparency so we know what is going on all the \ntime everywhere.\n  Secondly, I commend the portion on position limits. I learned the \nother day--and I believe this is an absolutely accurate statement--that \nall the users of commodities--airlines that buy futures in petroleum, \ncereal makers who buy futures in grain--all have position limits, \nmeaning there are limits to which they can speculate.\n  But did you know who does not have a position limit? The investment \nbankers on Wall Street. The same people who brought us the subprime \ncrisis by securitizing high-risk loans at high yield are the same \npeople who, in some way or another, have no limit on the positions they \ncan take or offer in the commodities market. I think the position \nlimits ought to be equalized across the board, whether you are a user \nor a speculator or a Wall Street banker.\n  So those are both good positions. But that is the only thing the bill \naddresses--speculation--when there are so many other things we need to \ndo. No. 1, on the production side, we do need to start exploring our \nown resources. It is true, it will take 10 years to get some of those \nresources to produce. But the very fact we finally make up our mind to \ndo it will make it 1 day shorter each day we have made up our mind. If \nwe put it off today, it is 10 years from tomorrow before we get the \nproduction. We ought to go ahead and get it.\n  Where we have significant differences--such as ANWR; we can debate \nthat separately--but there are other issues where there should be no \ndebate, either in the OCS or extracting the shale oil in Colorado, \nNorth Dakota, and Montana. Conservation, encouraging a savings--we \nought to be working to do everything we can to encourage Americans to \nconserve.\n  Quite frankly, Americans have already gotten that message. For all \nthe rapid transit, mass transit in my city of Atlanta, the buses are \nfull, with standing room only. So is the subway. Ridership is way up. \nThe traffic is much better because people are starting to find \neconomical ways to travel. We ought to incentivize more and more of \nthat.\n  We ought to incentivize conservation wherever we can. We also ought \nto look at those things such as nuclear energy. I know the Presiding \nOfficer today has shared with me the common ground he and I have on a \nsafe, reliable way to produce energy in nuclear. It does not pollute. \nIt does not contribute carbon. It is proven to be reliable around the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, 19 percent of our energy today comes from nuclear. In \n20 years we could take it to 50 percent, and we could reduce our carbon \nfootprint, while geopolitically we could have a tremendously positive \neffect on our country. Renewable sources of energy should be \nincentivized across the board, as biofuels should be the same way. We \nshould not have selective encouragement in tax policy. We should have \nopen encouragement on all research and development, whether it is \nsynthetic, renewables, or biofuels.\n  In essence, I have simply come to the floor to say this: We all know \nprecisely what the problem is. We all know there is not one answer. It \nis not just speculation. It is not just exploration. It is not just \nconservation. It is not just wind. It is not just solar. It is not just \nhybrid vehicles. It is not just plug-in cars. It is all of those \nthings.\n  But the solution lies in the heart of a Senate that is willing to put \nits partisanship aside, address the No. 1 issue facing the people of \nthe United States of America, and find a willingness and a heart to \nfind common ground. Our country faces some significant challenges \neconomically today, and whatever our differences may be politically, we \nshould be united in finding common ground to solve those problems, and \nthe biggest is the price of energy to the American family. It is \nimpacting every single thing they do.\n  So I come to the floor today to welcome the ability to debate this \nlegislation, to want to talk about dealing with speculation--but not \nspeculation alone. We should not make ourselves feel good by passing \none bill that deals with one issue and only one component part and go \nhome and say we did something. We should take pride in taking all the \nfacets we can agree on--whatever they might be--incorporating them in a \nbill, and leave here in August knowing we did something for the people \nwho have sent us up here to represent them, the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, nothing--nothing--is more urgent, more \nimportant today, and nothing is of greater significance to the American \npeople than dealing with our energy crisis. Gas is $4 a gallon. Every \ntime you fill up, it is like getting a smack in the face. My \nconstituents say they don't know what is going to get filled up first: \ntheir tank or their credit limit.\n  We have to cut to the chase. Americans are furious with Congress. \nThey are not just angry about our inability to get something done, they \nare fearful that political leaders on both sides of the political aisle \nare more concerned about winning elections and partisan arguments than \nthey are about protecting our Nation.\n  I am glad the leader has brought an energy speculation bill to the \nfloor, and that is a piece of this issue. I will talk about that a \nlittle later. But we need a full-throttled debate. We have to put \neverything on the table. The American people expect us to do all we \ncan, not take a piece and get involved in a political debate, and \nperhaps walk away with nothing being done and say we put it on the \ntable. This is not about what you put on the table. This is about \nwhether you are serious about dealing with this issue of understanding \nthat, yes, we have to deal with more conservation; that, yes, we have \nto deal with new technologies to cut energy use; that, yes, we have to \ndeal with speculation; that, yes, we have to deal with finding more \nenergy and consuming less--all of it.\n  To simply address and pass a speculation bill alone to address the \nenergy crisis would be like using a garden hose to put out a forest \nfire. The issue is that great, the challenge is that great, and the \nAmerican people expect us to\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\ndeal with this in an honest way. If you disagree with whether we should \ndo more exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf, then vote on it. \nBut this is not something in which we can simply put something on the \ntable and tell the American public we have dealt with it. They are \nsmarter than that. They deserve better than that.\n  America is blessed with remarkable energy resources, but we have tied \nour hands behind our backs--keeping vast oil and gas deposits off \nlimits in the Outer Continental Shelf, not to mention potential oil \nshale. Just consider: We currently have 85 percent of offshore acreage \noff limits--in the lower 48 States--to development and 100 percent of \nat least 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from oil shale off \nlimits. If we developed the entire OCS, we could see an additional \nperhaps 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas.\n  The argument is made: Well, there are areas that are not being used \ntoday. Listen, I am a believer of if you don't use it, lose it. But \nwhere is the logic in saying we have production in areas that are \nproducing oil today that may be closer to shore but still offshore, and \nsomehow we have drawn this arbitrary line that says we can't go right \nnext to it? Oil is not found in quadrants or areas. There are veins \nthat run across. Americans expect us to do everything we can to take \nthe pressure off so they can live their lives and enjoy their lives.\n  If we can push forward energy-saving technologies at our fingertips, \nwe could see an immediate impact on prices. For one, Congress should \naccelerate the production of plug-in hybrid electric cars and trucks, \nwhich would dramatically reduce the cost of fueling vehicles for \nconsumers and lower the demand for fuel.\n  We should expand tax incentives to produce and purchase vehicles \nrunning on alternative energy and fuel cell technology. There are lots \nof options out there. We have to get serious about it.\n  Americans know we have tremendous energy resources, and when many \ncannot afford to drive to work, it infuriates folks if Congress refuses \nto use those resources. Many share the frustrations of a Minneapolis \nman who wrote:\n\n       We need energy independence. Why should we be paying for \n     our energy from the very countries that want to kill us? \n     DRILL domestically now! We have vast resources of our own \n     that should be tapped.\n\n  From southern Minnesota, a man expressing his anger at Congress's \ninaction asks:\n\n       How much economic pain must Americans suffer before \n     Congress changes course? Gasoline prices are at $4.00 a \n     gallon and rising. . . . It is time to do something \n     different. Most Americans want energy independence.\n\n  Or at least not to be held hostage. That is what this is about.\n\n       They want to create new jobs here in America. We should do \n     that with new technology by boosting domestic energy supplies \n     so we can lower the price of gas and reduce our dependence on \n     foreign oil.\n\n  Americans get it. They understand that with $4 a gallon gasoline, we \nneed a comprehensive energy plan, and we need it yesterday. The great \nnews is we not only have the capability to produce more and use less, \nthe natural and technical resources to solve this energy crisis, but I \nalso believe there is enough room for compromise. There are Democrats \nand Republicans working together, Democrats who understand we need to \nfind more energy and bring it to the surface, use it.\n\n  We have to figure out a way to get past this divide, this idea that \nif we put it on the table and we have generated a debate, somehow we \nhave done something, because we have not. There is not a full-\nthrottled, honest effort to deal with this problem unless we put it on \nthe table, have the debate, and we come to some conclusion. The answer \nis not complicated: Find more, consume less. You have to do both. There \nare folks working on plans right now.\n  We can authorize deepwater drilling in America's Outer Continental \nShelf. By the way, plow the Government revenues from the OCS into a \nfund to fully fund renewable energy, fully fund energy efficiency \nprograms, fully fund some of the programs that I know the Presiding \nOfficer is concerned about--low-income heating assistance. Folks are \ngoing to be impacted this winter when the price of natural gas goes \nthrough the roof and the price of home heating oil goes through the \nroof. If we have the opportunity to bring in resources to fund those \nthings, it is a win-win for everybody.\n  We need to allow exploration of ways to tap into America's vast oil \nshale deposits. We need to expand electricity generation from new \nnuclear plants. It is not enough to say: Let's wait until we figure out \nwhat to do with the waste. I always tell folks, the French are not \nbraver than we are. Whether it is 75 percent or 85 percent of their \nenergy that comes from nuclear energy, they reprocess the waste. If you \nsay we are going to wait to solve the problem, it means you are not for \nexpanding the use of nuclear energy, and that is a mistake.\n  We need to do it all. We need to fund technological breakthroughs in \nbattery technology to bring plug-in cars and trucks to the market. We \nneed to prevent energy futures speculation from artificially inflating \nprices.\n  One thing stands in the way of doing what the American people sent us \nto accomplish, and that is political gamesmanship.\n  A woman in rural Minnesota with a 9-year-old son and struggling with \na 67-mile commute summed up a lot of the frustration out there when she \nwrote to me:\n\n       I am sick of the lame excuses I hear from all of you. I \n     would really appreciate it if you could stop politicking and \n     do something before the people of this Country get more \n     desperate. This is your job, this is what you were elected by \n     the people to do.\n\n  She is right. This is what we were elected to do.\n  The majority leader has called up a bill focused on speculation in \nthe energy commodity markets, which is certainly one of the areas we \nshould act on. As former chairman and current ranking member of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have worked with my friend \nand colleague Senator Carl Levin on this issue of market manipulation \nand excessive speculation in the commodity markets for years. I am \nproud of the work we did to close the Enron loophole as part of the \nfarm bill. I, along with many others in the Senate, have been looking \ninto the effect of increased speculation in the commodity markets on \nthe price of oil.\n  I hope the majority leader will allow speculation amendments so we \ncan consider other approaches to dealing with speculation, such as a \nproposal recently introduced by Senator Levin and Senator Feinstein \nthat I have cosponsored. But what we need is an amendment process that \nallows production and efficiency amendments to also be considered.\n  We keep hearing about this concept: If we do what we did with landing \na man on the Moon, by the end of the decade we can get this done. If \nyou reflect, at that time the Russians put Sputnik in space first. It \nwas a blow to the American ego. When President Kennedy set forth his \nvision: We will land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, we did \nnot have computer technology to get to the Moon, never mind to get \nback. But Americans came together with a vision and a plan and a \nresolve.\n  I suggest that you did not land a man on the Moon with a single-stage \nrocket that went halfway there. You have to get to the moon, and you \nhave to get back. You did not land a man on the Moon--or you are not \ngoing to end the challenge we have now to do something about the price \nof oil if you say no to new exploration, if you say no to new expanded \nnuclear production, if you say no to oil shale exploration. You cannot \nbe saying no to new opportunities and then, in the same breath, say: We \nneed a man-on-the-Moon commitment. We need a commitment that is real, \nthat is across the board. Put it all on the table, and then make some \ndecisions.\n  We hear the argument that says: Well, if we move forward with new \nproduction, some of it is not going to take effect for 10 years. When I \nwas mayor of St. Paul, I took over a city in which we abandoned the \nareas along the shores of the Mississippi, what I called the retreat of \nthe industrial wasteland. We had industries there, and they stepped \nback, and it was barren. So when I talked to folks about planting \ntrees, they would always say--I remember this because it rings true \ntoday--the best time to plant trees was\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\n20 years ago, 10 years ago. The second best time is now. The best time \nto have done the exploration was 10 years ago. The second best time is \nnow.\n  My friends who will come to St. Paul this year for the Republican \nNational Convention will see tens of thousands of trees that are in \nfull bloom because we planted them when I was mayor more than 10 years \nago.\n  Energy is the same way. It sure would have been better to open up \ndeepwater drilling 10 years ago, but that does not mean we should not \nstart now, or else we condemn Senators in 2018 to rehearsing and \nrehashing this same debate.\n  I wish to share one last letter from a constituent who wants us to \nget beyond the partisanship and get to work. Dan writes:\n\n       I am a middle class Minnesotan and have become very \n     concerned over the last several years about our elected \n     leadership in the Congress. Are they working for the people \n     of this country or the political parties they belong to? Now \n     is the time to address energy issues, not after the fall \n     election. It is time to open up areas in America to \n     exploration.\n\n  Finally, he goes on to ask:\n\n       Do you think the founding fathers of this country would be \n     proud of the political process today?\n\n  I think this is exactly what we should be asking ourselves. If ever \nthere were a moment for us to come together as a nation to protect and \npreserve our freedom and our liberty, as our Founders did more than 200 \nyears ago, that moment is right now.\n\n  We recently celebrated our Nation's day of independence. As I \ntraveled to Minnesota, I found no signs of retreat or fear about \nAmerica's ability to meet this energy crisis head on. They were certain \nwe can reach energy independence, that we can stop being held hostage \nby thugs, tyrants, Saudi sheiks, Ahmadi Nejad, Chavez, and others. Yet \nthey were uncertain Congress would be able to summon the courage and \nconviction necessary to set this Nation on a new path.\n  We must act on a comprehensive energy bill before the August recess, \nand there is no better time to do it than now. Let us do the job we \nwere sent here to do.\n  In 1994, Members of Congress worked into the August recess to pass a \ncrime prevention bill. If we cannot pass a comprehensive energy bill \nwith solutions big enough to match the size of this crisis before the \nAugust recess, then I don't think we should leave for the recess until \nwe do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, here is the situation we find ourselves \nin with respect to oil. Global supplies are tight, global demand keeps \nrising, and our country has a dangerous dependence we haven't yet begun \nto break. Meanwhile, the Bush administration has run up massive budget \ndeficits, instigated by war in Iraq that is costing us $5,000 per \nsecond, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that could cost more than \n$4 trillion before the next decade is out, and that has caused the \nvalue of the dollar to drop and investors to buy more commodities, such \nas oil.\n  The oil futures market used to be primarily a place for companies to \npay in advance for oil supplies they knew they would need. But now the \nfutures market is overcome with runaway speculation, with people buying \nfutures because they are betting the price will go up. Some experts say \nspeculation is adding as much as 50 percent to the cost of every \nbarrel. With oil prices this high, oil companies are raking in record \nprofits--sums of money that are bigger than the GDP of some countries.\n  But instead of reinvesting that money in their business and in \nrenewable energy possibilities, and expanding production to meet our \ncountry's growing needs, oil companies are investing in their own share \nprice by buying back their own stock. That may be good news for Wall \nStreet, but it is bad news for anyone struggling to pay to fill up \ntheir gas tanks.\n  That is how we have gotten to $140 a barrel oil--tight supply, high \ndependency and demand, a Bush budget deficit that is weakening the \ndollar--oil is traded in dollars--speculation in the market, and the \noil companies' greater concern for boosting their share price than for \nboosting production.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested \nall it would take to bring down oil prices would be to allow oil \ncompanies to drill off the east and west coasts of the United States. \nHere is the problem with that: The companies already have, as we have \nsaid before on the floor, 68 million acres of Federal land under lease \nthat they are largely not exploiting. The Federal Government will be \nopening 2.3 million additional acres to them in October, and they have \nover 200 million more acres they don't lease, but they could if they \nwanted to. The oil companies clearly think there is oil on all those \nmillions of acres or else they would not be leasing the land. But they \nare not using it.\n  To get an idea of the scale that is involved, here is a map showing \nhow much territory the oil companies control in the Gulf of Mexico. The \nred area represents all of those unused acres. It is a huge portion of \nthe gulf region that is going completely undeveloped, and that has been \navailable to them already. Yet all of those red areas go undeveloped.\n  Here is an even more impressive map--the map of how much of the \nwestern United States oil companies control. The black portions show \nwhere oil companies are exploring and, again, the red section shows \nwhere they are not exploring. As you can see, it is overwhelmingly \nstaggering, all of those red sections of places where they already have \nthe ability to pursue, which they are simply not pursuing.\n  The oil companies control an enormous amount of land. When you add it \nall up, it is an area more than 12 times the size of my home State of \nNew Jersey. So why would signing over yet more land to them have any \neffect at all?\n  It is not that companies don't have enough land to drill on. That is \nnot the bottleneck. The bottleneck is that, for 20 years, oil companies \nhave been underinvesting in oil exploration and in the infrastructure, \nthe equipment, and even the engineers needed to do additional drilling.\n  Here is what the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute--the trade \norganization representing all of these companies--said last month:\n\n       Every single available drilling rig, drill ship is in use--\n     being used right now. You can't go and drill when you don't \n     have equipment. We are not magicians as an industry.\n\n  So all of this clamor for more land doesn't do anything about that \nreality. For all of this land, this water, the rights, all of these \nland rights--all of that doesn't even deal with that. If we give them \neven 1 more acre, what would it mean?\n  That is part of why it would take so long--as long as a decade--to \nget to the first drop of oil from the Outer Continental Shelf. Even if \nwe wanted to, if we thought it were good policy--which I do not--the \ncapacity isn't there.\n  There is a reason they don't have the equipment to drill more: They \nare not reinvesting in their own businesses. They are only investing in \ntheir own stock. Last year, ExxonMobil spent about $21 billion in \ncapital expenditures, such as buying new equipment, compared to more \nthan $35 billion it gave to its stockholders.\n  What we see here in this chart is, in fact, billions of dollars of \nbig oil stock buybacks. You can see that from 2002 to 2007, it has \nincreased over five times what it was 6 years ago. So the reality is we \nhave a lot of money from big oil going back into big oil stocks, \nraising the value of these stocks, but doing nothing about what the CEO \nof the American Petroleum Institute talked about.\n  In the first quarter of this year, with oil prices sky high, \nExxonMobil decided to spend almost $9 billion on stock buybacks alone--\n$9 billion in the first quarter. They spent almost a full 40-percent \nless on actually exploring for oil. The situation is more extreme at \nConocoPhillips, which told its investors that its stock buybacks this \nquarter will come to about $2.5 billion or nine times its budget for \nexploration.\n  On the whole, the five biggest international oil companies used more \nthan half of the cash they made from their businesses in stock buybacks \nand dividends last year, up from only 1 percent in the early 1990s.\n  An expert at Rice University who studies how oil companies spend \ntheir money summed it up very well. She said:\n\n       If you're not spending your money finding and developing \n     new oil, then there's no new oil.\n\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\n\n  There is a very simple economic reality here: While families are \nstruggling to make ends meet, the oil companies are flush with cash. We \nhave seen big oil profits steadily increasing under this \nadministration, from approximately $22 billion or so in 2002 to nearly \n$120 billion in 2007. That is about $100 billion more.\n  There is a simple economic reality here. Families are struggling to \nmake ends meet, but the oil companies are flush with cash. Instead of \ninvesting in the new equipment they say they need to pursue the lands \nthey want, they are giving themselves a big payback and plowing their \ncash back into their own stocks.\n\n  At some point, oil companies need to recognize they have been trusted \nto manage natural resources from public lands, and there are times when \nthey have a responsibility greater than boosting their bottom line. \nWith gas and food prices through the roof, and the economy sputtering, \nwe arrived at that point long ago. So when people say, ``We need to \ndrill more,'' I say, tell it to the oil companies. Tell them to use \ntheir profits to invest in more equipment and drill in the 68 million \nacres they already have leased.\n  Basically, when oil companies say that giving them more acreage would \nincrease the amount of oil they produce, it is like saying, if your car \nis about to run out of gas, you need to pull over and install a bigger \ntank. The problem in that situation isn't the size of the tank, and the \nproblem we face right now isn't that oil companies don't have enough \nland to drill on. The problem is they are not drilling on what they \nhave. Not to mention, even if offshore drilling produced every drop \noptimists are talking about, it would not even be close enough to \naffect gas prices one way or another. Even President Bush's own Energy \nInformation Administration admits that all we are talking about is a \ndrop in the bucket that will have no effect whatsoever on the price at \nthe pump.\n  Let me put offshore production into perspective. What our colleagues \nsay is the panacea, the solution to everything, is misleading. The way \nthey say this, you would think if we drill tomorrow, open up new land \naround our Outer Continental Shelf, guess what spurts right up? Let \nthis happen tomorrow and you will get gasoline in your tank for a lot \nless.\n  I think the American public understands this much better than that. \nIt understands it takes a decade before we see the first drop, and it \nunderstands it takes until 2030. Let's talk about needing relief now, \nnot in 2030. Even then, what do we get?\n  Since April, Americans have responded to record high gas prices by \nusing over 800,000 barrels a day less--800,000 barrels a day less than \nwe did 1 year ago. This is the most significant and sudden drop in oil \ndemand since the 1970s.\n  What has happened--notwithstanding the fact that we have reduced \ndemand by 800,000 barrels a day--is that since April we have continued \nto see record gas prices--prices going up. In recent weeks, Saudi \nArabia has increased their production by 500,000 barrels every \nday. What happened? Gas prices continued to go up.\n\n  So how is it that if we had 800,000 barrels a day in reduced demand--\ngas prices went up--and 500,000 barrels a day in new production by \nSaudi Arabia--a combination of 1.3 million barrels a day--how does the \nBush-McCain drilling plan compare to these recent events wherein prices \nhave gone up, notwithstanding that shift of 1.3 million barrels a day?\n  If we open all our shores and risk all our tourism, fishing \nindustries, and all the economies of all the coastal States to oil \nproduction, the first drop of oil wouldn't be seen until the year 2017, \nand oil production would peak in the year 2030. What could we get in \nthe year 2030? We would get 200,000 barrels a day. Well, my God, if a \nreduction of 800,000 barrels a day has done nothing and gas prices went \nup, if the Saudis are pumping out 500,000 new barrels a day and prices \ngo up, how is it that getting 200,000 barrels a day in the year 2030 is \ngoing to reduce gas prices tomorrow? It is a sham being created by \nthose who want another grab for their oil company friends, as we have \nseen over the last 7 years by the two oilmen in the White House.\n  To put that number another way, the amount of gas we could get from \noffshore drilling is equivalent to a few tablespoons per car per day. \nTogether, an 800,000 barrels-per-day reduction in demand, an increase \nof 500,000 barrels per day of Saudi production equals that 1.3 million \nbarrels-per-day shift in the market. Yet we still have record gas \nprices. So if this massive shift has no impact, it is clear the \nproduction of 200,000 barrels a day in the year 2030 will do absolutely \nnothing at all about gas prices today. It is simply wrong to think that \nopening offshore drilling will lower gas prices.\n  So one might ask: Why are oil companies asking us to hand over more \nland when they already have so much that is unused? It seems to me \nthere is only one explanation. Oil companies aren't actually in a rush \nto drill in those areas, but they are in a rush to control as much \nFederal land as possible before their friends in the Bush \nadministration leave office. The oil companies' strategy right now is \nto grab control of as much Federal land and water as possible before \nJanuary 20 of 2009, the date the next President of the United States \ntakes office. They are trying to take advantage of the current energy \ncrisis to take control of more public property and boost their profits. \nThe GOP plan to open our shores to drilling isn't only about oil \nprices, believe me; it is about share prices. That plan comes with a \nserious pricetag: a vast increase in the risk to the health of our \ncoasts and the economies they support.\n  Sometimes, if you go to the Archives building here in Washington, on \nits portal it says, ``What's past is prologue,'' and I would remind \nAmericans of some of these facts. We were all told we had the most \nadvanced tankers in the world and that they would prevent any spills \nfrom happening, but we all also, I hope, remember the devastation off \nthe coast of Alaska after the crash of the Exxon Valdez. We all \nremember that after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita there was, yes, a human \ntragedy and there was also an economic tragedy. There was an \nenvironmental tragedy off the gulf coast. I have read comments by some \nwho say: Oh, nothing happened. Look at that. The infrastructure and the \ntechnology is so advanced, we didn't get one drop of spillage after \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. Wrong. False. Seven hundred thousand \ngallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, and over 7 million \ngallons of oil leaked offshore from the infrastructure that supports \noffshore drilling.\n  Now, here is a picture. This is not my picture; this is a picture \nfrom the U.S. Coast Guard. What did they do to try to deal with the oil \nthat leaked? They burned it to try to dissipate it. If I saw this off \nthe New Jersey shore or in North Carolina or Florida or California or \nOregon or Washington, I would say that is a major disaster. Yet we have \ncolleagues who say not a drop--not a drop--spilled. False. Wrong. Not \ntrue.\n  Between commercial fishing, sport fishing, forestry, and tourism, \ndrilling would pose a threat to coastal economies that are over $200 \nbillion a year. That is how much our coastal economies generate along \nthe east and west coasts--over $200 billion a year. That is part of \nwhat led President Bush's father to declare, when he was President, \nwhen he put in place the moratorium on offshore drilling, that:\n\n       Certain areas of our coast represent unique natural \n     resources. In those areas, even the small risks posed by oil \n     and gas development may be too great.\n\n  I don't consider this type of contamination a small risk, but even \nthe first President Bush said: ``Even those risks posed by oil and gas \ndevelopment may be too great.''\n  Even what he considered small risks were too great. This is far \nbeyond small risks. It is what led President Bush's brother, Jeb, the \nformer Governor of Florida, to say: ``Protection of those resources is \nof paramount importance to the State of Florida.''\n  Now, those Bushes got it straight. They understood.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we cannot escape those risks, when \ndrilling would happen less than 100 miles off our shores. The New \nJersey shore generates tens of billions of dollars in revenues each \nyear, and it supports about a half a million jobs. We have already seen \nin the past the devastating economic effects of medical waste washing \nup on our beaches. New Jersey families and businesses cannot afford the \nrisk of an oil slick on the scale of\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\nthe Exxon Valdez crash or the spills after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \nwith sticky crude forcing beaches to close, killing wildlife, \ncollapsing property values, and destroying our economy in the process.\n  We need real barrels coming out of the ground, not paper barrels \nfilling nothing but big oils' balance sheets. It is time to take action \nto shore up our energy security and drive down the price of gasoline.\n  First, we need to take action to lower gas prices now. The Federal \nGovernment should release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nprovide immediate relief. We can have a swap where we can take the \nlight crude--we can actually, in fact, make money on this--and get the \ntype of crude we need and, at the same time, help try to affect the \nprice by having that immediate surge of oil into the marketplace.\n  In addition, I have joined with Senators Feingold and Dodd to \nintroduce the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act, which requires \noil companies to show they are either producing oil or gas on public \nlands or making progress exploring or developing them on current leases \nbefore they get their hands on more land, when they are not even \nproducing on that which they have.\n  We have also introduced the Responsible Ownership of Public Land Act, \nalong with Senator Durbin. The bill would charge oil companies a fee \nfor every acre of land they lease but fail to use for production. The \ncombination of these measures could give the oil companies the \nincentives they need to get barrels of oil off their balance sheets and \ninto the marketplace.\n  In addition, I will be offering an amendment to make sure oil that is \nproduced on land owned by the people of the United States gets used by \nthe people of the United States. Right now, oil companies shift 1.5 \nmillion barrels per day of domestically produced oil overseas. So 1.5 \nmillion barrels a day produced in the lands and waters of the United \nStates shift overseas. Last year, that meant over half a billion \nbarrels of oil per year was taken from U.S. public lands and sent \nabroad. Now, we are talking about using the Outer Continental Shelf and \ngetting 200,000 barrels in the year 2030, while we have been sending \nover 1.5 million barrels a day to other places in the world--oil that \ncomes from public lands.\n  If we are going to endanger our own environment and deplete our own \nresources, certainly we should be the ones who benefit from it. Not \nthat I believe that should be the case, but in terms of taking a risk \nfor our own lands and public resources--certainly not to drill off the \ncoast, but to the extent that we have drilling going on now and we have \nland they are not drilling on, that ultimate production should be used \nhere in the United States. Over half a billion barrels are sent abroad. \nWe need to bring medium- and long-term relief so an energy crisis such \nas this does not happen again.\n  That moves us to the ultimate goal. This country should be far more \naspirational in its view of this issue. We should approve the renewable \nenergy tax extensions bill, which our colleagues on the Republican side \nhave opposed, that would help continue the rapid growth of wind and \nsolar and provide an incentive for the purchase of plug-in hybrid \nvehicles. This will help us begin the transition to new energy sources \nso we are not so vulnerable to the rising costs of fossil fuels, not to \nmention what it does to our environment and global warming.\n\n  We should clamp down on rampant oil speculation and burst the \nspeculative bubble that has caused oil prices to skyrocket.\n  We should be acting now on global climate change legislation that \nlays out the framework to completely change our economy from one that \nis based on oil and other fossil fuels to an economy based on renewable \nenergy.\n  That is a real plan, not just a plan to go out in search of our next \noil fix.\n  Increasing the share of oil we produce here at home is important, and \nwe should make sure there are incentives for oil companies to produce, \nbut authorizing drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf would just be a \ndistraction and would do nothing to bring down gas prices, now or ever.\n  Drivers are calling out for us to bring down gas prices, not to prop \nup oil companies' stock prices. Our Government needs to stop holding \nthe oil companies' hand and start holding them accountable. American \nfamilies and businesses deserve a government that works for them, not \njust for the people who sell us our oil.\n  A mother can't fill the family car with the predictions in oil \ncompanies' annual reports. A business can't ship its products with so-\ncalled likely reserves. What makes the engine of our economy run today \nis what comes out of the ground, not what is written on paper. What \nwill make our economy run tomorrow is our ability to transition beyond \nthis addiction.\n  Making a major commitment to create the economy of the future, free \nfrom the liquid shackles of oil, would send a clear message to the \nworld that America is ready to lead again. That is the message we \nshould be sending.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Since when have we been a country that is \nafraid of a challenge? Since when have we waited for others to \ninnovate, waited for others to rescue us from the dangers we face, \nwaited for other nations to take the lead?\n  When we entered the Second World War, our allies knew we were in it \nwith our hearts and souls. When President Kennedy announced we would go \nto the Moon, friend and foe alike knew we would not rest until we had \nallowed mankind to take that giant step.\n  I refuse to believe a country responsible for the light bulb, the \ntelephone, and the computer can't decide to become a country powered by \nwind turbines, solar cells, and geothermal plants. There is no reason \nwe can't decide to move toward powering our Nation with innovative, \nclean energy, especially since we have the technology to get started.\n  Two Americans were the first to fly. As one engineer said at the \ntime: ``The Wright brothers flew right through the smokescreen of \nimpossibility.''\n  It is time we showed we believe that ending this energy crisis is \nincredibly possible.\n  If we want to bring down the sky-high price of oil, stop shipping our \nmoney overseas in exchange for foreign oil and make our economy soar \nagain. It is time we did everything we can to get a real program for \nenergy independence off the ground. That is our real challenge. That is \nour real opportunity. That should be our real mission.\n  I close once again by saying that this comment about offshore \ndrilling, that it is the way we are going to solve all our problems--\n800,000-barrel reduction in demand, prices went up; 500,000 barrels \nmore production by the Saudis, gas prices went up; 1.3 million barrels \nand change, prices went up; 68 million acres of land the oil companies \nhave they don't use, that is another reason prices go up--restrict the \ndemand.\n  The bottom line is, let's move forward in a way that meets our \nchallenge not only today but tomorrow. We are a country that can do. We \nare a country of infinite possibilities. It is time to go beyond the \nshortsighted, narrow view that, in fact, we must risk all of our \ncoastal economies, $200 billion a year, for something that won't \nproduce one drop of oil for a decade, won't receive full production \nuntil 2030, and won't do anything now or in the future about reducing \ngas prices but will ultimately say to future generations of Americans \nthat we, in the expediency of the moment, were willing to risk not only \nthose economies but the natural resources of this country for something \nthat would do absolutely nothing about gas prices.\n  We can do better than that. That is what this debate is all about, \nand that is the opportunity we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know we are all under confined time. I \nhave a lot more to say than time will allow. I just listened to these \nremarks, and I wonder, why do people think the American people are so \ndumb they don't understand supply and demand?\n  A couple weeks ago--and no one can ever accuse the Washington Post of \nbeing partial to conservatives or Republicans, but they came out with \nan editorial, and they said: Why do Members of Congress think they can \nrepeal the law of supply and demand? You can say it all you want, but \nwe have to have more supply.\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\n  Ever since the 1995 veto of the bill that would allow us to go \noffshore to increase our supply, go to ANWR, go to oil shale, the \nDemocrats have voted against increasing supply since that time. That \nwas the middle nineties, and now we are paying for it. I can remember \ncoming to the floor of the Senate back then when President Clinton \nvetoed the bill that would allow us to increase our supply and saying \nthe day is coming when we are going to be sorry we did this.\n  I am very proud that the other day President Bush called for action \nby Congress in four areas. One is the Outer Continental Shelf, about \nwhich we have been talking. The others are ANWR and America's oil \nshale.\n  To give an idea of the capacity, this is called supply. We know what \nour demand is; everyone is demanding. This is supply. We called for it. \nWe can have all the supply in the world, but if we don't have the \nrefining capacity, we are not going to be able to use it.\n  We had the Gas Price Act. I thought that was one that would offset \nany kind of objection to the idea that we should be refining in this \ncountry. It was using some of these closed military places, along with \nEDA grants, to allow them to have refineries in America. We don't have \nthe refining capacity in America, and we need to have it. We need to \nhave the supply, and we need to have the capacity to refine the oil.\n  Polling--and I think the Democrats should be looking at this--is not \nwhere it used to be. The recent polling data from Rasmussen showed that \n67 percent of the voters support offshore drilling. Only 18 percent \noppose it. The same poll also found that 64 percent believe that if \noffshore drilling is allowed, gas prices will go down. And they will. \nThere have been several editorials which we have made part of the \nRecord which have shown the market response when things such as this \nhappen. When we open capacity, the market will respond.\n  Another poll found that 81 percent of Americans support greater use \nof domestic energy resources. By a margin of more than four to one, \nAmericans surveyed supported the United States tapping into its own \ndomestic energy reserves. We are the only country in the world that \ndoes not tap our own reserves.\n  With regard to offshore, I listened to the arguments, which are \nreally kind of ludicrous. When you stop and realize that offshore we \nhave the capacity of 14 billion new barrels, and people come down and \nsay--I heard the assistant majority leader say a few minutes ago that \nthere are 68 million acres out there that are not being explored, not \nbeing produced, not being drilled at this time. There is a very good \nreason for that--because there is no oil on them. Oil isn't everywhere, \nbut where you know it is, you need to go after it. So 85 percent of the \nland where there is an opportunity to bring oil in, the Democrats won't \nlet us explore it. It is something I think the American people \nunderstand and understand very clearly.\n  ANWR is another area. It contains 10 billion barrels--back at the \ntime President Clinton vetoed the bill--that would be coming through \nthe pipeline today in resolving these problems we have.\n  Rocky Mountain oil shale--that is the big one. That is the one that \nhas 2 trillion barrels. Right now, they cannot go after them, they \ncannot continue technology, they cannot explore for that, they cannot \nproduce it because the Democrats have a moratorium. Yet, if you go to \nthe States where this is located--Colorado, Utah, the Western States--\nthey all want to do it. It would be great for the economy, it would be \ngreat for America, and it would not take any time at all to get this \ndone.\n  Imports. Opening the Nation's access to reserves on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, ANWR and oil shale would cut our Nation's trade \ndeficit in half. We have recently been watching T. Boone Pickens, and \nwe should listen to him. He talks about some things we can do with wind \nenergy, but he talks about natural gas, and that is a partial solution \nto the problem. I have a bill that would allow compressed natural gas \nto be fully utilized. Right now, there are some obstacles with the EPA \nand others, but I agree with T. Boone Pickens; that if we pass this \nbill, we will be able to utilize that. As he said, we need to continue \nto produce, continue to explore, because we cannot run the greatest \nmachine in the history of mankind on solar and wind power right now. We \nhope that day comes, but it is not here.\n  We could cut our trade deficit nearly in half. According to the \nEnergy Information Administration, the United States spent more than \n$327 billion to import oil in 2007. That is roughly half of the $711 \nbillion trade deficit we had last year. So not only will we get cheaper \ngas for Americans at the pump merely by increasing capacity, increasing \nthe supply that is out there, but we also would do some great things in \nterms of our trade deficit situation.\n  Why should producing America's own resources be a partisan issue? It \nshouldn't. But the Democrats in Congress refuse to increase the supply \nof energy, and the gas prices keep rising. We have seen recently that \nall we have to do is open that and the markets will immediately \nrespond. I feel this is going to happen. I cannot imagine that the \npolling is going to get much more favorable than it is today.\n  There is one State--I won't mention which State it is because it is \nconsidered to be pretty much a liberal State--that 3 years ago, only 28 \npercent of the people in that State wanted to drill offshore and in \nANWR. Today, it is 68 percent. It doesn't get much better than that.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, we get the Democrats to join us, increase \nthe supply and resolve the problem, the energy crisis we have right \nnow. The No. 1 problem in America--talk with my wife, talk to any \nState, they will tell you the No. 1 problem is the price of gas at the \npumps. We can solve it with greater supply.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the topic of \nenergy, a topic that is obviously consuming Members of both Chambers of \nCongress. It is something everyone in the country is focused on, and \nfor good reason--gasoline at $4 a gallon and oil reaching $140 a \nbarrel. Even in the heat of summer, people are concerned with how they \nare going to pay to heat their homes this winter.\n  We need a sound, balanced approach to energy. This approach certainly \nhas not been any part of the debate we have had in Congress in recent \nmonths because all the discussion seems to center around the idea of \nspeculation, which is something we need to address and should be \nconcerned about, but rest assured, it is not the lion's share of the \nproblem. We need to do more than just look at ways to appropriately \nregulate our financial markets.\n  If we look at the bill on the floor, it has fallen into that same \ntrap. This is a bill which does not deal with conservation, it does not \ndeal with alternative and renewable energy, it does not deal with \nenergy research, it does not deal with electricity production, and it \ndoes not deal with new production of oil or natural gas or any other \nkind of energy.\n  I think people across the country look at a debate such as this and \nthey scratch their heads: How can people seriously think they are going \nto have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the \nlong term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or \ndemand? There is no question, we do need to continue to work to use \nless energy, save energy, and conserve energy. However, we also need to \nwork to find more energy, develop new alternatives for energy \nproduction, and develop new reserves of energy at home. Those are the \nkinds of changes that will make a real difference in the long term, but \nthey will also make a real difference in prices today because the \nenergy futures market is just that--a prediction of what the price of \nenergy will be in the future. If the markets, businesses, industry, and \ninvestors are convinced that there will be a concerted effort to do a \nbetter job saving energy--using less--and do a better job of producing \nenergy--finding more--then those prices will, without question, come \ndown. We need legislation that makes aggressive steps in all of these \nareas, and to think that we could just deal with one area one time with \na very modest approach and have an impact is simply mistaken.\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\n  Regulation is important. Regulation is important because it ensures \nthat the markets have integrity. Regulation ensures that investors, \nwhether it is a pension fund or a mutual fund, or a farmer who is \nhedging prices for the potential of an increase in energy prices in the \nfuture, have confidence in the marketplace.\n  Any time we have a financial market, we want to make sure disclosure \nis appropriate. In the case of energy futures, we want to make sure we \nhave appropriate position limits and information that is being shared \nacross different platforms so that we understand what those positions \nare, what their volumes are, and what might be influencing pricing. We \nalso want to make sure that we have information that might be important \nto bring to bear if there is a case of price manipulation, which is \nagainst the law and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the \nlaw.\n  The question is really whether what this bill addresses and only \naddresses--the idea of regulation in the markets--whether this bill as \nwritten would significantly affect price. I don't think it would have a \nsignificant impact, but I suggest you don't take my word for it. Let's \nlook at what investors and financial experts and regulatory agencies \nhave to say about the current problem.\n  Just in this past month, Warren Buffett, an intelligent investor, \nwell known, candid, honest, certainly not a Republican, had this say:\n\n       It's not speculation, it's supply and demand. We don't have \n     excess capacity in the world anymore and that's why you are \n     seeing oil prices increase.\n\n  The Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission says:\n\n       We haven't found evidence that speculators are broadly \n     driving these prices.\n\n  The International Energy Agency--not beholden in any way to American \npoliticians or American investors on Wall Street or Main Street--says:\n\n       There is little evidence that large investment flows into \n     the futures market are causing an imbalance between supply \n     and demand and therefore contributing to high oil prices.\n\n  Chairman Ben Bernanke, testifying before Congress, said:\n\n       If financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the \n     level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, \n     we would expect inventories of crude oil to increase. But, in \n     fact, available data on oil inventories show notable declines \n     over the past year.\n\n  These individuals and organizations are not political in nature. They \nshare the same goal a good legislator would have, or anyone in America, \nto try to bring down prices. They recognize that simply adding new \nregulations to the futures market is not going to have a significant \neffect on the fundamental problem of supply and demand.\n  So the question is: How do we have an impact? How do we enact \nlegislation today that will have an effect on energy prices, not just \nin the near term but in the long term as well? Well, we need a little \nmore substance, don't we? And I think that starts with conservation--\nthe idea of using less energy.\n  It is important to note this is one area where this Congress has \ntaken a positive step, passing for the first time in 32 years an \nincrease in fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, and raising \nthat fuel efficiency requirement to 35 miles a gallon by the year 2020. \nThat will make a difference, and we need to work to make sure that is \nfully implemented.\n  But we have already seen, if we look back over the last few decades, \nthe impact that conservation can have, because today our economy uses \nover 30 percent less energy to produce a dollar of goods or services \nthan we required 30 years ago. Legislation such as the conservation \nmeasure I described and was pleased to support, will help keep us on \ntrack to improve conservation.\n  Second, clean renewable energy. Again, this pending legislation does \nnothing to encourage alternative, renewable energy, and yet we have \nlegislation that the Senate previously considered that has strong \nbipartisan support that would expand the incentives for wind, solar, \ngeothermal, biomass, and high-performance wood-burning systems. We have \nthat legislation. It has passed the Senate 88 to 8. It extends the \nproduction credits. And it is good for the environment, of course, as \nwe all know renewable energy is. In New Hampshire, where we have a \nstrong history of sustainable forestry, incentives for high-performance \nwood-burning systems are good for the local economy, and it plays a \nreal part in reducing our dependence on energy imports.\n  So we have conservation and we have renewable energy, but with oil \nreaching $140 a barrel, it is not realistic to think we can reduce our \nenergy imports if we don't produce more here at home. We need domestic \nproduction of oil and domestic production of gas, in addition to these \nclean renewables and conservation initiatives.\n  One of the previous speakers talked about 10 to 15 billion barrels of \noil in the northernmost part of Alaska, billions of barrels of \nequivalent reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf, deep offshore. And \nmost importantly, today we have the technology to take advantage of \nthese reserves in a way that is more efficient than ever before, and in \na way that protects the integrity of the environment better than ever \nbefore. The time is now to employ this technology, to unlock this \nopportunity, and in doing so to have a real impact on the cost of \nenergy in the United States and around the world.\n  The same individuals who are opposing these initiatives today opposed \nthem 5 years ago, 10 years ago, and 20 years ago. Unfortunately, we \ndidn't take action 5 years ago or 10 years ago, and now they say: Well, \nif you allow additional production deep offshore, it will take some \ntime to take advantage of those reserves. Of course it will take time. \nEverything takes time. It takes time to build a new wind farm. It takes \ntime to construct a new nuclear powerplant. It takes time to have the \nconservation proposals I talked about earlier reach their full impact. \nBut that is all the more reason to start acting today.\n  Without question, an American commitment to take better advantage of \nresources here at home will have an impact on the predicted cost of \nenergy out in the future. It will bring down the cost of energy today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, conservation, clean renewable energy, and \nproduction--this is a balanced approach, and it is the only approach \nthat will attack on all fronts and ensure that we bring down the cost \nof energy for all Americans.\n  A final point I want to make is that even as we act in these areas, \nthere is one other area we need to act on, and that is helping those \nwho don't have the financial means to work through the coming winter \nmonths and the high cost of energy. Senator Gregg, who is now on the \nfloor, has introduced legislation to double funding for the Low Income \nHeating Assistance Program, and to do so in a way that is fully paid \nfor. I am proud to cosponsor that legislation, and it is legislation \nthat should also be included in this final energy package.\n  We need an opportunity to offer amendments on renewables, on low-\nincome heating assistance, on production, in order to make this a \nmeaningful energy package that makes a difference for all the people in \nthe country by bringing down those energy costs we see every day at the \npump and across the country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time, and I look forward to the \nopportunity to offer amendments, which I hope will be supported \naggressively on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I first congratulate Senator Sununu, my \ncolleague and friend from New Hampshire, for his excellent statement, \nand I agree with everything he said, especially the part about \ncosponsoring the bill I introduced. But Senator Sununu brings a unique \nperspective to this issue because he is the only engineer in the body, \nhaving graduated from MIT, and he understands the physics and the \nchemistry and the technology issues of getting more production. Thus \nwhen he speaks on those issues, we all need to listen.\n  I rise, as he and many of my colleagues do today, to ask about why we \naren't taking up a more in-depth energy bill than just one that deals \nwith\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\nspeculation--and speculation being at the margin of the problem, \naccording to the leading experts on this.\n  When I was home this weekend, I filled up my wife's car and it cost \nalmost $70. Now that is what you call painful. The people in New \nHampshire and across this country, when they pull into that gas \nstation, are asking themselves whether they can afford the price of \nthis gas. People in the Northeast and in the colder parts of this \ncountry are worried about what is going to happen this winter when the \nprice of home heating oil has to be met. It is a scary time, and we, as \na Congress, have a responsibility to do something about that.\n  It doesn't take a lot of expertise to know there are two ways you can \naddress this problem: You can produce more energy--hopefully American \nenergy--and you can consume less energy through conservation. This bill \nthat has come to the floor here today basically does neither. It \ndoesn't produce more and it doesn't conserve more. It simply attacks \nspeculators, who, according to most of the experts, haven't been the \nmajor problem in this runup in the area of the cost of energy.\n  The problem is pretty obvious. There are 2.5 billion people between \nChina and India who are starting to use significant amounts of energy \nas they move into a better lifestyle. That has created massive new \ndemand, and supply has not gone up because there has been no \nsignificant increase in supply across the world, especially supply here \nin the United States. So the price has gone up and gone up \ndramatically.\n  The solution isn't, as has been proposed from the other side of the \naisle, to not export American energy any longer, which would give us \nhalf a day of savings in oil; or to go into the Strategic Oil Reserve \nand use that all up, which will give us 3.5 days of additional oil. The \nsolution is to look for major new production sources in the United \nStates, as well as conservation initiatives.\n  For example, if we use oil shale, we have, between 3 States--Utah, \nColorado and Wyoming--2 trillion barrels in reserves of oil shale, and \nit can be withdrawn from the ground in an environmentally safe way. \nWhat does that represent? That represents 40,000 days of oil that could \nbe produced--American oil. It is only common sense that we should \npursue American oil production, when we can do it in an environmentally \nsafe way--which we can--and when it is sitting there. The American \npeople understand that.\n  On the Outer Continental Shelf, we have billions of barrels of oil \nsitting there available, and we know we can produce it in an \nenvironmentally safe way. Why do we know that? Because we have had \nexamples of it. Hurricane Katrina, a force 5 hurricane, came right up \nthe Gulf of Mexico and destroyed one of our greatest cities. It was a \nhorrific event. But one thing that didn't happen as a result of \nHurricane Katrina was that we did not lose a barrel of oil from the \nproduction sites, from the drilling sites in the Gulf of Mexico. So we \nhave proof beyond doubt that oil can be extracted in a safe way, and we \nshould be extracting it.\n  Why should we be sending billions of dollars annually overseas to \ngovernments and individuals who have no use for us--whether it is in \nVenezuela or Iran--when we can be buying American oil and producing \nAmerican product here in the United States in a safe and \nenvironmentally sound way? It is common sense that these opportunities \nwhich sit there should be taken advantage of for the American people, \nand that we conserve more and we create more renewables.\n  Yet when a bill comes to the floor which is supposed to involve the \nmajor energy debate of this Congress, what happens? The other side of \nthe aisle says they are only going to allow one issue to be discussed: \nspeculation. They are not going to allow the issue of drilling on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, producing more American energy, to be \ndiscussed or voted on or policies to be pursued. They are not going to \nallow oil shale and the extraction of oil shale to be discussed or \nvoted on or addressed in a way which will allow us to pursue that \ncourse of activity. There is no initiative that is going to be allowed \nto be brought to the floor and no amendment on the issue of expanding \nnuclear power, which is the cleanest form of energy we have and that \ndoesn't create more environmental hazard in the way of greenhouse \ngases. All of those issues, which common sense tells you we should be \naddressing, are taken off the table. All that is wanted from the other \nside of the aisle is a political vote to give them cover in the next \nelection.\n  Well, the American people aren't interested in cover for the \nelection, they are not interested in the politics of the next election, \nthey are interested in doing something that has an immediate and long-\nterm effect on the price of energy and makes our Nation stronger.\n  Now, why does action in the area of production--which may, as the \nSenator from New Hampshire said, take 5, 10 years to bring on--have an \nimmediate effect on the cost of energy? Because the price of a barrel \nof oil is based on what is the expected supply in the outyears. And if \nthe international community knows America is going to step up and start \nproducing energy, the price of the barrel of oil goes down.\n  The world community knows we are sitting on 2 trillion barrels of \nreserve in oil shale--three times the amount of oil Saudi Arabia has. \nIf we say to the world we are going to access that oil, the price of \noil will be affected significantly today, even though it may take a few \nyears to get it on line. We are sitting, as I said, on billions of \nbarrels of oil on the Outer Continental Shelf. If we say to the world \nwe are going to use that oil, we are going to take advantage of that \noil, the price of oil on the world market will adjust to reflect that.\n  And equally important, we will be keeping those dollars in the United \nStates. These are hard-earned American dollars. People spend their \nweeks working hard to produce that income, and they want to have that \nincome reinvested here in the United States. They do not want to send \nit to Iran or to Venezuela to be reinvested there. They want it to be \nreinvested here. And the way you reinvest here is to buy product here.\n  So we need to produce more, but most especially we need to have a \ndebate on this floor which allows us to discuss these issues in a \nformal, constructive way so we can have amendments and people can \ndecide what is the best policy, not shut off debate, as is being \nproposed. What is the fear that pervades the other side of the aisle \nthat they are not willing to discuss the issue of the Outer Continental \nShelf? I am willing to take on the issue from an environmental \nstandpoint.\n  I think I have a pretty good environmental record. I am willing to \ndefend the idea of going on the Outer Continental Shelf to produce \nenergy from an environmental standpoint. I know it is good policy from \nthe standpoint of production. The same is true of oil shale. The same \nis true of nuclear power.\n  Let's bring those issues forward here, put some policies in place \nthat allow us to use those type of energy resources so we can reduce \nthe cost to the American people of the price of their energy and also \nkeep those dollars in the United States.\n  At the same time, we do need to pursue an aggressive course in \nconservation and in renewables. That is why I am supporting, along with \nSenator Ensign, Senator Cantwell from Washington, a bill to reauthorize \nthe renewable tax credits so energy sources such as wind and biomass \ncan be aggressively used and effectively used.\n  Unfortunately, that bill has also been stopped on the floor of the \nSenate. It should not be. We should be pursuing that course of action \nas aggressively as we are pursuing alternatives which give us more \nproduction.\n  You know, my experience in Government is that when you confront an \nissue, and there is a commonsense solution to that issue, most people \nusually get it. I think most people, at least in New Hampshire, get it, \nthat this issue of energy, which is so huge and so important to \neverybody's lives, especially as we head into the winter, requires an \naggressive response in the area of more production and more \nconservation.\n  They also understand, and most people understand, you cannot produce \nmore unless you actually go out and look for it. I mean it is common \nsense that you cannot produce more unless you look for it. The way you \nlook for it is you look where it is. Where it is is in\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nthe oil shale of the West and in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  We have proven beyond any doubt that both of those resources can be \nused effectively and in an environmentally sound way. At the same time, \nwe know that there are other sources of energy that are available to \nus, such as nuclear, and that there are ways to conserve, such as \nadvancing the electric car and advancing other initiatives in the area \nof renewables.\n  So it is a degradation of our responsibility as a Congress, in my \nopinion, to not take up this issue and address it across the board; \ntake on all the different elements of it so the American people have \nsome confidence that we are actually moving forward and we are not \nsimply trying to dot a political ``I'' for the next election or to \ncross a ``T'' for the next election so we can claim we did something \nhere on one item of the overall problem.\n  This is a time to take some action. I certainly hope we do not leave, \nthat this Congress does not recess without having done something \nconstructive in this area and something that meets the commonsense test \nof the American people, which is we need to produce more American \nenergy and we need to conserve more American energy.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business but for the time to count against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               VA Hotline\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have had a very important debate today \nabout energy which I spoke about earlier today. I come to the Senate \nfloor this afternoon to talk about another issue that is also \nimportant; that is, to raise awareness about one of the most \nheartbreaking and alarming consequences of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  In the 5 years since we invaded Iraq, we have seen a disturbing \nincrease in the number of young men and women who are returning home, \nstruggling with the psychological impact of the war and then, sadly, \ntake their own lives. About 1,000 war veterans who are being treated by \nthe VA attempt suicide each month. It is a problem that is affecting \nmany communities across the country.\n  Earlier this month, we lost a young man in my home State of \nWashington, just hours after he went to the VA in Spokane to ask for \ncare. He was, in fact, the sixth veteran in that community to take his \nown life this year. Currently, the Spokane VA is investigating all of \nthose cases. I have spoken to Secretary Peake, and he has assured me \nhis team is on the ground taking a hard look to see what went wrong and \nwhat they can learn from that case. But while I appreciate the work \nSecretary Peake and the Spokane VA are doing, the fact is this is a \nserious problem across the country.\n  Every suicide is a tragedy. Those young men and women are someone's \nson or daughter, someone's best friend, possibly someone's spouse or \neven a parent. Our hearts go out to all of those families and their \nfriends. These deaths are an urgent reminder that we have to keep our \neye on the ball. We owe it to all of our servicemembers and veterans to \ndemand that the VA and the Department of Defense make it a national \npriority to bring those numbers down.\n  I acknowledge that the VA is taking steps to reach out to our \nveterans and their families to let them know that help is available. \nThis week, in fact, the VA is rolling out a public service campaign in \nWashington, DC. It is part of a 3-month-long pilot program, and the VA \nis going to be running a series of ads on TV, on buses and trains, and \non the subway. Those ads are going to highlight the VA's 24-hour \nsuicide prevention hotline. The number for that is 1-800-273-TALK. It \nwill help assure our veterans it is OK to ask for help. I truly applaud \nthe VA for that effort because it is a good step. We have to absolutely \nget the word out to veterans and their families. If this helps prevent \none tragedy, then it is more than worth it.\n  I applaud the VA. I hope the Defense Department will also publicize \nthat number among its Active-Duty troops so when they leave the \nservice, they will already be aware of it. But this is only a step. An \nad campaign is only as good as the resources that are there when our \nservicemembers call and ask for help.\n  If we truly are going to make a difference, we need a much bigger \neffort. We have to do more to reach out. We have to do more to break \ndown the barriers to those seeking mental health care. We need to back \nup those efforts with enough resources and money to ensure that when a \nveteran goes into the hospital asking for help, the VA offers the best \ncare possible.\n  While I applaud the idea of publicizing the suicide prevention \nhotline, I believe the military and the VA must reach out long before \nour young men and women pick up that phone and call for help. That is \ngoing to take creativity and leadership.\n  The VA and the Defense Department can't keep doing things the way \nthey have always done them because the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nnot like any we have fought before. Our All-Volunteer Force has been on \nthe ground in these two countries for longer than we fought in World \nWar II. Troops get very little downtime. Many of them are serving their \nthird or fourth and sometimes fifth deployments. This is a stress that \nis taking a toll on everyone.\n  For many of them, it gets worse when they come home to the pressures \nof everyday life or financial strains or family problems. That is \nespecially true for members of the National Guard and Reserves because, \nunlike Active-Duty troops who return from battle to go to a military \nbase where there is a support network, many of our Guard and Reserve \nmembers go home right away to family pressures and to civilian jobs \nthey need to start right away.\n  The military and the VA have to update their resources and outreach \nefforts to match the challenges our troops face when they return. That \nsafety net has to be in place before they ever leave the military. That \nmeans we must have creative programs that help our servicemembers \ntransition from that battlefield back to the home front. It means \nproviding family and financial counseling to any servicemember who \nneeds it, and it means developing a way for the military or the VA to \nfollow up with our servicemembers, especially those who have already \nasked for help with psychological needs. We have to also encourage our \nservicemembers and veterans to seek care when they need it by breaking \ndown the barriers that prevent them from asking for help.\n  The VA and the Defense Department have to take strong steps to change \nthe military culture so that servicemembers no longer fear that seeking \ncare will be viewed as some sign of weakness or one that could hurt \ntheir career. Even more important, servicemembers and veterans must be \nconvinced if they ask for help, doctors and staff will take them \nseriously and provide the care they need.\n  I personally have heard too many tragic stories about veterans who \nhave gone to the VA in distress, only to face a doctor who \nunderestimated their symptoms and sent them home to an end in tragedy. \nWhen someone with a history of depression or PTSD or other \npsychological wounds walks into one of our VAs and says they are \nsuicidal, it should set off alarm bells for everyone. We can't convince \nveterans or servicemembers to get care if they think they will be met \nwith lectures and closed doors. That is simply unacceptable. At the \nvery least, we have to ensure that staff at military and VA medical \ncenters have the training to recognize and treat someone who is in real \ndistress.\n  Finally, we have to provide the resources to back up all of these \nefforts, starting with making sure that the suicide prevention hotline \nis staffed with enough trained professionals to provide real help to \nsomeone in need. I hope that will be the case. Unfortunately, this \nadministration has failed for 8 long years to make good on its promises \nand provide the resources for our veterans to carry them out. Time and\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\ntime again it has taken leaks and scandals to get the administration to \nown up to major problems at the VA--from inadequate budgets to rising \nsuicide rates about which I am talking today. Its response to rising \ncosts has been to underfund research and cut off services for some of \nour veterans. We have to do better than that. Servicemembers and \nveterans need more than an 800 number to call. They need psychiatrists \nand psychologists who understand the horrors of war and the stresses \nour troops feel.\n  We also have to make sure we have the facilities and systems set up \nto accommodate the troops who will be entering the VA system in the \nnext decade. We have to fast-track research into the signature injuries \nof this war, such as traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, so we understand how to diagnose and treat those conditions. \nWe need to speed up efforts that will enable the DOD and VA to share \nrecords so that fewer servicemembers slip through the cracks as they \ntransition from Active Duty to veteran status. Now is the time to \ninvest in research and infrastructure. We cannot afford to wait.\n  Many of us are familiar with the story of Joseph Dwyer, a young Army \nmedic, made famous in a photo taken during the first week of the U.S. \ninvasion of Iraq. In that photo, we have seen Joseph running toward \nsafety with an injured Iraqi child in his arms. It is an epic image of \nbravery and compassion.\n  When he came home, Joseph struggled to fit back into civilian life. \nHe suffered from PTSD and, tragically, earlier this year, he died of \nwhat police are treating as an accidental drug overdose. That photo of \nJoseph Dwyer captured the incredible work our troops are doing every \nsingle day. But, sadly, Joseph's story is also now an example of what \nfar too many veterans face when they come home. The photo of Joseph was \ntaken during the first week of this war. Now, more than 5 years later, \nwe ought to have the resources in place to treat the psychological \nwounds of war as well as we do the physical ones. But we don't.\n  I ask my colleagues to put themselves in the shoes of a parent or \nspouse who has lost a child, a husband or a wife, or someone they know \nto suicide. I want them to think of all the questions they might be \nasking. We might not be able to provide all the answers, but we should \nat least be able to say we are doing everything we can to address the \nproblem.\n  We know there are many dedicated, hard-working VA employees who spend \ncountless hours providing our vets with the best treatment possible. We \nalso have to recognize the system is still unprepared today for the \ninflux of veterans coming home. As I have told my colleagues before, a \nrecent RAND study shows that one in four veterans is struggling with \nPTSD. It is the duty of the VA and of a grateful nation to be prepared \nto care for their unique wounds. In order to do that, we need strong \nleadership and attention to detail in Washington, DC, in Spokane, WA, \nand everywhere in between.\n  At the end of day, this is not about bureaucracy. It is not about \nprotecting turf. It is about saving lives. I am glad the administration \nplans to increase its outreach. It is a pilot program. It is only a \nsmall step. We have to make this a national priority to address this \ntragedy.\n  The administration has to back up its efforts by reaching out to our \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families. We have to break down the \nbarriers that prevent our servicemembers and veterans from seeking and \ngetting mental health care, and we have to provide adequate resources.\n  No matter how anyone feels about this war, our troops are heroes. \nThey have done everything we have asked of them--and more. It is time \nour commitment measured up to theirs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere \nconcern about the manner in which this body is considering energy-\nrelated legislation.\n  My constituents are interested in meaningful policy that will address \nthe extremely high energy costs they are facing today. They know that \nin order to deliver real results, we must develop legislation designed \nto address the entire problem--supply, demand, and market oversight.\n  They are not interested in why one policy proposal is more worthy \nthan another and therefore should be addressed before the other \nnecessary elements of the solution, which is no doubt the debate we \nwill be having today. We need to deal with increased supply from both \ntraditional energy sources and next-generation sources, improve \nconservation of resources, and ensure greater market transparency and \noversight.\n  I recognize that for meaningful, comprehensive legislation to pass, \nboth Democrats and Republicans are going to need to work together, \nwhich means everyone will not get everything they want, and we will all \nhave to accept a few things that do not necessarily appeal to our \ninterests. But that is what it takes to forge a workable compromise. \nDemocrats and Republicans need to come together and determine what we \ncan agree to, rather than bringing legislation to the floor of the \nSenate that, frankly, is designed to offend one side or the other.\n  For this reason, I have sought to work with my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, and have found that many within this body want \nto develop a bipartisan proposal that will yield real results. \nUnfortunately, the bill before the Senate today seems more intended to \ndivide the Senate rather than unite us in an effort to develop a \nmeaningful solution.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry--the committee with jurisdiction over commodity futures \ntrading--I have an obligation to ensure that legislation dealing with \nsuch matters is appropriately analyzed. Unfortunately, the committee of \nexpertise did not have an opportunity to review this legislation before \nit was brought to the Senate floor, and for that reason many problems \nexist within this language.\n  When dealing with issues of such complexity, we cannot afford to \nignore the potential unintended consequences that will surely result \nfrom this approach. What if we are wrong and we actually drive up the \nprice of crude oil? What if we miscalculate the true burden we are \nplacing on the over-the-counter market and such activities migrate to \nforeign markets? What if we reduce liquidity in the market so much that \nour physical market participants have limited hedging opportunities?\n  As I said, this issue is extremely complicated, and the factual data \nis lacking, which, unfortunately, allows everyone to paint the picture \nconvenient for their own cause. I am sure you all have heard \nconflicting reports. For example, some claim that in recent years \nnoncommercial participation, or speculation, in the oil markets has not \nchanged when compared to the proportion of commercial participation by \nthose who actually have a stake in the physical commodity, while others \nsay that speculation in the oil markets has increased from 37 percent \nto 70 percent in recent years.\n  This is quite a discrepancy in the facts. The truth is that neither \nof these claims is proven completely accurate. Why? Because the \ncategory used to determine commercial participation includes swap \ndealers who actually trade on behalf of both commercial operators as \nwell as speculators, and we simply do not have the data to verify which \nclaim is accurate.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is now in the process of \ngetting more segregated data from these swaps dealers to determine how \nmuch activity is truly speculative in nature. But data separated out in \nthis manner is currently not available. We simply do not know yet how \nspeculation participation may or may not have increased compared to \nparticipation by those we would consider physical market stakeholders.\n  I only mention this as an example of conflicting data upon which some \nof those proposed policy changes are predicated. I am not claiming that \none side or the other is correct. But I do believe we need to have \naccurate data before we seek to make major modifications in the manner \nin which these futures markets operate.\n  I want to be perfectly clear about this: I am not opposed to all \naspects of the bill before the Senate today. In fact, I believe many of \nthe components designed to yield more transparency in\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nthese markets are necessary and that they could be improved upon and \nenacted. We must ensure that the information both the regulators and \nCongress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our \nactions.\n  However, this language goes far beyond what I consider reasonable, \nespecially absent factually based data to support such radical changes \nand a thorough review of the potential unintended consequences. I truly \nbelieve that a reasonable market oversight component could be developed \nas part of a bipartisan, comprehensive package, but, unfortunately, \nthis approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable \nand balanced legislation.\n  I have in hand a letter from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, \namong others, dated July 21, 2008. It is a letter from what is referred \nto as the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. It is a group \nmade up of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Acting Chairman of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  We requested that group--which is the group that is viewed in this \ntown as the most expert group on issues related to the financial \nmarkets--we asked them to take a look at S. 3268, the bill before the \nSenate now, seeking to put more restrictions on speculators in the oil \ncommodities market, and to see what they thought about the particular \nbill--not the issue of speculation, but the bill itself.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 21, 2008.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: In response to your July 16 letter, \n     we are providing the views of the President's Working Group \n     on Financial Markets (PWG) concerning S. 3268--legislation \n     addressing regulation of the U.S. energy futures markets.\n       The PWG is concerned that high commodity prices, including \n     record oil prices, are putting a considerable strain on \n     American families and businesses. Proper regulation of the \n     energy futures markets is necessary to ensure that prices \n     reflect economic factors, rather than manipulative forces. To \n     this end, the PWG worked with Congress to enact, as part of \n     this year's Farm Bill reauthorization, additional regulatory \n     authorities for the CFTC to regulate certain over-the-counter \n     (OTC) energy transactions on electronic exchanges. The PWG \n     also supports the recent steps taken by the CFTC to improve \n     the oversight and transparency of the energy futures markets.\n       The PWG agencies also are participating in an Interagency \n     Task Force on Commodity Markets that will provide a staff \n     report on the role of economic fundamentals and speculation \n     in the commodity markets in the near future. If this staff \n     report or the analysis of other data the CFTC has recently \n     collected from commodity market participants suggests that \n     changes to futures market regulation are necessary, the PWG \n     stands ready to assist lawmakers in crafting such \n     modifications.\n       However, the PWG believes that bill S. 3268, as introduced, \n     would significantly harm U.S. energy markets without evidence \n     that it would lower crude oil prices. Among its several \n     provisions, it would require the CFTC to define and promote \n     ``legitimate'' trading and significantly curtail other types \n     of trading in the futures, OTC and overseas markets. Such \n     unprecedented restrictions on market participation could \n     reduce market liquidity, hinder the price discovery process, \n     and limit the ability of market participants to manage and \n     transfer risk. Provisions in the bill also may harm U.S. \n     competitiveness by driving some trading to overseas markets \n     or to more opaque trading systems at a time when policymakers \n     are trying to encourage greater transparency. Should this \n     legislation become law, the chances of significant unintended \n     consequences in the markets would be high.\n       This legislation would regulate for the first time certain \n     OTC transactions similarly to on-exchange transactions. It \n     has been the long-held view of the PWG that bilateral, OTC \n     derivatives transactions do not require the same degree of \n     regulatory oversight as exchange-traded instruments because \n     they do not raise the investor protection and manipulation \n     concerns associated with exchange-traded instruments. \n     Regulating these OTC instruments could prove costly and \n     difficult to administer by both regulators and the industry \n     given the size and nature of the market, might not provide \n     meaningful regulatory data, and could negatively affect the \n     ability of U.S. firms and markets to compete globally in \n     these types of transactions.\n       To date, the PWG has not found valid evidence to suggest \n     that high crude oil prices over the long term are a direct \n     result of speculation or systematic market manipulation by \n     traders. Rather, prices appear to be reflecting tight global \n     supplies and the growing world demand for oil, particularly \n     in emerging economies. As a result, Congress should proceed \n     cautiously before drastically changing the regulation of the \n     energy markets.\n       We look forward to working with Congress on these important \n     energy market issues and appreciate your seeking our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry M. Paulson, Jr.,\n       Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Ben S. Bernanke,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n     Christopher Cox,\n       Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     Walter L. Lukken,\n       Acting Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I want to take a minute to read a couple of statements \nin the letter. The PWG refers to the bill, talks a little bit about \nwhat it will do, and then it says:\n\n       . . . the PWG believes that [the] bill S. 3268, as \n     introduced, would significantly harm U.S. energy markets \n     without evidence that it would lower crude oil prices.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       To date, the PWG has not found valid evidence to suggest \n     that high crude oil prices over the long term are a direct \n     result of speculation or systematic market manipulation by \n     traders. Rather, prices appear to be reflecting tight global \n     supplies and the growing world demand for oil, particularly \n     in emerging economies. As a result, Congress should proceed \n     cautiously before drastically changing the regulation of the \n     energy markets.\n\n  This mirrors exactly my concern about this particular piece of \nlegislation. If we have a knee-jerk reaction to the issue of \nspeculation in the markets, and we are wrong, what we are going to do \nis we are not only going to destroy the energy markets in this country, \nbut we are going to take those legitimate operators, those legitimate \ninvestors in the energy markets, and we are going to drive them \noverseas. We are going to have no control whatsoever over their buying \nand selling of contracts, whether it be oil, and the next thing we know \nit will be other food products that are dealt with in the commodity \nworld on a daily basis.\n  So I think we need to listen to the experts. We need to make sure we \ntake the time to develop the right kind of policy, with the right kind \nof expert information, having input into the legislation, whatever it \nmay be. At the right time, let's have a bill on the floor that \nencompasses not only the energy markets themselves and any type of \nadditional restrictions or regulations we need to put there, \nparticularly from a transparency standpoint, but also we need to deal \nwith the overall issues of additional domestic exploration. We need to \ndeal with the issue of conservation, whether it be through lessening \nthe use of gasoline, diesel, or whatever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Plus, we need to make sure we are developing the right \nkinds of incentives in the automobile industry, as well as for \nconsumers to encourage the manufacture and purchase of vehicles that \nare operated by alternative methods, whether it is electricity or \nnatural gas, or whatever it may be.\n  So I urge we move cautiously, we not react too quickly, and we be \nvery careful in our approach to this issue and the bill that is on the \nfloor today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nin the forefront of every American's mind. Americans nationwide are \nstruggling with high gas prices. I attended a press conference the \nother day with people who administer programs that provide for the \npoor, they talked about how the poor are being disproportionately \naffected by high fuel prices. The part of the American population being \nmost severely affected is those who operate on the margins, such as our \npoor, such as small business people, who traditionally contribute a \nhuge amount to our economy. Many times they do not have the ability to \nstore their resources for when the economy turns\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\ndown, so these small businesses, and these poor Americans, are being \nimpacted disproportionately.\n  Higher gas prices not only affect our ability to get around, but \nincreasingly they are affecting each facet of our everyday life. Energy \nbuilds into our economy from the natural resource level right on up to \nthe final product that goes out to the market and is utilized by the \nconsumer.\n  Fuel costs are making transportation, construction, and food costs \nrise. Recently, oil hit $145 per barrel and, from the beltway to Middle \nAmerica, $4 a gallon gas is the frightening norm.\n  In the face of these challenges to the American economy and consumer, \nwe have failed to take the steps that are necessary to address this \nproblem either in the short term or the long term. Unfortunately, the \nlegislation we are considering today would do little to change that.\n  The legislation before us today would do little if anything to reduce \noil prices. Blaming investors misses the primary cause of high fuel \nprices: Nearly 2 years of failed congressional energy policy that has \ndone little to increase availability of fuel resources. That is the \ncause, and time and time again, we have looked at legislation that \ntries to disrupt the market--the market that provides an opportunity \nfor the businesses of this country to supply energy to its consumers.\n  This Congress has been ignoring one of the fundamental rules of \neconomics: Supply and demand. Instituting policies that disrupt the \nfree market does not increase supply. Worldwide supply for energy is \nbeing outpaced by a growing demand.\n  President Bush is doing his part by removing the Executive order that \nlimited the drilling for oil and gas off the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  The majority party now wants to shift blame from this Chamber to \ninvestors, who they would have you believe are robber baron \nspeculators. If only it were so simple. There is no nefarious fiend \nsitting in a dark room waxing his black mustache playing the market \nlike a mandolin. So who is investing then? Pension funds are, for one. \nThey are making an investment in the growing strength of energy stocks \nand bonds.\n  In Colorado, the Public Employees' Retirement Association--we refer \nto it as PERA--has seen oil companies as an attractive place to invest \ntheir members' money. Their 2007 investment overview listed two oil \ncompanies in their top 10 stock holdings, including their No. 1 valued \nstock.\n  Is their greater interest in investing? Sure there is. But it is \nprimarily because short supply of oil has caused its value to increase. \nThis would happen with any commodity in a similar situation. \nConversely, when we take steps to increase supply, prices will go down.\n  If I remember correctly, there is a guidance principle that applies \nto the Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado that says \nyou are going to invest members' money in that part of the stock market \nthat is going to, in a safe way, give you the best return. Energy \nstocks match that criteria.\n\n  The day after President Bush lifted the Presidential moratorium on \ndrilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, oil prices fell nearly $7 a \nbarrel. Let me say that again. We experienced a drop of almost $7 per \nbarrel in 24 hours because action was taken that got us closer to \nputting additional supply on the market. This translates into cheaper \ngas.\n  The national average price for gas yesterday was almost 5 cents less \nper gallon than it was before the Presidential moratorium was lifted. \nThis shows that instead of blaming investors, we need to look for ways \nto increase supply. We do this by finding more sources of energy and \nusing less.\n  One of the most promising sources of domestic energy is found in the \nWest, much in my home State of Colorado. The oil shale found in \nColorado, Utah, and Wyoming could yield between 800 billion to 1.8 \ntrillion barrels of oil. This is more than the proven reserves of the \nentire country of Saudi Arabia and certainly enough to help drive down \ngas prices and bring us closer to energy independence. Making us less \ndependent on foreign oil. We in the United States cannot currently \nbegin to plan how to utilize this resource because of an ill-advised \nmoratorium.\n  Why aren't we taking steps to utilize this resource and cut back on \nthe $700 billion we send overseas annually for fuel? Because the \nDemocrats in the Senate and in the House of Representatives have \nprevented the Department of the Interior from even issuing the proposed \nregulation under which oil shale development could move forward. How do \nthey try to correct this misguided policy? By blaming investors and \nproposing a piece of legislation that will potentially make things \nworse by increasing oil market volatility and eliminating investment \nopportunities.\n  I support some CFTC reform, such as providing them resources to \nimprove current oversight and get more cops on the beat. I do, however, \nhave major concerns with efforts that would impede the free market with \nadditional regulations. This is especially important now that financial \nmarkets are global in scale. Attempts to regulate the market would only \napply in the United States. This could cause economic activity to move \noffshore and help build foreign capital markets that compete against \nthe United States, making us less competitive. This would cause us to \nlose jobs.\n  Instead of focusing on blame, we should be focusing on our resources, \nfinding more domestic resources, such as oil shale and using less \nthrough conservation. We need more supply and less demand. As we move \nforward in this debate I hope the Senate will accept amendments, like \nthe ones I hope to offer, that will do just that.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to join the sentiments of my \ncolleagues from Georgia and Colorado who have spoken about the \nimportance we must place as a nation on implementing an effective and \nmeaningful energy policy in this country as quickly as possible. The \nUnited States is far too dependent in our energy policy on petroleum, \nand we are far too dependent in terms of the petroleum which we utilize \nfrom foreign sources.\n  We need to diversify our energy policy, and we need to do it quickly. \nBy that what I mean is that while we are seeking to become less \ndependent on petroleum, we must aggressively develop and produce our \nown sources of petroleum to help stabilize and control the increasing \nand spiraling cost of oil. We also need to look at alternative and \nrenewable fuels. We need to strongly move into nuclear power. We need \nto work on conservation aggressively. It is estimated that as much as \n30 percent of the world's consumption of energy could be reduced \nthrough effective conservation measures. That is another huge source of \nenergy--simply not consuming.\n  Yet as we have all of these alternatives and options out there, we \nare faced today with a bill in the Senate and a process to handle this \nbill that severely limits our ability to evaluate and, hopefully, adopt \nmeaningful alternatives and to establish a sensible comprehensive \nnational energy policy.\n  The bill we have before us today has one item in it, and that is a \nregulatory change, or governance, of the futures markets, often called \nthe speculation bill. Certainly--and I will talk about it in a moment--\ncertainly, we can debate whether there is a need for increased \nregulatory support and for evaluation and oversight and management of \nour futures markets. I believe there is room for that, though I believe \nthe bill that is before us is not well written. However, while we are \ndoing so, we ought to also take this opportunity--and Americans should \nbe glad an energy issue is on the floor of the Senate, but we ought to \ntake this opportunity, with a bill on the floor of the Senate, to look \nat the other ideas about how we should achieve energy independence. The \ncircumstances we face now threaten not only our economic security but \nour national security, and Americans should cry out for this Congress \nto take solid comprehensive action now, not to simply face one issue \nthat arguably is not even at the core of the need for the solutions.\n  The Senate ought to work the way it has worked in the past. Let me \ngive a couple of examples. Bill after bill after bill, the way this \nSenate has historically worked, was brought to the floor, amendments \nwere filed, a robust debate\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\nwas held on the amendments, votes were taken on many of the amendments, \nand at the end of the process, after the Senate worked its will, the \nbill moved forward for final passage.\n  In 2005, when we were considering energy policy, that is exactly what \nhappened. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, there were 235 amendments \nproposed to the bill. Of that 235 amendments, after the process worked \nits way, 57 were adopted. There were 19 rollcall votes on amendments, \nand it took 10 days for the Senate to complete this action.\n  Last year, as the Senate considered the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007, again, there were 331 amendments filed, 49 of \nwhich were adopted. We had 16 rollcall votes on amendments, and it took \n15 days on the floor, but the Senate worked its will and the ideas of \nAmericans from all perspectives were able to be brought forward and \ndebated on the floor of the Senate.\n  What are we faced with now, as gas prices are over $4 per gallon in \nthis country? A bill that brings forth one solution; namely, to \nregulate the futures markets, and then offers one other vote to the \nRepublicans as an alternative. That is a far cry from the robust, full \ndebate on policy this issue deserves in this Senate.\n  Now, those who have brought forth the bill with regard to speculation \nargue that with a bill dealing with speculation alone, it could reduce \nthe price of gasoline by 20 to 50 percent. The reality is the academics \nand the economists state it is not speculation; instead, it is supply \nand demand. Warren Buffett, for example, says:\n\n       It is not speculation, it is supply and demand. . . .We \n     don't have excess capacity in the world anymore, and that's \n     what you're seeing in oil prices.\n\n  Walter Lukken, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission--the Commission that monitors these issues--says: ``We \nhaven't evidence that speculators are broadly driving these prices.''\n  The International Energy Agency states:\n\n       There is little evidence that large investment flows into \n     the futures market are causing an imbalance between supply \n     and demand and are therefore contributing to high oil prices. \n     . . .Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids \n     taking the necessary steps to improve supply-side access and \n     investment or to implement measures to improve energy \n     efficiency.\n\n  The Chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke says:\n\n       If financial speculation were pushing prices above the \n     level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, \n     we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum \n     products to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But, in \n     fact, available data on oil inventories shows notable \n     declines over the past year.\n\n  The point is the experts are making it clear to us that although we \ndo need to aggressively improve the capacity of our country to conduct \noversight and evaluation of our futures market to be sure manipulation \nis not occurring, the current situation is most likely not being driven \nby that speculation. That is exactly what the President's working group \nsaid to us in the letter that was sent to Senator Chambliss today.\n  I will quote that again:\n\n       To date, the President's working group--\n\n  That again is the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve System, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \nand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairmen--\n\n       To date, the President's working group has not found \n     evidence to suggest that high crude oil prices over the long \n     term are a direct result of speculation or systematic market \n     manipulation by traders.\n\n  The fact is supply in the world has leveled off and some fear will \nbegin declining and demand in the world has skyrocketed. As a result, \nthose who invest in the futures market for oil are speculating it is \ngoing to go up. If we want to address the issue, we will address supply \nand demand issues.\n  Now, those of us who want to see the United States more aggressively \nengage in its own production are often told: Well, there is already 68 \nmillion acres of Federal land that is open for production. Let's force \nthose lands to be where we produce and we would not then have to go \nlook elsewhere.\n  Well, the fallacy in that argument is that 85 percent of the lower 48 \nOuter Continental Shelf and 83 percent of the onshore Federal, nonpark, \nnonwilderness lands are off limits for exploration and production, and \nof that 68 million acres that is talked about, not every acre the \nUnited States puts up for exploration yields oil. In fact, the \npercentage for onshore leases is only about 10 percent which actually \nends up ultimately being productive for oil. If you go into the \noffshore, the success rate is a little higher--about 33 percent--and \nthe deep water offshore is at about 20 percent.\n  My point is, these acreages that are being talked about that have \nbeen leased for exploration and potential production are not all going \nto be producing oil. In fact, the large majority of them will not \nproduce oil. Those that are capable of successfully being put into \nproduction are aggressively being pursued. In fact, the law today \nrequires that if they are not pursued and put into production, then the \nleases are lost.\n  So for those who want to avoid the United States getting more \naggressive in its own production to say: Well, we have 68 million \nacres, so let's go there, are missing the point. The point is, there is \na tremendous amount of oil in the U.S. reserves that we could utilize \nto defend and protect the security of our economy and our Nation.\n  Here are a couple examples: 14 billion barrels are available on the \nAtlantic and Pacific Outer Continental Shelf. What does that mean, 14 \nbillion barrels? That is more than all the U.S. imports from the \nPersian Gulf countries for the last 15 years. If you look to the oil \nshale reserves, right now the United States has more than three times \nthe oil reserves than Saudi Arabia in the States of Colorado, Utah, and \nWyoming--huge amounts of reserves. When you look at the reserves we \nhave, it is about 1.8 trillion potential recoverable barrels of shale \noil, which is the equivalent to hundreds of years of supply of oil at \ncurrent rates of consumption. Why should the United States continue to \nrefuse to engage in production of our own supplies, when we can do so \nin ways that will protect and preserve the environment and will make it \npossible for us to be far less dependent on foreign sources of oil?\n  I don't have much more time, but I think it is important for us in \nthe Senate to recognize we truly face a crisis, and this issue should \nnot be dealt with in a partisan manner. There are ideas across this \nChamber from across this country, by many people, that range from more \nproduction to oversight and regulation of investment markets, to \nconservation, to electric cars and other types of efficiencies, to a \nnumber of different ideas, many of which are very helpful and can be a \npart of the solution. Wind and solar and other alternative and \nrenewable fuels need to be incentivized, but we will not get there if \nthe debate is restricted,\n  If the people of this country are denied the opportunity for the \nSenate to engage in a robust effort to develop a comprehensive national \nenergy policy, it is my sincere hope that, as we move forward, we will \nbe allowed to have an open amendment process, where Senators can vote \ntheir conscience on a broad array of solutions and that we can then \nsend a strong, powerful bill to the President and a powerful message to \nthe market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is an old saying that when all is \nsaid and done, in most cases, more is actually said than done. Perhaps \nthat applies best to this debate.\n  Should we resolve our energy problems and make us less dependent on \nthe Saudis, Iraqis, and Venezuelans? Of course. Are we too dependent on \nforeign oil? You bet. Up to 70 percent of our oil comes from outside \nthis country. Are we addicted to oil, as President Bush has suggested? \nOf course. How do you deal with the addiction to oil? Well, every 10 \nyears, our colleagues come to the floor and say let's drill more holes, \nbigger holes, deeper holes.\n  Do you know what? The debate is all about false choices. The \nsuggestion has been made that people on this side of the Senate Chamber \ndon't want to produce anymore. That is absurd, and they know it. That \nis what we insist because that is the narrative they have created for \nthis issue. They don't want to do what needs doing, so they want to \ncreate a series of false choices.\n  Let me describe the issue of drilling. Drill more. Well, I support \ndrilling\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\nmore. I worked with several others in this Chamber to open lease 181 in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. I was one of four Senators who began that process. \nThere is 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico that has been open for \n2 years. There is no oil activity on it right now, despite the fact \nthere are proven reserves of oil and natural gas.\n  This is a map of Alaska, and this is the National Petroleum Reserve \nAlaska, NPRA. This happens to be 23 million acres, 20 million of which \naren't even leased yet. But they are all open for production. We \nsupported that. Here is a place you can drill. There is more oil here \nthan there is in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which has become the \nhood ornament for their argument. So why aren't we drilling in the \nNPRA? It is open.\n  Many Republicans say that Democrats don't support drilling. In my \nhome State, we have the Bakken shale, a seam 10,000 feet down. We have \n75 drilling rigs producing oil, drilling for oil in the Bakken shale, \njust in western North Dakota. There is similar activity in eastern \nMontana. A U.S. Geological Survey finished the assessment, and it is \nthe largest contiguous assessment in the history of the lower 48 \nStates. They released that 3 months ago at my request. There are up to \n3.65 billion barrels of recoverable oil. We are drilling there right \nnow. Don't tell me we are not for drilling. I am for more drilling. I \nam for much more conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy \nproduction. I am for all those things, but it seems to me you ought to \ndo first things first.\n  We have a broken market called the oil futures market. It is a \ncommodities market with which producers and consumers can hedge risks \nof a physical commodity, but it is now broken. It was created in 1936. \nThe law that creates it has a provision called ``excess speculation,'' \nbecause they were worried about excess speculation. When Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt signed the bill creating the oil futures market, he \nwarned about excess speculation. Well, here we are. The speculators \nhave taken over this market. If you wonder if that is the case, I will \nshow you the result of a House of Representatives investigation. In \n2000, 37 percent of the trades on the oil futures market were \nspeculators. Now in 2008, it is 71 percent. They have completely taken \nover that market.\n  To my colleagues who say ``supply and demand''--and said:\n\n        . . . I wonder, why do people think that the American \n     people are so dumb they don't understand supply and demand?\n\n  He misunderstands. The American people aren't dumb at all. They get \nit. They are sick and tired of driving to the gas pump and paying these \nprices. They are sick and tired of seeing the price of oil double in \none year, and then they look at supply and demand and realize nothing \nhas happened in supply and demand to justify it--nothing.\n  I have asked the question: Will someone come to the floor of the \nSenate and describe to me what happened in supply and demand that \njustifies a doubling of the price of oil and gas in a year? They never \ndo because they can't. The Secretary of Energy can't. The head of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission can't. Despite the fact both of \nthem repeatedly have said what is happening with the price of oil and \ngas is the fundamentals of supply and demand. Oh, really? Where? \nDescribe it to me. Nothing has happened in the fundamentals of supply \nand demand that justifies doubling the price in the last year. What has \nhappened is brain dead regulators, who are supposed to be wearing the \nstriped shirts, the referees that are supposed to call the fouls, have \nsat back and said: Do whatever you want to do, have a good time, have a \nparty, a carnival.\n  Speculators have taken over the market. There is a very important \nreason to have a futures market. It is to allow legitimate hedging of \nrisk between producers and consumers of a physical product. This market \nbecame something much different than that. The regulators have said we \nwill issue no-action letters so we don't have that to see. We are \nwillfully blind and deaf and don't care very much what is going on. I \nknow they will deny that, but that is the fact.\n  So you have a regulatory body that doesn't regulate, a market that is \nbroken, and then we have folks waltz in here and thumb their suspenders \nand say: You know, we cannot be talking about speculation because there \nis no speculation. We have had testimony before our committees by some \npretty good people who say that as much as 20, 30, up to 40 percent of \nthe current price is due to rampant, relentless speculation.\n  Let me describe it from the standpoint of Mr. Fadel Gheit. I have \ntalked to him by phone. He testified before the committee. This is a \nman who worked, for 30 to 35 years, as a top energy analyst for \nOppenheimer  Company. He said this last fall:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I am convinced that \n     oil prices should not be a dime above $55 a barrel.\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It's open 24/7 \n     and totally unregulated. It is like a highway with no cops \n     and no speed limit, and everybody is going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  So we bring a bill to the Senate that says let's establish a \ndistinction between those who are legitimately hedging--that is trading \nfor legitimate hedging purposes and all others. All the others will be \nsubject to strong position limits to try to wring the speculation out \nof the system. It is a reasonable thing to do, in my judgment.\n  My colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and say: No, let's go \nfor more drilling. That is their narrative. I say, OK, let's do \ndrilling. How about in the National Petroleum Reserve? We set aside 23 \nmillion acres there, and only 3 million have been leased. Let's do \nthat. In lease 181, there are 8.3 million acres available. There is \nplenty available if you want to do drilling. Even as we do that, how \nabout helping us get rid of the speculation in the marketplace and \nrestore this market to what it was intended to do. Do you choose to \nstand on the side, when somebody says whose side are you on? They say: \nLet us think about that. We are going to be on the side of the oil \nspeculators. Really? Or I am going to be on the side of those who don't \nwant us to become less dependent upon the Saudis. It is fine if $500 \nbillion, $600 billion or $700 billion a year is sent outside our \ncountry in pursuit of oil. That is OK. That will not weaken our \ncountry.\n  We all know better than that. We don't need an overnight epiphany to \nunderstand what is happening to our country. These relentless price \nincreases and the unbelievable dependence we have on foreign sources of \noil are injuring this country. Every consumer in this country is \ndamaged almost every day. Which airline next will declare bankruptcy or \nliquidate? How many trucking companies aren't in business anymore? Ask \nfarmers what it is going to cost when they try to fill their tanks with \na load of fuel. Then can you conclude this doesn't matter? You cannot \nconclude that. We ought to be here debating what to do. It ought to be \nobvious. I have said before, if you are running the high hurdles, you \nhave to decide to jump the first hurdle in front of you. The first \nhurdle, it seems to me, is to address this relentless speculation and \nput downward pressure on gas and oil, on prices.\n\n  Let me describe what our Energy Information Administration said. They \nsaid there is no question about speculation. The only way you can \nconclude this is not speculation is to look at this chart and not see \nit. On this chart, here is the price of oil. It is kind of like a Roman \ncandle on the Fourth of July. Here is what our Energy Information \nAdministration told us. We spend about $100 million a year for this \nagency, which has the best and the brightest, to evaluate supply and \ndemand and come up with this. I put this chart together because I want \neverybody to see how wrong they have been and conclude why.\n  Take November of last year. They said this would happen to the price \nof oil. Then, in January of last year, they said the line will look \nlike this. In March of this year, they said it is going to look like \nthis. You can go back to May of last year, a year ago. Obviously, this \nisn't where the price went. It went up like this. Is that because the \npeople estimating it were stupid, maybe didn't sleep well, didn't \nfinish school, or had no common sense? That is not why. They didn't \nunderstand this is not about supply and demand any longer.\n  This is about a speculative binge that is driving up the price of oil \nin a manner that is completely disconnected\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\nwith supply and demand. I understand we have people talking about that, \nand I understand the world is changing. I understand the Chinese want \nto drive cars and people from India want to drive automobiles. I \nunderstand there will be maybe 300 million, 400 million, to 500 million \nmore cars on the road 10, 20, 30 years from now. I understand that. But \nthat hasn't changed significantly in the last 12 months. There is \nnothing that changed with the estimate of future demands in the last 12 \nmonths that justifies this line.\n  That is why we bring a bill to the floor of the Senate that says \nlet's at least agree, on a bipartisan basis, to do first things first. \nThen you say, well, we need to support drilling, conservation, energy \nefficiency, and more renewables. You bet your life--although, I would \nsay many of those who have spoken on the other side are not quite so \nenthusiastic about the other side of energy that is renewables and \nconservation and energy efficiency.\n  We have many airlines in this country. Obviously, that industry is \none of the heaviest users of jet fuel. We have had seven bankruptcies \nrecently. They have said it means thousands less jobs. Normal market \nforces are being amplified by poorly regulated market speculation. The \nNation needs to pull together to reform the oil markets and solve this \ngrowing problem. That is from the airline industry. You probably saw \nthe newspaper yesterday--and this is not unusual--``Jet Fuel Costs Push \nMidwest Air to End Flights to 11 Cities.'' It is happening across the \ncountry. I would understand this if, in fact, this was a circumstance \nwhere supply and demand had changed in a radical way, and we would \ndecide in this country that, you know what, we have to confront supply \nand demand. We have to do that in the longer term. But that is not what \nthis is about.\n  I said earlier today, in my judgment, the drill now--and I am for \ndrilling now, so let me be clear--the drill now mantra is a yesterday \nforever strategy. It is good that every 10 years they come to the floor \nand say the solution to our energy issues is to drill now. If yesterday \nforever is comfortable for you, good for you. I don't think it is a \ngood policy. I think we need to use this circumstance at this \nintersection and say we are going to fundamentally change America's \nenergy future. We can do that. John F. Kennedy didn't wake up one day \nand say: I am going to give a speech and say I think America is going \nto put a person on the Moon, or I hope that perhaps someday we can put \na person on the Moon. He could have said we are going to try to see if \nwe can get someone to walk on the Moon. That is not what he said. John \nF. Kennedy said:\n\n       By the end of this decade, we are going to have a man \n     walking on the Moon.\n\n  He just declared it. That is our goal, what we are going to do. This \nwould be an awfully important intersection for us to decide, after we \ntake care of this excessive speculation to set the market right, that \nwe should do a lot of things--and conservation is the cheapest and most \nobvious option. The other thing we ought to do is do some change. We \nought to decide that in the next 10 years we are heading toward \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Maybe between now and then, we will move \nquickly toward electric-drive vehicles. We are going to have a \ncompletely different future with substantial new wind energy, solar \nenergy, and geothermal energy development. We are going to build a \nsuperhighway transmission system, just as President Dwight Eisenhower \ndid with the interstate system. That way we can use the wind belt from \nTexas to North Dakota and the Sunbelt across the Southwest can displace \nsignificant portions that we currently get from fossil fuels for \nelectricity. We can do all of that, but only if we start pulling \ntogether as a country.\n\n  I have watched this debate this afternoon. It is the most \ndisappointing debate because we have people coming to the floor of the \nSenate who are the ``just say no'' crowd. Just say no. No matter the \nquestion, just say no and then develop some little narrative that \nallows you to say no and make people think you are saying yes.\n  How about this issue? The market is broken. It has resulted in the \ndoubling of oil and gas prices in the past year, and there is no \njustification in fundamentals of supply and demand to make that happen. \nHow about having us pull together and say: Let's fix the broken market \nand put downward pressure on oil and gas prices. Don't use something \nelse as an excuse. When you talk about something else, I am going to \nsay: I am with you on that; I think we ought to do a lot of everything. \nDon't use that as an excuse to do nothing here, but let's at least do \nfirst things first.\n  There is plenty of reason for the American people to be disappointed \nin what they hear from their Government. It is so frustrating to be \nhere and understand what needs to be done and yet does not get done \nbecause we have people who believe they were born to be a set of human \nbrake pads and stop everything at all times.\n  On a number of occasions, I have described on the floor what we have \ndone. Think for a moment. We split the atom. We spliced genes. We \ncloned animals. We invented plastics. We invented radar. We invented \nthe silicone chip. We invented the telephone, the computer, and \ntelevision. We decided to build an airplane and learn to fly it. We \nbuild rockets. We walked on the Moon. We cured smallpox. We cured \npolio.\n  It is unbelievable what this country accomplishes. Yet, somehow we \ndecide what we should do is continue a strategy of being dependent, for \n60 or 70 percent of the oil we need to run America's economy, certain \noil producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Venezuela. \nI am sorry, I think that policy is nuts.\n  This country needs to mobilize and pull together. This is not about \nRepublicans or Democrats. It is about a game-changing strategy that \nsays: Here is where we have been, and right now, we can't go there in \nthe future. We need a different kind of energy future.\n  My point is just to do first things first. The first thing on the \nfloor of the Senate is about speculation. Mr. President, 47 Members of \nthe other side have indicated in one form or another, through one \ncomment or another, in their home state or here in the Senate, that \nspeculation is a part of the problem. If that is true, and I believe \nevery Member on this side of the Chamber believes that, that ought to \nadd up to 97 Senators. I don't know who the three others are who \napparently have not voiced an opinion, but we ought to be able to pass \nlegislation that fixes a broken futures market.\n  Just as quickly, we ought to be able to agree on a wide range of \nother issues. Yes, we should include some drilling in areas that are \nopen and not being drilled on. We should also look more aggressively at \nconservation and energy efficiency and make a dramatic change to \nrenewable energy in the longer term. We ought to be able to do that. \nThe American people should expect that of us, and we ought to be able \nto meet that expectation.\n  I know others are going to come to speak this evening.\n  Just so the American people understand, we agreed to a cloture motion \non a motion to proceed. That means we voted to shut off debate, not on \nthis legislation but on whether we should proceed to the legislation. \nSo we had that vote, and now the minority is saying to us: No, you \ncannot proceed to the bill; you need to speak for 30 hours.\n  There is a 30-hour requirement. Usually, it is waived back, but in \nrecent times, on everything, it has been required. So now, for the next \n30 hours, we will have people obfuscate; thumb their suspenders; wear \nblue suits on the Senate floor; and talk about this, that, and the \nother. We are not making progress because the minority is saying we \nhave to spend 30 hours before we can even get to the bill of which I \nhave been speaking. It is an unbelievable procedure. In most cases, \ncooperation would simply suggest that we work together. Unfortunately, \nthere is a big, growing problem that is hurting this country. Yet if we \nwork together and find a way to fix it, then it makes a lot of sense to \nme.\n  I am someone who is respectful of other opinions, but in this case, I \nthink there is a mountain of evidence that should lead us to fix this \nmarket and put some downward pressure on oil and gas prices. Following \nthat, we can, in a matter of days, it seems to me, work on a wide range \nof other issues that deal with all of the issues I just described. We \ncan put America in a much better place if we decide to do that.\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Energy bill that \nis on the floor today. This is a great debate, it is a needed debate, \nand one that is happening every day across our country, in every \ncommunity and at every gas station and coffee shop--as to how to get \nthese energy prices down and what we need to do to get these energy \nprices down. So I am delighted we are getting the chance to talk about \nit on the floor.\n  I think people across the country are absolutely, there is no \nquestion about it, completely fed up. They are tired of it. It has hit \nthem directly and it has hit them hard. It is making people change \nlifestyles or even do without essentials simply to be able to get to \nand from work or to and from appointments, schools, and hospitals. This \nis a big, huge problem that Americans are facing daily and that we need \nto address and that we need to solve and we need to deal with.\n  Unfortunately, this base bill does not go to the heart of the \nquestion. I am delighted we are having a chance to talk about it, but I \nwish we would go to the heart of the question of what we need to do, \nwhich is to produce more, to create more options for people across the \nUnited States, and to conserve.\n  A fact that I think people are recognizing, but one we don't talk \nnearly as much about, is the huge transfer of wealth that is taking \nplace from this country to other places. This year alone, importing a \nmillion barrels of oil less per day in the first 5 months of this year \nwould have reduced the year-to-date trade deficit by more than $14 \nbillion. If we had imported a million barrels of oil less a day, we \ncould have reduced that trade deficit by $14 billion. It would have \nincreased our GDP and increased domestic employment and certainly had \nsome impact on prices. That is something we don't talk about as much, \nbut it is a big part of the equation as well.\n  Obviously, we need more domestic energy production. We are witnessing \nthis massive transfer of wealth because we don't have adequate domestic \nenergy production. Every year, to buy oil, America sends well in excess \nof half a trillion dollars to foreign countries. In fact, in 1972, \nSaudi Arabia's foreign exchange earnings were about $2.7 billion. That \nwas in 1972. In 2006, it was over $200 billion. Clearly, we are having \na huge transfer of wealth. And where is that wealth coming from? It is \ncoming from people pulling up to gas stations and filling up their \npickups; diesel fuel consumption. It is coming from the American \nconsumer, and it should be going back into Americans' pockets instead \nof going overseas. So we are seeing too much of that taking place right \nnow.\n  We have some options, and different people have talked about \ndifferent ones, but I want to highlight several that I think are key \nfor us to be looking at for our future in producing more. One is the \noil shale regions of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. I have a quick \npicture of this. I think some people, hopefully, have seen this.\n  Here is an area that has been frozen out of production by law that \ncould be brought into production. It has huge reserves in it--500 \nbillion or more potential--and it is being held off the market. So \nwhile we transfer billions and trillions of dollars of wealth to \nregions of the world--and in many cases they don't like us--we are \nholding off production of areas in the United States that we could \nproduce from in an environmentally sound way. We have huge reserves \nhere, and that makes no sense to most people across my State of Kansas \nas to why you would do that. What is the purpose here? We can do this \nin an environmentally sound way. We can do it with American technology \nand know-how, and we need to get that done.\n  Another thing we need to do, particularly from my vantagepoint, \ncoming from the Midwest, is to do more with biofuels. A recent study \nfrom Merrill Lynch found that the world's use of biofuels has kept oil \nprices 15 percent lower than they would be without these alternative \nfuels--15 percent lower. So you are looking at 60 cents a gallon of \nthat $4 gasoline that is being held lower because we have biofuels. \nThat is something we need to continue to do more of.\n  We are producing ethanol plants throughout the Midwest and throughout \nthe country. We are moving into cellulosic ethanol, and we have the \nfirst four of those plants coming on line. It is an innovative \ntechnology of taking, in many cases, what we would refer to as \nagricultural waste and turning it into ethanol. That is a key part of \nour growing and our marketplace that we can utilize.\n  I think we also need to look at other fuel sources, such as methanol \nand biodiesel. Earlier today, a tripartisan group of my colleagues and \nI introduced a bill that would require 50 percent of the new cars made \nin the United States, or sold in the United States by 2012, to be flex-\nfuel vehicles. These are vehicles that you can pull up to a gas pump \nand put gasoline, ethanol, methanol, or any combination of those three \ninto the car. This is a goal the big three auto manufacturers in the \nUnited States say they can achieve--50 percent by 2012--and then we up \nit to 80 percent 3 years later, adding a 10-percent increase of the new \ncars that have to have that option of the flex fuel.\n  Now, if you were to take that situation today, what that creates, \ninstead of having a monopoly of dependence on oil, you have an option \nand a competition, which is going to reduce price. You can pull up at \nthe pump and say: Okay, I want to put in E-85 ethanol--85 percent \nethanol and 15 percent gasoline. What is the price on ethanol today? \nVersus: Okay, let's see what it is on gasoline versus methanol. What is \nit I can get here? The car or the pickup can read any of the fuels. \nThis is a technology that is estimated to cost about $100 per car to \nput it in but is priceless in creating options and competition for the \nfuel sources in the United States.\n  Somebody asked me at the press conference that Senators Lieberman and \nSalazar and I held on this: Well, isn't this going to hurt plug-in \ntechnology or plug-in cars? I said: It is my estimation and hope that \nin the future you are going to be able to buy a plug-in hybrid flex-\nfuel car that you plug in at night, go the 20 miles on electricity--it \nis a hybrid, so it recharges and uses that electricity whenever it can \nin the vehicle--and then it is a flex-fuel vehicle, so you can use \nethanol, methanol, gasoline, or any combination thereof. That creates \nthat competition on fuel sources, whether it is electricity, ethanol, \nmethanol, or gasoline, and we will reduce price. These are things we \nneed to do to move forward and get off of our reliance on foreign oil \nand the addiction we have to foreign oil.\n  We also need to innovate. I am going to show a chart here of what I \nthought was a very innovative project in the western part of my State \nthat is still on the drawing boards. It has been blocked to date, but \nit is an integrated bioenergy center near Holcomb, KS. It was going to \nuse coal-fired technology to produce electricity. They were going to \ntake their CO2 emissions and run them through an algae \nreactor. They were projecting they would reduce 40 percent of the \nCO2 emissions, running it through the algae, and then taking \nthe algae and making it into biodiesel. So you have this integrated \ncenter where you have this sort of biodiesel and algae reactor fuel as \nwell associated with it because of the heat production, and the use of \nthat and the ethanol plant where you can get these integrated systems \ntogether. At the end of the day, you reduce your CO2 \nemissions, increase your fuel production, and it would be good for the \neconomy. So you are balancing the economy, energy, and the ecology of \nthe environment. You get the three Es balanced together and moving \nforward in an innovative made-in-America type of plant.\n  Those are the sorts of innovative solutions that we need to move \nforward with and to discuss in this debate so that we create a \ncompetition. We need to create options, we need to produce more supply, \nand by producing more supply, we are going to reduce price in this \nprice point. And by producing\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nmore supply in the United States, we are going to stop the transfer of \nwealth to the degree that we have seen taking place from the United \nStates, out of our pocketbooks, and into, unfortunately, the pockets of \nour competitors, who, in many cases, don't like us.\n\n  I am the ranking member on a subcommittee that has held hearings on \nthis particular bill, and that is the Appropriations subcommittee that \nfunds the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. We have looked at these \nissues. And while we are having an important debate here--I think it is \na good discussion--I think the hearings we have held have been very \npositive in reflecting on how much money has been coming into a number \nof places in the futures market. Yet if we are going to get the answer \nto the basic question here of trying to reduce price, the clear way is \nto deal with the supply-and-demand equation--increasing supply and \nreducing demand--and not just saying: Okay, it is all because of \nspeculation that these prices are going up.\n  I do believe it would be wise for us to limit pension funds, the \namount pension funds can put in the commodities market, but primarily \nas a feature of how you help the pension funds, because commodity \nmarkets are inherently volatile, moving wildly at various times, and it \nseems not to be a wise place to put large amounts of pension funds. But \nthis bill goes far beyond that, to the point that the Kansas City Board \nof Trade--it is on the Missouri side of Kansas City, but a number of \npeople working there live in Kansas--is strongly opposed to this and \nthinks it will hurt the commodity futures market rather than help it. \nYou are going to hurt the price discovery mechanism, and you may well, \nin the long term, end up driving up prices through these features. They \nhave been in my office previously drawing attention to outside funds \ncoming in and saying this is something that ought to be looked at, but \nwhen they look at this answer, they are saying it is way over the top. \nIt doesn't fit the need that we have of the day.\n  I wish to make the point on where we need to limit the pensions funds \nin the commodity futures market. As public pension funds have grown in \nsize and expanded their investment portfolios beyond traditional equity \nand bond investment activities, significant losses by some major \npension funds have led to greater calls for scrutiny and investigation.\n  For example, the San Diego County pension fund lost about half of its \n$175 million investment in a hedge fund when the fund crashed due to \nwhat turned out to be a disastrous bet on natural gas, getting into a \ncommodity market. All told, approximately 20 percent of the pension \nfund's assets are invested in alternative strategies through hedge \nfunds and other money managers.\n  That is my point here. I think the right place to look is a \nlimitation on the total amount of monies that can be put in hedge \nfunds, into the commodities futures markets, to protect the pension \nfunds, rather than saying this is the silver bullet that is going to \ncure the increase in energy prices that we have.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the chance to be able to \nspeak on this bill. My colleague from Alaska, whose State is absolutely \ncritical to expanding our energy supply, is here to speak further about \nthe need for production.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity this \nevening to bring to light some of the comments that have been made on \nthis floor earlier about what is happening with existing leases across \nthe country, the oil and gas leases that exist, and whether the oil \ncompanies are sitting on these leases--whether they are producing \nenergy. I will try to assess what we are talking about when we look at \nthe leasing status of the oil and gas opportunities around the country.\n  Some have suggested that perhaps the oil and gas companies are \nsitting on these leases, that they are not producing energy, in an \neffort to drive up the prices of oil and gas. I suppose that is a \ncreative theory but, honestly, it is one that has so many holes in it, \nit is like installing a screen door on a submarine. It is bound to \nsink.\n  At best, the charge is based on a review of what I consider to be \nincomplete data viewed through a prism of little actual knowledge of \nthe difficulties of producing energy from any individual tract. At \nworst, the charge is a smokescreen to cover up the opposition to the \nproduction of more oil and natural gas from where it is likely to be \nfound, and not necessarily from those areas where the opponents want it \nto be located.\n  Currently, of the 45 million acres onshore in the United States under \noil and gas lease, about 10.5 million acres are producing energy, with \nthe remaining 34.5 million acres not yet in production. Offshore, of \nthe 49.3 million acres under lease, about 15.2 million acres are \nproducing. These are statistics on which I think we are all in \nagreement. These are the known leases out there.\n  What that means is, of the Nation's current 67,700 oil and gas \nleases, about 30,000, or 44 percent, are producing oil and gas at this \ntime.\n  I can understand how, at face value, you look at that and say that \ndoesn't look like a very good track record, only 44 percent producing. \nThe numbers make it seem as if there are lots of leases that the \nindustry is simply not moving on. But I think we need to look at those \nleases and say: What is the situation? What are the facts on the \nground?\n  Let's take a closer look at these inactive leases.\n  This is just the onshore leases. If you look at the 34.5 million \nacres, of those, 3.2 million acres are suspended while review problems \nare being worked out. You have 1.1 million acres that are tied up in \nthe development of land use plans. You have 760,000 acres that are \nblocked from any development by active and ongoing court litigation. \nYou have 645,000 acres that are waiting the completion of legally \nrequired environmental impact statements. You have about 450,000 acres \nthat are awaiting revisions of their EISs after reviews, and you have \n500,000 acres that are tied up in the production-permitting process.\n  Walking through the numbers, when we are talking about inactive, what \ndoes ``inactive'' mean? If you look at the status of many of these, you \nsee there are a multitude of reasons they are not producing: \nlitigation, permitting process, land use plans, other acreage is on \nhold until companies can find and lease drilling rigs, and then all of \nthe other exploratory equipment that they need to go into these \nexploratory wells. This is not an easy proposition, given the level of \nactivity in the oil and gas patch right now.\n  I can tell you for a fact that it is extremely difficult to get the \ndrilling rigs, the exploratory rigs, that we need, and there is a wait \nfor those. Even more acres already have been explored, but they are \nawaiting confirmatory or additional exploratory wells to determine \nwhether the hydrocarbon find is large enough to be economical to \nproduce. Just because you find a little bit doesn't mean that it is \ngoing to be economical to produce. You have other tracts that are \nwaiting for infrastructure to be built to get their oil or gas to \nmarket.\n  You have heard me say on the Senate floor many times, we have \nincredible natural gas supplies on the North Slope, all in the northern \npart of Alaska, but we do not have the infrastructure to get that gas \nto market.\n  In other cases, complex coordination is needed among a host of \ndiffering lease holders to determine the future for new energy \nprovinces that haven't yet been finished. Then, of course, you have \nsome of the tracts that have either demonstrated very disappointing \ninitial shows of the hydrocarbons or they are just too small to be \neconomically produced without production from nearby tracts that have \nmore oil.\n  The overwhelming number of the tracts, the lease tracts that exist \nout there, simply do not hold any hydrocarbons that anyone has been \nable to find. Companies may not yet have had enough time to return them \nto the Government. I have had conversations with some who, it seems, \nbelieve that because an oil company has paid good money for a lease \nthere must be oil and gas there. The truth is, while some of these \nprelease reviews of the tracts are conducted so some of the companies \nare not exactly bidding blind, the level of presale review is not \nsufficient for\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nthe companies to have a clear vision of whether there is going to be \nsufficient oil and gas to be found there. About two-thirds of the time \nit is not, it is not sufficient, and the companies drill their infamous \ndry wells.\n  As you can see, it is not simply as easy as saying there are 34 \nmillion acres that are not producing oil. The examples I have given you \nare as they relate to onshore. The same is true for offshore \nexploration. We have to recognize that production just doesn't start \nonce the lease bid has been won. We certainly know that in Alaska. The \ncomplication of lawsuits, the regulatory compliance, the current \nshortages we are seeing of labor, of equipment, of infrastructure--they \nare ignored by charges of energy lease warehousing.\n  Sometimes when you think about all that goes into exploration and \ndevelopment, it is a wonder--at least it is a wonder to me--that of the \n7,700 new leases that have been issued in 2007, we have about 1,800 \nthat have yet to be explored. The industry has obtained drilling \npermits for the first 5,300 of them. I look at that and say it looks as \nif they are doing pretty well. But it normally takes longer than a year \nto start the exploration. The norm is about a 2- to 5-year time period \nto get through the planning, get through the redtape, before you \nactually determine whether you have oil.\n  Alaska is different. As you know, our resources, our reservoirs, are \nquite extensive. We have been producing oil from Alaska's North Slope \nfor the last 30 years and, in my opinion, doing a fine job of it. But \nwe recognize that exploration and development in the Arctic is that \nmuch more challenging; it is that much more complicated. The timeframes \nare that much longer. It takes us about 6 to 7 years at a minimum to \nget to the point where we are able to determine whether there is oil to \nbe had there.\n  In addition to the delays that I have mentioned, the permitting, for \ninstance, and just the equipment issues, is the requirement that we \nhave in place that ice roads be used to locate the drilling rigs. You \njust can't take your drilling rig and plunk it out there on the tundra. \nWe have very firm and set requirements for how that exploratory \nactivity can take place, when it can take place. The companies have to \nwait until the tundra is frozen. They have to wait until it is frozen \nbefore they can move the rigs to the sites. It is an extremely limited \nexploratory season. When you have a limited season like this, it can \nadd years to the timetable for exploration.\n  I had asked our DEC, our Department of Environmental Conservation, \nwhich is the State department that makes the determination as to when \nthe companies can actually go out onto the tundra and engage in any \nexploratory work out there. For the 2007-2008 exploration season, the \ntimeframe in Alaska was December to May. This includes the time that it \ntakes to move the equipment to the site.\n  Just to give an example of what we are talking about, it depends on \nwhere you are going. It is not just the beginning of December to the \nend of May. In the e-mail that we received from DEC, it says ``oil \ncompanies can begin regular travel across the tundra along the coast on \nDecember 28. In the upper foothills you cannot begin until January 24, \nand in the eastern and lower foothills''--this is where most of the \nactivity has occurred--``you can commence on January 16 of 2008.''\n\n  They have about 4 months to do their work. They have to be off the \ntundra in the upper foothills on May 13, and out of everywhere else on \nMay 16.\n  This is how precise it is. It is not because we are looking at a \ncalendar, and there is some magic day. It depends on what is happening \nwith the season, how cold it is. The rules are--and I am quoting:\n\n       The companies can't get onto the tundra until the ground is \n     a negative 5 degrees centigrade, 30 centimeters down--\n\n  About a foot--\n\n     and until there is 9 inches of snowcover to protect the \n     vegetation.\n\n  For all those who are saying you can't do this exploration in Alaska \nbecause we do not care about our environment, let me tell you we have \nbeen caring about our environment for a long time. We put these \nparameters in place because we do care about the ecosystem. We do care \nabout the condition of the tundra. We do want you to have an ice bridge \nthat you move this heavy equipment across during the winter months and \nthat is removed right after you have done the exploration. Then when \nthe spring comes, and the summer, and the thaw happens, there is no \nmark to the tundra because your road has melted. We leave no impact.\n  But when you think about how you do business in any other field--if \nyou are a construction company, you know what your construction season \nis. If you are a fisherman, you know what your fishing season is. The \noil and gas industry in Alaska, they know that their exploratory season \nis very limited. Essentially we are talking about 60 to 90 days a year.\n  In the National Petroleum Reserve--I will put up the map just so \npeople can understand what we are talking about in terms of the \ngeography. This is the ANWR area. This is State lands. This is our \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline, which is carrying the existing oil from the \nPrudhoe Bay fields down to the southern part of the State. This is the \nNational Petroleum Reserve.\n  In the NPRA, waiting for these frozen conditions to allow for \nexploration again means that the companies have between 60 to 90 days \nduring which actual drilling can take place. The leases on the North \nSlope, then--put it in context--are available for drilling activity \nbetween somewhere about 15 percent to 25 percent of the year.\n  You put that in context with most any other industry and you would \nsay you can't just operate only 15 percent of the year. Your costs must \nbe incredible. Yes, costs are incredible up there. A single drill rig \ncan only drill at most two exploration wells per year, and part of this \nis just how we move the equipment. The ice for making the roads, the \nweather issues, the fuel, and the logistics--all these account for \nabout 75 percent of the costs for exploration. The actual drilling \nactually accounts for about 25 percent of the costs.\n  For all of these various reasons, in the NPRA, the oil and gas \nindustry has only been able to drill 28 exploratory wells since the \nyear 2000.\n  This is out of the hundreds of leased tracts. So far, the area in \nwhich they have found some prospective tracts is in the Greater Mooses \nTooth Unit, but unfortunately, given how far these small amounts of oil \nare from the existing nearest infrastructure, which is the Alpine \nOilfield, production is anticipated to still be quite far away.\n  Again, to put it in context, this red line here is our existing \npipeline going down to Valdez, but you have pipeline infrastructure up \nhere on the coast. The Alpine field extends to here, and the Mooses \nTooth area is right in this region here. But it is 80 to 100 miles to \nconnect from some of these more prospective finds to the existing \ninfrastructure. On the other hand, it is about 25 miles between the end \nof the pipeline here and the 1002 area in ANWR where we are seeking to \nhave an opportunity to explore and drill.\n  I think what I want to leave folks with this evening is keeping in \nmind that not all leases are equally prospective. We know you have some \nelephant finds; Prudhoe was an elephant find. We believe the ANWR will \nalso be an elephant field. But we know that for every big find you have \nout there, there are just as many, if not more, dry holes. There are \nleases where the companies spend billions of dollars to buy, as they \nhave this past year in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Chukchi Sea over \nhere. There, the geology is very favorable for oil and gas discoveries. \nBut mostly companies buy usually a minimum lease, and the cost is a \ncouple of million dollars per tract, and they are really very marginal. \nThose are the leases that likely do not contain the oil and gas that \nare still awaiting exploration.\n  We look at how the oil companies are making their investment because \ncertainly from Alaska's perspective, we want to know whether they are \ninvesting in oil and gas opportunities up north. This last year, the \ntop 25 oil and gas companies in the United States invested $1.15 \ntrillion on exploration and production, the top 5 companies spent $765 \nbillion on exploration from 1992 to 2006, and in both instances \nindustry members invested more than they earned back in profits.\n  Now, in part, this is because this country has not been putting its \nmost prospective tracts for oil and gas discoveries up for lease. You \nhave some\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\n777 million acres of lands onshore that are off limits to oil and gas \nproduction. That is about 62 percent of the Nation's likely oil and gas \npotential.\n  To bring it back to Alaska, think of ANWR, the place where the \nlargest onshore deposit of oil is likely to be found in America. There \nis a 95-percent chance that 5.7 billion barrels will be found, a 5-\npercent chance that there will be 16 billion barrels, and the mean \nestimate is about 10 billion barrels of recoverable oil. And it is off \nlimits. It is off limits.\n  Offshore, 1.76 billion acres of our coastline are off limits to \ndevelopment. This is an area which is believed to hold approximately 80 \nbillion barrels of oil.\n  So in kind of wrapping up my comments here this evening about the \nleases, I wish to remind folks that when they talk about the ``use it \nor lose it'' rationale or direction they feel we should take, they need \nto remember that these oil and gas leases around the country already \nexpire after 10 years. Only in Alaska can companies seek an additional \n10-year extension to bring the leases into production. This is a right \nwe had granted companies in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and we did \nit for the reasons I have outlined for you tonight, because we \nrecognized that environmentally sound exploration was, in many cases, \ntaking longer than 10 years. I do not think there are any of you out \nthere who are going to suggest that, well, we do not want to do it in \nan environmentally sound manner. Well, if we are going to do it right \nand we are going to protect the environment, it might take us a little \nbit longer in a place such as Alaska where you are only able to explore \nand engage in exploratory and production activity for 15 to 25 percent \nof the year.\n  You have to ask the question, Why should companies spend money on new \nleases in an area where they can easily be delayed from bringing oil \nand gas online and then lose all of their investment through no fault \nof their own? Companies also have no reason to delay producing oil. \nEach year, they pay between $1 and $5 onshore and $6.25 and $9.50 an \nacre offshore to keep their leases in effect. So in order to hold their \nleases, they have to be paying.\n  Think about what they have already kind of put in place, if you will. \nThey have purchased the lease up front, and for many of the leases, \nthey are extremely expensive in terms of the outlays the company has to \nmake. Then they engage in the pre-exploratory efforts.\n  I keep mentioning NPRA and the cost we are seeing there. It is \nanywhere between $50 and $100 million to drill an exploratory well in \nthe NPRA area--$50 to $100 million to drill. And then what happens if \nyou drill and there is nothing there? Well, you get to give it back, \nbut you do not get anything from the Federal Treasury when you give it \nback. These are costs you have as a company. So there is a very \npowerful incentive for companies to see the development of any lease \nacres they believe have the potential they are looking for, a powerful \nincentive for companies to speed development of the 68 million acres \nthat some argue is not being developed quickly enough.\n  We have a ``use it or lose it'' law in place. It is a situation of \nenforcing it, and we do enforce it. There is no reason, in my mind, \nthat we need to do more in this area at this time.\n  I know I have gone over my time. I had hoped to be able to have a \nlittle discussion about the distinctions between the ANWR area and the \nNPRA area. I do not see any of my colleagues on the floor at this point \nin time, so with the permission of the Chair, I would like to continue, \nunless there is another order at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time limits.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to kind of walk people through a \nlittle bit of the distinction, if you will, with ANWR, which the \nAmerican public has heard an awful lot about for the past 20 years as \nwe have, in our effort, attempted to open this 1002 area that was set \naside for exploration and development when the refuge area was \nestablished.\n  ANWR consists of an area that is 19.6 million acres--the size of the \nState of South Carolina. This map is a little bigger and helps you put \nit in context. This is the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in \nthe State of Alaska. It borders against Canada. And here is our \npipeline coming down. This whole Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the \nsize of the State of South Carolina, again, about 19.6 million acres.\n  Also within the Refuge is a huge wilderness area, the ANWR wilderness \narea. It is 10.1 million acres in the Refuge itself. Nothing can happen \nin the wilderness area in terms of any development whatsoever. It is \nwilderness. We have established it as such. It will remain as such.\n  The area we are talking about in ANWR for development is what is \nknown as the 1002 area, taken from the legislation itself, section \n1002. What we are talking about when we ask for permission from the \nCongress to allow for exploration in ANWR is not permission to drill in \nthe Refuge, not permission to explore in the wilderness, but permission \nto explore in the area that was set aside by Congress for the purpose \nof exploration and development in this 1002 area; it is 1.5 million \nacres in this area.\n  But we are not seeking to do all of the 1002 area with exploratory \nwells; we are asking for permission to drill in an area that would be \nabout a 2,000-acre area. So when you kind of winnow down what we are \ntalking about, it is really pretty minimal in context of the whole. If \nyou take into account that the Refuge area is the size of South \nCarolina, this is the area we are looking to explore. And within that \narea, we have agreed we do not think we need more than 2,000 acres of \narea for disturbance.\n  Why do we think we can get by with that small amount? It is simply \nbecause we have advanced our technologies so far when it comes to oil \nand gas development in the Arctic, the technologies that allow us to \ndrill under the surface and go out directionally up to almost 8 miles \nin every direction. The caribou are on top, and they do not know what \nis going on. You do not have disturbance to the surface. It is our \ntechnology that will allow us to extract a resource and utilize the \nresource and still allow for the care of the environment, for the \nanimals that are there, for the caribou that migrate through. We want \nto do it right.\n  So this is the ANWR area I mentioned earlier. This is the existing \nseries of pipelines that spurred off of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline built \nabout 30 years ago. The line extends to an area about 25 miles to the \nborder of the 1002 area. So when we are talking about access to the \nresource, to the infrastructure that is there, it is not too bad, 25 \nmiles. It is still difficult given the environment, but it is certainly \ndoable.\n  Let's go over here to NPRA. NPRA is 23 million acres in size, 23 \nmillion acres total; 4.4 million acres are new acres available for \nleasing, 3.94 of which are available immediately. These are leases in \nthe northeast and the northwest part of NPRA. If you look at this map, \nit has the leases themselves. These are in the green area. The 2006 \nleases are in this area here, and then the new leases that are coming \non are in the northeast and the northwest area of NPRA.\n  The crosshatched areas we see here have been put off; in other words, \nwe have deferred these areas. This area here north of Teshekpuk Lake is \nnow protected, 430,000 acres in this area. We have agreed to this \ndeferral because we recognize the sensitivity of the ecosystem, the \nwaterfowl that come through there. It is an area that we recognize \nshould be off limits. NPRA, in terms of its prospects, the estimate is \n5.9 to 13.2 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. So the mean \nthere is about 9.3. It is right in the same ballpark as ANWR. If you \nrecall, I said ANWR had a mean estimate of about 10 billion barrels of \noil. So it is about the same. The difference is access to the \ninfrastructure and the geography.\n  Go back to this other map. If you have 10 billion barrels estimated \nin this small area and you have 10 billion barrels estimated in this \nlarger area, we are talking about 1.5 million acres versus 23 million \nacres. It doesn't take a math genius to figure out that it is more \nconcentrated in ANWR; 15 times more oil per acre in ANWR than NPRA. \nThat is worth repeating: 15 times more oil per acre in ANWR than you \nwould anticipate in the NPRA.\n  The other issue is access to the infrastructure. When you are looking \nat 25\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\nmiles from the end of the pipeline here to get to the 1002 area and \nrecognize that you have opportunities through directional drilling so \nyou can minimize impact to the surface, that is not too bad of a \nstretch. But when you are looking at your more lucrative finds in these \nareas, looking at, say, 150 to 200 miles of pipeline to get your \nresource into infrastructure, it is extremely difficult to reckon with \nthat. That has been one of the issues we have faced. BLM is proceeding \nexpeditiously. They have been working to advance the leasing program in \nthe NPRA area.\n  It is interesting because it seems that some in the House and the \nSenate have just discovered NPRA. They say, well, you have all these \nwonderful leases over there and you have all this great opportunity. \nYou should make that happen. It certainly does sound easy. I would like \nto do more to make it happen. But when you are dealing with geography, \nas we are, when you are dealing with environmental issues, when you are \ndealing with a lack of infrastructure, when you are dealing with a \nlimited exploratory season and the extremely high cost, it is not so \neasy to make it happen.\n  Back in the 1940s, when NPRA first started leasing, 36 test wells \nwere drilled, 45 shallow cores were drilled to find commercial oil and \ngas. But they didn't find any. In the 1980s, there were 28 more test \nwells. Seismic was conducted. In 2000, in the leasing period then, we \nsaw 28 exploratory wells drilled and at least 12 3-D seismic efforts \nhad been conducted, shooting the 3-D seismic in the area. But again, \nthe only small finds that we have come upon have been in the Greater \nMooses Tooth area. The problem is, to this point in time, we haven't \nfound enough in these areas to justify a pipeline that would be 80 \nmiles, 100 miles to connect up. That is a harsh reality. It is going to \ntake realistically 6 to 7 years to bring NPRA tracts into production. \nCompare this with the 2 to 5 years in the lower 48. It takes that much \nlonger. Compare the cost we face for exploration in NPRA. You are \nlooking at wells that are costing somewhere between $50 and $100 \nmillion to do a single exploration well. This is compared to wells that \ncan cost 6 to 10 times less in the lower 48.\n  I don't want to make excuses for Alaska, because we want to develop \nmore. We are ready to develop more. But we recognize it does take \nlonger for the multitude of reasons I have mentioned.\n  One of the things that perhaps has not been talked about and I might \nnot have mentioned in my earlier comments when I was speaking about \nleases is the number of leases we actually see turned back by the \ncompanies. About 700,000 acres of awarded leases since 2000, in the \nNPRA area, have been turned back. If you look at this map--and I know \non the screen you won't be able to see the squares--in these areas, in \nthese areas, in these areas, in these areas, about 700,000 acres have \nbeen returned by Conoco-Phillips. This is the company that has the most \nexperience in the area. They have already given up on 267 lease tracts \nin the preserves. They may well end up turning back another 407 tracts \ncovering 2.8 million acres by the end of this year. What they are \nfinding is a lot of natural gas, but the oil potential seems to have \ndimmed in areas where they are looking.\n  As I said, we have a lot of natural gas up there, but we don't have \nthe infrastructure. We are working on that. The State of Alaska is \nworking diligently. Our legislature is actually meeting in about an \nhour to take a significant vote on how we move forward with \nconstruction of a gas line. Again, the potential for NPRA is certainly \nthere. We believe it is very viable. I mentioned the mean estimate of \nabout 10 billion barrels. But the seismic evidence we are getting back \nseems to indicate that the likelihood for oil is diminishing, and we \nare seeing greater gas.\n  One of the things we also recognize is that the area that is viewed \nmost prospective around Teshekpuk Lake here is the area that has been \ndeferred from leasing for at least a decade. This was the outcome of \nlawsuits by environmental groups that had opposed the development in \nthis key habitat area for waterfowl, the black brant. Our reality is \nthat as good as NPRA is and as much as we want to see NPRA developed, \nit is less prospective than the Arctic Coastal Plain to the east; \nagain, 15 times more oil forecast to be discovered per acre in ANWR \nthan in NPRA.\n  I have had an opportunity this evening to give a little bit of \nperspective about what is available up in the Arctic in Alaska, what we \nwould like to be able to provide. But I am also trying to leave my \ncolleagues with a sense of the pragmatism, the reality that comes with \noil exploration and production, not only in the Arctic, where it is \nchallenging and very difficult, but in the rest of the country. When we \nsay we have these leases that are in play and the companies have chosen \nnot to produce, it is only right that we look more closely at these \ninactive leases and ask: What is the delay? What is the problem? Is it \nlitigation? Is it some kind of a land use plan delaying it? Where are \nthey in that process? But to suggest that because we are not seeing \nactual production here and now, that somehow or other we are not trying \nhard enough, ignores the reality of the complications the industry \nfaces on a daily basis.\n  We want to do more. We want to find more, use less, as we have all \nbeen saying. But I think it is important that we recognize as we \nattempt to find more, we have to be realistic in terms of our \nexpectations.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the legislation \nthat is pending before the Senate, the Stop Excessive Energy \nSpeculation Act of 2008. I believe it does represent a significant \naction that Congress can take right now to help reclaim our energy \nmarkets, to ensure the prices that Americans pay at the pump truly \nreflect supply and demand dynamics and not the additional, backbreaking \ncosts added to a barrel of oil as a result of market manipulation and \nrampant speculation.\n  I do not come late or lightly to the issue of speculation. I have \nworked closely with Senators Feinstein, Levin, and Cantwell, and I \ncould not commend their leadership enough as we have worked to enhance \ntransparency in our energy markets for more than 2 years. We have \nsuccessfully collaborated to close the enron loophole through an \namendment to the farm bill, which Senator Feinstein and I spearheaded. \nAnd I am particularly pleased that this legislation incorporates \ncomponents of legislation I introduced with Senator Cantwell, which \nwould significantly enhance regulations on foreign markets that trade \nU.S. energy assets.\n  Now, I understand there is a great deal of discussion, debate, and \neven dispute about the process surrounding this legislation. Let me \nsay, having returned to maine almost every weekend, having spoken to \ncountless Mainers and Americans from all walks of life who are \nliterally frightened and desperate because they do not know how they \nare going to fill their gas tanks, how they are going to heat their \nhomes this coming winter, how they are going to even survive this \nwinter. and the only thing they care about is results.\n  It is the beginning of the process, as it should be, to debate a \nlarger question on energy policy. Obviously, this is not the end-all \nand be-all, but it is a beginning of the legislative process that must \nstart. We must move forward on this legislation. It is not mutually \nexclusive with considering a far more comprehensive package. In fact, I \nwould say that it must not be mutually exclusive. This body must debate \nand consider additional measures as a wide ranging package, in my view, \nthat addresses the additional pressing energy issues that will both \nmove our country toward self-sufficiency in the short term as well as, \nof course, in the long term.\n  Again, I believe acting on speculation as well as our long-term \nenergy strategy must not be mutually exclusive. The fact is, we can and \nshould enact this speculation measure and then move immediately to \nenergy legislation. If that means spending every\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\nminute of the remaining days of this session on energy legislation, \nthen that is what we must do. The issue is not a matter of time but \npolitical will.\n  For the moment, with respect to the legislation before us, this bill \ntoday does begin the process of enhancing the transparency of our \nenergy markets. It should be debated, amended, and improved. I do not \nagree with every provision in the legislation, but I do think it moves \nthe process forward. After all, Congress has had more than 40 hearings \non speculation. While I strongly support the intent of this \nlegislation, and believe it would be a vast improvement over the \ncurrent regulatory structure, I think we can agree we should utilize \nour collective knowledge and insight of energy experts to further \nenhance this pending legislation.\n  With the price of oil up $11 one day and down $8 the next, with \ntestimony and studies indicating that speculation is contributing as \nmuch as $25, if not $60, a barrel, there is no question that swift, \ndecisive action of this kind is required. In fact, last month, during a \nSenate Commerce Committee hearing, chaired by Senator Cantwell, \nProfessor Michael Greenberger, the CFTC's former Director of Trading \nand Markets, testified that foreign trading of U.S. commodities is \nincreasing energy prices that Americans are paying, and, worse, the \nregulation of foreign markets is inferior to U.S. standards.\n  Americans have a right to know what is occurring in these markets, \nthat trade commodities can be costly and wreak financial havoc on them. \nThe Government Accountability Office study, which I requested nearly 3 \nyears ago, demonstrated just how futures markets play a key role in \nprice discovery but that these markets require three fundamental \ncriteria: first, current information about supply and demand; secondly, \na large number of participants; and, third, transparency. It is \ntransparency that is conspicuously missing from these markets today, \nespecially with regard to foreign markets that trade U.S. commodities.\n  Unequivocally, if U.S. commodities are being traded overseas, then \nthe foreign market must incorporate the core principles established by \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the New York Mercantile \nExchange, including position limits and accountability, emergency \nauthority, and daily publication of trading information.\n  The absence of these principles along with a lack of transparency \ncould foster corruption and a gaming of the system in these markets, as \nwe witnessed with Amaranth and Enron. There are traders active on the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange as well as the ICE Exchange in London who \nare buying the same U.S. West Texas Intermediate oil on both exchanges. \nHow does that happen?\n  Well, I ask my colleagues, what is the effectiveness of two markets \nif they sell the same product but one has relaxed regulations?\n  I posed this very question, with Senator Feinstein, to the CFTC \nChairman in a letter 2 months ago. The Acting Chairman responded that \neven if the CFTC instructed a trader to reduce the size of his NYMEX \nWest Texas Intermediate position, nothing under the Commodity Exchange \nAct or the Commission's regulations would prevent that trader from \nestablishing a similar position for West Texas Intermediate on the ICE \nLondon Exchange. What good are regulations if you can simply sidestep \nthem and move to another exchange?\n  To its credit, the CFTC has since reversed its position after Senator \nCantwell and I pressed the Acting Chairman by introducing legislation. \nThe CFTC has now moved forward to establish position limits for U.S. \ntraders making transactions on U.S. commodities on foreign exchanges.\n  I am pleased the legislation before us today would codify this CFTC \nrule for all foreign exchanges. However, at the same time, we should \nheed Professor Greenberger's admonition and regulate futures markets \nwhich are physically located in a foreign country but that operate in \nthe United States and trade U.S. commodities--exactly like NYMEX.\n  This stipulation is exactly what Senator Cantwell's and my \nlegislation would accomplish by requiring that these foreign markets, \nwhich trade a third of all the contracts for America's West Texas \nIntermediate, be subject to the 18 core principles established by the \nCFTC. Only when foreign markets adhere to these principles will we be \nable to ensure our energy futures markets are secure and not \nsusceptible to manipulation. With that said, this legislation \nsignificantly improves the regulations for foreign trading of U.S. \ncommodities, and I will be supporting this package because of this \nbasic provision.\n  This brings me to the larger point I want to convey to this Chamber \ntoday. This bill is indeed a step in the right direction. But the \nproblem is, instead of steps, America should be making giant strides. \nInstead of adding yet another year to 30 years of a failed, piecemeal \napproach to energy policy, we should be developing a bipartisan \nconsensus, one committed to landmark, comprehensive energy legislation. \nAs a result, I call on my colleagues to join to move forward with other \npolicies that could be implemented now that will make a difference for \nour constituents struggling with inordinate prices when it comes to \nenergy.\n  In a world in which gasoline at the pump costs $4.10 per gallon, \naccording to AAA--obviously, prices vary across the country--and the \nprice of oil is still approximately $130 per barrel and could easily \nspike depending on the day, or the events, where the Consumer \nFederation of America estimates that the amount spent annually by \nAmerican households on energy in the last 6 years soared from \napproximately $2,600 to an astonishing $5,300, where the United States \nis sending as much as $700 billion overseas this year for oil--the \nlargest transfer of wealth in human history--and where energy costs are \nboosting the price of groceries and transportation, commuting, plane \nfares--arguably every aspect of our daily lives--I ask my colleagues, \nin the area of energy policy, can we not pass a speculation bill that \nthen leads to consideration of a larger energy measure?\n  I think of the taxpayer who could use a $300 tax credit to purchase a \nhigh-efficiency oil furnace, which would save $430 annually, according \nto calculations based on Department of Energy data and recent home \nheating oil prices. But what did we do? We allowed the tax credit to \nexpire--and to date, there are no Federal incentives for homeowners to \nsave money and for our country to reduce energy demand.\n  I think of our Nation's vast reservoir of renewable resources that is \navailable to us yet lies virtually dormant. As this chart highlights, \nour entire country has access to significant wind that may be developed \ninto electricity. On May 12, the Department of Energy, in a \ngroundbreaking report, stated that wind energy alone could produce up \nto 20 percent of our Nation's electricity--20 percent.\n  If you look at the map of the United States, you see the potential \nfor wind energy. In my State alone, we have $1.5 billion pending for \ninvestments awaiting the outcome of whether we are going to extend the \ntax credits for renewables.\n  But what has Congress done? Increased uncertainty for renewable \nenergy companies by not extending incentives that are scheduled to \nexpire this year, causing a precipitous decline in investment. Projects \ncurrently underway may soon be mothballed. We have already seen this \noccur, when our renewable production tax credit expired in the past, as \nindicated by this chart.\n  Looking at these years, in 2000, 2002, and 2004, the production tax \ncredit expired, and there was a pronounced downturn in electricity \nproduction from a clean American resource.\n  If you look at this chart, you can see the vast difference in what we \ndid in 2007, when there was a bill. When the production tax credit was \navailable, we saw the investments being made. You see the red arrow \ngoing down shows where we did not have it, and it had a significant and \nmarked impact in lessening the investment and causing the underwriting \nof investments to fail. That is unfortunate because clearly the Federal \nGovernment and the Congress have a role to play when it comes to \nspurring incentives and investments in alternatives, and certainly this \nis the case with the production tax credit.\n  Seven months ago, we could have begun to put more than 100,000 \nAmericans to work with an extension of clean energy production tax \ncredits, if\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\nwe had passed these incentives as I called for in the stimulus package \nalmost, what, 6 months ago now. This is evidenced by the growth in the \nindustrial production of wind blades, turbines, fiberglass, and towers.\n  I recognize that wind energy cannot be produced everywhere in our \ncountry, but the manufacturers of wind infrastructure are growing \nthroughout the country. Wind is a resource that our country could be \ndeveloping right now, if we only extended the modest tax incentive.\n  Again, I think this chart is an illustration of the potential for \nwind energy across this country; as I said, including in my State, \nwhere we have $1.5 billion worth of wind power projects available, \nawaiting the outcome of whether the Congress is going to extend the tax \ncredits for renewables.\n  Why aren't we doing this now? I do not understand why we did not \ninclude this as part of the stimulus package 6 months ago. Certainly, \nthis was stimulative in terms of what it could accomplish in job \ncreation. We well know that. As I said, 100,000 jobs, so obviously the \ntax credits would have had an impact on the economy. It would have had \nan impact on job creation. It would have had an impact on energy \nproduction, investments for the future, and moving this country \nforward. These would have been concrete steps that would have sent the \nright message to those who are prepared to make the investments in \nalternatives, but we are fiddling while people are scrambling to figure \nout how they are going to make ends meet with soaring energy prices.\n\n  Here we could take up the simple act of extending what we know will \nbe extended--that is the ridiculous nature of this whole debate, that \nwe know we are going to be extending the tax credits. We know, so why \ndon't we take the steps proactively and be aggressive in addressing the \nproblems facing this country, rather than reacting, rather than \nstalling, rather than hesitating to take action on a critical and \nfundamental issue when it comes to alternative energy sources.\n  There are sizeable geothermal resources we could tap into right now. \nLast year I met with President Grimsson of Iceland who related to me \nhow geothermal power now provides 93 percent of the heat for \nresidential homes on his island. This achievement marked the \nculmination of a 30-year undertaking, the dividends of which Iceland is \nonly now beginning to reap. Not only is the United States the greatest \nproducer of geothermal power, as the President noted, but we also \npossess the world's largest potential for additional geothermal \ncapacity, as indicated in this chart again, yet we don't have policies \nin place to tap this tremendous energy alternative. Again, it \ndemonstrates our abilities and our capabilities when it comes to \ngeothermal, yet we have not tapped into this mighty resource as an \nalternative. We have not taken the proactive position and actions, nor \ncreated the incentives that would encourage this as an alternative, as \nan investment, whether it is commercial or residential--and it could be \nboth--yet we are not taking any action when it comes to this resource \nthat we have in abundance across this country.\n  The evidence in favor of maximizing this particular resource is \noverwhelming. In fact, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report \npublished in January of 2007 provided an extensive assessment of the \nfuture of geothermal power in the United States and concluded it is \npossible to produce nearly 10 percent of total electricity generation \nby 2050 at a cost of between $600 million and $900 million, which would \nbe extremely attractive today to the energy market. The findings \nposited that geothermal power can be expanded because of a new drilling \ntechnology that artificially produces the geothermal process at deep \nlevels in the Earth's crust.\n  We could begin this process, but yet again, we are investing little \nto nothing toward the production of geothermal power, and there are \ncurrently no incentives for homeowners to develop clean, American, \ngeothermal heating or cooling systems for their own homes. I ask the \nquestion: Why?\n  There are actions we in this Chamber could take right now to soften \nthe blow being incurred already by our citizens in every region, every \nsector, and at every income level in this country. Why can't we move on \nlegislation I introduced last week with Senator Kerry authorizing $1 \nbillion in funding from 2009 to 2013 to help States design and \nimplement a crisis response to addressing the rising cost of heating \noil, natural gas, and diesel? In very short order, grants could be \nadministered to States to help provide heating shelters for \ncommunities, as well as energy assistance and information to the \nelderly, to consumers, and to small businesses.\n  Why can't we move on legislation I joined with Senators Dodd and \nKerry in introducing last month, which would stipulate that if the \nprice of home heating oil exceeded $4 per gallon this winter, the Home \nHeating Oil Reserve would be released on a staggered schedule \nthroughout the winter? There are nearly 2 million barrels--2 million--\ncurrently available and going unused in the Northeast. It would be an \negregious dereliction of duty for the Government to withhold this vital \nheating source when the health and safety of our population is at risk.\n  Why can't we move on legislation I have introduced which would extend \nenergy efficiency tax credits for new homes, new commercial buildings, \nand home retrofits that were included in the 2005 Energy bill? These \ntax credits are working to make a difference right now. Since 2006, \nwhen the new homes tax credit was first put in place, 30,000 new homes \nhave qualified for the tax credit, cutting the energy use of those \nhomes by half. According to a Harvard School of Public Health study, 65 \npercent of homes are under-insulated. With 100 million homes \nnationwide, there is a considerable amount of savings if we would \nprovide incentives for homeowners to make the investments in \nefficiency.\n  It is hard to believe we have yet to pass tax credits, for example, \nfor my constituents to retrofit their homes with a wood pellet furnace, \nfor example, which they are trying to do right now. We can't pass it \nhere at a time when we are facing the crisis of home heating oil of \nmore than doubling, could be close to $5. We have yet to get close to \nwinter, so no one can predict what the cost of home heating oil will be \nas we approach the winter or even as we approach fall. Right now it is \nsomewhere between $4.62 and 4.79 per gallon, depending again on where \nyou live. These are the projections and these are what people are \npaying, and yet we cannot pass a tax credit for people to retrofit \ntheir homes to alternative furnaces because we are dithering once \nagain.\n  It is regrettable that we can't take these simple but concrete steps \nthat can make a difference. We could take many steps that could \nconstitute viable actions that could truly assist this country, yet we \nremain timid, stagnant, and polarized. Instead of earning the public \ntrust, we continue to lose it. It is no wonder the approval levels for \nCongress are now hovering around 14 percent. Some of us are working to \ntranscend party, to reach across the aisle, to put political posturing \naside for something larger than scoring a point here or a point here. I \nam advocating that we join forces, not out of some idea of getting \nsomething done, but because circumstances are grave and the potential \nperil we face is that ominous that bold cooperation is the only answer.\n\n  In a recent column entitled ``Dumb as We Wanna Be,'' Thomas Friedman \nsaid as much with regard to our unbelievable squandering of these tax \ncredits. He said:\n\n       Few Americans know it, but for almost a year now, Congress \n     has been bickering over whether and how to renew the \n     investment tax credit to stimulate investment in solar energy \n     and the production tax credit to encourage investment in wind \n     energy. The bickering has been so poisonous that when \n     Congress passed the 2007 Energy bill last December, it failed \n     to extend any stimulus for wind and solar energy production. \n     Oil and gas kept all their credits, but those for wind and \n     solar have been left to expire this December. I am not making \n     this up. At a time when we should be throwing everything into \n     clean power innovation, we are squabbling over pennies.\n\n  In my own State of Maine, the absence of an energy policy is creating \na bleak picture for the future that only gets more dire as winter gets \ncloser. Eighty percent of Maine households use heating oil to get \nthrough winter. For those of us in Maine, like all of New England and \nthose of us in the\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\nWest, access to home heating oil is not just a matter of economic \nsurvival, it can be the difference between life and death. Last year at \nthis time prices were at a challenging $2.70 a gallon. For the Mainer \nwho, on average, goes through 1,000 gallons of oil, that is $2,700. The \nprice now is $4.62, meaning it will cost those of us in Maine $4,600 to \nstay warm--and that is here in July. We haven't come into the fall; we \nare not even approaching winter. That is not even taking into account \nthe gasoline prices. This is a looming crisis in Maine, one that \nrequires immediate attention, not only for Maine but throughout this \ncountry.\n  Because of the anxious concern about the price of heating oil that is \nmounting in my State, because our economy continues to teeter on the \nbrink of recession and even stagflation, and because efforts to craft \nan energy policy have remained mired in political machinations year \nafter year, we can ill afford to stand idly by. That is why I, along \nwith 15 of my colleagues--Senator Ben Nelson and I wrote a letter, and \nwe were joined by 15 other colleagues, including Senators Wicker, \nGregg, Bayh, Levin, Collins, Sununu, Specter, Johnson, Cardin, Coleman, \nLieberman, Dole, Landrieu, and Barrasso, asking the President to \nconvene an emergency summit to address what is a growing energy crisis. \nWe recognize the status quo must change with regard to our energy \nparalysis, and we have to sit down and forge a bipartisan and bicameral \nagreement with the President. We are calling on the President to \nconvene this emergency summit on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  We ought to be able to sit down around the table, convening the \nbipartisan congressional leadership and other Members of both the House \nand Senate on committees of jurisdiction, along with industry leaders, \nenvironmental leaders, and all stakeholders, because this is a national \nemergency that requires urgent attention by the President and by the \nCongress to take immediate action.\n  Because families are facing painful choices on a daily basis between \nfilling up their cars with gas or feeding their family, I have called \non Congress to do everything to address every needless dollar our \ncountry spends on energy as a result of price manipulation and rampant \nand unchecked speculation. The bill under consideration today helps \nachieve that, but we have to do much more. So while I agree we must \nmove forward with this legislation, I hope at the end of the day, at \nthe end of this process, we will consider other measures that are so \ninstrumental to crafting a comprehensive energy policy. The President \ntoo has a responsibility to join us in this process. We should be \nworking individually and collectively in bringing the best minds in \nthis country together to begin the process of addressing our energy \npolicy based on the short term, on intermediate and long-term proposals \nthat are so essential to eliminating our dependency on imported foreign \noil once and for all. We need to develop strategic independence, and \nthat is going to require urgent attention on our part. It requires \nconsensus and compromise that has paved the way for landmark \nlegislation in the past and it obviously requires crossing the \npolitical aisle to advance these historic initiatives--principles \ningrained in our Constitution and keystones from our Nation's \ninception.\n  When considering the vision of the Framers and the times in which we \nfind ourselves, I am compelled to say today that unless we in Congress \ndepoliticize these monumental issues of our time--as we have neglected \nto do time and again on energy policy--unless we set aside our partisan \nself-interests, we risk marginalizing this institution we cherish, and \nwe will not only have failed those who have elected us, but we will \nhave failed the test of history. As we are witnessing every day, the \nstakes couldn't be higher economically, militarily, and globally.\n  The core challenge is--as it has always been--for this, the greatest \ndemocracy on Earth, our ability to govern ourselves. Good governance \ndoesn't mean full agreement or comity 100 percent of the time within \nthe walls of this venerable, deliberative body, but it does mean that \nwe, as elected officials, have an individual and collective \nresponsibility to make the system work, and that can only happen when \nwe are willing to take the risk of working with each other instead of \nagainst each other. We would engender a renewed integrity to this \nprocess if we were simply to allow it to work. We should begin to make \nevery possible effort to make it happen. If we truly accept working \ntogether, there is nothing we cannot achieve. We could realize, I \nthink, milestone accomplishments that would be so important for this \nNation at this very anxious time.\n  I hope this is the beginning of the process of crafting a \ncomprehensive energy policy. It is rightfully what the American people \nexpect and deserve from their elected officials and this institution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Welcome Home Shaw\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in June, I had the distinct honor of \njoining thousands of Clevelanders at the Wolstein Center to celebrate \nthe determination and success of The Mighty Shaw High School Marching \nBand. The band was preparing to travel to Beijing later that month to \nperform at the International Olympic Music Festival. Shaw was one of \nonly five U.S. marching bands invited to this event, and we celebrated \ntheir achievement that night in Cleveland.\n  On the night of the concert, there were several thousand people in \nattendance. Many of them were Shaw High School alumni but just as many \nof them were not.\n  Folks traveled from all over the State of Ohio to come out and show \nsupport for the marching band, everybody dancing and singing in \ncelebration of Shaw's accomplishment.\n  The celebration represented more than a sendoff of a high school \nmarching band. It represented the collaboration of an entire community \nand the sheer willpower of a dedicated band and its tireless and \nfearless director. Donshon Wilson can be called many things: director, \nteacher, and mentor. But for the students and families of Shaw High \nSchool, he is also called hero.\n  Mr. Wilson, a Shaw marching band alum, saw the decline of his beloved \nband and decided to do something. Beginning in 2001, with a meager \nbudget, he took a handful of students and turned the band into a 60-\nmember-strong force to be reckoned with.\n  This year, with his unwavering faith and determination, he raised the \nnecessary funds--more than $400,000--to send Shaw to Beijing.\n  Mr. Wilson had transformed a high school band from an organization \nthat plays instruments to a group that inspires thousands of young \npeople across Cleveland.\n  From performing for Senator Obama and Senator Clinton in the last \nyear, to entertaining city diners as the musicians played impromptu \nconcerts throughout Cleveland's city streets, to representing our \ncountry in China, the Shaw marching band is an example of the best and \nthe brightest in our community.\n  At that Cleveland concert in June that my wife and I attended, what \nwas already a great celebration turned even more jubilant when Band \nDirector Wilson announced that the money raised in the last year would \nnot only send the band to Beijing, it would also establish a new \nseventh and eighth grade section of the band.\n  When it was announced Mr. Wilson would extend the program to now \ninclude the younger students in the Mighty Cardinals Marching Band, the \ncrowd applauded with joy and gratefulness. They knew this had never \nbeen done before. Giving the students the proper foundation to become \nbetter musicians earlier in their lives benefits this entire community \nof the city of East Cleveland.\n  As a father of four children, I could not help but well up with pride \nas more than 30 boys and girls in seventh and eighth grade marched onto \nthe arena floor to join their new band sisters and brothers in a \nspirited performance that brought down the house.\n  Because of the extraordinary work of Mr. Wilson, the Mighty Shaw High \nSchool Band, and school superintendent Myrna Loy Corley, a new \ngeneration of students will become part of the Shaw band family and \nCleveland history.\n  Earlier this month, Shaw returned from their triumphant trip to \nChina.\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\nTo say they were a hit is an understatement. From a spirited \nperformance in the historic Xi'an City Plaza, to an energetic \nperformance at the Great Wall of China, to their climactic parade and a \nknock-their-socks-off concert in Beijing, the Shaw High School Band \nrepresented themselves, their school, their city of East Cleveland, and \nthis great country with honor.\n  In the process, based on the cheers and applause from the audiences, \nthey won the hearts of their Chinese hosts. This summer, the people of \nChina--and the world--came to know what so many of us already knew: The \nMighty Shaw High School Marching Band is world class.\n  These are the band members:\n\n       Jimea Barnum, flag; Justin Bass, French horn; Jason Blade, \n     trumpet; Samone Bey, dance team; Krystal Brooks, flag; Alona \n     Bryson, dance team; Carlissa Chambers, dance team; Renee \n     Dorsey, flag; Kamaria Eiland, flag; Leah Foster, cymbals; \n     Isaiah Gardner, tenor drum; Marlon Graves, tenor drum; Rhonda \n     Harris, cymbals; Arthur Hill, baritone horn; Simone Hurd, \n     dance team; Kayla Jordan, dance team; Gerome Jennings, \n     Baritone horn; Jared Lang, French horn; Derrick Le Grande, \n     tenor drum.\n       Deontae Lewis, French horn; Mathew Longino, French horn; \n     Marshae Love, dance team; Audrey Maxwell, trombone; Genesis \n     Maxwell, cymbals; Alisha McClellan, cymbals; Robert Miller, \n     tenor drum; Seirra Moore, trumpet; Quanee Penn, snare drum; \n     Tony Prather, bass drum; Raymond Raye, bass drum; Sharleen \n     Riley, flag; Chanay Robinson, trombone; Tyrel Ross, tuba; \n     Delilah Sedrick, dance team; Natasha Shields, trumpet; \n     Masonia Shorter-Little, trombone; Jimila Small, trumpet; \n     Andresa Stephens, dance team; Marshell Stone, trombone.\n       Chavone Taylor, snare drum; Jonathan Thomas, tuba; Rory \n     Tripp, trumpet; Donovan Vaughn, trumpet; Ericka Walker, \n     trumpet; Denzel Watkins, snare drum; Kimille Webb, dance \n     team; Russell West, baritone horn; Daniel Whitworth, tuba; \n     Ciera Whitworth, trumpet; Shera Williams, trombone; Victor \n     Williams, snare drum; Latonia Young, flag.\n  These young men and women are special as students, as musicians, and \nas citizen ambassadors.

Mr. President, I rise to mark a dark anniversary for the \nHellenic-American community, and its Cypriot members in particular. \nThirty-four years ago this week, the armed forces of Turkey violated \nthe sovereignty and territory of the Republic of Cyprus by illegally \ninvading and ultimately occupying its northern third.\n  The continued division and military occupation of Cyprus by Turkey \nremains a gross violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms \nof all Cypriots and a blatant disregard for the rule of law. The \nEuropean Court of Human Rights has repeatedly condemned Turkey for \nviolating fundamental rights of Cypriots such as the right to life, the \nright to liberty and security, the right to the protection of property \nand the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment--rights we as \nAmericans also regard as sacrosanct.\n  Throughout these decades of injustice, the Greek Cypriot community \nhas sought a just resolution to the ``Cyprus Question.'' And we are \ncertainly at a potentially historic crossroads in the effort to end \nthis tragic division. With the February election of President \nChristofias and his focus on engaging the Turkish Cypriot community, \nthe coming months may turn out to be among the most consequential in \nthe island's long history. Certainly, for the people of the Republic of \nCyprus, the illegal occupation of the north cannot come to an end soon \nenough.\n  Meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou in early \nApril, I was therefore heartened to hear in detail about the progress \nmade at President Christofias' March meeting with Mehmet Ali Talat, the \nleader of the Turkish Cypriot community, which resulted in the \nestablishment of working groups on the outstanding substantive issues \nto be resolved between the two communities. Shortly thereafter, the two \ncommunities opened a critical border crossing on Ledra Street in the \nheart of Nicosia in early April. The two leaders have met twice more to \nreview the progress of the working groups, and are scheduled to again \nmeet at the end of this week.\n  These efforts only strengthen my long-held commitment to work to \nensure that the United States stands by its close ally, the Republic of \nCyprus, to achieve a resolution to the tragic division of the island \nthat is fair to Greek Cypriots. As we learned from our experience with \nthe justified rejection of the Annan Plan by Greek Cypriots in 2004--\nthe Cyprus Question is one that can only be resolved through mutual \nagreement on a solution, not an imposition of one.\n  The magnanimity of the Greek Cypriot community in seeking a fair \nsolution to the division of the island despite the injustices they have \nsuffered for nearly three and a half decades was also highlighted for \nme in October, when I met with the Mayor-in-exile of Famagusta, Alexis \nGalanos, concerning the Republic's hope for the orderly resettlement of \nthe ``ghost neighborhood'' of Varosha by its rightful inhabitants under \nU.N. administration, which would also open the harbor for use by both \ncommunities. Support for this plan--which the international community \ncalled for in United Nations Security Council Resolution 550 of 1984--\ndemonstrates not only the willingness but also the wisdom of the Greek \nCypriot community in seeking just and workable outcomes to seemingly \nintractable problems on the island. I am pleased to be working with \nAmbassador Andreas Kakouris of Cyprus to garner congressional support \nfor this initiative.\n  Moreover, the United States should be doing its part to address one \nof the most devastating effects of the occupation on Cypriot-American \nfamilies by providing the means for U.S. citizens with claims to \nproperty in the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus to seek redress for \nthe homes that have been destroyed or taken from them. The invasion by \nthe Turkish troops in 1974 forced nearly 200,000 Greek Cypriots--nearly \none-third of the Cypriot population at the time--from their homes, \nmaking them refugees in their own country. A large proportion of the \nproperties from which the Greek Cypriot owners were expelled was \nunlawfully distributed to the tens of thousands of illegal settlers \nfrom Turkey. An estimated 7,000 to 10,000 U.S. citizens of Cypriot \ndescent have claims to such properties.\n  That is why my colleague Senator Menendez and I have introduced the \nAmerican-Owned Property in Occupied Cyprus Claims Act, which would \ndirect the U.S. Government's independent Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission to receive, evaluate, and determine awards with respect to \nthe claims of U.S. citizens and businesses that lost property as a \nresult of Turkey's invasion and continued occupation of northern \nCyprus. The bill would further grant U.S. Federal courts jurisdiction \nover suits by U.S. nationals against any private persons occupying or \notherwise using the U.S. national's property in the Turkish-occupied \nportion of Cyprus. The act would expressly waive Turkey's sovereign \nimmunity against claims brought by U.S. nationals in U.S. courts \nrelating to property occupied by the Government of Turkey and used by \nTurkey in connection with a commercial activity carried out in the \nUnited States.\n  More than just providing redress to Cypriot-Americans who have had \ntheir ancestral homes taken from them, this legislation would uphold \nthe larger shared values of justice and personal dignity that the \ncitizens of both the United States and the Republic of Cyprus value so \nhighly. It is my hope and pledge that, whatever progress is made in the \ncurrent talks between the two communities on the island, the United\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\nStates will continue to stand by its close ally to ensure that fairness \nis not sacrificed in the interest of expediency.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thanks for the info. And thanks for asking for input. My \n     family is seeing the pinch somewhat. We live 20 miles from \n     Boise, and since work and shopping are in Boise, that puts us \n     on the road a lot during the week. We have been forced to \n     consolidate trips, which is not that bad an idea. We also \n     drive our little car (Honda Civic) more, which, for a family \n     of large people such as ours, is not a small problem. We do \n     not drive my pick-up as much as we have in the past, either.\n       I think that it is about time we developed our own \n     resources regardless of the impact of individual families. It \n     is a strategic decision since the world's oil reserves are \n     being used at an ever-increasing rate because of the growth \n     of the economies of different countries around the world. The \n     U.S. is not the only consumer any more, and we have to live \n     with that. So, drilling in ANWR, off the coast and developing \n     oil shale is a good thing, especially since we have proven \n     that we can do it with very little impact on the environment \n     (as is the case of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline). Of course, we \n     can expect accidents, but we have to deal with that if it \n     happens and engineer a plan for that contingency to prevent \n     it from happening.\n       I think solar power is something we really have to look at. \n     Why not require that every new house built have solar \n     collectors on the roof. This will do a number of things:\n       It will create a new industry which will create a fertile \n     environment for R, which will, in turn, improve the \n     efficiency and branch into new areas where solar power can be \n     used that have not been considered yet.\n       It will use a resource that is not being utilized because \n     of inefficiency. But, regardless of how inefficient our use \n     is, if we do not use it, it is going to waste, anyway.\n       It will open a new realm of thought where American \n     ingenuity can take over branching into other areas.\n       If we could offer tax or other types of incentives to home \n     owners who choose to retrofit their existing houses to solar \n     power, we could further increase the possibility of \n     development of the use of the resource.\n       I think nuclear energy has proven itself to be a great \n     source of power. Its increased use would foster research into \n     uses of the spent fuel, which seems to me to be the most \n     controversial area. Again, I am sure that with the increased \n     use of nuclear power comes the increased possibility of \n     accidents, but also comes the increased knowledge base from \n     which to work, keeping the possibilities of accidents to a \n     minimum.\n       One of the important questions I would like to raise is the \n     viability of ethanol. I think it is going to do too much \n     damage (we are seeing it already) to our food-producing \n     industry. It is already causing an increase in food costs in \n     the grocery store, and further development will cause, I am \n     afraid, an even larger cost increase. We are already \n     importing foodstuffs from other countries, something we have \n     not had to do before.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       You write that my country is too dependent on foreign oil \n     and we must develop alternate energy sources. You, your \n     party, and many of the Democrats have voted consistently \n     against all such alternatives for one reason or another. [I \n     disagree with your assessment of the problem.] It is of no \n     use to write about my experience with the rise in gas prices. \n     If Congress and this Administration need stories, then it \n     further proves that our elected government [is not responsive \n     to its citizens][Congress has] held hearings with the oil \n     representatives, which [has not resulted in anything.] Thank \n     you for your inattention to this response.\n     Harry.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a small business owner in Meridian. I will put this \n     succinctly: My government is allowing OPEC to put me and \n     other businesses out of business! If I understand this \n     correctly, we import most of our oil from Canada and Mexico. \n     If I also understand this correctly, they import a lot of \n     food and technology from us. Therefore, if we get little to \n     no oil, then understandably, they should get no food or \n     technology and keep [their own] citizens in [their] country. \n     I cannot afford to pay higher taxes for these illegal people. \n     No oil = no food. I can live longer without their oil than \n     they can without our food. Stop all Alaskan pipeline oil to \n     Japan; why should we be in critical shortage and continue to \n     supply them?\n       We can build refineries, too. Obviously the OPEC cartel \n     does not want to since they are raping our bank accounts with \n     the few that are working. Drill off-shore; China is [doing \n     so] in our own gulf, and drill in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n       [I am tired of all the talk without any action. Congress \n     must get this country moving in a positive direction.]\n       Support the troops.\n       Secure the border.\n       Drill and process our own oil, build refineries.\n       Secure English as our language.\n       No foreign aid to countries hostile to the U.S.\n       Practice some ethics in government service.\n       [I am very unhappy with the inaction of Congress on this \n     matter.]\n           Sincerely,\n     David, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I received your e-mail and just wanted \n     to respond in kind to it.\n       I also heard President Bush's speech this morning that he \n     would like to lift the ban on offshore drilling, begin shale \n     drilling in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, and also begin \n     drilling in ANWR. My husband and I are 100 percent in favor \n     of this happening, and hope that your vote will likewise be \n     the same in the Senate. What a shame that this country has \n     not built a new refinery in thirty years. It is hard to \n     believe that we have let ourselves become so dependent on \n     foreign oil, and it is a disgrace to this country. We would \n     also be in favor of nuclear energy, and affordable hybrid \n     cars (electric and gas) to lessen the dependency on oil.\n       My husband and I are both retired and on fixed incomes so \n     the sky rocketing fuel prices affecting the cost of food, and \n     anything else shipped by truck, has not only cut into our \n     income, but also into our savings.\n       We thank you for all the good work you are doing on our \n     behalf as Senator of Idaho. Please keep up the fight so that \n     our voices can be heard.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sheila.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is time that we must remind Republicans that if we do \n     not drill, we will no longer be the strongest nation in the \n     world. I am sure that the Liberals and Environmentalists want \n     us to suffer. We are a ``can do'' nation and we can start \n     drilling off the coasts and in ANWR. We need to show, the \n     Americans, that we are still a ``can do'' nation. Maybe we \n     should tell all those who do not support drilling that we \n     should not support them in Congress. We are a nation that has \n     always had a ``can do'' attitude. We do not [want people in \n     Congress who do not support drilling and new jobs; we need \n     people who will allow us to develop our own resources without \n     reliance on foreign countries.] We have plenty of oil and oil \n     shale in our country to start drilling now.\n     Mary.\n                                  ____\n\n       Good for you, Senator Crapo!! Thank you for not falling for \n     the illogical environmental hysteria that is taking over the \n     political landscape right now. We need long-term planning, \n     not short-term panic.\n     Marv.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have presently read a report written by a retired \n     engineer from Exxon. This engineer has proposed a change from \n     oil to coal-oil. That can be produced at $40 a barrel and \n     within EPA standards. To me, this is a no-brainer for the \n     interim until a permanent solution is available.\n     Herbert.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I live in Hailey and are octogenarians, so the \n     impact of high energy costs is felt through home heating and \n     cooking and limitation on driving. Perhaps the greatest \n     impact is the rising cost of food and services relating to \n     costs of energy. We have canceled out two vacations this \n     summer and fall, and go into town to shop and pick up mail \n     just 2 or 3 days a week.\n       If Congress actually gets serious, I feel we would be well \n     served by 1) offshore drilling and new refining and 2) a \n     serious long-term effort to diversify into nuclear power, and \n     other economically correct alternatives, including coal and \n     shale oil.\n       Keep your eye on the ball.\n     Jim and Marty.\n                                  ____\n\n       ``This year alone, the average American family will spend \n     more than $200 a month on gasoline.''\n       YOU are now paying about half what Europeans pay for gas--\n     so this is what you chose to call a ``crisis.'' But then of \n     course you do not walk in my shoes. The Europeans apparently \n     have learned to live with outrageous\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\n     gas prices, but then their governments do not provide tax \n     incentives for people to buy SUVs and 1-ton trucks to go \n     shopping in. Maybe there is no SUV or 1-ton truck lobby over \n     there.\n       Here is MY crisis--if you are interested: I am paying \n     $1,293 per month for medical insurance for my wife and \n     myself. That is a heck of a lot more than your $200 \n     ``crisis.'' That takes care of about all of my company \n     pension (after 30 years of employment).\n       For that $200 in gas I can escape to McCall or Stanley for \n     a weekend. That $1,293 medical insurance does not even offer \n     me peace of mind, as I struggle each month to justify the \n     payment.\n       Obviously--your crisis is not my crisis--and vice versa.\n     Ole, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       This fuel problem is, of course, hard on us all. But the \n     young families trying to make ends meet by working two jobs \n     and still cannot meet the student's needs, and cannot get any \n     to help because they do not fall into the right bracket to \n     receive stamps or whatever, free children's lunches, even. \n     The real people are the ones who are hurting. Yes, something \n     has got to give. Bless you for caring.\n     Mary.\n                                  ____\n\n       The bottom line solution to our energy crisis is to \n     dramatically reduce our dependence on fossil fuel as quickly \n     as possible, especially foreign oil. Sooner or later that \n     supply is going to be history.\n       The big question is what can we do now? I can think of \n     several ideas: (1) Allow oil drilling in the U.S. in those \n     areas currently restricted by environmental law. (2) Create \n     monetary incentives for auto manufacturers who offer non-\n     fossil fuel vehicles for sale and also incentives for those \n     who buy them. (3) Encourage the use of nuclear energy to \n     generate electrical energy, both for home and domestic use. \n     (4) To help pay for some of this, apply a healthy surcharge \n     on every gallon of foreign oil that comes into the U.S. And \n     finally (5) continue to help educate our U.S. public in new \n     and better ways to cope with high energy costs.\n       None of this will come quick or easy, but something has to \n     be done now to keep from destroying our U.S. economy and \n     existence.\n       Thank you.\n     Dave and Helen, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I totally disagree with your statement in the first \n     paragraph that reads:\n       ``The driving distances between places in our state as well \n     as limited public transportation options mean that many of us \n     do not have any choice but to keep driving and paying those \n     ever-increasing prices for fuel. The United States is too \n     dependent on petroleum for our energy. And we are far too \n     dependent on foreign sources of that petroleum. We urgently \n     need to expand our own domestic production of petroleum and \n     need to significantly diversify our energy sources.''\n       More emphasis should be placed by Congress (including you) \n     on forcing the three domestic automobile manufacturers to \n     increase the mileage cars and trucks get and phase out \n     production of gas-guzzling SUVs, while increasing the \n     production levels of hybrid cars similar to the ones Toyota \n     and Honda make. Instead of coming up with new ideas you \n     advocate continuing the status quo, which is to allow auto \n     manufacturers to save money on the research necessary to come \n     up with cars that have leading-edge technology, like the \n     Toyota Prius. No wonder American car makers are losing \n     billions of dollars and are now behind Toyota in cars sold. \n     Next thing we taxpayers will probably have to do is to bail \n     these companies out, just as we did with Chrysler in the \n     early 1980s.\n     Robert, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, While there is no short term fix for \n     escalating energy prices, I believe there are a few things \n     that we can do to ensure the United States of America will \n     have viable energy for the future.\n       (1) Speculative Impact on Oil--Taxing the oil companies \n     into oblivion is not the answer, but the methods that are \n     used to trade oil contracts can be changed. Since oil \n     speculators only need to put 4 percent--7 percent down on an \n     oil contract, there are too many speculators in the market \n     that have no intention of ever taking delivery of a drop of \n     oil. Raising the down payment to be comparable to the stock \n     market (50 percent down payment) will take out the investors \n     ``dabbling'' in oil. Let us do the math on this: If I took \n     $40,000 of my own money, I could buy one million dollars \n     worth of oil contracts that I would have no intention of ever \n     taking delivery of. Removing oil contracts such as these from \n     the market would give us a better idea of true supply/demand \n     ratio really is.\n       (1a) The Fed needs to do what is necessary to increase the \n     value of the dollar. A stronger dollar slows down speculative \n     buying of oil, causing the price to drop.\n       (2) Import tariff on ethanol. While we do not want to be \n     dependent on yet another imported fuel, this would remove \n     some of the pressure on food prices due to demand for corn. \n     Corn is so important to our society that most people do not \n     grasp the impact it has on many areas of the economy. \n     Everything from carbonated drinks, dog food, meat, etc. \n     depend on corn in one way or another and also raises the \n     prices for other crops because less of these other crops are \n     being planted in favor of corn. Now take that price increase, \n     and add the effect of the flooding this year and we are \n     looking at a recipe for rampant inflation. Since Idaho \n     farmers produce a large amount of sugar from sugar beets, \n     maybe helping them build some plants to turn that sugar into \n     ethanol is a viable option.\n       (3) Other energy sources. We cannot continue to count on \n     oil as our primary source for energy. The Federal Government \n     has known for years that we can get biodiesel from ALGAE! \n     (http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html cites many \n     government sources) We cannot afford to not provide funds for \n     more research and development in this field. Clean nuclear \n     energy--we need to do whatever we can to be able to take \n     spent nuclear fuel and regenerate it, thus having less \n     nuclear waste going into the ground. If the French can do \n     this, there should be nothing in our way to prevent us for \n     doing it--even if it means renegotiating nuclear \n     proliferation treaties. We also need to invest more into \n     research and development of solar and wind power. We also \n     need to overturn drilling bans that are in place in places \n     such as the coasts of California and Florida. We also cannot \n     deny that this country needs more refining capacity, and we \n     need to come up with a way to help companies cut the red tape \n     and build more refinery capacity.\n       (4) FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION--The rules imposed by the \n     EPA have impacted our ability to have higher mile per gallon \n     vehicles. Tighter emission laws always results in a decrease \n     in fuel economy. If engines put out less emissions in \n     emissions tests, is that negated by them consuming more fuel \n     over several years? For example, the change from low sulfur \n     diesel (500 ppm sulfur) to Ultra low sulfur diesel (50 ppm) \n     caused diesels to lose about 2 percent economy and some of \n     the older engines have problems with the new diesel eating \n     through seals. Having regulations more like Europe (separate \n     policies for gasoline engines vs. diesel engines) would also \n     help. Due to the current EPA regulation, nobody can import \n     the clean diesels from Europe such as the Volkswagen Polo--\n     which with the diesel engine gets 72 mpg. Hybrid vehicles \n     cannot touch this kind of fuel economy. Just think how many \n     gallons of fuel would be saved by cars like this, then think \n     about how many more gallons of fuel would be saved if this \n     vehicle used biodiesel!\n       As for how it affects my life: I had already reduced my \n     driving after diesel hit $3/gallon, and now I have reduced it \n     even more. I canceled plans to visit family in North Idaho \n     for the Memorial Day Weekend (I live in Boise), and about the \n     only driving I do is to/from work (5 miles each way), and \n     necessary errands such as the grocery store. I also end up \n     hunting much less than I would like, and if the price \n     continues to climb, I may not hunt at all. If more people \n     like me do not hunt, then the Idaho Fish and Game department \n     will have huge funding shortfalls which, in my opinion, \n     jeopardizes the future of wildlife conservation in our state. \n     I also have cut down on spending of all other types, whether \n     it is eating out or not buying consumer goods.\n       There is not an instant solution to the energy crisis, but \n     some of the things above will help in the short term. We need \n     to focus on the long term energy policy not only to cause \n     prices to normalize, but to prevent economy-killing price \n     hikes like we are seeing now.\n     Alan, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are 70 years old and active seniors on a fixed income. \n     Energy costs are becoming a burden for us and will begin to \n     go into our reserves for future years. Gas prices are \n     obviously a problem but the cost of groceries is also a big \n     item. We have one car and my husband rides a bicycle as much \n     as possible. I walk to places when destinations are close \n     enough. We are concerned about being good stewards of our \n     environment and do what we can, e.g., recycling, using less \n     gas, using fans instead of an air conditioner when practical, \n     raising some of our own food, planting trees on our property, \n     and conserving water.\n       We are disgusted that we are the victims of bogus global \n     warming fanatics, environmentalists, and opportunists. \n     Ethanol, which has not been proven to be efficient or good \n     for engines, is using up corn that was used for food and \n     livestock feed thus raising food costs. We have oil reserves \n     in our own soil that could be used. There are other countries \n     drilling off our shores so why cannot we since this would not \n     create any more risk than is already present?\n     Allen and Jane, Nampa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S7027-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7027-S7028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            125TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHURCHS FERRY, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. On June \n27 through June 29, the residents of Churchs Ferry celebrated their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  This Great Northern Rail Road town site was founded in 1886 and named \nfor the ferry service operated by Irvine A. Church. Mr. Church moved \nhis Church post office to the town on November 13, 1886, adopting the \nnew name. To conform to new government spelling regulations the name \nwas changed to Churchs Ferry on November 30, 1894.\n  Although its population is small, Churchs Ferry serves as a testament \nto\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\nhard work and determination. Even after a Federal buyout in 2000 \nrelocated many residents of Churchs Ferry from the rising flood waters \nof Devils Lake, some residents remained. These 10 residents have \npersevered and worked extremely hard to keep Churchs Ferry alive. Paul \nChristenson is the mayor, mechanic, and mower of the community's 30 \nacres of grass and takes great pride in keeping Churchs Ferry \nbeautiful. Two new businesses have opened, including Gardendwellers \nFarm, which grows custom crops for wineries and restaurants and offers \nhorticulture tours and workshops, and Water's Edge Dog Boarding kennel.\n  Visitors who pass through Churchs Ferry still see that the street \nsigns are up and can drive by city hall, the post office, Kat's Korral \nbar, Paul's Repair shop, the Zion Lutheran Church, a museum, the \nMasonic Temple and the former school's gym/kitchen/stage addition that \nwas purchased by the school's alumni association.

On July \n12 and 13, the residents of Guelph gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Guelph is located in Dickey County in southeastern North Dakota. It \nwas founded in 1886 as a station for the Great Northern Rail Road. The \npost office was established on March 8, 1887, and its postmaster, Silas \nR. Dales, named the town for his hometown of Guelph, Ontario.\n  Although its population is small, Guelph is a popular destination \nbecause of its proximity to the James River for recreational boating \nand fishing. In addition, there are eight farms in the community that \nhave been in the same families for 100 years.\n  The celebratory events on July 12 included a performance by the \nGuelph Community Band and Chorus, an all-school reunion, children's \ngames, pony rides, a Shine and Show classic car/collectible vehicle \nshow, a banquet and a dance. Activities for July 13 included a turkey \nbarbeque, children's games and a tractor pull.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th \nanniversary. On July 4-6, the residents of Havana gathered to celebrate \ntheir community's history and founding.\n  Havana is a town of nearly 100 inhabitants. It is located in \nsoutheast North Dakota. Originally, the town was named Weber, but it \nwas subsequently changed to Havana to avoid confusion with a town of a \nsimilar sounding name on the same railroad line. Havana was \nincorporated in 1904. By 1913, the town claimed a population of 450. In \nits early days, Havana had numerous general stores, pool halls, hotels, \nbusinesses dedicated to agriculture, a newspaper and an opera house.\n  Today, Havana offers its citizens plenty of leisure activities. \nResidents can enjoy a game of baseball at Williamson Park. The town \nmaintains a grocery store and a post office. The Havana Civic Center \nhosts events for Havana's citizens. One of the favorite gathering \nplaces of residents of Havana is the town's cafe, the Farmer's Inn.\n  Havana's anniversary celebration began with a parade. In addition to \nmany other activities, the community hosted a craft show, a banquet at \nthe Havana Civic Center, a street dance, and fireworks display. Havana \nheld a music festival, featuring bluegrass and gospel music, on the \nlast day of the celebration. One of the highlights of Havana's \nfestivities was the All School Reunion, which brought together former \nclassmates of Havana School.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Havana, \nND and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well \nin the future. By honoring Havana and all the other historic small \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the frontier spirit alive for future \ngenerations. It is places like Havana that have helped to shape this \ncountry into what it is today, which is why this community is deserving \nof our recognition.\n  Havana has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S7028-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             125TH ANNIVERSARY OF MINNEWAUKAN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 25 \nthrough July 27, the residents of Minnewaukan will celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Minnewaukan is a small town with a population of 318 residents \nlocated in Benson County in northeastern North Dakota. In 1883, the \ntown site was founded as one of several sites competing for the \nimportant Northern Pacific Railroad connection at the west end of \nDevils Lake. It became the county seat in 1884. The name is based on \nthe Indian name Mini Waukon Chante, meaning water of bad spirits. The \npost office was established on March 12, 1884, by Thomas B. Ware. In \n1898, Minnewaukan became a city.\n  Today, Minnewaukan remains a proud community that has a prosperous \neconomy consisting of farming, service businesses, outdoor tourism, \ncomputer processing and retail businesses. Like so many smaller rural \ncommunities in North Dakota, Minnewaukan is a tight-knit town where \neveryone knows their neighbor. The Minnewaukan Community Club is a \nvaluable asset to the community. The efforts of the club have \nsuccessfully established a thriving fish cleaning station and boat ramp \nin the area.\n  Minnewaukan is a great place for enjoying the outdoors all year \nround, including hunting, fishing, boating, and camping. People from \nacross the State and Nation are drawn by the lengthy seasons and \nabundant populations of waterfowl and fish. Grahams Island State Park \nprovides citizens of the community and tourists an opportunity to enjoy \nthe beauty of North Dakota through hiking, canoeing, biking, horseback \nriding and cross-country skiing.\n  The community has planned a wonderful weekend celebration to \ncommemorate its 125th anniversary. Current and former residents of \nMinnewaukan will gather to celebrate this special occasion. The \ncelebration includes an all-school reunion, a 5k walk/run, parade, \nfireworks display, concerts, and much more.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nMinnewaukan, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in \nwishing them well in the future. By honoring Minnewaukan and all the \nother historic towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations.

A bill to advance America's priorities; read the first time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing along with Senators \nLeahy, Lieberman, Feinstein, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, and Biden, an \nimportant bill, with provisions in a variety of areas--from advancing \nmedical research in critical areas, to cracking down on child \nexploitation, to promoting important U.S. foreign policy goals, to \nhelping improve America's understanding about the oceans. What unites \nthis diverse package of bills? One thing--unprecedented obstructionism.\n  The bills in this package include initiatives that have broad \nbipartisan support. Initiatives that have passed the House by 411 to 3; \nby 422 to 2; by 416 to 0. Many of these initiatives had such strong \nbipartisan support that they passed the House and Senate Committee by \nvoice vote or even by unanimous consent.\n  Under normal circumstances, they would have passed the Senate through \na simplified and expedited unanimous consent process and become law. \nMaybe some would have required a period of brief debate before passing \nthe Senate.\n  But, instead of allowing the will of the Congress and the American \npeople to be heard, Republicans have obstructed one bill after another. \nHere are just a few examples of the legislation that this bill \nincludes--and that Republicans are preventing from becoming law:\n  The Emmitt Till Unsolved Crimes bill: Would help heal old wounds and \nsolve crimes that have continued to be unsolved and unpunished since \nthe Civil Rights era.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth bill: Would provide grants for health \ncare, education and workforce programs, and housing programs for \nrunaways and homeless youth.\n  The Combating Child Exploitation bill: Would provide grants to train \nlaw enforcement to use technology to track individuals who trade child \npornography. Establishes an Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force \nwithin the Office of Justice Programs.\n  The ALS Registry bill: WouId create a centralized database to help \ndoctors and scientists treat and hopefully find a cure for ALS/Lou \nGehrig's Disease, which afflicts 5,600 Americans every year.\n  The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act: Would enhance \ncooperation in research, rehabilitation and quality of life for people \nwho suffer from paralysis. Not only will this bill accelerate the \ndiscovery of better treatments and cures, but help improve the daily \nlives of the 2 million Americans who await a cure.\n  This is just the tip of the iceberg. These bills address important \nAmerican priorities, have broad--virtually unanimous--bipartisan \nsupport, yet, all have fallen victim to just one or two Republicans.\n  Senate Democrats are not willing to allow this obstruction of a few \nto block the will of the Congress and the American people any longer. \nRepublicans will have a choice: Will they join the side of the American \npeople, or continue to stand beside one or two colleagues intent on \nblocking progress? I hope Republicans will end their obstruction and \nwork with Democrats this week to pass this crucial and long-overdue \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       The subtitle may be cited as the ``Vision Care for Kids Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Millions of children in the United States suffer from \n     vision problems, many of which go undetected. Because \n     children with vision problems can struggle developmentally, \n     resulting in physical, emotional, and social consequences, \n     good vision is essential for proper physical development and \n     educational progress.\n       (2) Vision problems in children range from common \n     conditions such as refractive errors, amblyopia, strabismus, \n     ocular trauma, and infections, to rare but potentially life- \n     or sight-threatening problems such as retinoblastoma, \n     infantile cataracts, congenital glaucoma, and genetic or \n     metabolic diseases of the eye.\n       (3) Since many serious ocular conditions are treatable if \n     identified in the preschool and early school-age years, early \n     detection provides the best opportunity for effective \n     treatment and can have far-reaching implications for vision.\n       (4) Various identification methods, including vision \n     screening and comprehensive eye examinations required by \n     State laws, can be helpful in identifying children needing \n     services. A child identified as needing services through \n     vision screening should receive a comprehensive eye \n     examination followed by subsequent treatment as needed. Any \n     child identified as needing services should have access to \n     subsequent treatment as needed.\n       (5) There is a need to increase public awareness about the \n     prevalence and devastating consequences of vision disorders \n     in children and to educate the public and health care \n     providers about the warning signs and symptoms of ocular and \n     vision disorders and the benefits of early detection, \n     evaluation, and treatment.\n\n     SEC. 1403.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon \n     Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to President George W. Bush, ``America's \n     leadership and national security rest on our commitment to \n     educate and prepare our youth for active engagement in the \n     international community.''.\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\n       (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, \n     ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the \n     effective management of global issues, and even an \n     understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater \n     contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures \n     beyond our borders.''.\n       (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission \n     on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program \n     pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations \n     and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). \n     Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission has submitted \n     to Congress and the President a report of its recommendations \n     for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at \n     institutions of higher education in the United States to \n     study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing \n     nations.\n       (4) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[s]tudy abroad \n     is one of the major means of producing foreign language \n     speakers and enhancing foreign language learning'' and, for \n     that reason, ``is simply essential to the [N]ation's \n     security''.\n       (5) Studies consistently show that United States students \n     score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on \n     indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global \n     literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade \n     and business, global interdependence, and global terror.\n       (6) Americans believe that it is important for their \n     children to learn other languages, study abroad, attend a \n     college where they can interact with international students, \n     learn about other countries and cultures, and generally be \n     prepared for the global age.\n       (7) In today's world, it is more important than ever for \n     the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader \n     that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership \n     cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with \n     significant knowledge and awareness of the world.\n       (8) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of \n     imparting international and foreign-language competency to \n     students.\n       (9) In any given year, only approximately one percent of \n     all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher \n     education study abroad.\n       (10) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from \n     United States institutions of higher education with bachelors \n     degrees have studied abroad.\n       (11) Far more study abroad must take place in developing \n     countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's population \n     growth over the next 50 years will occur outside of Europe. \n     Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of United \n     States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and 45 \n     percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom, Italy, \n     Spain, and France--according to the Institute of \n     International Education.\n       (12) The Final Report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission \n     Report) recommended that the United States increase support \n     for ``scholarship, exchange, and library programs''. The 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission, \n     noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this \n     recommendation was ``unfulfilled,'' and stated that ``The \n     U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange \n     programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the \n     course of a generation.''. In its December 5, 2005, Final \n     Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ``D'' \n     for its implementation of this recommendation.\n       (13) Investing in a national study abroad program would \n     help turn a grade of ``D'' into an ``A'' by equipping United \n     States students to communicate United States values and way \n     of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among \n     citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad.\n       (14) An enhanced national study abroad program could help \n     further the goals of other United States Government \n     initiatives to promote educational, social, and political \n     reform and the status of women in developing and reforming \n     societies around the world, such as the Middle East \n     Partnership Initiative.\n       (15) To complement such worthwhile Federal programs and \n     initiatives as the Benjamin A. Gilman International \n     Scholarship Program, the National Security Education Program, \n     and the National Security Language Initiative, a broad-based \n     undergraduate study abroad program is needed that will make \n     many more study abroad opportunities accessible to all \n     undergraduate students, regardless of their field of study, \n     ethnicity, socio-economic status, or gender.\n\n     SEC. 4003. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and \n     international knowledge base of the United States by ensuring \n     that more United States students have the opportunity to \n     acquire foreign language skills and international knowledge \n     through significantly expanded study abroad;\n       (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United \n     States by significantly expanding and diversifying the talent \n     pool of individuals with non-traditional foreign language \n     skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are \n     available for recruitment by United States foreign affairs \n     agencies, legislative branch agencies, and nongovernmental \n     organizations involved in foreign affairs activities;\n       (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by \n     United States students will take place in nontraditional \n     study abroad destinations such as the People's Republic of \n     China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing \n     countries; and\n       (4) to create greater cultural understanding of the United \n     States by exposing foreign students and their families to \n     United States students in countries that have not \n     traditionally hosted large numbers of United States students.\n\n     SEC. 4004.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In June 2004, the Office of the Coordinator for \n     Reconstruction and Stabilization (referred to as the \n     ``Coordinator'') was established in the Department of State \n     with the mandate to lead, coordinate, and institutionalize \n     United States Government civilian capacity to prevent or \n     prepare for post-conflict situations and help reconstruct and \n     stabilize a country or region that is at risk of, in, or is \n     in transition from, conflict or civil strife.\n       (2) In December 2005, the Coordinator's mandate was \n     reaffirmed by the National Security Presidential Directive \n     44, which instructed the Secretary of State, and at the \n     Secretary's direction, the Coordinator, to coordinate and \n     lead integrated United States Government efforts, involving \n     all United States departments and agencies with relevant \n     capabilities, to prepare, plan for, and conduct \n     reconstruction and stabilization operations.\n       (3) National Security Presidential Directive 44 assigns to \n     the Secretary, with the Coordinator's assistance, the lead \n     role to develop reconstruction and stabilization strategies, \n     ensure civilian interagency program and policy coordination, \n     coordinate interagency processes to identify countries at \n     risk of instability, provide decision-makers with detailed \n     options for an integrated United States Government response \n     in connection with reconstruction and stabilization \n     operations, and carry out a wide range\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\n     of other actions, including the development of a civilian \n     surge capacity to meet reconstruction and stabilization \n     emergencies. The Secretary and the Coordinator are also \n     charged with coordinating with the Department of Defense on \n     reconstruction and stabilization responses, and integrating \n     planning and implementing procedures.\n       (4) The Department of Defense issued Directive 3000.05, \n     which establishes that stability operations are a core United \n     States military mission that the Department of Defense must \n     be prepared to conduct and support, provides guidance on \n     stability operations that will evolve over time, and assigns \n     responsibilities within the Department of Defense for \n     planning, training, and preparing to conduct and support \n     stability operations.\n       (5) The President's Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request to \n     Congress includes $248,600,000 for a Civilian Stabilization \n     Initiative that would vastly improve civilian partnership \n     with the Armed Forces in post-conflict stabilization \n     situations, including by establishing an Active Response \n     Corps of 250 persons, a Standby Response Corps of 2000 \n     persons, and a Civilian Response Corps of 2000 persons.\n\n     SEC. 4103.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for temporary improvements to the Medicare inpatient hospital \npayment adjustment for low-volume hospitals and to provide for the use \nof the non-wage adjusted PPS rate under the Medicare-dependent hospital \n(MDH) program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rural \nHospital Act of 2008. Back in December, I stood before this body \nexplaining that we were only passing a 6-month Medicare bill in order \nto provide the opportunity for us to address a number of priorities. \nOne of the biggest priorities I identified was the need to ensure \naccess to rural hospital services.\n  The type of rural hospitals that top the priority list are what are \nknown as ``tweeners.'' These hospitals are too large to be critical \naccess hospitals, but too small to be financially viable under the \nMedicare hospital prospective payment systems. It is absolutely \nimperative that these tweener hospitals get the assistance they need in \norder to keep their doors open. They are often not only the sole \nprovider of health care in rural areas but are also significant \nemployers and purchasers in the community. Also, the presence of a \nhospital is essential for purposes of economic development because \nbusinesses check to see if a hospital is in the community in which they \nmight set up shop.\n  While the Medicare bill that Congress just enacted improves the \nsituation for some tweeners, many more are left in financial peril. It \nis unfortunate that comprehensive payment reforms for tweener hospitals \nwere not included in the bill that just passed. As you know, I have \nlong proposed a number of tweener payment improvements in previous \nbills this Congress and they were included in the agreement that \nSenator Baucus and I reached for this year's Medicare bill. \nUnfortunately, the core tweener hospital payment improvements were \ndropped from the bill once the process became partisan.\n  It is for this reason that I am introducing this bill. We must \nimprove the financial health of tweener hospitals and ensure that \npeople have access to health care.\n  Most tweener hospitals are currently designated as Medicare Dependent \nHospitals and Sole Community Hospitals under the Medicare program. \nWhile the bill that recently passed Congress improves payments for Sole \nCommunity Hospitals, there are no provisions that benefit Medicare \nDependent Hospitals. This bill would benefit Medicare Dependent \nHospitals by not adjusting their payments for area wages unless it \nwould result in improved payments.\n  Also, a major driver of the financial difficulties that tweener \nhospitals face is the fact that many have relatively low volumes of \ninpatient admissions. Back when we passed the Medicare Prescription \nDrug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, I made sure that this \nlaw included an add-on payment for low volume rural hospitals. This \nbill would improve the existing low-volume add-on payment for hospitals \nso that more rural facilities, both Medicare Dependent Hospitals and \nSole Community Hospitals, with low volumes would receive the assistance \nthey desperately need.\n  To offset the increases in spending from these tweener hospital \npayment improvements, this bill would address another priority that we \nwanted to include in a more comprehensive Medicare bill. Many know my \nposition regarding physician owned hospitals and my concern about the \neffect these facilities have on health care access and costs as well as \npatient safety. There has been much debate regarding these facilities \nover the years, especially with physician owned limited service \nhospitals. This bill would eliminate the exceptions under the physician \nself-referral laws for physician-owned hospitals and provide a limited \nexception for existing facilities.\n  As you can see, we still have much to do when it comes to ensuring \naccess to health care in rural America. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on this urgent matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3304. A bill to designate the North Palisade in the Sierra Nevada \nin the State of California as ``Brower Palisade'' in honor of the late \nDavid Brower; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nmy colleague Senator Boxer to introduce the Brower Palisade Designation \nAct and honor the life of one of our Nation's most influential \nenvironmental stewards, the late David Brower.\n  The Brower Palisade Designation Act renames the North Palisade--a \nprominent peak in the Sierra Nevada--``Brower Palisade'' in his honor.\n  David Brower dedicated his life to environmental advocacy and helped \nshape the conservation movement in California and across the Nation.\n  His efforts raised public awareness about the environment and the \nneed to preserve our resources for future generations.\n  Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall once referred to David \nBrower as the ``giant of 20th Century conservation in the United \nStates.''\n  In 1952, David Brower was named the first executive director of the \nSierra Club, one of the most prominent environmental and conservation \norganizations in the U.S. He held this position for nearly 2 decades.\n  David Brower's leadership led to the creation of many units of the \nNational Park System, including North Cascades National Park, Redwood \nNational Park and Point Reyes National Seashore.\n  He also played a significant role in helping to draft the Wilderness \nAct, which has preserved much of the Sierra Nevada, including his \nfavorite group peaks, the Palisades.\n  Renaming the North Palisade peak ``Brower Palisade'' will be a \nlasting reminder of David Brower's leadership and invaluable \ncontributions to the environmental community for generations to come.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Brower Palisade Designation \nAct and join me in honoring the achievements of one of our most notable \nenvironmental advocates, David Brower.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3304\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Brower Palisade Designation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) David Brower dedicated his life to environmental \n     advocacy and was 1 of the most notable environmental stewards \n     of the United States;\n       (2) former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall referred \n     to David Brower as the\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\n     ``giant of 20th Century conservation in the United States'';\n       (3) David Brower was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize 3 \n     times;\n       (4) David Brower was named the first executive director of \n     the Sierra Club, 1 of the most prominent environmental and \n     conservation organizations in the United States;\n       (5) the efforts of David Brower led to the creation of many \n     units of the National Park System, including North Cascades \n     National Park, Redwood National Park, and Point Reyes \n     National Seashore;\n       (6) the leadership of David Brower helped protect the Grand \n     Canyon National Park and Dinosaur National Monument;\n       (7) David Brower played a important role in drafting the \n     Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), which has protected \n     much of the Sierra Nevada;\n       (8) David Brower revolutionized rock-climbing and \n     mountaineering in the United States and is credited with more \n     than 70 first ascents of Sierra Nevada peaks;\n       (9) David Brower made the first winter ascent of North \n     Palisade and the first ascent of the Northwest Ridge of the \n     peak; and\n       (10) the Palisade group of peaks, on the border of Kings \n     Canyon National Park and Inyo National Forest, was David \n     Brower's favorite part of the Sierra Nevada.\n\n     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF BROWER PALISADE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The North Palisade, a prominent peak in \n     the Palisade group of peaks in the Sierra Nevada bordering \n     Kings Canyon National Park and the Inyo National Forest in \n     the State of California, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Brower Palisade''.\n       (b)  References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     peak described in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the Brower Palisade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Obama, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 3308. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \npermit facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be \ndesignated as voter registration agencies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the \nVeteran Voting Support Act, which Senator Feinstein and Senator Kerry \nhave introduced today.\n  This bill will address an issue of great concern to me and to so many \nAmericans: the rights of Americans who fight to defend our values and \nfreedoms abroad must have the full enjoyment of those rights here at \nhome. This legislation responds to an announcement by the Bush \nadministration's Department of Veterans Affairs that it will ban non-\npartisan organizations and state election officials from conducting \nvoter registration drives at its facilities.\n  It is a sad commentary that in our great Nation, so many of our young \nveterans who have been treated shamefully by their government when it \nsent them into harm's way under false pretenses are again mistreated \nafter they return home. Our troops were sent to fight an unnecessary \nwar in Iraq--without sufficient armor, without adequate reinforcements, \nwithout a plan to win the peace, and without adequate medical care and \nother services to help them adapt to life upon their return.\n  Given this President's obsession with democracy taking root in the \nMiddle East, I would think that at a minimum he would be equally \nconcerned with guaranteeing the right to vote to veterans returning \nhome after risking life and limb spreading that right to others. Yet, \nhis administration has done just the opposite. Under this President's \nwatch, the Department of Veteran Affairs has erected barriers to voter \nregistration that impede veterans being treated in VA facilities from \nparticipating in the political process.\n  First, this administration's Department of Veteran Affairs has shown \nlittle interest in, or commitment to, assisting veterans in exercising \nthe fundamental right to vote. Since 2004, the Department has often \nsided in Federal court against allowing third-party organizations to \nconduct voter registration drives at VA hospitals. Until this past \nApril, the Department's national policy was silent on whether it could \nassist disabled veterans access and complete voter registration forms. \nIndeed, court findings appear to indicate that in some instances, the \nDepartment may have even prohibited its own staff from providing such \nassistance.\n  Second, although the Department has made recent strides to allow \nveterans more access to voter registration forms, it has not gone far \nenough. Three months ago, the Department issued a written directive' \nrequiring all VA facilities to develop voter registration plans that \nwould assist patients in registering to vote. I applaud this action as \na positive first step. However, I am concerned that the new directive \nstops short of mandating that VA facilities affirmatively offer \ndisabled veterans a chance to register to vote. To paraphrase Paul \nSullivan, the Executive Director of Veterans for Commonsense, the new \ndirective only changed the Department from being in active opposition \nto veterans' voter registration to passively supporting it.\n  Third, and perhaps most troubling, the new directive prohibits third-\nparty organizations and state election officials from conducting \nnonpartisan voter registration drives among veterans at VA facilities. \nI am concerned that this ban will not only undermine the Department's \ngoal of assisting disabled veterans in registering and voting, but will \nalso make it more difficult for these Americans to participate in the \npolitical process.\n  The Veterans Voting Support Act would address these concerns. This \nimportant measure would designate VA facilities as voter registration \nagencies, thereby ensuring that the Department actively offers veterans \nthe assistance they need to vote and register to vote. This provision \nwould also protect disabled veterans from being disenfranchised by a \nprocedural technicality. In addition, the bill provides our veterans \nwith information relating to the opportunity to request an absentee \nballot, ensure the ballots are available upon request, as well as \nprovide assistance in completing them.\n  It would also require a meaningful opportunity for nonpartisan groups \nand election officials to provide voter registration information and \nassistance at VA hospitals. The Department was founded on the principle \nthat its first duty to veterans was to meet their medical, social, and \ncivic needs, including the full participation of veterans in our \nsociety. As a corollary, this provision will strengthen that mandate \nand send an important message to our veterans: our country will make \nevery effort to ensure that those who sacrificed so much to expand \ndemocracy around the globe are involved in our democracy at home.\n  Finally, to ensure that the Department does not backslide from its \ncritical function of expanding the civic involvement of disabled \nveterans, the bill also provides reporting requirements to ensure that \nthe Department complies with this important goal.\n  The Nation's disabled veterans have given extraordinary service to \nour country. These courageous men and women deserve our help to ensure \nthat they receive the necessary assistance to guarantee their full \nparticipation in our democracy. I look forward to Senate passage of the \nVeterans Voting Support Act, and I hope the House and the President \nwill act quickly on this legislation to ensure the implementation of \nthis important measure in time for the upcoming national election.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S7076-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7076-S7077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 617--HONORING THE LIFE AND RECOGNIZING THE \n ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF ERIC NORD, CO-FOUNDER OF THE NORDSON CORPORATION, \n INNOVATIVE BUSINESSMAN AND ENGINEER, AND GENEROUS OHIO PHILANTHROPIST\n\n  Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nlegislation today that will leave no doubt about the constitutional \npropriety of the appointment of administrative patent judges and \nadministrative trademark judges within the Patent and Trademark Office. \nI thank my cosponsor, Senator Specter, for his work with me on this. \nThese judges are currently appointed to their positions by the Director \nof the PTO. Our bill will change this process, so that the Secretary of \nCommerce, in consultation with the Director of the PTO, will appoint \nthese judges, thus bringing the process more clearly in line with the \nappointments clause of the Constitution. This legislation will also \nallow the Secretary of Commerce to ratify the appointment of the \ncurrent judges. A companion bill was introduced in the House.\n  It is important to ensure that the decisions made by these judges are \nallowed to stand on their merits, and that they are not nullified by a \npotential constitutional challenge to the appointment process somewhere \ndown the line. By making this small change to the existing law, \nCongress can leave no doubt that the appointment of these judges \ncomplies fully with the process set out by the Constitution.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will adopt this measure today, and I \nhope that the House of Representatives will quickly take it up and pass \nit so that it can be sent to the President for his signature without \ndelay.\n  Mr. BROWN.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tom Lantos Block Burmese \n     JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of \n     citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and \n     students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against \n     rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and \n     repressive policies of the State Peace and Development \n     Council (SPDC), the ruling military regime in Burma--\n       (A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, \n     including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and\n       (B) to urge the regime to engage in meaningful dialogue to \n     pursue national reconciliation.\n       (2) The Burmese regime responded to these peaceful protests \n     with a violent crackdown leading to the reported killing of \n     approximately 200 people, including a Japanese \n     photojournalist, and hundreds of injuries. Human rights \n     groups further estimate that over 2,000 individuals have been \n     detained, arrested, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, or \n     otherwise intimidated as part of this crackdown. Burmese \n     military, police, and their affiliates in the Union \n     Solidarity Development Association (USDA) perpetrated almost \n     all of these abuses. The Burmese regime continues to detain, \n     torture, and otherwise intimidate those individuals whom it \n     believes participated in or led the protests and it has \n     closed down or otherwise limited access to several \n     monasteries and temples that played key roles in the peaceful \n     protests.\n       (3) The Department of State's 2006 Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices found that the SPDC--\n       (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, \n     assembly, association, religion, and movement;\n       (B) traffics in persons;\n       (C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;\n       (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\n       (E) commits other serious violations of human rights, \n     including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, \n     disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and \n     detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for \n     political motives.\n       (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or \n     held under house arrest for more than 12 years.\n       (5) In October 2007, President Bush announced a new \n     Executive Order to tighten economic sanctions against Burma \n     and block property and travel to the United States by certain \n     senior leaders of the SPDC, individuals who provide financial \n     backing for the SPDC, and individuals responsible for human \n     rights violations and impeding democracy in Burma. Additional \n     names were added in updates done on October 19, 2007, and \n     February 5, 2008. However, only 38 discrete individuals and \n     13 discrete companies have been designated under those \n     sanctions, once aliases and companies with similar names were \n     removed. By contrast, the Australian Government identified \n     more than 400 individuals and entities subject to its \n     sanctions applied in the wake of the 2007 violence. The \n     European Union's regulations to implement sanctions against \n     Burma have identified more than 400 individuals among the \n     leadership of government, the military, and the USDA, along \n     with nearly 1300 state and military-run companies potentially \n     subject to its sanctions.\n       (6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their \n     ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies, \n     and military activities in part through financial \n     transactions, travel, and trade involving the United States, \n     including the sale of petroleum products, gemstones and \n     hardwoods.\n       (7) In 2006, the Burmese regime earned more than $500 \n     million from oil and gas projects, over $500 million from \n     sale of hardwoods, and in excess of $300 million from the \n     sale of rubies and jade. At least $500 million of the $2.16 \n     billion earned in 2006 from Burma's two natural gas \n     pipelines, one of which is 28 percent owned by a United \n     States company, went to the Burmese regime. The regime has \n     earned smaller amounts from oil and gas exploration and non-\n     operational pipelines but United States investors are not \n     involved in those transactions. Industry sources estimate \n     that over $100 million annually in Burmese rubies and jade \n     enters the United States. Burma's official statistics report \n     that Burma exported $500 million in hardwoods in 2006 but \n     NGOs estimate the true figure to exceed $900 million. \n     Reliable statistics on the amount of hardwoods imported into \n     the United States from Burma in the form of finished products \n     are not available, in part due to widespread illegal logging \n     and smuggling.\n       (8) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the \n     Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Millions of \n     dollars in gemstones that are exported from Burma ultimately \n     enter the United States, but the Burmese regime attempts to \n     conceal the origin of the gemstones in an effort to evade \n     sanctions. For example, according to gem industry experts, \n     over 90 percent of the world's ruby supply originates in \n     Burma but only 3 percent of the rubies entering the United \n     States are claimed to be of Burmese origin. The value of \n     Burmese gemstones is predominantly based on their original \n     quality and geological origin, rather than the labor involved \n     in cutting and polishing the gemstones.\n       (9) According to hardwood industry experts, Burma is home \n     to approximately 60 percent of the world's native teak \n     reserves. More than \\1/4\\ of the world's internationally \n     traded teak originates from Burma, and hardwood sales, mainly \n     of teak, represent more than 11 percent of Burma's official \n     foreign exchange earnings.\n       (10) The SPDC owns a majority stake in virtually all \n     enterprises responsible for the extraction and trade of \n     Burmese natural resources, including all mining operations, \n     the Myanmar Timber Enterprise, the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, \n     the Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, and the Myanmar Oil and Gas \n     Enterprise. Virtually all profits from these enterprises \n     enrich the SPDC.\n       (11) On October 11, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council, with the consent of the People's Republic of China, \n     issued a statement condemning the violence in Burma, urging \n     the release of all political prisoners, and calling on the \n     SPDC to enter into a United Nations-mediated dialogue with \n     its political opposition.\n       (12) The United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari \n     traveled to Burma from September 29, 2007, through October 2, \n     2007, holding meetings with SPDC leader General Than Shwe and \n     democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi in an effort to promote \n     dialogue between the SPDC and democracy advocates.\n       (13) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive \n     to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, \n     the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the People's \n     Republic of China if they come under targeted economic \n     pressure that denies them access to personal wealth and \n     sources of revenue.\n       (14) On the night of May 2, 2008, through the morning of \n     May 3, 2008, tropical cyclone Nargis struck the coast of \n     Burma, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of \n     Burmese.\n       (15) The response to the cyclone by Burma's military \n     leaders illustrates their fundamental lack of concern for the \n     welfare of the Burmese people. The regime did little to warn \n     citizens of the cyclone, did not provide adequate \n     humanitarian assistance to address basic needs and prevent \n     loss of life, and continues to fail to provide life-\n     protecting and life-sustaining services to its people.\n       (16) The international community responded immediately to \n     the cyclone and attempted to provide humanitarian assistance. \n     More than 30 disaster assessment teams from 18 different \n     nations and the United Nations arrived in the region, but the \n     Burmese regime denied them permission to enter the country. \n     Eventually visas were granted to aid workers, but the regime \n     continues to severely limit their ability to provide \n     assistance in the affected areas.\n       (17) Despite the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis, the \n     junta went ahead with its referendum on a constitution \n     drafted by an illegitimate assembly, conducting voting in \n     unaffected areas on May 10, 2008, and in portions of the \n     affected Irrawaddy region and Rangoon on May 26, 2008.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Unocal case, and should consider granting refugee \n     status or humanitarian parole to these plaintiffs to enter \n     the United States consistent with existing United States law.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate Congressional committees a report on the status \n     of the Doe vs. Unocal plaintiffs and whether the plaintiffs \n     have been granted refugee status or humanitarian parole.\n\n     SEC. 15. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS IN \n                   BURMA'S OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.\n\n       (a) Findings and Declarations.--Congress finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Currently United States, French, and Thai investors are \n     engaged in the production and delivery of natural gas in the \n     pipeline from the Yadana and Sein fields (Yadana pipeline) in \n     the Andaman Sea, an enterprise which falls under the \n     jurisdiction of the Burmese Government, and United States \n     investment by Chevron represents approximately a 28 percent \n     nonoperated, working interest in that pipeline.\n       (2) The Congressional Research Service estimates that the \n     Yadana pipeline provides at least $500,000,000 in annual \n     revenue for the Burmese Government.\n       (3) The natural gas that transits the Yadana pipeline is \n     delivered primarily to Thailand, representing about 20 \n     percent of Thailand's total gas supply.\n       (4) The executive branch has in the past exempted \n     investment in the Yadana pipeline from the sanctions regime \n     against the Burmese Government.\n       (5) Congress believes that United States companies ought to \n     be held to a high standard of conduct overseas and should \n     avoid as much as possible acting in a manner that supports \n     repressive regimes such as the Burmese Government.\n       (6) Congress recognizes the important symbolic value that \n     divestment of United States holdings in Burma would have on \n     the international sanctions effort, demonstrating that the \n     United States will continue to lead by example.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--\n       (1) Congress urges Yadana investors to consider voluntary \n     divestment over time if the Burmese Government fails to take \n     meaningful steps to release political prisoners, restore \n     civilian constitutional rule and promote national \n     reconciliation.\n       (2) Congress will remain concerned with the matter of \n     continued investment in the Yadana pipeline in the years \n     ahead.\n       (3) Congress urges the executive branch to work with all \n     firms invested in Burma's oil and gas sector to use their \n     influence to promote the peaceful transition to civilian \n     democratic rule in Burma.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that so \n     long as Yadana investors remain invested in Burma, such \n     investors should--\n       (1) communicate to the Burmese Government, military and \n     business officials, at the highest levels, concern about the \n     lack of genuine consultation between the Burmese Government \n     and its people, the failure of the Burmese Government to use \n     its natural resources to benefit the\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\n     Burmese people, and the military's use of forced labor;\n       (2) publicly disclose and deal with in a transparent \n     manner, consistent with legal obligations, its role in any \n     ongoing investment in Burma, including its financial \n     involvement in any joint production agreement or other joint \n     ventures and the amount of their direct or indirect support \n     of the Burmese Government; and\n       (3) work with project partners to ensure that forced labor \n     is not used to construct, maintain, support, or defend the \n     project facilities, including pipelines, offices, or other \n     facilities.\n\n       Resolved further, That the House agree to the amendment of \n     the Senate to the title of the aforesaid bill with the \n     following:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment of the Senate to the title of the bill, amend the \n     title so as to read: ``An Act to impose sanctions on \n     officials of the State Peace and Development Council in \n     Burma, to amend the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 \n     to exempt humanitarian assistance from United States \n     sanctions on Burma, to prohibit the importation of gemstones \n     from Burma, or that originate in Burma, to promote a \n     coordinated international effort to restore civilian \n     democratic rule to Burma, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to note Senate passage of \nH.R. 3890, the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE, Junta's Anti-Democratic \nEfforts, Act. This is bipartisan legislation that is now on its way to \nthe President for his signature. In this effort, I was pleased to work \nclosely again with my friend and colleague, Senator Biden of Delaware.\n  This bill--appropriately named in honor of Tom Lantos, a great \nchampion of Burmese freedom and reconciliation--will further ratchet up \nthe already strict sanctions against the State Peace and Development \nCouncil, SPDC, the grotesquely misnamed ruling junta. In doing so, it \nwill restrict the importation of jade into the U.S. through other \ncountries, one of the most lucrative sources of profit for the junta. \nIt also enhances existing financial sanctions against the regime and \nincludes new reporting requirements which will provide greater \ntransparency about the junta. These reports include data about the \nSPDC's financial holdings; information about countries that provide \nmilitary assistance to the regime; and background on the Burmese timber \ntrade.\n  I would note that, like the annual Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, \nthis legislation does not interrupt the flow of humanitarian assistance \nto the people of Burma, who continue to struggle in the wake of Cyclone \nNargis. By focusing the sanctions on the SPDC, this bill sends a clear \nmessage to the junta that the United States stands squarely with the \nfreedom-loving people of Burma.\n  As my colleagues can tell you, passing legislation sometimes means \nyou don't get everything you want. I have been on record for over a \ndecade as supporting the divestment of U.S. energy interests in Burma. \nI would have preferred it if Congress had taken binding action in this \nbill to compel divestment, but including such a provision would have \nthreatened passage of this important legislation. Nonetheless, I would \npoint out that Congress makes its position on the issue quite clear by \nencouraging the voluntary divestment of all energy companies operating \nin Burma.\n  Finally, I would also like to express my appreciation for all those \nwho have worked diligently on this legislation. In particular, I would \nlike to thank Frank Jannuzi and Keith Luse of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee staff for their efforts.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendments, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/22/senate-section/article/S7084-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7084-S7087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     NOMINATION OF CATHY SEIBEL TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF GLENN T. SUDDABY TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 689 and 690, and that the Senate proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of the nominations; that upon confirmation of the \nnominations, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, with no \nfurther motions in order, that any statements relating to the \nnominations be printed in the Record, and that the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate is poised to confirm two \nmore nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench: Cathy \nSeibel for the Southern District of New York and Glenn T. Suddaby for \nthe Northern District of New York. These nominees each have the support \nof the New York Senators, who worked with the White House to identify a \nslate of consensus nominees. I thank both Senator Schumer and Senator \nClinton for their work in connection with these nominees.\n  When these nominees are confirmed, that will bring the number of \njudicial nominees confirmed by the Senate during the slightly more than \nthree years I have served as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to \n158. Coincidentally, the number of President Bush's judicial nominees \nconfirmed by the Senate during the almost four and one-half years of \nRepublican control totaled 158.\n  I have always said that we would treat this President's nominees more \nfairly than Republicans treated President Clinton's. And we have. \nIndeed, we have matched the confirmation record that Republicans \nachieved for a President from their own party. We have not pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of this President's nominees. We are not \ngoing to return 17 circuit court nominees without action to this \nPresident as the Republican-led Senate did to President Clinton. We \nhave not doubled the judicial vacancies and forced them above 100 \nnationwide, nor have we doubled the number of circuit court vacancies. \nTo the contrary, we have cut judicial vacancies by more than half, and \nreduced circuit court vacancies by more than two-thirds from a high \npoint of 32, to a low of just nine throughout all 13 Federal circuits.\n  The 100 nominations we confirmed in only 17 months in 2001 and 2002, \nwhile working with a most uncooperative White House, reduced the \nvacancies by 45 percent by the end of 2002. With 40 additional \nconfirmations last year, and another 18 this year, the Senate under \nDemocratic leadership has now confirmed 158 lifetime appointments to \nthe Federal bench nominated by President Bush. Nearly half of the \njudicial nominees the Senate has confirmed while I have served as the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee have filled vacancies classified by \nthe Administrative Office of the Courts as judicial emergency \nvacancies. Eighteen of the 27 circuit court nominees confirmed while I \nhave chaired the committee filled judicial emergency vacancies, \nincluding nine of the 10 circuit court nominees confirmed this \nCongress. This is another aspect of the problem created by Republicans \nthat we have worked hard to improve. When President Bush took office \nthere were 28 judicial emergency vacancies. Those have been reduced by \nmore than half.\n  In the 2 full years that preceded my returning as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in 2007, with a Republican chairman and a \nRepublican Senate majority working to confirm the judicial nominees of \na Republican President, 54 nominations were confirmed. After the two \nconfirmations today, we will reach 58 judicial confirmations for this \nCongress. Truth be told, President Bush's judicial nominees have been \nconfirmed faster by the Democratic majority than by the previous \nRepublican majority of the Senate.\n  Judicial vacancies have been reduced from 10 percent as we made the \ntransition to the Bush administration to 4.5 percent today. I wish we \ncould say the same about unemployment, the cost of gasoline, food \nprices, health care costs, about inflation and the national debt, but \nall those indicators have been moving in the wrong direction, as is \nconsumer confidence and the percentage of Americans who see the country \nas on the wrong track.\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\n  Republican critics ignore the progress we have made on judicial \nvacancies. They also ignore the crisis that they had created by not \nconsidering circuit nominees in 1996, 1997 and 1998. They ignore the \nfact that they refused to confirm a single circuit nominee during the \nentire 1996 session. They ignore the fact that they returned 17 circuit \ncourt nominees without action to the White House in 2000. They ignore \nthe public criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist to their actions during \nthose years. They ignore the fact that they were responsible for more \nthan doubling circuit court vacancies during their pocket filibusters \nof Clinton nominees or that we have reduced those circuit court \nvacancies by more than two thirds.\n  In fact, as the Presidential elections in 2000 drew closer, and when \nthe judicial vacancy rate stood at 7.2 percent, then-Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Orrin Hatch declared that ``There is and has been no \njudicial vacancy crisis,'' and that 7.2 percent was a ``rather low \npercentage of vacancies that shows the judiciary is not suffering from \nan overwhelming number of vacancies.'' As a result of Republican \ninaction, the vacancy rate continued to rise, reaching 10 percent when \nthe Democrats took over the Senate majority in 2001.\n  Democrats have reversed course. We have cut circuit court vacancies \nby more than two-thirds, from a high of 32. With the confirmation of \ntwo nominees today, the judicial vacancy rate will be just 4.5 percent.\n  I have yet to hear praise from a single Republican for our work in \nlowering vacancies. I also have yet to hear in the Republican talking \npoints any explanation for their actions during the 1996 congressional \nsession, when the Republican Senate majority refused to allow the \nSenate to confirm even one circuit court judge. I have yet to hear \nexplanations for why they did not proceed with the nominations of \nBonnie Campbell, Allen Snyder and so many others.\n  I hope the American people will not witness another week in which \nSenate Republicans attempt to make a partisan, election-year issue out \nof the confirmation of judicial nominations. This is the one area where \nthe numbers have actually improved during the Bush presidency while the \nlife of hardworking Americans has only gotten more difficult. The \nTreasury Secretary has been quite sobering about the financial \ndifficulties still ahead. Inflation is now on the rise, jobs are being \nlost, gas prices have skyrocketed, food prices have soared, health care \nis unaffordable and yet Republicans want come to the floor to pick a \npartisan fight about the pace of judicial confirmations while the \nSenate proceeds to confirm two more judges.\n\n  Americans have seen the unemployment rate rise to 5.5 percent and \ntrillions of dollars in budget surplus have turned into trillions of \ndollars of debt. Last week General Motors announced layoffs. The annual \nbudget deficit is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the dollar \nhas lost half its value, and the costs of the Iraq war and interest on \nthe national debt amounts to $1.5 billion a day.\n  When President Bush took office, the price of gas was $1.42 a gallon. \nToday, it is over $4.00 a gallon. The housing crisis and mortgage \ncrisis threatens the economy. The stock market dropped 2,000 points in \nthe first six months of the year and went under 11,000.\n  Hardworking Americans trying to do the best they can for their \nfamilies are more concerned about critical issues they face in their \nlives each day. They are concerned about affording to heat their homes \nthis winter. They are concerned about gas prices that have skyrocketed \nso high they do not know how they will afford to drive to work. They \nare concerned about the steepest decline in home values in two decades. \nMore and more Americans are affected by rising unemployment, with job \nlosses for the first six consecutive months of this year tallying over \n438,000. Americans are worried about soaring health care costs, rising \nhealth insurance costs, the rising costs of education and rising food \nprices. The partisan, election-year rhetoric over judicial nominations, \nat a time when judicial vacancies have been significantly reduced, is a \nreflection of misplaced priorities.\n  Our progress today in confirming two more nominations for lifetime \nappointments shows that when the President works with home State \nSenators to identify consensus, well-qualified nominees, we can make \nprogress, even this late in an election year. I congratulate the \nnominees and their families on their confirmations today.\n  The Federal judiciary is the one arm of our Government that should \nnever be political or politicized, regardless of who sits in the White \nHouse. I will continue in this Congress, and with a new President in \nthe next Congress, to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle \nto ensure that the Federal judiciary remains independent and able to \nprovide justice to all Americans, without fear or favor.\n  Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee was scheduled to consider a \nnumber of bipartisan measures. Several are important items on which \nRepublicans had already delayed consideration since June. They include \nthe bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act, a bipartisan OPEN FOIA bill and the bipartisan William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. In \naddition, we had before us the Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration \nAct, the Fugitive Information Networked Database Act, the \nMethamphetamine Production Prevention Act and the National Guard and \nReservists Debt Relief Act.\n  I had hoped that last week we would be able to report these measures. \nA few words about one of them--the legislation to reauthorize the \nWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This bill would \nstrengthen our efforts to stop the abhorrent practice of human \ntrafficking around the world. Our bill enhances protections for victims \nof these terrible crimes. Human trafficking is a modern-day form of \nslavery, involving victims who are forced, defrauded or coerced into \nsexual or labor exploitation. These practices continue to victimize \nhundreds of thousands around the world, mostly women and children, and \nwe must do all that we can to be more effective in confronting this \ncontinuing problem. I thank Senator Biden for his leadership. \nUnfortunately, Republican partisan antics have gotten in the way of \nprogress on this front and delayed the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate from acting on this measure.\n  Rather than meet and work on the human trafficking bill and the \nothers, a number of the Republican Senators who serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee came to the Senate floor while Republicans objected to the \ncommittee meeting. That was too bad. It set back our legislative \nagenda.\n  Republicans previously boycotted business meetings for the month of \nFebruary when we were trying to report judicial nominations. That only \nslowed our progress. Then, when we tried to expedite consideration of \ntwo circuit court nominations in May, they objected. Those judicial \nnominations were finally confirmed late in June.\n  I look forward to a time when Senators from the other side of the \naisle return to work with us on the important legislative business of \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Senate. It would be refreshing if they \nrecognized the progress we have made on filling judicial vacancies.\n  When they do, when they show cooperation, when we are able to make \nprogress on our legislative agenda, at that point I will be able to \nturn my attention from concentrating on that legislative agenda and \nconsider, along with the majority leader, whether there are additional \njudicial nominees we might be able to consider and confirm this year. \nIt will be difficult to do so, especially in connection with nominees \nrecently received for whom we do not have an ABA peer review rating at \nthis time.\n  Let me give you some flavor of how petty the obstructionism from \nRepublicans has become. I introduced at the request of the Chief \nJustice a bill to extend authorization for the Supreme Court police to \nremain in operation, S. 3296. I have been trying to clear this measure \nfor passage since June 19. Although our Ranking Republican on the \nCommittee cosponsored, he has not been able to clear it on his side of \nthe aisle.\n  I have been seeking for months to find a way to extend the EB-5 \ninvestor visa pilot program that brings benefits\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\nnot only to Vermont but to Pennsylvania and Iowa, and elsewhere. \nAuthority for this worthwhile program that leads to investments here in \nthe United States expires in September. My efforts to clear H.R. 5569, \na bill to extend the program for 5 years, have been stymied by \nRepublicans who insist on using this bill as a vehicle for other \nimmigration-related matters and have ensnarled it in a series of \ncompeting concerns.\n\n  More broadly, the Judiciary Committee has worked throughout this \nCongress to advance the priorities of Americans. We have reported \nlegislation to support local law enforcement to make our cities and \ntowns safe from crime that has now gone back up after consistent \ndeclines in the 1990s, like the COPS Improvements Act, S. 368, and my \nbill to extend the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 2511. We \nhave reported legislation to combat fraud and corruption, like the War \nProfiteering Prevention Act, S. 119, and the Public Corruption \nProsecution Improvements Act, S. 1946. We have reported legislation to \nprotect the civil rights and voting rights of Americans, like the \nEmmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, S. 535, and Senator \nObama's Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of \n2007, S. 453. We have reported legislation to protect Americans' data \nprivacy like my Personal Data Privacy and Security Act, S. 495. We have \nreported measures to provide the Federal judiciary with increased \nresources both in terms of salary restoration and additional \njudgeships, S. 1638 and S. 2774. We have reported intellectual property \nmeasures like the Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act, S. 2913. And, of \ncourse, we have reported the bill to confront the OPEC cartel, NOPEC, \nS. 879. I look forward to a time when Republicans work with us on these \nmatters instead of obstructing us at every turn.\n  Legislation with broad bipartisan support that I have managed to move \nthrough the Judiciary Committee has then been stalled on the Senate \nfloor by the obstruction of a few Republicans. Of the bills that have \nbeen reported from the Judiciary Committee this Congress, Republicans \nhave blocked legislation to support runaway and homeless young people, \nS. 2982; to help law enforcement cope with mentally ill offenders, S. \n2304; to support the investigation and prosecution of civil rights era \nmurders left unsolved for too long, S. 535; and to protect our children \nfrom the scourges of drugs, child pornography, and child exploitation, \nsuch as S. 1210, S. 1738 and S. 2344. I joined the Majority Leader in \nintroducing a measure yesterday that combines some of these Committee-\napproved and House-passed bipartisan measures into one bill, S. 3297. \nThese should have been consent items and already been considered and \npassed by the Senate.\n  The list goes on. I say, again, Republican obstructionists have \nblocked legislation to ensure that law enforcement officers can obtain \nbulletproof vests, to give much needed resources to State and local law \nenforcement, to break the grip of the OPEC cartel on oil prices, to \nprohibit war profiteering, to train prosecutors, and to teach children \nto use the internet safely, just to reiterate a few examples. And that \nis just legislation reported by the Judiciary Committee. Every \nCommittee in the Senate has seen simple legislation intended to help \nthe American people in difficult times stymied by Republican \nobstruction.\n  Republicans have become masters of true obstruction, boycotting \nbusiness meetings of the Judiciary Committee and cutting short \nimportant hearings, including a hearing at which two courageous women \nfrom Pennsylvania were testifying about severe injuries they suffered \nto help us understand the plight of hardworking Americans whose \nlegitimate grievances have been rejected by a pro-business Supreme \nCourt. When Republicans obstructed a meeting last week where we could \nhave made progress on reducing youth violence, protecting women and \nchildren from human trafficking, and helping those who serve our \ncountry to cope with unmanageable debt, that was just the latest \nexample of a pattern that has become all too familiar.\n  Sadly, we have seen Republican obstructionism since the beginning of \nthis Congress, with Republicans using filibuster after filibuster to \nthwart the will of the majority of the Senate from doing the business \nof the American people. Republican filibusters prevented Senate \nmajorities from passing the climate change bill; the Employee Free \nChoice Act; the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; the DC Voting Rights Act; \nthe Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of \n2007; the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008; the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008; and the Consumer-\nFirst Energy Act.\n  These are critical pieces of legislation to address urgent priorities \nlike the energy crisis, the environment, voting rights, health care, \nand fair wages for working men and women. All of them had the support \nof the majority of the Senate. And all were blocked by a minority of \nRepublican Senators bent on preventing us from making progress. \nRepublicans have now filibustered more than 80 pieces of legislation in \nthis Congress. We can only imagine what we could have accomplished in \nthis Congress with cooperation rather than obstruction.\n  This long list of priorities unaddressed because of the Republicans \nin Congress would be even longer if we were to include the many \nimportant bills President Bush has vetoed since the beginning of this \nCongress. This list includes legislation to fund stem cell research to \nfight debilitating and deadly diseases, to extend and expand the \nsuccessful State Children's Health Insurance Program that would have \nprovided health insurance to more of the millions of American children \nwithout it, to set a timetable for bringing American troops home from \nthe disastrous war in Iraq, and to ban waterboarding and help restore \nAmerica as a beacon for the rule of law.\n  The American people are going through increasingly difficult times, \nand their Congress should be working to make their lives better. Time \nis running short in this Congress. It is past time for Republicans to \nstop their foot stomping and work with us to get things done. That is \nwhat I have been trying to do throughout this Congress. I hope, despite \ntheir recent antics, that Republicans will reconsider and join with me \nto make progress on legislative matters of concern to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of two nominees to be \ndistrict judges in the Southern and Northern Districts of New York.\n  I was pleased last week that the Senate voted unanimously to confirm \ntwo other excellent New York nominees, Kiyo Matsumoto and Paul \nGardephe.\n  Like last week's candidates, both of the nominees before us today--\nCathy Seibel and Glenn Suddaby--were rated unanimously well qualified \nby the American Bar Association, and both were unanimously recommended \nout of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am particularly pleased to support Ms. Seibel to be a judge in the \nSouthern District of New York because I personally recommended her to \nthe President.\n  The Judges in her district respect her, the defense bar knows her to \nbe fair and reasonable. and I myself found her to be thoughtful, \nmodest, and blessed with a perfect judicial temperament.\n  These are the qualities that compelled me to recommend her to the \nbench.\n  Ms. Seibel has been a Federal prosecutor for 21 years and has long \nties to the Southern District of New York where she has served as both \nthe deputy U.S. attorney and the first assistant.\n  During her time as a prosecutor, she has earned a reputation for \nfairness and effectiveness.\n  Indeed, she is described as the very model of grace under pressure.\n  And while at the Southern District, she has trained several \ngenerations of young prosecutors, who also sing her praises.\n  She has prosecuted a number of high-profile tax fraud cases, as well \nas the very first case where the Violence Against Women Act was used \nfor a murder charge--a subject obviously very close to my heart since I \nwas the chief author of the Violence Against Women Act when I was in \nthe House.\n  She is the recipient of numerous well-deserved honors, including the \nprestigious Stimson Medal for federal prosecutors in New York.\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\n  Despite the demands on her time as a prosecutor, Ms. Seibel has also \nfound time to teach a course on trial practice at Columbia Law School, \nand previously has taught courses at Fordham.\n  Ms. Seibel graduated magna cum laude from Princeton and received her \nJ.D. cum laude from Fordham University, where she was editor-in-chief \nof the Fordham Law Review. Ms. Seibel also clerked for Judge Joseph \nMcLaughlin in the Eastern District after graduation.\n  Additionally, Ms. Seibel's confirmation will help to rectify the \nserious underrepresentation of women in our Federal judiciary.\n  In the Southern District today, only a paltry 25 percent of district \ncourt judges--11 of 44--are women. I believe that our Federal bench \nshould reflect the same broad diversity of experience as America writ \nlarge.\n  Glass ceilings are abhorrent, but they especially have no place in \nour Federal courthouses, where every citizen is held as equal before \nthe law.\n  Ms. Seibel's confirmation will be an important step to remedying an \nunfortunate gender gap in one of the country's most important courts.\n  Finally I would like to say a few words in favor of Mr. Glenn \nSuddaby, a nominee for the Northern District of New York.\n  Mr. Suddaby has been a U.S. attorney since 2002, but his ties to the \nNorthern District go back much further than that. He received his B.A. \nfrom State University of New York at Plattsburgh, then received his law \ndegree from Syracuse University. Mr. Suddaby then began his long career \nas a prosecutor in Onondaga County before joining the U.S. attorney's \noffice.\n  Between college and law school, Mr. Suddaby even spent time as a \nlegislative aide in the New York State Assembly, so he also has \nexperience shaping the law from inside the halls of a legislature. I \nthink its a good idea to have more judges with a little experience \nwriting the law, and not only enforcing it and interpreting it.\n  Mr. Suddaby has worked especially hard to target corruption in his \ndistrict, and has demonstrated his commitment to placing the rule of \nlaw ahead of ideology.\n  Both of these nominees will make excellent judges who will be \nimpartial and thoughtful guardians of our legal tradition. I urge my \ncolleagues to support them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the nomination.\n  The legislative read the nomination of Cathy Seibel, of New York, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
