Mr. President, I think it is important to let all Senators \nknow that we worked very hard, late into the night, with significant \nmembers of the Senate staff. We worked very hard. In fact, I got home a \nlittle bit after midnight this morning, as did others.\n  We are going to have a couple of votes this evening. The first vote \nwe are going to take is our housing bill, a bill that would help \nfamilies struggling\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\nto keep their homes and families struggling with the foreclosure \ncrisis--and it is a crisis. The second piece of legislation we are \ngoing to vote on is called PEPFAR, an initiative introduced by \nPresident Bush in 2003 to confront the crisis in Africa, the continent-\nwide problem we have dealing with HIV/AIDS, where 8,000 people are \ndying from AIDS every day on that continent. That is a death toll that \ndoesn't take vacations. They are dying today and they are dying \ntomorrow. It is a weekend, but that doesn't matter; holidays are not a \nday off. People continue to die. That is what this legislation is \nabout, to try to stem the tide of this scourge which has swept that \ncontinent.\n  Both these bills, the housing bill and the AIDS bill, rightfully have \nthe support of virtually all Democrats and a significant number of \nRepublicans. Both these bills could have long since been passed and \nsent to the President's desk and we could have been on other important \npriorities, such as the energy crisis. I say that with regard to \nhousing. I say that with regard to the legislation I talked about \ndealing with PEPFAR. They both could have been passed a long time ago.\n  We now have a situation--I am looking for a chart here. I don't know \nwhat happened to it. I would say there is a hunt going on in the \ncloakroom for our chart. We have a few stacked back there. Maybe one of \nthe Republican staff stole it.\n  I don't know what happened to it, but let's pretend I have a chart \nhere that says ``82 Republican filibusters.'' Remember, this is our \nVelcro chart, and you can just peel off the numbers. Here is what we \nhave. We have the Velcro pieces but no chart.\n  Let's just pretend we have a great big white chart here and the \nVelcro. See my Velcro? Just pop it on here. It doesn't work. It won't \nwork--well, it is working. It looked a lot better when we had our chart \nbefore. Somebody swiped it.\n  We started in the 50s, and they keep adding up, and now it is 82. \nEvery one of those filibusters has taken huge amounts of time from the \nSenate. After cloture is invoked, under the rules of the Senate you \nhave 30 hours where basically you can do nothing except wait for the 30 \nhours to go by with a few speeches. Think about it, 82 times 30--\nsometimes the 30 hours wasn't used, but most of the time it was in an \neffort to obstruct and delay. That is what we have had in the housing \nbill, and that is what is happening now on this global AIDS piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is a small number of people holding up these matters, but it is \nstill the Republicans holding them up. Because of the obstructionism we \nhad on these two matters last night, we worked, as I indicated, until \nmidnight. We thought we had an agreement worked out which would have \nallowed us to proceed, but one Senator prevented us from doing this. \nBecause of that, our bipartisan negotiations late into the night were \nall for nothing.\n  Today, we must hold an unnecessary set of votes that could have been \nagreed to by unanimous consent. No Senator is complaining because we \nhave to be here on Friday. We work when we have to work. But it is just \na question of what we should be doing while we are here. We could have \nbeen doing other things, but we are here today. We are going to vote on \na couple of votes that are unnecessary. We could have been doing other \nthings. We could have spent the time constructively, as I indicated, on \nother matters.\n  It is interesting to note that the Senator who has held this up and \nother Republican Senators--they have been coming to the floor all week \ncriticizing the Senate for not moving to address the energy crisis. But \none reason we are not moving forward on a lot of other things, \nincluding the energy crisis facing this country, is because we have \nbeen held up on so many different bills.\n  Everyone should know that this is a record that has broken any other \ntime in the history of our country. This is filibuster on steroids. \nThis is the Flo-Jo of filibusters--the great runner. She broke all \nrecords. We are breaking all records. If the American people wonder why \nCongress has not passed yet another piece of legislation to help ease \nthe energy crisis, the housing crisis, and the many other problems \nfacing this country, they need look no further than this number 82, \nright here. If anyone wonders why the American people are frustrated \nwith Congress, all they need to do is look at the number 82.\n  Despite these setbacks, this has been a productive week in the \nSenate. Since the filibusters--plural--have started on the housing \nlegislation, there have been about 130,000 new foreclosures filed. \nEvery legal workday, usually Monday through Friday when the courthouses \nare open, people are filing 8,500 new foreclosures on homes around the \ncountry. That is a lot of foreclosures. We should have worked on this \nhousing bill long ago, and we tried to, but we were held up by the \nRepublican filibusters. We have legislation we are going to vote on \nthis afternoon at 5:20 that will help struggling homeowners and prevent \nconditions that led to the foreclosure crisis happening in the first \nplace. So we have done that.\n  Here, Wednesday afternoon, a vote started at 4 o'clock, one of the \nmost historic times in the history of this institution, one of the most \nhistoric times in the 230 years-plus of our country being in existence. \nWhat was that? We, America, have a lot of wonderful programs. The most \nsuccessful social program in the history of the world is Social \nSecurity, a program that helps those in their golden years with an old-\nage pension check. Social Security helps the disabled, it helps widows, \nit helps orphans. It is a wonderful program--that President Bush wanted \nto privatize. Think about that. Had we been unsuccessful in stopping \nhis privatization, how do you think Social Security recipients would \nfeel today with the stock market going down, down, down? It would have \nbeen a terrible decision for the American people.\n  The other program the President doesn't like is Medicare. Medicare is \nnot a program as successful as Social Security. It is an imperfect \nprogram, but it is a good program. It is a program I have seen in my \npolitical life. My first elected political job was chairman of the \nboard of trustees of Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. When I took \nthat job, 40 percent of the seniors who were admitted to that hospital \nhad no way of paying their bill. When I left, Medicare had come into \nbeing, and 100 percent of the people who were old, coming to that \nhospital, had their health insurance taken care of through Medicare. It \nis an imperfect but good program. President Bush does not like the \nprogram. He has tried to privatize it.\n  What happened Wednesday afternoon at 4 o'clock? The program was \nsaved. The program was saved by virtue of a courageous man named Ted \nKennedy who got out of his sickbed, literally, to come here and cast \nthe deciding vote. His was the 60th vote that allowed us to move \nforward and, I repeat, save Social Security.\n  Senator Kennedy was a Senator when Medicare came into existence. He \nsaid that he would not let it fail, even though we all know it was very \ndangerous to him, from a health perspective, to fly from Boston down \nhere and then have to fly back after the vote was cast.\n  But it was a productive week, because not only did he cast the vote \nthat made passage of the bill, but as a result of that, courageous \nRepublicans, realizing he had done what had not been done, stepped \nforward and said, you know, the President has done enough. We have \nbacked him long enough. We are going to vote the right way.\n  So we had the original nine, plus nine more. We had 18 Republicans, \nfar more than enough to override a Presidential veto. I hope the \nPresident does not veto this bill. I hope he does not. But I am \ngrateful to Senator Kennedy, as are all the American people. We have \nrules. It is against Senate rules for the people in Galleries to clap. \nNo one could stop them. No one could stop Senators from clapping, \ncheering, and crying for the act Senator Kennedy performed.\n  So we did that. We are going to, this afternoon, pass the housing \nbill and send it back to the House. We also completed FISA legislation. \nI did not agree with the result, but it was an accomplishment for this \nbody to finally work its way through all the problems we had \nprocedurally to get that complete.\n  Now, I would hope with the Medicare bill being saved by Senator \nKennedy,\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nPresident Bush does not veto that. Every day that goes by that he does \nnot sign that bill, people in America are suffering. They are suffering \nbecause doctors are going to drop out of the system. As we know, \npatients will not be taken care of, veterans, whose funding and \nreimbursement is based upon Medicare, who are part of the TRICARE \nsystem, about 8 million servicemen and their families, are being denied \nthose benefits.\n  So the President should not do this simply because he wants to \nprivatize Medicare. He is not going to win; he is going to lose that \nbattle. So why does he want to do that? We had 355 votes in the House, \n69 in the Senate, enough to override the veto. So I call upon the \nPresident to not veto this bill; sign it so we can get this worked out, \nand we will end this situation once and for all.\n  We have talked about the global AIDS bill. We are moving ahead with \nthis legislation. It continues the support for America's efforts to \njoin the world community in fighting against this disaster we have on \nthat continent, global HIV/AIDS, which is so pronounced in that \ncontinent.\n  President Bush has worked with Democrats and Republicans to help get \nthis legislation passed, over the objections last night of one person, \nperhaps a small handful urging this one man on. Despite that, I am \nconfidant we are going to pass this legislation.\n  I should mention how glad my fellow Democrats and I were to have our \nnominee for President here to cast a vote on these important bills. \nSenator Obama understood the importance of the Medicare legislation, \nand he stepped down here and voted. But for him we would not have had \nthe necessary votes to pass this. He was also here when the GI bill of \nrights came up, landmark legislation, repaying our valiant troops who \nfought in Iraq and Afghanistan and deserve the same rights to be \neducated as those World War II veterans.\n  Senator Barack Obama was here to vote on that. On the FISA \nlegislation, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation, \nBarack Obama cast his vote on that legislation. John McCain did not.\n  The American people should also know that despite the delay tactics \nwe have seen this week that have kept us from a debate on energy, \nDemocrats and most all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, are \ncommitted to addressing the energy crisis with both long- and short-\nterm solutions.\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. We all acknowledge much \nneeds to be done. Last night I held a meeting a few feet out of this \nSenate Chamber. I had a productive meeting--We had former Senator Jim \nSasser, who was conducting the meeting--Senator Sasser of Tennessee, \nchairman of the Budget Committee, subcommittee chairman of \nAppropriations, subcommittee chair on Banking, one of America's great \nSenators. He was an Ambassador to China when his Senate career came to \nan end.\n  He was there as a moderator. We had the director of Global Oil \nGroup--the Yergin Group. He has written books on the situation with \npetroleum around the world. We had the chief executive officer of \nUnited Airlines. Keep in mind, this man has been president of Texaco, \nthe vice chairman of Chevron, and now the chief executive officer of \nUnited. If anyone should have an understanding of what is going on with \nour energy markets, our business community, he should. He was \ntremendous in outlining this information for us.\n  We had the head of global commodities at JPMorgan, the portfolio \nmanager of Masters Capital Management, the CEO of NYMEX, and a \nprofessor at the University of Maryland School of Law. His expertise is \nin this area. It was a very good meeting. It lasted a long time.\n  The group strongly agreed we must take steps to stem speculation in \nenergy prices. Is speculation the only problem? Of course not. But is \nspeculation a problem? Of course it is. This group agreed that \nspeculators drive up prices for their own gain, while the American \npeople are left feeling the pain.\n  It was agreed that now is the appropriate time for President Bush to \ndraw oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as his father did. It \nwas also agreed we must increase domestic oil production in the 68 \nmillion acres of land that oil companies currently lease but are not \nusing.\n  The group agreed that any oil drilled in America should be sold to \nthe America marketplace, not to China, Japan, India, as is currently \nhappening. By the way, when there was a vote on this, Senator McCain \nvoted that it was not necessary, that American oil produced be used by \nAmericans. He, by his vote, indicated it could be used in other \ncountries. We disagree. The group disagreed last night.\n  So we need to take steps curtailing energy speculation, we need to \ntap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we need to increase the supply in \nthe 68 million leased but unused acres in America, and earmarking \ndomestic oil for American consumers.\n  We also agreed last night that combined with increased and sustained \ninvestment in clean alternative fuel sources, the wind, the Sun and \ngeothermal, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, will \nstrengthen the economy and improve our environment.\n  If we do all of these, will we solve all the energy problems? Of \ncourse not. But we will have a significantly strong step in that \ndirection. That is our roadmap for going forward. We hope both the \nRepublican leader and his caucus will work with us to reject \nobstruction and embrace the progress that the American people deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6585-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6585-S6595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to disagree to the two \namendments of the House which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A message from the House of Representatives to accompany \n     H.R. 3221, an act to provide needed housing reform, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Wyoming yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. ENZI. I would.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Wyoming concludes his remarks that I be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Aids Relief\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have been waiting to speak and listening \nto the Senate leader. I have to say, I am a little disappointed. In the \n20 minutes' worth of remarks, I did not hear anything that would bring \nthe two sides together. Instead, I saw wedges being driven in there. \nThis is not the time when we need wedges. That is the reason the public \nopinion of Congress is at an alltime low. There are things we need to \nget together on. That is one of the things I am going to talk about \nnow.\n  I rise to express my support for the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde \nUnited States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.\n  That is a mouthful, so we are referring to it as PEPFAR, which stands \nfor the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which is something \nwe passed several years ago that has made a significant difference in \nthe world. Simply put, this legislation is proof of the fact that the \nUnited States continues to put its money where its mouth is on all \nthese terrible diseases; that is, leading the best way by example. By \nso doing, we are encouraging other countries to do their part and help \nto ease the devastating toll of these diseases on the less fortunate.\n  In 2003, the Congress passed and the President signed into law the \nfirst global AIDS bill. I remember when the President addressed us in \nthe State of the Union speech that year and announced he wanted $15 \nbillion to go into solving the AIDS problem worldwide. I think it was \nactually a shock on both sides of the aisle. But we went to work and we \nworked together and we got a plan that has been in effect.\n  We made an aggressive commitment to work with other governments to \nhelp them take action and to try to\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\ncontrol the spread of HIV/AIDS in their country.\n  When we began our work on this bill and started to discuss the need \nfor a program that would address the spread of HIV/AIDS overseas, many \nhad doubts that we could reach the goals we had set. There were some \nwho thought we were reaching too far too fast and that we could never \ncome close to making the kind of impact to which we had committed \nourselves.\n  Fortunately, we have succeeded beyond what many thought was possible. \nSince the program has been implemented, our community outreach \nactivities that were designed to begin the process of prevention by \neducation have reached nearly 61.5 million people. Although there is \nstill much more to be done, we are finding that we have turned the \ncorner from the fear and frustration that was so prevalent in the past \nto a brighter avenue of hope and the promise of an even better \ntomorrow.\n  When I visited Africa in March, I was able to see the progress that \nhas been made over the years. While we have not reached all the goals \nwe set back then, we are coming closer to them day by day. My recent \nvisit to Africa reminded me of what I saw when I first visited that \ncontinent about 5 years ago. During the first visit, I learned a great \ndeal about diseases such as AIDS and how the culture of the nations we \nvisited had a great impact on how the diseases spread.\n  HIV is a great problem because it can lie dormant for many years \nwhile it is being transmitted. It was clear back then that solving the \nproblem would take more money. It would take in-country leadership and \nthe political will to solve the problem before it became totally \nunmanageable. That is where we were headed. I am pleased to say I got \nto meet with several of the First Ladies of the African countries who \nhave banded together, 51 of them banded together to work together as a \nnetwork to solve this problem. They are doing a phenomenal job in \nAfrica, and they are working with our First Lady; I am pretty sure that \nthey talk to our First Lady and our First Lady talks to the President. \nThe President, this year, said: We need to double our effort.\n  We have the framework in place. We can do it. We need to do it. That \nis what this bill is about, doubling our effort. The solution began \nwith making simple changes to the resources available to each \ncommunity, things we take for granted, such as a safe and secure water \nsupply, as well as nutrition programs, about basic buildings, and the \npeople who have the training that communities need to maintain these \nfacilities.\n  That all happens over here. It does not happen over there. Back then \nwe had the treatments to keep AIDS patients functioning for years. What \nwe needed to do was provide these treatments and be sure they were \nbeing properly used.\n  Our hope during that time was that we could keep mothers alive long \nenough to raise their children. Our greatest hope was that we could \nkeep everyone alive long enough for a cure to be found.\n  As we toured those countries, we witnessed a treatment that was \ndesigned to prevent a mother's AIDS infection from being passed on to \nher newborn baby during birth, because of birth. There is a pill the \nmother could take and a liquid that can be administered to the baby \nimmediately after birth that had a 95-percent success rate.\n  The treatment only costs $2.50 per birth. The problem was that most \ndeliveries don't take place in hospitals. Only the difficult ones take \nplace in the hospital. So how do you distribute the medication to these \nexpectant mothers so it would be available during birth, which is the \ncritical time for preventing transmission? Of course, anybody who was \ncarrying that pill would be labeled HIV-positive, and that was creating \nanother set of problems because of the stigma attached to the disease. \nIn addition, other relatives would try to steal the pill because they \nthought it was a wonder drug that would prevent them from catching \nAIDS.\n  As we traveled through Africa, one aspect of the disease I will never \nforget had to do with the economies of these nations. In each one, the \nfastest growing business was funeral parlors and coffin makers. In \nNamibia, since they did not have enough wood to go around, people were \nsaving newspapers so they could make coffins out of papier mache. That \nwas 5 years ago.\n  Since my visit to Africa and passage of the PEPFAR bill, we have \naccomplished things that many thought impossible. In 2003, only 50,000 \npeople living with HIV/AIDS in Africa were receiving treatment from \nU.S.-funded sources. Today, we are treating over 2 million. That is a \nsignificant accomplishment and a great leap forward from where we were \nback then. Although each success is important, they remind us of the \nwork that still needs to be done. There are now 33.2 million people \nliving with HIV/AIDS compared to 29 million in 2001, but the growth has \nslowed dramatically. The statistics are alarming, but they also show we \nare making an impact. As the old adage says so well: We have only begun \nto fight. And fight we must, for AIDS is a battle we cannot afford to \nlose--not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Looking back, the PEPFAR bill \ngave us an important foundation from which to work so we could take \nwhat was designed as an emergency aid plan and make it a sustainable, \nlong-range effort that would continue to be effective until these \ndiseases are relegated to the medical history books.\n  In the original bill, we set challenging goals for treatment, for \ncare, and for prevention. We made treatment the No. 1 priority for the \nfunding we were able to provide. We also established a comprehensive \napproach to prevention. Today, we are discussing the reauthorization of \nthis program and a renewal of our commitment to continue to make a \ndifference throughout the world. As I said, I went to Africa in March, \nand I have seen the progress we have been able to make on this vitally \nimportant issue. We have made a start. This bill continues the work we \nhave begun.\n  We have a good bill before us, because Senators Biden and Lugar spent \nlong days and nights working on it to ensure it reflects what Members \non both sides of the aisle see as the important issues that must be \naddressed. This bill has been through the whole process. This bill \nexpands on the structure of the current law's policies to ensure that \nthe money follows the patients and does not get lost in the \nadministrative structure of the programs these funds support. It \ncontinues to focus on treatment by requiring that more than half of the \nfunds be used for that purpose. It also provides for a complete \naccounting of all funds provided to the global fund.\n  In addition, it calls for a balanced approach to prevention so that \nabstinence and ``be faithful'' programs receive funds equal to that of \nother prevention programs. Other efforts it will fund will help to \nincrease the capacity of the health care systems in the affected \ncountries, ensure that all drugs purchased for the program are safe and \neffective, and begin the process of developing a framework for the \nlong-range stability of these programs. Finally, it will encourage the \ncountries receiving this assistance to develop their own independent \nand sustainable programs to address the health care needs of their \npeople.\n  When passed, the new edition of PEPFAR will establish even more \nchallenging goals for the treatment, care, and prevention of these \ndiseases by tying the increase in funding to a corresponding \nrealization of the goals we have established in the bill. In addition, \nas the cost of treatment goes down, the treatment goals increase \nproportionately. This will ensure we will be treating the greatest \nnumber of people in the most cost-effective manner possible. Senators \nCoburn, Burr, and I worked with Senators Biden and Lugar, and many \nother Members, to ensure this bill would reflect the principles and \ngoals that have been shared by us with the interested Members of the \nSenate. I commend each Member for their dedicated work and the hard \nwork that has resulted in the successful development of this third way.\n  This bill is a good piece of legislation. I urge all colleagues to \nsupport its passage and send a message to all nations that are \nreceiving AIDS assistance from America that we will continue to stand \nby their side in the great fight. Our commitment to ridding the world \nof all these diseases in our lifetime will never weaken or waiver. This \nis something that is appreciated in the countries in which we are\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\nworking. It is something they know America is doing for them. It is \nmaking friends in other parts of the world. I hope we can keep this \nprocess going. I urge everyone to vote for cloture this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Levin pertaining to the introduction of S. 3255 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                         Oil Contracts In Iraq\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by the apparent lack \nof a clear and consistent U.S. policy on the entering into of oil deals \nin Iraq in the absence of Iraqi national hydrocarbon legislation. \nUnfortunately, that hydrocarbon legislation, which would ensure \nequitable distribution of oil revenues among the Iraqi people, and \nenable increased oil production and long-term foreign investment, \nremains stalled in the Iraqi Assembly. Continued failure by the Iraqi \nGovernment to pass national hydrocarbon legislation, a political \nbenchmark which was set by the Iraqis for themselves, risks fracturing \nthe country and jeopardizing hard-fought gains.\n  Last September, Hunt Oil Company, an American firm, was the first \ncompany to sign a production-sharing contract with the Kurdistan \nRegional Government, or KRG. The KRG has now apparently signed \napproximately two dozen such contracts with international oil \ncompanies, all of which have been condemned by the Iraqi national \nGovernment. Iraq's Oil Minister has called these deals ``illegal'' and \nthe State Department's May 2008 report on Iraq indicates that progress \non national hydrocarbon legislation has been ``complicated by the KRG's \npursuit of oil contracts'' and is now ``at a standstill.''\n  Administration officials have stated publicly and in letters to me \nthat U.S. policy strongly discourages oil production-sharing contracts \nbetween private companies and regional governments in Iraq, including \nthe KRG. However, representatives from Hunt Oil Company have indicated \nthat they specifically asked about U.S. policy regarding such deals in \nmeetings with State Department employees prior to Hunt Oil signing \ntheir production-sharing contract with the KRG and were told ``there \nwas no policy, neither for nor against.'' I am concerned that if a \npolicy discouraging contracts with regional governments was in place \nprior to the signing of Hunt Oil's contract with the KRG, that it was \nnot adequately understood or communicated by State Department employees \nin their interactions with Hunt Oil and other international oil \ncompanies seeking to do business in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I wrote to the \nPresident's National Security Advisor, Stephen Hadley, and his response \nto me on this issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2008.\n     Hon. Stephen J. Hadley,\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, \n         National Security Council, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hadley: I write to you in regard to Hunt Oil \n     Company's decision to sign an oil production sharing contract \n     (PSC) with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) on \n     September 8, 2007, and the official U.S. government policy \n     relating to such deals. The KRG has now signed more than 25 \n     PSCs with international oil companies, several of which are \n     subsidiaries of U.S.-based companies.\n       The PSCs signed between international oil companies and the \n     KRG run directly counter to our goals for reconciliation in \n     Iraq and risk fracturing the country over the management of \n     Iraq's oil industry and distribution of oil revenues. As you \n     know, Iraq's Oil Minister has called PSCs like the one signed \n     by Hunt Oil ``illegal.'' Furthermore, the State Department's \n     May 2008 report on Iraq states that progress on the national \n     hydrocarbon legislation ``is at a standstill'' and its \n     prospects for passage have been ``further complicated by the \n     KRG's pursuit of oil contracts.''\n       While the State Department report also indicates ``the \n     United States continues to discourage the KRG from signing \n     oil contracts until negotiations on a national oil law are \n     completed,'' I am concerned that U.S. policy has not been \n     clearly and consistently communicated to oil companies who \n     have signed or may be considering signing PSCs with the KRG, \n     including U.S.-based companies like Hunt Oil.\n       In response to reports of contacts between Hunt Oil \n     employees and State Department representatives prior to the \n     company signing a PSC with the KRG on September 8, 2007, I \n     sent a series of letters to Hunt Oil and Secretary Rice \n     regarding the nature of these contacts and whether U.S. \n     officials expressed opposition to such a deal prior to its \n     signing. The responses I received from the State Department \n     and Hunt Oil starkly contradict one another.\n       In response to a letter I sent to Hunt Oil Chief Executive \n     Officer Ray Hunt, I was provided an email from Hunt Oil's \n     General Manager for Mideast Exploration David McDonald to \n     another Hunt Oil employee dated September 28 in which he \n     detailed meetings he had with State Department Regional \n     Reconstruction Team (RRT) representatives on June 12, June \n     15, and September 5, 2007. Of the June 15 meeting, Mr. \n     McDonald states that he ``specifically asked if the USG had a \n     policy toward companies entering contracts with the KRG'' and \n     was told ``that there was no policy, neither for nor \n     against.'' Mr. McDonald also states, ``There was no \n     communication to me or in my presence made by the 9 state \n     department officials with whom I met prior to 8 September \n     that Hunt should not pursue our course of action leading to a \n     contract. In fact there was ample opportunity to do so, but \n     it did not happen.''\n       On the other hand, the State Department in a letter to me \n     stated ``Hunt Oil apparently first expressed its interest in \n     signing an agreement with the KRG to RRT staff in the meeting \n     on September 5, 2007. RRT staff explained U.S. Government \n     policy against signing deals with the KRG to Mr. McDonald.''\n       The clear inconsistency between the State Department and \n     Hunt Oil in their accounting of the meetings leading up to \n     the company's signing of a PSC with the KRG is deeply \n     troubling. Hunt Oil says that they were never told about a \n     U.S. policy against signing deals with the KRG. The State \n     Department says that Hunt Oil was told of such a policy on \n     September 5, three days before the deal was signed.\n       I believe the administration should request Hunt Oil, and \n     other U.S.-based oil companies, to withdraw from any PSC they \n     have signed and to advise the KRG that they are doing so in \n     order to facilitate the passage of national hydrocarbon \n     legislation. I also believe that the administration should \n     clearly define and disseminate a policy relating to the \n     signing of oil deals with the KRG.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 4, 2008.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     reiterate the Administration's policy regarding oil \n     production sharing contracts with the Kurdistan Regional \n     Government (KRG).\n       United States policy strongly discourages oil production \n     sharing contracts between private companies and regional \n     governments in Iraq, including the KRG, prior to the \n     enactment of national hydrocarbon legislation authorizing \n     such contracts. This policy is embodied in a cable to the \n     United States Embassy in Baghdad dated August 3, 2006. I \n     understand that you have been provided with a copy of this \n     cable. The United States Government also has announced this \n     policy publicly.\n       To implement this policy, the United States has been in a \n     position to request companies, including U.S.-based \n     companies, not to enter into any oil contracts with regional \n     governments in Iraq and to advise those companies of the \n     legal and political risks of doing so.\n       You have asked the United States to request that U.S.-based \n     oil companies withdraw from oil production sharing contracts \n     already signed with the KRG. The Administration shares your \n     view that it would have been better had these contracts not \n     occurred. We do not believe, however, that seeking the \n     termination of oil contracts between the KRG and private \n     companies based in the United States would substantially \n     advance efforts to resolve the impasse with the KRG on \n     national hydrocarbon legislation in Iraq. Oil production \n     sharing contracts between U.S.-based private companies and \n     the KRG constitute only a small number of the approximately \n     two dozen oil production sharing contracts to which the KRG \n     is a party.\n       The United States continues to encourage both the KRG and \n     the national government of Iraq to resolve their differences \n     and to agree on national legislation that will allow \n     companies to pursue opportunities with a clear legal \n     framework across Iraq.\n       Please let me know if we may be of further assistance \n     regarding this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Stephen J. Hadley,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n                                        National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on a related issue, recent reports indicate \nthe Government of Iraq is now in negotiations with five Western oil \ncompanies for no-bid ``technical service'' contracts at existing oil \nfields. When\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\nasked about these contracts on June 19, 2008, Secretary Rice said:\n\n       The United States Government has stayed absolutely out of \n     the matter of the awarding of Iraqi oil contracts. It's a \n     private sector matter.\n\n  However, subsequent reports indicate that State Department employees \nadvised the Iraqi Government on the drafting of these technical service \ncontracts. These reports were followed on July 1 with news that Iraq \nintends to award contracts to develop six oil fields and two natural \ngas fields, with or without the passage of national hydrocarbon \nlegislation.\n  These contracts would seem to circumvent the national hydrocarbon \nlegislation currently under consideration in Iraq and could risk \nfurther complicating what are already delicate negotiations. I am \nconcerned by the administration's silence on these contracts and the \nmessage our reported involvement in drafting the no-bid technical \nservice contracts sends to the Iraqi Government about the importance of \npassing national hydrocarbon legislation. I am sending a letter to \nStephen Hadley today asking him about U.S. policy with regard to these \nservice and development contracts and expressing my concern that such \ncontracts might harm negotiations on national hydrocarbon legislation. \nI ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Stephen J. Hadley,\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, \n         National Security Council, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hadley: Thank you for your July 4, 2008, response \n     to my previous letter. However, I remain concerned about the \n     signing of oil deals in Iraq in the absence of national \n     hydrocarbon legislation and the lack of a clearly stated U.S. \n     government policy regarding such deals.\n       Published reports indicate that the Government of Iraq is \n     in negotiations with five Western oil companies for no-bid \n     ``technical service'' contracts. These reports were followed \n     on July 1st with news that Iraq intends to award contracts to \n     develop six oil fields and two natural gas fields.\n       These contracts would appear to circumvent the national \n     hydrocarbon legislation currently under consideration and \n     risk further complicating what are already delicate \n     negotiations. Furthermore, continued failure by the Iraqi \n     Government to pass national hydrocarbon legislation, a \n     political benchmark set by the Iraqis for themselves, risks \n     fracturing the country.\n       I am concerned by the Administration's silence on the \n     potential signing of technical service and oil field \n     development contracts by the Iraqi government prior to \n     passing national hydrocarbon legislation and would appreciate \n     your response to the following questions:\n       1. Is there an official U.S. policy with regard to the \n     technical service contracts currently under negotiation by \n     the Iraqi Government?\n       2. Is there an official U.S. policy with regard to the oil \n     field development contracts being considered by the Iraqi \n     Government?\n       3. Is it the Administration's view that the technical \n     service contracts or the oil field development contracts \n     under consideration by the Iraqi Government will complicate \n     efforts to pass national hydrocarbon legislation? If so, have \n     you expressed these concerns to the Iraqi Government or to \n     oil companies seeking to do business in Iraq?\n       Thank you for your prompt assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss the \nturmoil in the financial markets, especially with regard to Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac. Let me be clear, Fannie and Freddie are too important \nto fail. Their fundamentals, as they look now, provide no reason to \nthink they will fail. We all know how important they are.\n  These two institutions are the foundation of the mortgage market, and \nwe fully stand behind them and their crucial role. Without Fannie and \nFreddie, housing markets would come to an utter standstill and our \neconomy, shaky as it is, would sink much deeper. Therefore, we should \ntake all necessary steps to ensure affordable home ownership for \nmillions of American families, and that includes preserving the \nessential role Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play.\n  Our Nation is caught in the middle of one of the most severe housing \ndownturns since the Great Depression, so it is not surprising that the \ntwo institutions that guarantee $5 trillion worth of mortgages for \nfamilies across America are now facing real significant challenges. But \nthe markets' overreaction over the past 2 days is more based on \npsychology than reality.\n  Over the past few days, Treasury Secretary Paulson, James Lockhart, \nthe GSE's primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, and Chairman \nBernanke, and leading Senators, including both parties' candidates for \nPresident, have all clearly stated their confidence in Fannie and \nFreddie and the Government's commitment to keeping those institutions \nsafe and secure.\n  That commitment has not changed and will not change.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are well capitalized. They are actually \nholding capital in excess of their current requirements.\n  In these volatile markets--in these volatile markets--share price is \nnot the most reliable measure for judging Fannie and Freddie and will \nnot dictate the responses by the regulators. Rather, the regulators are \nmore closely watching the performance of Fannie's and Freddie's bonds \nand how their yields compare to U.S. treasuries. Right now, Freddie and \nFannie bonds are trading closer to treasuries than they were in March \nafter the Bear Stearns collapse, and that is a reassuring signal.\n  The stock markets may be overreacting, but the regulators should not \nand will not. I have talked to them on a regular basis today, and I can \nassure Americans in the markets that they are very much on top of this \nproblem, they are looking at it in a careful, thoughtful, but \nnonpanicky and nonrush way.\n  We do not believe the regulators will be forced to act, but if they \nare, it is not a choice between inaction or full-blown receivership \nbecause there is more than one way to shore up Fannie and Freddie, if \nnecessary. There are countless intermediate steps that regulators could \ntake before ever having to entertain a Government takeover.\n  The regulators are preparing for worst-case scenarios. But developing \ncontingency plans does not mean that disaster is around the corner. By \nsimply being prepared, the Government can restore confidence that these \ninstitutions will remain safe and secure and continue to function in \ntheir essential role as the cornerstone of the mortgage markets for \ndecades to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                  Air Force's KC-X Tanker Competition\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to talk \nabout the Air Force's KC-X tanker competition. There was a House \nhearing on that matter this week, and a number of our colleagues have \nspoken on it. I have discussed it on the floor a couple of times.\n  As you will remember, that contract was awarded to the Northrop/EADS \nteam back in February, after a competition that the Air Force \nadjudicated. That team--the Northrop/EADS team--plans to build a new \ntanker, which our military desperately needs, in my hometown of Mobile, \nAL. It is important to the people of Alabama, and they are watching it \nvery closely.\n  However, Boeing objected to the decision. They protested. They cited \n100 concerns with the Air Force's award--more than 100. The Government \nAccountability Office, whose duty is to review such complaints, did so \nand concluded that out of the 100-plus complaints, only eight elements \nof the protest had merit. So it was then up to the Department of \nDefense, after the GAO report was issued, to decide how it would \naddress GAO's concerns. That is the way the system works, and every \nbidder has that opportunity. The DOD was not legally bound to accept or \nacknowledge these criticisms. They legally could have gone forward with \nthe process and affirmed their own decision and gone forward with it. \nHowever, Secretary Gates considered the matter carefully. He announced \nthat in order to ensure this selection process is totally fair, \ntransparent, and beyond reproach, that the Secretary would order a \n``limited recompetition'' of the contract. This new competition will be\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\npersonally overseen, he said, by the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Mr. John Young, and Mr. Young \nwill be advised by a completely new Source Selection Advisory \nCommittee.\n  Secretary Gates announced he will amend the original solicitation and \nallow both Boeing and Northrop Grumman to submit revised bids. The \namended contract will address each of the eight complaints that were \nupheld by GAO. Wisely, I think, it ignored the extraneous issues that \nsome have raised over the past few months, such as WTO disputes or \nindustrial base matters.\n  So let me repeat, each of the concerns raised by the GAO would be \naddressed, but political considerations here in Washington, the \nSecretary said, will not affect this process.\n  So as the Secretary said in his press conference yesterday:\n\n       Industry, the Congress and the American people all must \n     have confidence in the integrity of this acquisitions \n     process. I believe the revised process will result in the \n     best tanker for the Air Force at the best price for the \n     American taxpayer.\n\n  I think that is what Congress asked of him, and that is what he has \ncommitted to do.\n  The GAO affirmed the Secretary's decision yesterday in testimony \nbefore the House Armed Services Committee. Daniel Gordon, the Deputy \nGeneral Counsel for the GAO--I think he headed the team or supervised \nthe team at GAO--said that, based on the Department of Defense press \nconference earlier this week, ``it certainly sounded to me like \nSecretary Gates was acting in good faith to implement the \nrecommendations'' made by the GAO. This expedited process, it is hoped, \ncan lead to a new source selection soon.\n\n  There are some additional points I wish to make to respond to those \nwho say the GAO's decision suggests a preference for one aircraft--for \nthe Boeing aircraft. In other words, some have contended that their \ndecision indicated that GAO was suggesting that a wrong decision was \nmade. Others have suggested that this report should, therefore, invite \nthe Congress to somehow take over this competition, which I submit \nwould be unprecedented and unwise since we are not aircraft engineers, \nwe are not pilots, we are not responsible for managing these aircraft, \nnor are we capable of making the final decision about which aircraft is \nthe best.\n  So I would make these points: No. 1, the GAO did not say Boeing \nshould have won the competition at all, nor did it say the award should \nnow be sole-sourced to Boeing or any other contractor. GAO said clearly \nwhen they released their decision:\n\n       Our decision should not be read to reflect a view as to the \n     merits of the firm's respective aircraft. Judgments about \n     which offeror will most successfully meet the governmental \n     needs largely is reserved for the procuring agencies, subject \n     only to such statutory and regulatory requirements as full \n     and open competition and fairness to potential offerors.\n\n  This point was reinforced yesterday in testimony before the House \nArmed Services Committee by Mr. Daniel Gordon, who is the deputy \ngeneral counsel for the GAO:\n\n       We found serious errors in the procurement process that \n     could have affected the outcome of, again, what was a close \n     competition. But our legal decision does not say anything \n     about the merits of the Boeing's or Northrop's proposed \n     tankers.\n\n  Point 2: When it comes to capability, the Northrop Grumman plane is \nstill the superior choice for our warfighters, I would submit, based on \nthe analysis, and I would make these points--ultimately, that would \nhave to be decided by the professionals, not this Senator.\n  I would just make these points as a push-back to some of the comments \nmy colleagues have raised. First, I would note that the A330, the \nNorthrop aircraft frame, is a more modern airframe than the Boeing 767. \nThe first 767 flew in 1982. The A330 was first built in 1998, some 16 \nyears later. It is a much more modern airframe.\n  No. 2: I would note that no one disputes that the A330 can carry and \noffload more fuel, the primary job of a refueling tanker. The Air Force \njudged that one Northrop plane could do more refueling more efficiently \nthan one Boeing plane, and the GAO upheld that finding.\n  The GAO did criticize the Air Force for giving Northrop ``extra \ncredit'' for their superior refueling capability. However, they noted \nthat this extra credit was not in keeping with--in a legal sense--the \nlanguage of the original request for proposal. They did not say the Air \nForce shouldn't place a premium on refueling capability. Mr. Gordon of \nGAO said yesterday:\n\n       There was an objective. Northrop exceeded it by quite a bit \n     and Northrop got all the extra credit. We have no opinion, we \n     have no view on whether it was a good idea.\n\n  Well, I would suggest that giving a refueling tanker credit for its \nrefueling capability would seem like a good idea to me, if the Air \nForce wants the best aircraft for their men and women in uniform.\n  Further, I would note that in addition to carrying more fuel, the GAO \nalso agreed with the Air Force and their finding that the larger boom \nenvelope of the Northrop KC-45 would make it easier and safer for \npilots to refuel.\n  In addition, because the A330 is a more capable refueler than the \n767, the Air Force predicts they will ultimately have to buy 22 fewer \naircraft if they go with the Northrop team. At today's prices, the \nsticker price of 22 aircraft is $4.3 billion. That is without factoring \nin manning those aircraft and maintaining them over the years.\n  The GAO acknowledged in their report and in their testimony yesterday \nthat the A330 can carry more cargo, more personnel, and conduct more \naeromedical evaluations. They said:\n\n       We see no basis to conclude that the Air Force's evaluation \n     that Northrop Grumman's aircraft was more advantageous in the \n     airlift area is unreasonable.\n\n  The GAO further found no fault with the Air Force's conclusion that \nthe Boeing proposal was more risky in certain areas and that their past \nperformance on--by the Boeing team--on similar contracts was \n``marginal.''\n  So what did the GAO ultimately say about the Air Force's decision? \nThey certainly said the decision was flawed from a procedural \nperspective, but they also said the Air Force picked a plane that could \ncarry and offload more fuel more efficiently and in a more desirable \nway for pilots.\n  The main fuselage compartment of the aircraft is not where the fuel \nis stored. It is in the wings. So these aircraft have a tremendous \ncapability of helping airlift personnel and equipment to a distant \nbattlefield. They found that the plane's secondary mission--airlift--\ncould be accomplished more effectively by the Northrop aircraft.\n  Finally, the GAO agreed that the Northrop plane was lower risk and \nthat Boeing had marginal past performance.\n  Point 3: We need to maintain a fair and competitive process. The fact \nthat we chose to compete this contract--that Congress ordered a \ncompetition for this aircraft--directed it rather than sole-sourcing it \nto Boeing or any other company, as some would have preferred, has been \nhugely beneficial to our military and to our taxpayer. Boeing's \npreferred sole-source leasing plan or scheme that got through this \nCongress, or this Senate, would have had us leasing 100 767s for $23.5 \nbillion. So we would lease them for $23.5 billion, or $235 million a \ncopy.\n\n  Now, thanks to this very competitive and aggressively conducted bid \ncompetition, thanks to fair and transparent procedures, the military is \ngoing to own 179 superior aircraft for $35 billion, or $195 million a \ncopy. That is a win for the taxpayers and a win for the military.\n  As Secretary Young said yesterday in his testimony before the House \nArmed Services Committee:\n\n       I see no benefit, in my experience across the acquisition \n     enterprise, setting this aside. Sole sources limit our \n     flexibility in negotiating prices. We achieve the best value \n     through a competitive source selection of a single source who \n     has bid in a competitive environment and offered us hopefully \n     an excellent deal.\n\n  So these words should induce caution in those of my colleagues and \nsome of our Senators who have introduced legislation that would, in \neffect, sole-source this contract to Boeing. The result would be \ninferior planes for our military and clearly inflated costs for the \ntaxpayers.\n  As important as the principle that we should have a competitive \nprocess for defense contracts is the principle that the military \nultimately--and not the\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\nCongress--should be in charge of making meritorious, objective, and \nfair decisions on who should be the winner of a contract.\n  As Secretary Young said yesterday in his testimony:\n\n       Grounded in the warfighter's requirements and the pursuit \n     of the best value for the taxpayer, the Defense Department is \n     the only organization that can fairly and knowledgeably \n     conduct this competition . . .\n\n  Isn't that true?\n\n        . . . The Defense Department does not care which tanker \n     wins the competition. The Defense Department's sole objective \n     is to get the required capability for the men and women who \n     serve this Nation at the best price for the taxpayer.\n\n  I certainly think that is correct. I certainly think that is correct.\n  I will conclude by saying, after the collapse and quite a bit of \nembarrassment and actual criminal prosecutions of the sole-source lease \nplan that occurred--and we are all aware of how that occurred--Congress \nrequired a competition. By definition, a competition assumes that there \nwill be bidders, and there are only two potential bidders in the world \nfor this kind of aircraft. And if you are going to have a competition, \nit needs to be fair. Both bids should be objectively evaluated on the \nmerits of the product they have offered. If that is so, I think the \nAmerican taxpayer will be the winner in the end. I will just say to my \ncolleagues, I have advice. I believe the Northrop team presented the \nbest aircraft, but I don't know. I am not an expert. So I would urge my \ncolleagues to resist any political pressures that might be brought to \nbear or interests that they may have in infecting this process with \npolitics. Let's let them make the best decision. That is what I have \nsaid from the beginning, and that is what I have said throughout this \nprocess. That is what I believe is the only right position we can take.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Job Training\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is poised to \npass this critically important legislation that will help address the \nforeclosure crisis our Nation is facing and take necessary steps to \nbolster our flagging economy. We have all seen the far-reaching effects \nthe housing crisis is having on our economy, and in my view it is \nincumbent upon us to examine any actions we might take to reduce \nforeclosures and steady our Nation's housing markets.\n  My home State of Connecticut has pursued an innovative approach to \nhelp people facing foreclosure on their homes. In a bill passed \nrecently by the Connecticut General Assembly and signed by the \nGovernor, $2.5 million was devoted to a job training fund targeted at \npeople facing foreclosure. Guiding this new initiative is the idea that \nif people have access to job training, they may be able to find higher \npaying jobs that would allow them to keep their homes and avoid \nforeclosure. This program will be run by The WorkPlace, Inc., Southern \nConnecticut's workforce development board, and Capital Workforce \nPartners, North Central Connecticut's workforce board that serves 37 \nmunicipalities, both of which have done a tremendous job in Connecticut \nhelping to train people for better jobs over many years. I think that \nthis is an important idea that merits study as the Congress continues \nto consider how to help hardworking families weather the current \neconomic storms. As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Employment and \nWorkplace Safety and a great champion of job training programs, I would \nwelcome any thoughts on this matter from my distinguished colleague \nfrom Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, and thank him for his leadership on this legislation. As the \nchairman knows, I have been a long-time advocate of our Nation's job \ntraining programs as an effective tool to help people get the skills \nthey need to secure family-wage jobs, improve their quality of life, \nand keep our communities healthy and competitive. In fact, I believe \nthat giving workers the opportunity to grow their skills is one of the \ncritical elements of our Nation's economic security. That's why I \nfought for the passage of the Workforce Investment Act in 1998 and will \ncontinue to push for its reauthorization and increased funding levels \nfor its job training programs. Workforce boards around the country, \nincluding those in my home State of Washington, administer great job \ntraining programs that help millions of Americans get off unemployment \nrolls or out of low-paying, dead-end jobs.\n  I think the program that my colleague described sounds like an \ninitiative that is certainly worth study. Indeed, any ideas that could \nhelp even more people avoid the economic turmoil and emotional hardship \nforeclosures cause for themselves and their families should be \nconsidered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Washington for her comments and \nfor her leadership on this issue. I also would ask the Senator from \nWashington if it is her understanding, as it is mine, that workforce \nboards administer programs that train workers for jobs in cutting-edge \nindustries such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his question. \nWe believe now, as we did when we passed the act into law, that for \ntraining to benefit working families and their communities, it must \nrespond to the skills needs of thriving industries that lead to family-\nwage jobs. An example of this is the green jobs sector. Innovative \nStates, such as my own State of Washington, are leading the expansion \nof career opportunities in the green economy, making sure that \nopportunities are readily available for workers to acquire the skills \nto qualify for these good jobs. In fact, Washington State set a new \ngoal to increase the number of clean energy jobs to 25,000 in the next \n12 years and committed to finance the necessary training. Innovative \nworkforce boards across the country increasingly are providing training \nfor green collar jobs that will be critical in meeting the demands of a \nlow-carbon economy and providing workers with quality jobs. And \nCongress also is taking action. As a member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I supported the recent passage the Labor/Health and \nHuman Services bill; we reported that a greater training investment \nneeds to be made in areas such as renewable electric power, biofuels, \nenergy-efficiency assessment and environmentally sustainable \nmanufacturing and directed the Secretary of Labor to competitively \naward community based job training grants in these areas. All of these \nprograms will be instrumental in developing the skilled domestic \nworkforce necessary to maintain our Nation's competitive edge.\n  Mr. DODD. l look forward to working with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Washington on this idea and hope that we continue to \nexplore fresh ideas to help lift our Nation out of this housing crisis.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Housing and Economic Recovery \nAct of 2008. I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Dodd and Ranking \nMember Shelby in developing a comprehensive bill that will meaningfully \naddress the housing crisis in our country. Working families are losing \ntheir homes. Credit access has been drastically reduced. Affordable \nhousing options for our constituents are severely limited.\n  Hawaii's foreclosure rate increased by more than 88 percent last \nyear, for a total of 1,270 families who had their homes foreclosed. The \nresults for the first part of 2008 are even more troubling, with a \nforeclosure rate in April representing a 218 percent increase over the \nsame month in 2007. Comparatively, Hawaii has not suffered as much as \nother States. However, foreclosure statistics do not reflect pending \ndelinquencies for those families struggling to make payments or those \nwith resetting adjustable rate mortgages. Additionally, falling home \nprices can lead to homeowners having to sell at a significant loss due \nto an unexpected transfer or a loss of a job, especially under current \neconomic conditions.\n  This much needed bipartisan legislation will help protect homeowners \nacross the country, prevent foreclosures, increase the supply of \naffordable housing, and assist our Nation's veterans. This legislation \nwill modernize and improve the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, to \nprovide homeowners with additional access to fixed rate mortgages. \nAdditional resources will be provided by this bill for housing \ncounseling to assist homeowners in finding solutions to their difficult \nsituations. Mortgage disclosures\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\nwill also be made more meaningful to consumers by this legislation.\n  The bill creates a new affordable housing trust fund and a capital \nmagnet fund to increase access to affordable housing. These efforts are \nso important because we have such a shortage of affordable housing in \nmy home State of Hawaii. According to the National Low Income Housing \nCoalition's 2007-2008 Out of Reach report, Hawaii ranks as the most \nexpensive housing jurisdiction in the country. We must act to provide \nadditional resources to help build and preserve affordable housing \nunits for working families.\n  I also appreciate the inclusion of a provision that is derived from \nmy legislation, S. 2768. This corrects an oversight in the Economic \nStimulus Act of 2008 and extends the temporary home loan guaranty \nincrease to veterans so that more of them can realize the dream of home \nownership.\n  The VA Home Loan Guaranty was part of the original GI bill in 1944. \nIt provided veterans with a federally guaranteed home loan with no \ndownpayment. This landmark legislation made the dream of home ownership \na reality for millions of returning veterans. More than 25 million \nveterans and service members are now eligible for VA home loan \nguarantees.\n  The amount of the home loan guaranty was last adjusted by the \nVeterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004. The maximum guaranty amount \nwas increased to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit \ndetermined under Section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \nCorporation Act for a single family residence, as adjusted for the year \ninvolved. Using that formula, because the Freddie Mac conforming loan \nlimit for a single family residence in 2008 is $417,000, VA will \nguarantee a veteran's loan up to $104,250. This guaranty exempts \nhomeowners from having to make a downpayment or secure private mortgage \ninsurance.\n  The newly enacted Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, however, temporarily \nreset the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA home loan guarantee limits \nto 125 percent of metropolitan-area median home prices, without \nreference to the VA home loan program. This had the effect of raising \nthe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits to nearly $730,000, in the \nhighest cost areas, while leaving the VA limit of $417,000 in place. \nThis important group of Americans may benefit from an increased home \nloan guaranty in this time of economic uncertainty.\n  This legislation would also increase benefits for specially adapted \nhousing for disabled veterans. Increases in housing and home adaptation \ngrants have been infrequent. Unless the amounts of the grants are \nadjusted, inflation erodes the value and effectiveness of these \nbenefits, making it more difficult for beneficiaries to afford the \naccommodations they need. This provision would go a long way in making \ncertain that specially adapted housing benefits meet the current needs \nof America's veterans.\n  We must enact this essential legislation to help homeowners remain in \ntheir homes, ensure access to credit, create more affordable housing \nopportunities, and provide much needed improvements to veterans' \nhousing benefits.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act because it contains a number of provisions that will \nassist communities in Wisconsin and around the country as they continue \nto respond to the foreclosure crisis. Many housing analysts say that \nthe foreclosure crisis and its drain on our economy could get worse \nbefore it gets better. With more than 2 million American families \nfacing foreclosure, Congress must act both to help those Americans \ngoing through foreclosure now as well as to help prevent Americans from \nfacing foreclosure in the future. While not perfect, this bill contains \nboth reactive and proactive provisions that should help States, local \ncommunities, and American families as they deal with the foreclosure \ncrisis and its effects on our Nation.\n  Last month, the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard \nUniversity released its annual report, ``The State of the Nation's \nHousing.'' This report looks at a variety of housing statistics, \nincluding figures related to affordability issues and foreclosures. The \nreport indicates just how grim the housing situation in our country is \nright now. According to the report, ``the number of homes in \nforeclosure proceedings nearly doubled by almost one million by the end \nof 2007.'' While the foreclosure rate in my State of Wisconsin is not \nas high as in other parts of the country, Wisconsin's foreclosure rate \nalso continues to grow. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has compared \nforeclosure rates in 2008 and 2007 and reported that for the first half \nof this year, the foreclosure rate in Milwaukee County increased by \nover 40 percent when contrasted with 2007's foreclosure rate. \nAdditionally, the Capital Times recently reported about the substantial \nincrease in foreclosures throughout Wisconsin over the past few years, \nnoting that ``foreclosures have more than doubled from 2005 to 2008.'' \nI also continue to hear from housing advocates about the individual \nfamilies' stories behind these foreclosure statistics and about the \nrising number of foreclosures in urban, rural, and suburban parts of \nWisconsin. With foreclosures continuing to rise, Congress has a duty to \nact. Although there are provisions in this bill that I have serious \nconcerns about and hope to see changed, on balance, this housing \npackage represents a step in the right direction.\n  Last month's report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at \nHarvard also highlights the problem of affordability of housing and \nnotes that there are over 17 million families whose housing costs \nconsume more than half their income. I continue to hear about the lack \nof affordable housing, both for renters and homeowners throughout \nWisconsin. Some housing analysts have also said that the lack of \naffordable housing helped to contribute to the growth in subprime \nlending and nontraditional mortgage products in recent years as \nfamilies increasingly struggled to meet rising housing costs. I am \npleased that this Senate bill addresses the lack of affordable housing \nin this country by creating a housing trust fund financed by resources \nfrom the Government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nOver the past few years, I have heard from a number of housing \nadvocates throughout the State of Wisconsin about the need to create a \nnational affordable housing trust fund to supplement the affordable \nhousing work that is going on at the local, city, and State level. \nHundreds of affordable housing trust funds have been created throughout \nthe country, including in the city of Milwaukee, and help finance the \nrehabilitation, production, and preservation of affordable housing. \nThese trust funds not only create affordable housing, but they can also \ncreate good-paying jobs and help bring stability to our communities.\n  In the fall of 2006, I introduced the Affordable Housing Expansion \nand Public Safety Act, which among other things called on Congress to \ncreate a national affordable housing trust fund with the goal of \nsupplying affordable housing units and sufficient income targeting to \naddress the housing affordability burdens faced by extremely low-income \nand very low-income families. I am pleased this legislation we are \nconsidering takes the first steps toward the creation of a national \nhousing trust fund and contains deep income targeting to benefit \nextremely low-income and very low-income families. Research shows that \nthese families often face the most severe housing cost burdens and have \na difficult time finding affordable housing whether they live in urban, \nsuburban, or rural communities. I commend Senators Reed and Dodd for \nworking to ensure this provision was included in the legislation and I \nhope that the final housing package sent to the President will retain \nthis provision.\n  I have also heard from advocates in Wisconsin in strong support of \nthe nearly $4 billion that is included in CDBG funding to States and \nlocal communities hard hit by the housing crisis. These funds can be \nused to buy and redevelop foreclosed upon homes with the intention to \nsell, rent, or redevelop these homes. This provision was also included \nin the Senate Foreclosure Prevention Act that this body passed in April \nof this year and, at that time, I noted that the flexibility of the \nCDBG program will allow States and local communities to use this \nfunding in a way that best fits the indiviaual needs of their States \nand communities. I am\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\npleased that the Housing and Economic Recovery Act retains the \nrequirement that 25 percent of the CDBG funds included in this bill be \nused to redevelop foreclosed homes for families or individuals whose \nincome is at 50 percent of the area median income or less. This \ntargeting will help ensure that those most in need are not left out of \nthe Federal assistance provided in this legislation. I am disappointed \nthat the President has issued a veto threat over this provision of the \nlegislation given its broad support from housing advocates and State \nand local governments.\n  This provision would provide much needed assistance for a number of \nStates, including Wisconsin. According to the Center for American \nProgress, the CDBG funds in the bill will bring Wisconsin $57.2 million \nin direct funds for housing assistance and restore over 1,815 \nproperties. The Senate has designated this funding as emergency \nfunding, and while I would prefer to see this CDBG funding fully \noffset, this critical funding is needed in our communities now. The \nSenate will soon be sending this bill back to the House of \nRepresentatives, and I urge my colleagues in the other body to offset \nthis CDBG funding rather than strike it out of this package entirely.\n\n  I also support the provisions in this bill providing increased \nfunding for mortgage counseling programs as well as provisions that \nenhance mortgage disclosure requirements. These provisions were also \nincluded as part of the Senate Foreclosure Prevention Act that this \nbody passed in April, and I am pleased the provisions were kept in as \npart of this current package. Reports indicate that the mortgage \ncounseling dollars are a cost-effective use of Federal dollars and \nincreased funding will provide even more families with the necessary \nassistance to try to reach workable solutions with their lenders in \norder to remain in their homes. The enhanced mortgage disclosure \nrequirements included in this legislation will help future borrowers \nwho are taking out their first mortgage or refinancing their existing \nmortgages better understand the terms of their loans and how much they \ncan expect to pay every month. There are a number of reports indicating \nthat some borrowers were misled into troublesome loan products and \nthese enhanced disclosures will help to prevent some of these egregious \npractices from happening in the future.\n  This legislation also contains a regulatory overhaul of the \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well \nas the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Congress has been working to \noverhaul the regulatory structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for \nyears in response to the accounting scandals at the two GSEs in 2003 \nand 2004. This legislation creates a single regulator for the GSEs that \nwill help to oversee the stability of the GSEs, including setting up \nmanagement standards for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. More effective \noversight of the GSEs is needed and should this legislation be enacted, \nCongress must closely follow the implementation of these substantial \nGSE reforms to ensure the reforms are effective.\n  This comprehensive housing package includes the FHA Modernization Act \nwhich has already passed the Senate twice--once as a stand-alone bill \nin December of last year and earlier this year as part of the Senate \nForeclosure Prevention Act. The Federal Housing Administration is an \nimportant Federal agency providing expanded access to the housing \nmarket for homeowners by offering mortgage insurance to families \nthroughout the country. There is bipartisan support for modernizing the \nFHA to help the agency better assist homeowners in today's housing \nmarket. As with the GSE reforms contained in this bill, I will monitor \nthe implementation of the FHA reforms to ensure that these reforms \ntruly benefit low-income and middle-income homeowners who are the very \nhomeowners the FHA and the GSEs are supposed to serve as part of their \naffordability missions.\n  Another piece of this legislation is the Hope for Homeowners Act, \nwhich will establish a new Federal Housing Administration program that \nwill allow homeowners facing foreclosure to refinance their mortgages \ninto an FHA-insured mortgage. It is important to note that this \nvoluntary program is not permanent and contains a sunset ending the \nprogram in 2011. While this program is certainly not perfect, the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that the program could help \n400,000 of the over 2 million homeowners facing foreclosure stay in \ntheir homes. This program should be given a chance to work with careful \noversight from Congress, the FHA, and HUD to ensure that borrowers and \nlenders are not taking advantage of the program. The Hope for \nHomeowners program contains a number of provisions to help ensure that \nthe program is targeted to borrowers facing foreclosure, rather than \nspeculators who gambled on the housing market. For example, the \nborrower has to certify to the Federal Government that he or she has \nnot defaulted on his or her mortgage intentionally or provided untrue \ninformation to obtain a mortgage. The legislation also specifies that \nthe Hope for Homeowners program is only available to mortgages that \ncover an owner-occupied primary residence, and not speculators who own \nmultiple homes. Lenders will also have to agree to write down the value \nof the existing mortgages to be no more than 90 percent of the current \nvalue of the property. Finally, the borrowers will have to share any \nfuture equity and appreciation in their homes with the Federal \nGovernment if the borrower decides to sell his or her home or refinance \nhis or her mortgage.\n  This bill is not perfect. I have some concerns related to certain \nprovisions in the bill that I hope can be addressed in ongoing \nnegotiations with the House of Representatives.\n  For example, I am disappointed that this bill does not include \nSenator Durbin's legislation which would have removed a provision in \nbankruptcy law that prevents mortgages on primary residences from being \nmodified during bankruptcy. According to advocates, the Durbin \nlegislation could help approximately 600,000 individuals or families \nremain in their homes. We tried to pass this legislation as an \namendment to the Senate Foreclosure Prevention Act in April, but, \nunfortunately, the amendment met with stiff resistance in the lending \ncommunity. Due to the complex nature of the foreclosure problem, we \nneed to enact a wide range of legislative proposals to help families \nfacing foreclosure, and the Durbin legislation is an important part of \nany legislative response. I voted for Senator Durbin's stand-alone \nlegislation in the Judiciary Committee, and I hope the Senate can move \nthis proposal forward in the coming weeks and months.\n  We also need to address predatory lending practices that have taken \nplace around the country and ensure that such abuses are not repeated. \nSenator Dodd has introduced a predatory lending bill that should serve \nas the foundation for comprehensive predatory lending legislation. \nPredatory lending practices and abusive subprime lending practices have \ncontributed to one of the most significant challenges to our national \neconomy in years and in order to more effectively address these \nchallenges, Congress should pass predatory lending legislation this \nyear.\n  As foreclosure rates continue to grow in Wisconsin and around the \ncountry, Congress must address the problems associated with increased \nforeclosures. Subprime lending and rising foreclosure rates are \ncomplicated issues to unravel and any response, whether legislative or \nregulatory, will bring with it a set of consequences, some intended and \nsome unintended. As this legislation moves forward, Congress and the \nrelevant Federal agencies must monitor its effects and consider whether \nmodifications are necessary. This package of reforms and new programs \nwill likely not correct all of the subprime and foreclosure problems \nour country continues to face. But a number of the provisions in this \nbill will provide some help for families, local communities, and States \nas our country continues to respond to these serious housing issues, \nand I hope the House will pass and the President will sign this bill \ninto law quickly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, later this afternoon the Senate will be \nvoting on two measures. One is the housing bill. We have been working \non it for months. The object behind this bill is to find some relief \nfor the thousands of people who will lose their homes today and every \nday.\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\n  About 7,500 Americans will have their homes foreclosed on today, and \nthat has been repeated over and over. We are reaching a housing crisis \nin this country. It not only affects those who are losing their homes; \nit affects those of us who live nearby who make our mortgage payments \nand watch the value of our homes go down because somebody in the \nneighborhood lost their home, had to put it up for auction, sold it at \nless than what they wanted to just to get out of the deal. So we need \nto do something about this housing crisis, not just for the good of \nthose families affected by foreclosure and those living nearby but for \nthe housing industry, which is an important part of our economy.\n  This housing bill has been around for several weeks. This week alone \nwe had two Republican filibusters slowing down this bill. If there has \never been a time when we shouldn't slow down, when we should move \nforward with dispatch, it is now. With the state of our economy, with \nthe number of people unemployed, with the costs that a lot of families \nare facing, this Senate ought to put politics behind, stop these \nfilibusters, move these bills forward, and give our best efforts to try \nto solve some of the problems facing our country.\n  The second bill we are going to be voting on is called the PEPFAR \nbill. This is a bill which relates to a program announced by President \nBush.\n  Now I am on the Democratic side of the aisle. I have sure had my \ndifferences with President Bush. However, I can remember his State of \nthe Union Address when he stood up and said: I think the United States \nshould lead the world in fighting the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. I \njumped out of my seat to applaud because he was right. I supported the \nPresident every year when he came in asking for more money so we could \nwork around the world to deal with the scourge of HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria. After the first 5 years, the President came \nback and said: We need a new program, one that takes into account what \nwe are doing around the world and what we need to do in the future. I \nthink he was right.\n  We basically had two programs going at once, and we were \nparticipating more in one--the PEPFAR Program--which was the \nPresident's emergency program to deal with this problem. It was the \ndirect aid of the United States to countries around the world--some 15 \ndifferent countries--where we provide assistance in dealing with HIV/\nAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. There is a separate endeavor called \nthe Global Fund, and that really engages the whole world and the rest \nof the world. We participate in that too. We are part of it.\n  A lot of people may say: Well, with all of the problems in the United \nStates, why are we spending all of this money overseas? It turns out to \nbe a small fraction of our budget but a very important investment. \nFirst, that money spent defines who we are. America is a caring nation. \nWhen we read about tragedies around the world, whether it is a \nhurricane or an earthquake or some other disaster, our people rally to \nhelp.\n  We always have. I am proud of that. I think it says a lot about who \nwe are. There are a lot of people trying to paint an image of America \naround the world that is very negative, an image most of us here don't \neven recognize. For a lot of people in the world, all they ever hear is \nbad news about the United States.\n  This is part of the good news about the United States. President \nBush's initiative to deal with the global AIDS crisis is the right \nthing to do. It explains who we are and what American values are. It \nbrings the expertise we have in our country to other countries around \nthe world who are, frankly, struggling with a very slow economy or \nbackward economy, and a lot of people are in trouble.\n  When I first went to Africa a number of years ago, I wasn't looking \nfor a global AIDS epidemic, but I could not avoid it. In every country \nthere I visited, I would see more and more people who were doomed to \ndie because they had been infected--young people, mothers and fathers \nwith children by their side, who knew death was the ultimate result of \nthis disease. There was no place for them to turn. At that point, there \nweren't any drugs--at least not available to these poor countries. All \nthey were doing was trying to keep people as strong as they could for \nas long as they could to avoid the fatal onset of these diseases.\n  Things have changed. They have changed because of the PEPFAR program \nof President Bush, the global fund program. We are taking therapies now \nand medications that have kept Americans infected with HIV alive for so \nmany years and sharing them with countries around the world. President \nBush comes before us now with this proposal, S. 2731, which wants to \nreauthorize the global AIDS program. I think it is a good idea. I am a \ncosponsor. It is a bipartisan bill, led by Senator Biden, a Democrat \nfrom Delaware, and Senator Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. It is a \nbipartisan bill. This bill has been stopped on the floor of the Senate \nfor months. A handful of Senators don't want this bill to move forward \nfor a variety of reasons. If they disagree with this bill, if there is \nsomething they wish to change, let them offer an amendment about the \nbill.\n  But it turns out, yesterday, when we confronted these Senators and \nsaid: What is your problem? What is the amendment you want to offer, \nthey want to offer amendments that have nothing to do with the global \nAIDS crisis, nothing to do with this bill. That, to me, is unnecessary \nand unfortunate. We are delaying the passage of this important \nlifesaving legislation so some Senators can offer amendments that have \nnothing to do with the subject matter.\n  I hope they will reconsider. In fact, the Senate being in session \nthis late on a Friday is unusual. We are usually back home by now. But \nwe are here, having spent the whole day waiting for a vote at about \n5:20 because one particular Senator--Senator DeMint of South Carolina--\nobjected to moving forward with the vote on this bill either this \nmorning or on Monday. So 100 Senators--at least those of us who are \nstill here--wait patiently for this vote and hope to get home to our \nfamilies this evening or maybe even tomorrow. I hope we pass the bill. \nWe need 60 votes to do it. If all Senators are present, there are 51 \nDemocrats and 49 Republicans. Even with all the Democrats supporting \nthe President, we need nine Republicans to make this a bipartisan bill, \nand we should.\n  The Presiding Officer, Senator Brown of Ohio, has focused a large \npart of his congressional career in the House and in the Senate on the \nissue of tuberculosis. He has traveled all around the world and has \nseen the scourge of the disease and what it has meant to these \ndifferent nations. We can treat it effectively. If we fail to treat it \neffectively, it can get complicated and very challenging--this \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which we read about in the newspapers \nonce in a while and is extremely difficult to treat.\n  If a person in a developing country is developing tuberculosis, and \nwe can spot it and treat them with very low-cost medicine immediately, \nwe can cure it. If we fail, their condition can worsen and the disease \ncan worsen and more people can be subject to it.\n  We don't live in a world where public health problems are isolated. \nThe public health problem in Africa today could be the same public \nhealth problem in America 2 weeks from now. All it takes is an airplane \nride. We have seen that happen before. So when we treat these diseases \noverseas, we are not only speaking of our values and who we are, we are \ndoing something that is right when it comes to the area of public \nhealth.\n  Critics of the bill have said it goes too far. Let me give you one \nillustration. They argue, for example, we should not be including in \nthis bill--directed at HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria--nutrition \nprograms. They are wrong. I went to an area of Nairobi, Kenya. It is a \nslum area, where about 600,000 people are living in very abject \ncircumstances. It is called Canberra. If you saw the movie ``The \nConstant Gardener,'' I believe it was broadcast--or at least filmed in \nthis slum. They have all the problems you can imagine--public diseases \nand health problems. Of course, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are found in \nthis slum area. They took me to a section on the outskirts where there \nwere mothers with small children, families. The kids were playing in \nthis courtyard-like area and the\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nmothers were sitting on benches. Most of the mothers looked like they \nwere about to die. I said: Why didn't these mothers, who are suffering \nfrom HIV/AIDS, get the drugs they need? They said: Well, they did. \nUnfortunately, these mothers were suffering from malnutrition. They \ndon't have enough food. They give the food to the kids. Because they \ndon't have enough food to eat, the drugs cannot work. Their systems are \nso compromised because of their weakness and malnutrition that the \ndrugs don't work.\n  So to say we are going to send drugs to that slum in Nairobi, Kenya, \nto cure HIV/AIDS but not food to feed the patients is self-defeating. \nWe would not achieve our goal of saving lives and giving those kids the \nparents they need for the rest of their lives. A nutrition program is \nan important part of this effort.\n  I hope this bill will pass this afternoon, or at least move forward, \nbut we need 60 votes for that to happen. We have to come together and \nput politics aside. I hope those who wish to offer a variety of \namendments relating to other things, and not directly to global AIDS \nand HIV, will save those battles for another day. I want them to save \nthose battles because that mother in Nairobi is fighting a battle right \nnow; she needs our help. President Bush understands that. Senator \nLugar, a Republican leader, understands that, Senator Biden understands \nthat, and the Senate should too.\n  It is, to me, a bit embarrassing that we have waited this long to \nbring up this bill of such critical importance to so many millions of \npeople around the world. It is our chance this afternoon to do what is \nright and move it forward. The sacrifice we have made to stick around \nand not be with our families this evening, as we hoped to be, is worth \nit if, at the end of the day, we can pass this important motion, move \nthe legislation forward for a vote early next week.\n  I salute the occupant of the chair for his leadership on the issues \nof tuberculosis and many other areas of public health. I know you feel \nthis is the right thing to do. A small investment now can make a big \ndifference in lives around the world. I hope our colleagues will share \nthat view this afternoon when we vote on the motion to proceed to this \nbill, which is President Bush's plan to deal with the global AIDS \ncrisis.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of minutes before \nthe vote occurs in the next 10 minutes or so to thank, first of all, \nthe majority leader for his tireless efforts to see to it that we stuck \nwith this housing bill. I know it has been a number of days since we \nbegan this debate on the housing issue.\n  Regrettably, because of a handful of people who oppose the bill, \nwhich is certainly their right, we have been held up from going to \nfinal passage. We could have passed this bill yesterday. We could have \npassed it last week. We have had overwhelming votes in favor of this \nhousing proposal. Yet, as is the right of any individual Senator or \nsmall group of them, they can use every parliamentary vehicle available \nto them to delay any consideration.\n  The tragedy is, the difference between passing this bill yesterday \nand today, another 8,000 to 9,000 families are filing for foreclosure, \nand every day we delayed over the last 2 or 3 weeks of considering this \nbill--just remember that every day we could have passed this bill, \nsomewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 families began the process of losing \ntheir homes.\n  While we cite these numbers over and over--53 percent increase, \nvalues go down, 1.5 million have lost their homes--somehow they glaze \nover the reality of what is happening with a family. Imagine, if you \nwill, as I said yesterday, that you had to go home this evening and \ntell your children, your family: We are going to have to lose our home. \nWe have to pack up. I am not sure where we are going. I am not sure we \nwill find anything. But we are about to lose the home that was our \ndream, the ability to raise our family here, to accumulate equity to \npay for college for our children, maybe pay for health care costs, \nunexpected costs that arose--everything that families use with the \ngreatest and most important asset that most will ever acquire, and that \nis their home.\n  Over the last year and a half, 1.5 million people have fallen into \nthe category of losing their home. The economic effects, of course, \nhave been staggering. They go far beyond, obviously, what happens to \nindividual families, as tragic as that is.\n  This bill, which Senator Shelby, I, and 19 other members of the \nBanking Committee--Democrats and Republicans--put together and brought \nto the floor on a vote of 19 to 2, deals with the foreclosure crisis by \nproviding some hope for allowing people to stay in their homes at rates \nthey can afford. Lenders will have to take a substantial cut from what \nthey otherwise would be getting. Borrowers will have to pay insurance \nto the FHA. They have to live in that home. It is not for speculators. \nIt is for a limited amount of time, but it gives them a chance to stay \nthere. We also provide for modernization of FHA, as well as reform of \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises.\n  Today, as people watched the economic news of the country, we know \nthat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these great mortgage lenders that are \nresponsible for more than 50 percent of the mortgages in the country, \nhave had a tough day. The good news is they stabilized at the end of \nthe day, and rightfully so because these institutions, despite what \nsome have said, are on a sound footing. They are adequately \ncapitalized. In fact, they have more capital than Federal law requires \nand they have access to it. I am glad to report that things seem to be \nstabilizing when it comes to the government-sponsored enterprises.\n  We also include an affordable housing program and, of course, \ncommunity development block grant money.\n  Senator Max Baucus and Senator Chuck Grassley deserve great credit \nfor what they included in the tax package--mortgage revenue bonds, \nfirst-time tax relief for people who buy foreclosed houses, along with \ntax provisions that will be a real asset to begin to let us come out of \nthis economic crisis, the worst we have had in years in this \ncountry. In fact, the loss of value in our homes now is some of the \nworst we have seen in decades in our Nation.\n\n  So shortly we will have a chance to once again vote on this bill and \nthen send it to the House of Representatives. I had a good conversation \nwith Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts a little earlier this \nafternoon about this bill, and while there is some disagreement about \nwhat we are doing in the Senate bill, my hope would be--and I will make \nthis plea to our colleagues in the other Chamber--that they would be \nwilling to accept this Senate bill. I know there are provisions in \nthere they do not necessarily agree with, but I think on the \nfundamentals there is basic agreement about the value of what we have \ndone here. I am hopeful they will accept that. They may not, and send \nus back an alternative idea, but I hope before they did that they would \nsit down with Senator Shelby and me and try to work out those \ndifferences so we could have one more pass at this before sending it to \nthe President for his signature.\n  Again, I am very grateful to the majority leader, very grateful to \nSenator Shelby and his staff for the wonderful work they have done in \nworking with us in order to bring us to the point of finally adopting \nthis legislation. It is not the final stop, but it is a major stop in \ngetting this bill done, hopefully in the next several days, and getting \nit to the President for his signature. It will not solve every problem. \nBut for those who said this Congress could not come together in a \nbipartisan fashion to do something responsible about housing, this bill \ndoes that.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the motion in the \nvote that will occur momentarily, and let us move on with our ability \nto solve this major economic crisis, the heart of which is the \nforeclosure crisis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly for 1 or 2 minutes, \nbecause I know we are voting right at 5:21, and I will be done well \nbefore that.\n  First, I thank Senator Dodd for his very important and incredibly \neffective work on housing. That is such a huge issue, and we need to \npass that today, and we will in a couple of minutes.\n  Secondly, I thank Senator Durbin for his comments on PEPFAR and how \nimportant that is for our place in the world and as a humanitarian \neffort. I have spent time in prisons in Moscow, in Siberian prison \ncamps, and in Haiti in Dr. Farmer and Dr. Kim's clinic, and I have seen \nhow tuberculosis ravages bodies, especially when it is combined with \nHIV. Most people in Africa who die from HIV actually are dying from the \ntuberculosis bacteria. I would add it is even more crucial and \ndevastating when this TB evolves into multidrug resistant TB or, even \nworse, a newer form, a more virulent, more deadly TB called excessive \ndrug resistant TB.\n  I urge this body to pass the housing bill, and to have particular \nfocus on the PEPFAR legislation, supported by the President. I \nappreciate the President's input and work on this. It is very important \nfor our country and for our place in the world.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call of \nthe roll begin now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to disagree to the \namendments of the House, adding a new title and inserting a new section \nto the amendment of the Senate to H.R. 3221.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST \nHIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008--MOTION \n                          TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I and a number of people have spoken on the \nfloor about the African HIV/AIDS bill many times, including a number of \nspeeches earlier today. This legislation demonstrates our commitment to \nhelping African nations fight the terrible scourge of HIV/AIDS that is \nnow taking approximately 8,000 lives every day on the African \nContinent. President Bush called on this Congress to invest in this \ninitiative in 2003, and we worked hand-in-hand with the White House to \npass this into law.\n  Now is the time to continue our commitment to this worthy cause. An \noverwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans along with the \nPresident supported this legislation. I believe this bill should have \nbeen passed weeks ago by unanimous consent. I recognize that a very \nsmall number of Republicans have continued to object, and we worked \nhard to reach a compromise and move forward.\n  Senators Lugar and Biden have done a wonderful job. The concerns \namong some Republicans have been addressed in this bill. Senators Biden \nand Lugar negotiated a bipartisan substitute amendment that added more \nthan 15 Republican amendments to this base bill which itself was a \nbipartisan bill.\n  Last night, we agreed to have votes on numerous Republican amendments \nthat were relevant to the bill. Unfortunately, my friends on the other \nside continue to object, which is why we are here today--principally \none objection.\n  Today, we are going to propose a unanimous-consent agreement that \nwould allow 10 Republican amendments, including amendments from \nSenators Gregg, DeMint, Cornyn, Bunning----\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Republican leader and virtually every single \nSenator would agree that we have negotiated in good faith and reached a \nfair agreement. Not a single Senator can legitimately claim that they \nwere not given fair consideration, and we allowed 10 Republican \namendments in addition to the Republican amendments there are in the \nbipartisan substitute.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6595, July 11, 2008, the Record reads: The Presiding \nOfficer.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I do not intend to object. Can you tell \nme whether, to your knowledge, the rules require the objecting Senator \nto be present? I understand on the last vote, which also had an \nobjection, that the objecting Senator did not cast a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you. I wanted to say this. The reason that we are \nhere today and not working on other business is one Senator held this \nup, and so this vote is required. That Senator is not here today.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to welcome the \n39th Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress of the Greek Orthodox Church of \nAmerica to Washington, D.C. This is a gathering of the clergy and lay \nleaders of the 550 parishes across the country with their hierarchs--\nbishops and metropolitans.\n  I am pleased that the metropolitan with jurisdiction over my State, \nMetropolitan Gerasimos of San Francisco, and the parishes from Ely, Las \nVegas, McGill, and Reno are well represented at this meeting. The Greek \nOrthodox community in America is an integral part of our national \nmosaic. My State of Nevada has many very successful citizens in both \nthe government and private sectors whose families trace their origins \nto Greece.\n  His Eminence Archbishop Demetrios, the leader and representative of \nthis national community, serves as Exarch of Ecumenical Patriarch \nBartholomew--the spiritual leader of millions of Orthodox Christians \naround the world. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who on June 29, \n2008, celebrated mass with Pope Benedict XVI at St. Peter's Basilica in \nthe Vatican, has also been awarded the highest civilian honor Congress \ncan bestow, the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  With the blessings of Archbishop Demetrios, and under the leadership \nof the Order of St. Andrew of the Greek Orthodox Church, the Greek \nOrthodox community has been an invaluable source of information for the \nUnited States Senate with regard to the numerous issues facing the \nnearly 2,000 year-old Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n  As a result of this warm relationship, on November 29, 2006, 73 U.S. \nSenators, including myself, signed a letter to President Bush \nexpressing great concern about the religious freedom of the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate in Turkey. According to the United States Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom's May 2008 annual report, legal \nrecognition of religious minorities, such as the Greek Orthodox \ncommunity, ``has not been implemented in Turkish law and practice.''\n  On behalf of my fellow Senators, I wish to welcome the priests and \nlay leaders in the 550 parishes across the country, the bishops, the \nMetropolitans of Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Denver, Atlanta, Detroit, \nSan Francisco, and New Jersey; the Archbishops, and especially the \nGreek Orthodox community of Nevada to this year's Clergy-Laity Congress \nhere in Washington, DC. I wish all of you the best for a successful and \nproductive event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6597-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6597-S6598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              13TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SREBRENICA MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to mark the \n13th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.\n  Between July 12 and July 16, 1995, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak Muslim \nmen and boys were slaughtered in the region of Srebrenica in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. This was the largest mass murder in Europe since the \nSecond World War. The killings were committed by the Army of the \nRepublika Srpska, under the direct command of Ratko Mladic, and with \nthe approval of Republika Srpska President Radovan Karadzic.\n  The atrocities in Srebrenica were documented in the November 1995 \nindictment of Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic by the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY:\n\n                      ``Safe Area'' of Srebrenica\n\n       1. After war erupted in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb military forces occupied Bosnian \n     Muslim villages in the eastern part of the country, resulting \n     in an exodus of Bosnian Muslims to enclaves in Gorazde, Zepa, \n     Tuzla, and Srebrenica. All of the events referred to in this \n     indictment took place in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       2. On 16 April 1993, the Security Council of the United \n     Nations, acting pursuant to Chapter VII of its Charter, \n     adopted resolution 819, in which it demanded that all parties \n     to the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a safe area which \n     should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile \n     act. Resolution 819 was reaffirmed by Resolution 824 on 6 May \n     1993 and by Resolution 836 on 4 June 1993.\n       3. Before the attack by Bosnian Serb forces, as described \n     in this indictment, the estimated Bosnian Muslim population \n     in the safe area of Srebrenica was approximately 60,000.\n\n                 Attack on the Safe Area of Srebrenica\n\n       4. On or about 6 July 1995, the Bosnian Serb army shelled \n     Srebrenica and attacked United Nations observation posts that \n     were manned by Dutch soldiers and located in the safe area. \n     The attack on the Srebrenica safe area by the Bosnian Serb \n     army continued through 11 July 1995, when the first units of \n     the attacking Bosnian Serb forces entered Srebrenica.\n       5. The Bosnian Muslim men, women and children who remained \n     in Srebrenica after the beginning of the Bosnian Serb attack \n     took two courses of action. Several thousand women, children \n     and some mostly elderly men fled to the UN compound in \n     Potocari, located within the safe area of Srebrenica, where \n     they sought the protection of the Dutch battalion responsible \n     for the compound. They remained at the compound from 11 July \n     1995 until 13 July 1995, when they were all evacuated by \n     buses and trucks under the control of and operated by Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel.\n       6. A second group of approximately 15,000 Bosnian Muslim \n     men, with some women and children, gathered at Susnjari \n     during the evening hours of 11 July 1995 and fled, in a huge \n     column, through the woods towards Tuzla. Approximately one-\n     third of this group consisted of armed Bosnian military \n     personnel and armed civilians. The rest were unarmed \n     civilians.\n\n\n                           Events in Potocari\n\n       7. On 11 July 1995 and 12 July 1995, Ratko Mladic and \n     members of his staff met in Bratunac with Dutch military \n     officers and representatives of the Muslim refugees from \n     Potocari. At these meetings, Ratko Mladic informed them, \n     among other things, that Bosnian Muslim soldiers who \n     surrendered their weapons would be treated as prisoners of \n     war according to the Geneva Conventions and that refugees \n     evacuated from Potocari would not be hurt.\n       8. On or about 12 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military forces \n     burned and looted Bosnian Muslim houses in and around \n     Potocari.\n       9. On or about 12 July 1995, in the morning hours, Bosnian \n     Serb military forces arrived at the UN military compound in \n     Potocari and its environs.\n       10. On or about 12 July 1995, Ratko Mladic arrived in \n     Potocari, accompanied by his military aides and a television \n     crew. He falsely and repeatedly told Bosnian Muslims in and \n     around Potocari that they would not be harmed and that they \n     would be safely transported out of Srebrenica.\n       11. On or about 12 July 1995, at the direction and in the \n     presence of Ratko Mladic, approximately 50-60 buses and \n     trucks arrived near the UN military compound in Potocari. \n     Shortly after the arrival of these vehicles, the evacuation \n     process of Bosnian Muslim refugees started. As Muslim women, \n     children and men started to board the buses and trucks, \n     Bosnian Serb military personnel separated the men from the \n     women and children. This selection and separation of Muslim \n     men took place in the presence of and at the direction of \n     Ratko Mladic.\n       12. The Bosnian Muslim men who had been separated from \n     other refugees were taken to diverse locations in and around \n     Potocari. On or about 12 July 1995, Ratko Mladic and Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel under his command, informed some of \n     these Muslim men that they would be evacuated and exchanged \n     for Bosnian Serbs being held in Tuzla.\n       13. Most of the Muslim men who had been separated from the \n     other refugees in Potocari were transported to Bratunac and \n     then to the area of Karakaj, where they were\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\n     massacred by Bosnian Serb military personnel.\n       14. Between 12 July 1995 and 13 July 1995, Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men and \n     women at diverse locations around the UN compound where they \n     had taken refuge. The bodies of those summarily executed were \n     left in fields and buildings in the immediate vicinity of the \n     compound. These arbitrary killings instilled such terror and \n     panic amongst the Muslims remaining there that some of them \n     committed suicide and all the others agreed to leave the \n     enclave.\n       15. The evacuation of all able-bodied Muslim refugees \n     concluded on 13 July 1995. As a result of the Bosnian Serb \n     attack on the safe area and other actions, the Muslim \n     population of the enclave of Srebrenica was virtually \n     eliminated by Bosnian Serb military personnel.\n\n\n                        Surrender and Executions\n\n       16. Between the evening of 11 July 1995 and the morning of \n     12 July 1995, the huge column of Muslims which had gathered \n     in Susnjari fled Srebrenica through the woods towards Tuzla.\n       17. Bosnian Serb military personnel, supported by armored \n     personnel carriers, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and artillery, \n     positioned themselves along the Bratunac-Milici road in an \n     effort to interdict the column of Bosnian Muslims fleeing \n     towards Tuzla.\n       18. As soon as the column reached Bosnian Serb held \n     territory in the vicinity of Buljim, Bosnian Serb military \n     forces attacked it. As a result of this and other attacks by \n     Bosnian Serb military forces, many Muslims were killed and \n     wounded and the column divided into several smaller parts \n     which continued towards Tuzla. Approximately one-third of the \n     column, mostly composed of military personnel, crossed the \n     Bratunac-Milici road near Nova Kasaba and reached safety in \n     Tuzla. The remaining Muslims were trapped behind the Bosnian \n     Serb lines.\n       19. Thousands of Muslims were captured by or surrendered to \n     Bosnian Serb military forces under the command and control of \n     Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. Many of the Muslims who \n     surrendered did so because they were assured that they would \n     be safe if they surrendered. In many instances, assurances \n     of safety were provided to the Muslims by Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel who were with other Bosnian Serb \n     soldiers wearing stolen UN uniforms, and by Muslims who \n     had been captured and ordered to summon their fellow \n     Muslims from the woods.\n       20. Many of the Bosnian Muslims who were captured by or \n     surrendered to Bosnian Serb military personnel were summarily \n     executed by Bosnian Serb military personnel at the locations \n     of their surrender or capture, or at other locations shortly \n     thereafter. Incidents of such summary executions include, but \n     are not limited to:\n       20.1 On or about 13 July 1995, near Nezuk in the Republic \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a group of 10 Bosnian Muslim men \n     were captured. Bosnian Serb soldiers summarily executed some \n     of these men, including Mirsad Alispahic and Hajrudin \n     Mesanovic.\n       20.2 On or about 13 July 1995, on the banks of the Jadar \n     River between Konjevic Polje and Drinjaca, Bosnian Serb \n     soldiers summarily executed 15 Bosnian Muslim men who had \n     surrendered or been captured. Amongst those killed were Hamed \n     Omerovic, Azem Mujic and Ismet Ahmetovic.\n       20.3 On or about 13 July 1995, in the vicinity of Konjevic \n     Polje, Bosnian Serb soldiers summarily executed hundreds of \n     Muslims, including women and children.\n       20.4 On or about 17 July 1995 or 18 July 1995, in the \n     vicinity of Konjevic Polje, Bosnian Serb soldiers captured \n     about 150-200 Bosnian Muslims and summarily executed about \n     one-half of them.\n       20.5 On or about 18 July 1995 or 19 July 1995, in the \n     vicinity of Nezuk, about 20 groups, each containing between \n     5-10 Bosnian Muslim men, surrendered to Bosnian Serb military \n     forces. After the men surrendered, Bosnian Serb soldiers \n     ordered them to line up and summarily executed them.\n       20.6 On or about 20 July 1995 or 21 July 1995, near the \n     village of Meces, Bosnian Serb military personnel, using \n     megaphones, urged Bosnian Muslim men who had fled Srebrenica \n     to surrender and assured them that they would be safe. \n     Approximately 350 Bosnian Muslim men responded to these \n     entreaties and surrendered. Bosnian Serb soldiers then took \n     approximately 150 of them, instructed them to dig their own \n     graves and then summarily executed them.\n       20.7 On or about 21 July 1995 or 22 July 1995, near the \n     village of Meces, an excavator dug a large pit and Bosnian \n     Serb soldiers ordered approximately 260 Bosnian Muslim men \n     who had been captured to stand around the hole. The Muslim \n     men were then surrounded by armed Bosnian Serb soldiers and \n     ordered not to move or they would be shot. Some of the men \n     moved and were shot. The remaining men were pushed into the \n     hole and buried alive.\n       21. Many of the Muslims who surrendered to Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel were not killed at the locations of their \n     surrender, but instead were transported to central assembly \n     points where Bosnian Serb soldiers held them under armed \n     guard. These assembly points included, among others, a hangar \n     in Bratunac; soccer fields in Kasaba, Konjevic Polje, \n     Kravica, and Vlasenica; a meadow behind the bus station in \n     Sandici and other fields and meadows along the Bratunac-\n     Milici road.\n       22. Between 12 July 1995 and 14 July 1995, at various of \n     these assembly points, including the hangar in Bratunac and \n     the soccer stadium in Kasaba, Ratko Mladic addressed the \n     Bosnian Muslim detainees. He falsely and repeatedly assured \n     them that they would be safe and that they would be exchanged \n     for Bosnian Serb prisoners held by Bosnian government forces.\n       23. Between 12 July 1995 and 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel arbitrarily selected Bosnian Muslim \n     detainees and summarily executed them.\n\n\n                      Mass Executions Near Karakaj\n\n       24. On or about 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel transported thousands of Muslim detainees from \n     Bratunac, Kravica and other locations to an assembly point in \n     a school complex near Karakaj. At this assembly point, \n     Bosnian Serb military personnel ordered the Muslim detainees \n     to take off their jackets, coats and other garments and place \n     them in front of the sports hall. They were then crowded into \n     the school building and adjacent sports hall and held under \n     armed guard.\n       25. On or about 14 July 1995, at this school complex near \n     Karakaj, Ratko Mladic conferred with his military \n     subordinates and addressed some of the Muslims detained \n     there.\n       26. At various times during 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel killed Bosnian Muslim detainees at this \n     school complex.\n       27. Throughout 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel removed all the Muslim detainees, in small groups, \n     from the school building and sports hall and loaded them onto \n     trucks guarded and driven by Bosnian Serb soldiers. Before \n     boarding the trucks, many of the detainees had their hands \n     tied behind their backs or were blindfolded. They were then \n     driven to at least two locations in the vicinity of Karakaj.\n       28. Once the trucks arrived at these locations, Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel ordered the bound or blindfolded \n     Muslim detainees off the trucks and summarily executed them. \n     The summary executions took place from approximately noon to \n     midnight on 14 July 1995.\n       29. Bosnian Serb military personnel buried the executed \n     Bosnian Muslim men in mass graves near the execution sites.\n       30. On or about 14 July 1995, Ratko Mladic was present at \n     one of the mass execution sites when Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men.\n       31. The summary executions of Bosnian Muslim males, which \n     occurred on 14 July 1995 in the vicinity of Karakaj, resulted \n     in the loss of thousands of lives.\n\n  Since the end of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the ICTY has \nmade considerable progress. Charges have been filed against 161 \nindividuals. Of those, the trials of 114 have concluded, resulting in \n55 convictions; 47 cases are ongoing. Among the Tribunal's greatest \nsuccesses was the August 2001 conviction of Radislav Krstic on the \ncount of genocide. I was recently pleased to learn of the June 11, \n2008, arrest of longtime fugitive Stojan Zupljanin by Serbian \nauthorities, as this was the first capture of a major war crimes \nsuspect in about a year. However, three individuals, including Radovan \nKaradzic and Ratko Mladic, remain at large.\n  It is vital that the remaining three be brought to face the court. It \nis imperative that the rule of law be brought into the international \narena, both for the 8,000 who were killed in Srebrenica in July 1995, \nand for the many others who continue to suffer around the world today \nunder oppressive regimes. I agree with former United Nations Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan, who said during his 1997 visit to the ICTY, \n``impunity cannot be tolerated, and will not be. In an interdependent \nworld, the rule of law must prevail.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6598-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6598-S6599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING SANDRA M. BODIN\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sandra M. Bodin, who \nhas recently completed her services as president of the American \nNephrology Nurses' Association, ANNA, for her dedication and \ncontributions to nephrology nursing and kidney patients across the \ncountry.\n  ANNA's members are registered nurses and health care professionals at \nall levels of practice. They care for patients who are experiencing or \nare at risk for kidney disease. ANNA's mission is to advance nephrology \nnursing practices and positively influence outcomes for patients \naffected by kidney disease through advocacy, scholarship, and \nexcellence.\n  As a member of ANNA, Ms. Bodin has served as president, vice \npresident, and as a member of the Board of Directors. She received the \nRon Brady Memorial Award for Excellence in Volunteer Leadership from \nANNA in 2002. As president, Ms. Bodin has inspired nephrology nurses to \nreach the highest\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nlevels of practice and patient care. She is a visionary leader who has \nimplemented a broad range of initiatives that will continue to improve \ncare for patients whose lives depend on dialysis and other kidney \nreplacement treatments.\n  Professionally, Ms. Bodin graduated with a bachelor of arts and a \nmaster of arts in nursing from the College of St. Scholastica in \nDuluth, MN. She became a registered nurse in 1977 and a certified \nnephrology nurse in 1992. After completing work at Miller-Dawn Medical \nCenter and St. Mary's Hospital, Ms. Bodin is currently the lead \nclinical informatics analyst and application coordinator at the SMDC \nHealth System in Duluth.\n  I honor the efforts of Sandra M. Bodin to promote the care of those \nsuffering from kidney disease and I recognize her achievements as a \nnurse, patient advocate, and healthcare leader. I commend her on her \nservice to the American Nephrology Nurses' Association and our country. \nPlease join me in honoring Ms. Bodin for her years of vision, \nleadership, and commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6599-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6599-S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I work for Micron Technology in Boise \n     Idaho as an Engineer. I love my job, but it is getting harder \n     to pay my mortgage, food, gas and cost of living expenses. My \n     wife used to work for Micron, but she got laid off last \n     summer and has not found a new job. My job as an Engineer \n     covered our expenses, and my wife's job was the extra money \n     we used to go camping, out to dinner, and have fun with. \n     Right now, we are barely getting by. All we do is sit home \n     and complain about the politicians in Washington that are not \n     doing anything to create jobs, lower gas prices and promote a \n     stable economy.\n       I have given up on Washington. I am voting for a third \n     party all the way from now on because the Republicans and \n     Democrats can't play well together.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       Good afternoon Senator Crapo: First of all I want to thank \n     you for the great job you do as my U.S. Senator!\n       I am an avid outdoorsman and like to backpack, hunt, fish, \n     camp and enjoy all that Idaho has to offer! I am also a \n     Scoutmaster with the Boy Scouts of America. In that capacity, \n     it is necessary to have a big truck to haul gear and Scouts \n     around. One of the Laws of Scouting is that a Scout is \n     thrifty and, as such, we (I) make every effort to camp \n     smartly to keep costs down for the parents so as to make \n     scouting more affordable and enjoyable. We also believe in \n     ``Leave No Trace Camping,'' and try very hard to be good \n     stewards of the environment. Up until recently, most of the \n     Scoutmasters, including myself, have donated their trucks, \n     fuel and maintenance costs as part of our monthly campouts. \n     Unfortunately, fuel costs over the last few years have now \n     taken a real toll on us, and we have had to pass many or most \n     of those costs onto the parents. Additionally, my family \n     enjoys camping, and the costs of fuel are definitely \n     negatively impacting our families ability to get out an enjoy \n     nature as much as we used to. Furthermore, as a Scouter, \n     outdoorsman, businessman and family man, I am very \n     concerned about the environment and want to preserve it \n     for my kids, grandchildren and others. Therefore, a very \n     careful look into preserving nature is important to me!\n       For years I have seen the United States being wasteful \n     users of gasoline and other natural resources and sought to \n     do my part to recycle and conserve energy. I have tried in \n     earnest to reduce water waste and electric waste by turning \n     water off as well as lights to reduce use and costs. Last \n     month, I began to carpool with a neighbor on a daily basis to \n     work to cut down on my personal consumption. I am trying to \n     do my part in the effort; however, our country (my country) \n     has been very shortsighted and unwilling to do a number of \n     key things to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and gas.\n       For one, there has been a group within the United States \n     that has successfully put a stranglehold on our ability to \n     develop and extract petroleum products from known oil \n     reserves. They would be best described as ultra radical tree \n     huggers! That is as nice as I can put it! Again, I am an avid \n     lover of nature, but our unwillingness to use those reserves \n     has given OPEC and other oil producers around the world a \n     wonderful opportunity to hold us hostage and run the prices \n     up and watch us squirm! In my opinion some of our citizens \n     and their elected officials have failed to protect our \n     independence in the world market, by allowing ourself to \n     become so dependent on foreign oil.\n       As a respected Senator, I implore you to take this message \n     to the Senate floor and loudly state that enough is enough!!! \n     Remove the obstacles that prohibit the extraction of oil on \n     our soil and within the territorial waters of the United \n     States and get the control of oil back in our hands! \n     Furthermore, with as much scientific talent that exist in our \n     own country, we need to develop cleaner and more efficient \n     vehicles while at the same time finding alternative engines \n     powered by solar, nuclear, hydrogen or other alternative \n     fuels to get our country back within our own control and not \n     other governments or private companies! I enjoy having a big \n     truck for all the activities I like to do, and there must be \n     a safe, efficient, cost-effective power plant that can run a \n     truck as well as a car, and we are long overdue on finding \n     that alternative! Furthermore, the costs in fuel have really \n     driven food costs as well as other household products costs \n     way out of control!!!!\n       I am fed up with the ultra extreme protectionist attitude \n     in this country that has put us in this predicament! I do \n     want responsible, well thought-out procedures to safeguard \n     the environment while at the same time (for the short term) \n     use our own oil while we think of new ways to make driving \n     more cost-efficient, safe and with less pollution to the \n     environment. I seriously think we are more than up to the \n     task and believe that we can safely do both!!!\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       With the price of gas going up, it just does not affect us \n     with how much we drive; it affects groceries and price of \n     common goods like carpet. Up till just this last month, we \n     haven't had to make any drastic changes to our spending \n     habits, but because of the price of everything, we are going \n     to have to. A vacation we were going to take will have to \n     wait, carpet that we were going to purchase will have to be \n     put on hold, etc.\n       What makes matters worse is to find out that China is \n     drilling in the Gulf Coast, right off our shore. Why aren't \n     we drilling there, why aren't we becoming energy independent? \n     If the Senate and the House can't get it right, which is not \n     more taxation I might add, we need to get people in office \n     that will. I thank you that you did not go along with the \n     last bill and hope that you continue to fight for good \n     legislation.\n     Donald, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Thank you so much for the opportunity \n     to offer my views on our energy crisis. I'm 48 years old and \n     grew up on a farm. In fact I can remember buying bulk fuel \n     for 25 cents per gallon. Most of my growing up time gasoline \n     cost between 35 and 50 cents. This is the first time in my \n     life I have ever made decisions based on the cost of fuel! My \n     family spends about $250 per month on fuel and that is a \n     burden but that is not the major problem. Fuel used in \n     industry and transportation has affected the cost of every \n     area of our lives. I know that India and China get the blame \n     for increased demand but I do not believe that is the only \n     factor. ``Green'' is most definitely a factor and I cannot \n     believe the ``science'' behind this movement. Seems they \n     assume that if I do not buy their dogma hook, line, and \n     sinker that I am dooming my children to hell. Please do the \n     correct thing vs the ``political thing'' concerning green. \n     Next, I would wonder about the sense of using our corn crop \n     to make ethanol rather than to feed people. This may be the \n     biggest reason for my increased cost of food. Lastly, America \n     needs to stand for the right, not the popular. I feel that \n     the USA is acting rudderless because we have forgotten what \n     we are. Please read the Constitution and lets get back to \n     where the Founding Fathers wanted us to be. One Nation Under \n     God . . . not one nation under Gore.\n           Thank you\n     Matt.\n                                  ____\n\n       I had heard from a friend of a friend one time that the INL \n     outside of Idaho Falls produces enough energy to easily run a \n     few cities. And that this energy is simply being pumped into \n     the ground and completely wasted. Because the government \n     cannot legally enter into the competitive energy market, I \n     suppose.\n       As INL is a secure site and having never been there, I am \n     not positive this information is accurate. But knowing how \n     our government usually works, I would not doubt that it is \n     all true and to the point.\n       If there is truly energy that can be used at the INL, let's \n     use it! Credit back the INL funds to produce further \n     employment and benefit everyone all around.\n                                                           Robert.\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       I ride my bike. Gas prices for that are $0, pollution is \n     minimal, impact to the roads minimal, and most of all, it is \n     great for my health.\n     Mike, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I now ride a bicycle to deal with the \n     high cost of gasoline. You may be surprised to know that \n     bicycles are about 97% efficient in converting energy to \n     motion. Of course, there are times of the year when this is \n     not practical (like during the winter), so I would make the \n     following recommendation.\n       We need more fuel-efficient motor vehicles, and one way to \n     do that would be to pass legislation limiting the maximum \n     weight of new motor vehicles. The automotive industry could \n     make significant improvements in motor vehicle fuel \n     efficiency if they would all move to lower mass designs. For \n     this, they need a level playing field that also resets safety \n     standards to consider a lower maximum vehicle weight. To \n     achieve a lower vehicle weight, industry would have to employ \n     new or alternative materials. It is not just about the \n     engines.\n     Paul.\n                                  ____\n\n       Three of us work for Scentsy Candles in Meridian, which is \n     26 miles one way. We drive two cars; I get off at 3 pm, and \n     the others get off at 5:30 pm. One car spends 42.00 a week, \n     and the other car spends 48.25 a week. You do the math. When \n     does it stop . . .\n     Douglas, Christine and Colleen, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       The energy prices are outrageous! The only people that it \n     is not affecting are the rich and famous! We are in the \n     process of building a new home . . . and did you know that \n     Idaho does not have any kind of programs that will help a \n     homebuilder with solar panels or windmills. If you are so \n     worried about energy, why not bring some programs that will \n     help people with these kinds of things. In looking at the \n     costs of these things, there is not one program out there \n     that will help the individuals who are barely making it. We \n     would love to go solar and wind, but on top of all the other \n     high costs, there's no way we can afford it. Too bad you \n     aren't as worried as you say you are, or we in Idaho would \n     already have these kinds of programs in effect! All we do is \n     save and help the lazy people who would rather take and take \n     from the government. There are no programs to help the ones \n     that really need it and wouldn't use the system, over and \n     over again.\n       Just think--if we could afford the extra 10-30k for solar \n     panels and all that is needed to make solar energy, we could \n     be selling power back to Avista! But the rich and famous \n     politicians do not have to worry about their energy bills!\n       Eight years ago, I made a statement of ``when Bush is done \n     with this country, no one will be able to afford gas.'' Well, \n     it is almost that time! I sure hit that one right on the \n     money! We need to get our troops out of Iraq, also. If we had \n     all the money that was being spent on a war we can't win \n     (what are we suppose to win anyway?) The government could \n     have already given every citizen in the United State a \n     million dollars to spend any way they wanted to and still \n     have money left! But we have to be killing people and letting \n     our soldiers die, too. When they get injured, we do not do \n     anything for them. How sad is our country, anyway. We \n     shouldn't be fighting with anyone!\n     Denise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have a small sales company that sells new construction \n     hardware for the residential market. This territory is for \n     Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The amount of new construction \n     is way off from two years ago and, coupled with gasoline \n     costing over $4 a gallon, it becomes almost impossible to \n     service the accounts profitably.\n       What do we do to counteract the negative forces? We drive \n     4-cylinder cars that get good mileage, drive less, make more \n     phone calls and hope for improvement in the construction \n     sector.\n       What do we believe would help the current squeeze by high \n     gasoline prices? Encourage more development of the Bakken Oil \n     Formation which stretches across North Dakota, Montana, and \n     part of Saskatchewan. This oil field has 3.65 billion barrels \n     of light sweet crude according to the USGS and that is not \n     counting reserves. What to do with it? Threaten the oil \n     companies with the possibility of taking away the extra tax \n     credits afforded them unless they expedite refinery capacity \n     (Does not matter how much crude without the refining \n     capacity), and give a very concerted effort to begin major \n     extraction from this large pool of oil. This oil field makes \n     a lot more sense than drilling in ANWR when considering the \n     location and amount of crude available. Nuclear? You bet. \n     With today's technology, it makes extreme sense to use \n     nuclear power. The biggest problem of course is waste \n     disposal. How many billions of taxpayer dollars have been \n     spent on Yucca Mountain? Tell the state of Nevada that the \n     facility is the property of the U.S. government and that it \n     will use it according to the best interests of the U.S. \n     citizens.\n       Does Joe Citizen think that we have a big problem with \n     energy right now? You bet. Would the above ideas help? I \n     think so. Can it be done? If the U.S. could put a man on the \n     moon almost 40 years ago and that was not under emergency \n     conditions, why not? A lot of people need to sit down in \n     Washington D.C. and say ``Hey we have a real problem here, \n     let's fix it''. If NASA can put a man on the moon why can't \n     the whole U.S. fix the energy problem?\n           Regards,\n     Gary, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Honorable Mike Crapo: Our youth group used to spend our \n     summers enjoying the absolutely fabulous Idaho backcountry. \n     We used to hike, fish, swim in all the scenic Idaho lakes and \n     rivers. Congress has spent a lot of effort to make sure that \n     these pristine areas are set aside for future generations to \n     enjoy. I applaud their efforts to maintain a balance between \n     energy exploration and the ability to witness the beauties of \n     nature. However, due to the continuing increases in fuel \n     costs, those days of exploring these backcountry wonders is \n     quickly becoming only a shadow. Our youth group is no longer \n     able to afford these backcountry trips due to the fuel \n     expense. With a continued increase in gas cost, it will be a \n     wonder if soon anyone will be able to make the excursion.\n       I would fully support the limited and non-intrusive \n     exploration and exploitation of the vast oil, gas and coal \n     resources our country has been blessed with to maintain the \n     life style that past generations have enjoyed. Open ANWR and \n     our coastlines to these proven reserves. I believe we have \n     the technology to safely capture all the fossil fuel reserves \n     that are within our ability to acquire. It is much better for \n     a good steward like the USA to retrieve these resources in a \n     safer way rather than other countries such as China and India \n     that have been notorious for abandoning sound pollution \n     principles. Nuclear power has a proven track record of safe \n     power production and I would implore the Senate to do \n     everything in their power to open the door to the next \n     generation of even safer nuclear power production and finally \n     opening up the single repository for our spent fuel at Yucca \n     Mountain. Our society will be much better off and our future \n     generations will then be able to continue to witness marvels \n     of nature as we blend environmental and sane land use \n     policies.\n       I consider myself a conservationist and have always ridden \n     my bike to work, but removing the wonders of nature from my \n     life due to gas cost is more than I can bear.\n     James, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6600-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF GENERAL MICHAEL MOSELEY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to say a few \nwords about the retirement of GEN T. Michael Moseley.\n  This morning at Bolling Air Force Base, the Air Force said farewell \nto its 18th Chief of Staff. Buzz Moseley faced a staggering array of \nchallenges during his tenure: Recapitalizing and modernizing the oldest \ninventory of aircraft in the history of the Air Force, training and \ndeveloping young airmen in a tumultuous time, and sustaining ongoing \noperations in two theatres of war as well as a worldwide fight against \nal-Qaida. Buzz tackled those significant challenges head-on, and made \nsubstantial progress in addressing each of them. The crucial role \nplayed by the Air Force in the current fight is often and unfortunately \noverlooked.\n  Over the past 12 months, the Air Force has identified some serious \nlapses in attention to the nuclear mission. There were significant \nproblems, and General Moseley took immediate action to strengthen \ncompliance and discipline, heighten attention to detail and execution, \nexpand inspection and evaluation, and broadly refocus the service on \nthe nuclear mission. He and Secretary Michael Wynne have not received \nthe credit they deserved for their efforts. But even if General Moseley \nwill not be the one to oversee the conclusion of these efforts, there \nis no doubt that the Air Force will be building on the solid \nfoundations laid by Buzz as it continues to aim for the zero-defect \nstandard the American people are entitled to expect when it comes to \nnuclear weapons.\n  The U.S. Air Force has always held its airmen and leaders to the \nhighest standards, and in my view, Buzz Moseley consistently exceeded \nthem throughout more than 36 years of service. He was an outstanding \nleader for the Air Force, and he should be proud of what he \naccomplished there. Our country owes him a deep debt of gratitude. It \nhas been an honor to work with him over the years. But more than that, \nit has been an honor to call him my friend. This great American goes \ninto his retirement with my deepest appreciation. Our fellow citizens \nshould know he is a great patriot who protected our freedoms at great \npersonal sacrifice and with real distinction. GEN Buzz Moseley is among \nour very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6600-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6600-S6601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STRENGTHENING MEDICARE\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to share with my \ncolleagues a disturbing report about the challenges\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nhome health professionals are facing while delivering service to our \nNation's seniors. Too many home health providers have seen not only \ndeclining reimbursement but also increasing fuel costs.\n  Last week, the New York Times highlighted how these challenges are \naffecting several Michigan families and home health providers. Sadly, \nthis is a problem facing the entire Nation. The National Association \nfor Home Care & Hospice's, NAHC, Foundation for Hospice and Homecare \nreleased a study finding that nurses, therapists, and home care aides \nwho serve chronically ill elderly and disabled patients drive nearly 5 \nbillion miles each year. But escalating gasoline prices threaten their \nability to reach their patients, particularly in rural areas. NAHC \nreported that, in Michigan, home health providers drove over 161 \nmillion miles to make nearly 12 million visits to seniors and other \npatients in need of homebound services.\n  As a short-term solution, I urge my colleagues to join with me in \ncalling for the Medicare rural home-health add-on, which expired in \n2006, to be reinstated. The rural add-on bonus will have a huge impact \non the ability of home health providers to serve seniors, particularly \nin remote, rural locations.\n  I ask that a copy of the New York Times article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 5, 2008]\n\n              As Gas Prices Soar, Elderly Face Cuts in Aid\n\n                            (By John Leland)\n\n       South Haven, Mich.--Early last month, Jeanne Fair, 62, got \n     her first hot meals delivered to her home in this lake town \n     in the sparsely populated southwestern part of the state. \n     Then after two deliveries the meals stopped because gas \n     prices had made the delivery too expensive.\n       ``They called and said I was outside of the delivery \n     area,'' said Mrs. Fair, who is homebound and has not been \n     able to use her left arm since a stroke in 1997.\n       Faced with soaring gasoline prices, agencies around the \n     country that provide services to the elderly say they are \n     having to cut back on programs like Meals on Wheels, \n     transportation assistance and home care, especially in rural \n     areas that depend on volunteers who provide their own gas. In \n     a recent survey by the National Association of Area Agencies \n     on Aging, more than half said they had already cut back on \n     programs because of gas costs, and 90 percent said they \n     expected to make cuts in the 2009 fiscal year.\n       ``I've never seen the increase in need at this level,'' \n     said Robert McFalls, chief executive of the Area Agency on \n     Aging in Palm Beach, Fla., whose office has a waiting list of \n     1,500 people. Volunteers who deliver meals or drive the \n     elderly to medical appointments have cut back their miles, \n     Mr. McFalls said.\n       Public agencies of all kinds are struggling with the new \n     math of higher gas prices, lower property and sales tax \n     revenues and increases in the minimum wage. Some communities \n     have cut school bus routes, police patrols, traveling \n     libraries and lawn maintenance. The St. Paul Police \n     Department is encouraging officers to use horses and bikes. A \n     number of state agencies, including those in Utah, are going \n     to four-day workweeks to save energy costs and reduce \n     commuting expenses for their employees.\n       But older poor people and those who are homebound are \n     doubly squeezed by rising gas and food prices, because they \n     rely not just on social service agencies, but also on \n     volunteers.\n       In the survey of agencies, more than 70 percent said it was \n     more difficult to recruit and keep volunteers.\n       Mrs. Fair, who has limited mobility because of diabetes, \n     lives on $642 per month in Social Security widow's benefits, \n     and relies on care from her son, who often works odd hours, \n     especially during blueberry season. ``He says, `You belong in \n     a nursing home; I can't take care of you,' '' Mrs. Fair said.\n       The delivered meals allowed her to eat at regular hours, \n     which helped her control her blood sugar levels, she said. \n     Last year she lost her balance during a change in blood sugar \n     and spent a month in a nursing home.\n       With no meal delivery in her area, Mrs. Fair said her home \n     aide, who comes three times a week, must pick up frozen meals \n     from a center in the next town.\n       ``If my aide can't get the meals, maybe I can get my pastor \n     to pick them up,'' Mrs. Fair said. ``I can't travel even to \n     the drop-off center.''\n       Val J. Halamandaris, president of the National Association \n     for Home Care and Hospice, said that rising fuel prices had \n     become a significant burden for the 7,000 agencies \n     represented by his group, with some forced to close and \n     others compelled to shrink their service areas or reduce \n     face-to-face visits with patients.\n       A recent survey by the group concluded that home health and \n     hospice workers drove 4.8 billion miles in 2006 to serve 12 \n     million clients. ``If we lose these agencies in rural areas, \n     we'll never get them back,'' Mr. Halamandaris said.\n       The agencies, which have suffered from Medicare cuts in \n     recent years, are lobbying Congress to account for fuel \n     inflation in reimbursement rates and to reinstate special \n     increases for providers in rural areas, a program that \n     expired in 2006.\n       In Union, Mich., a town among flat corn and soybean farms \n     near the Indiana border, Bill Harman, 77, relies on a home \n     aide to take care of his wife, Evelyn, who is 85 and has \n     Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Harman has had to use a wheelchair \n     since 2000 because of hip problems.\n       But the aide, Katie Clark, 26, may have to give up the job. \n     She lives 25 miles away and drives 700 miles a week to \n     provide twice-daily visits, helping Mrs. Harman dress in the \n     morning and get to bed at night, feeding her, doing chores \n     around the house. ``And putting up with a grumpy old man,'' \n     she said jokingly to Mr. Harman. Her weekly income of $250 is \n     being eaten up by gas expenses, which come to $100 a week.\n       ``Some weeks I have to borrow money to get here,'' said Ms. \n     Clark, a single mother of two, adding, ``They're just like \n     family to me.''\n       Agencies say they are facing a shortage of home aides, \n     because the jobs have low pay and often require long drives \n     for a few hours of work. ``They can't make any money,'' said \n     Laurence Schmidt, administrator for the Oswego County Office \n     for the Aging, in rural northwest New York. ``So they'll get \n     jobs in nursing homes, where they can drive to one place and \n     work a full shift. That is a statewide problem.''\n       Mr. Harman said that he thought a previous aide might have \n     abused his wife, but that Mrs. Harman was comfortable with \n     Ms. Clark. On a recent afternoon, Mrs. Harman called Ms. \n     Clark ``honey''; Ms. Clark, walking Mrs. Harman to the \n     bathroom, kissed her nose. Mrs. Harman said she was going \n     home. Ms. Clark said, ``You are home, silly.''\n       For her work, Ms. Clark receives $9 an hour. If she leaves, \n     Mr. Harman said, he could not care for his wife.\n       He said that when they married, she raised his five \n     children as if they were her own. When Mrs. Harman started to \n     develop Alzheimer's 8 or 10 years ago, he said, ``I promised \n     her, `Don't worry, I'll take care of you as long as I can.' \n     ''\n       Without an aide, he said, he would have to put his wife in \n     a nursing home, and probably need to live in one himself.\n       For many isolated older people, home delivery of meals \n     provides not just nutrition but also regular contact with the \n     outside world, said Elaine Eubank, president of CareLink, a \n     nonprofit agency that serves elderly people in six counties \n     in Arkansas, delivering 480,181 meals to 18,000 people last \n     year. Because of gas prices, Ms. Eubank said, one center in \n     Monroe County had closed its kitchen, and others were \n     delivering frozen meals two days a week.\n       Mary Margaret Cox, executive director of Meals on Wheels in \n     Greeley, Colo., which serves meals to 300 people a day, said \n     that her agency was trying to avoid shifting to frozen meals, \n     but that it was getting hard to recruit students and teachers \n     who volunteer during the summer.\n       ``Most don't have anyone else checking up on them daily,'' \n     Mrs. Cox said of her clients. ``If we do more frozen meals, \n     they'll lose that daily contact.''\n       Many agencies said their revenues--which come from state, \n     federal and private sources--were not keeping up with their \n     increased expenses. ``We've had one increase from Medicaid in \n     11 years,'' Ms. Eubank said. ``But home care and Meals on \n     Wheels keep people at home for a fraction of the cost of a \n     nursing home. The state pays for care once they're in a \n     nursing home. So our cuts may cost more than they save.''\n       Sandra Prediger, 70, who still drives a car, said higher \n     gas prices hit her every time she needed to go to the doctor. \n     From her senior apartment in South Haven, she was barely able \n     to pay her bills before gas prices rose.\n       ``I try to help some of the ladies around here, driving \n     them to doctors or to the store,'' Miss Prediger said, but a \n     round trip to her doctor or the beauty shop now costs $26 in \n     gas. She has had to ask her friends to pay half. ``I hate to \n     ask,'' she said, ``because they have less than me.''\n       Her Social Security check arrives on the third of the \n     month. For the few days before, her local gas station lets \n     her write a postdated check to fill up.\n       On July 2, Miss Prediger had no money and owed money to the \n     gas station. ``In a few minutes,'' she said, ``my friend \n     Shirley will probably call and say, `Can you take me to Wal-\n     Mart to get needles for my diabetes?' What else can I do?''\n       Barbara Blumka, 67, of Buchanan, Mich., said she would \n     continue delivering 15 or 16 meals a week though she could \n     not afford it. She is driving a Dodge Caravan, a ``gas \n     guzzler,'' she said.\n       ``I see these people's faces,'' said Ms. Blumka, who gets \n     her meals at a senior center. ``They're so appreciative. I \n     think of all the people who took care of my mother in the \n     nursing home. This is my way of giving thanks.''\n       Christine Vanlandingham, development officer for the three-\n     county Area Agency on Aging, said that in three to six \n     months, the agency would have to start cutting meal \n     deliveries to clients who get them now.\n       But Ms. Blumka will continue to help the homebound. Her \n     nieces and nephews were buying her an adult tricycle for \n     other travels. ``It's neon blue,'' she said. ``I'll ride it \n     to the senior center.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6601-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6601-S6602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HONORING ST. STEPHEN'S COMMUNITY HOUSE\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I honor the efforts of St. \nStephen's Community House to designate July 10, 2008, Summer Learning \nDay.\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\n  Located in Columbus, OH, St. Stephen's Community House has worked \ntirelessly to increase awareness of the importance of summer learning \nprograms. Summer breaks in schooling can lead to significant academic \nloss, particularly among students in low-income areas. The efforts of \nSt. Stephen's Community House to partner with the Ohio Department of \nEducation and other community organizations help ensure that children \nall across Ohio have access to high quality summer enrichment programs. \nIts work provides students with meaningful summer activity and helps \nreduce the growing achievement gap in education.\n  In addition, St. Stephen's Community House has demonstrated its \ncommitment to the community through its work with the Children's Hunger \nAlliance and Major League Soccer. Almost half of Ohioans living in \npoverty are under 24 years old, yet only 57,000 out of 500,000 eligible \nchildren participate in Ohio's Summer Food Service program. Working \ntogether, these organizations are expanding summer feeding programs and \nensuring that all Ohio children have access to nutrition throughout the \nsummer months.\n  The dedication of the staff and volunteers of St. Stephen's Community \nHouse to the needs of some of the most vulnerable members of our \ncommunities serves as an inspiration to us all. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in wishing them the best of luck in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6602-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IDAHO STUDENTS WIN FUEL CELL CAR COMPETITION\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on June 20, five Treasure Valley \nMath and Science Center, TVMSC, students won first place overall in the \nHydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge, an alternative energy model \ncompetition held in conjunction with National Science Bowl. The team, \nconsisting of Alex Baca, Andrew Hoth, Kevin Brown and Eddie Smith, and \nalternate Paul Schroeder, also took fifth place honors in the National \nScience Bowl. The competition challenged students to design, build and \nrace fuel cell model cars. The three components on which students were \njudged were the design document, a presentation of the use of hydrogen \nin transportation, and the race itself. The team was coached by Mark \nAnderson, physics teacher at TVMSC, Tony Baca of Hewlett Packard, and \nBarbara Jorden, legislative director for the Idaho Trial Lawyers \nAssociation. The team qualified for Nationals after sweeping the \nregional competition with eight trophies, four of which were for first \nplace.\n  Alex, Kevin, Andrew, Paul and Eddie are all highly accomplished \nstudents, even as seventh and eighth-graders. Their interests range \nfrom the science disciplines of geography, earth science, chemistry, \nmath, biology and computer science to liberal arts disciplines such as \nhistory and English. Their hobbies range from reading, painting, \nplaying music and video and board games to drama, making scale models \nand playing air soft. The boys also participate in sports including \nfootball, soccer and tennis. The breadth of their interests and \ninvolvement will prepare them well for success in high school, college \nand the future careers of their choosing.\n  The Department of Energy, DOE, created the National Science Bowl \ncompetition in 1991 to help promote math and science education in high \nschool and highlight the successes of students who excel in these \nfields. In 2002, DOE expanded the competition to middle school \nstudents.\n  Idaho can be proud of these exemplary students and their coaches for \noutstanding performance in the National Science Bowl and Hydrogen Fuel \nCell Model Car Challenge. Idaho's strong heritage of math, science and \nengineering continues in our young people, keeping our State's student \nacademic standards high and helping prepare Idaho youth for rewarding \ncareers in these fields.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6602-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE MANSFIELD, OHIO, GARDEN CLUB\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the 80th \nanniversary of the Mansfield Garden Club.\n  Since its founding in 1928, the Garden Club has worked diligently to \nserve the Mansfield community. During World War II, members \ndemonstrated their civic commitment by raising Victory Gardens and \nreplacing their flowers with fruits and vegetables, thereby reducing \npressure on the public food supply and boosting community morale. The \nclub's continued work on community improvements over the years has been \nrecognized with numerous awards recognizing their commitment to the \ncommunity. Today, the club's efforts have provided floral plantings at \nthe Mansfield Lahm Airport, landscaping at the Mansfield General \nHospital, and a large circular garden in the city's central park.\n  For more than eight decades, the Mansfield Garden Club's members have \ndemonstrated profound dedication to culture and community and have \nserved as an inspiration to us all.

Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, thousands \nof Americans tragically lost their lives, but the legacies of their \nlives endure. One of those individuals was CeeCee Lyles, a flight \nattendant who perished in Pennsylvania on United Airlines Flight 93.\n  CeeCee was a loving mother, a dedicated wife, and determined \nindividual who spent her life fulfilling dreams. CeeCee was born and \nraised in Fort Pierce, FL, where she attended Fort Pierce Westwood High \nSchool. She raised two sons on her own while working for 6 years as a \nFort Pierce police officer. As a police officer, CeeCee earned the \nreputation of being a tough crime fighter. In 2000, she married Lorne \nLyles and the family relocated to Fort Myers. In the face of financial \nhardships, CeeCee held two jobs, one at a local hospital and the other \nat a powerplant to help care for her sons. In her spare time, CeeCee \nvolunteered at Restoration House, a Christian women's shelter in Fort \nPierce.\n  Eventually, CeeCee walked away from police work to pursue her \nlifelong dream of becoming a flight attendant. She was part of the \nflight crew that helped to overpower the terrorists responsible for \nhijacking Flight 93 and successfully kept them from reaching their \nintended target. On the day she died, she left little doubt that she \nloved her husband and children. From the plane, she told her husband in \na voicemail: ``I want to tell you that I love you. I love you. Please \ntell my children that I love them very much.''\n  In honor of CeeCee's heroism, courage, and dedication to serving \nothers, the city of Fort Pierce has already commissioned a sculpture of \nher for permanent remembrance. As Senator of the State she called home, \nit would give me great pleasure to recognize Ms. CeeCee Lyles by \nplacing her name on a community facility so others will remember the \ngreat American she became during her brief but full life. I call upon \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring a truly great Floridian and \nexemplary American by renaming the post office at 1717 Orange Avenue in \nFort Pierce the CeeCee Ross Lyles Post Office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/11/senate-section/article/S6602-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 3236.

A bill to amend the Internal Revnue Code of 1986 to allow \nbanks to be taxed as limited liability companies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Lincoln, I rise today to introduce the Small Bank \nTax Equity Act.\n  One of the many important duties of Congress is to ensure that the \nvarious laws that govern commerce in this Nation are working as \nefficiently as possible. This can be a significant challenge because of \nthe rate of change and innovation occurring in our world today. \nNevertheless, we need to be aware that changing circumstances can lead \nto obsolescence in our laws, which can have a limiting effect on \neconomic growth and on our ability to compete in an ever-more \nchallenging marketplace.\n  This is as true of our tax laws as it is with any other laws. We \noften speak of the many problems of the Internal Revenue Code, and most \nof them have to do with complexity and perceived unfairness. However, I \nbelieve that the issue of outdated or obsolete provisions that no \nlonger reflect the realities of our changing world is also an obstacle \nthat deserves our attention.\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\n  This is why I am pleased today to be introducing legislation that \nwould reverse an outdated administrative rule and allow banks the \nflexibility to be structured in a much more tax-efficient manner. Under \nour bill, the Small Bank Tax Equity Act, banks that are organized as \nlimited liability companies would be able to elect to be taxed on a \nflowthrough basis. Under this treatment, the bank's shareholders would \nbe taxed each year on the bank's income, but the bank would not also be \nsubject to a second layer of tax on that same income at the entity \nlevel.\n  A little history is in order here. Treasury Department regulations \nhave long allowed limited liability companies to be classified for tax \npurposes as flowthrough entities. Under this classification, the \ncompany's owners are subject to tax on the company's income on a flow-\nthrough basis. This allows the very significant advantage of not being \nsubject to the double taxation characteristic of corporations, as all \nbanks are currently taxed.\n  Those same Treasury Department regulations specifically deny banks \nthat are organized as limited liability companies the benefit of flow-\nthrough tax treatment, even though this favorable treatment is \navailable to other types of businesses. While banks can organize as \nlimited liability companies, for tax purposes, they are taxed as \ncorporations.\n\n  It is important to note that at the time the Treasury Department \nissued these regulations, banking laws actually required all banks to \nbe organized in the corporate form under state law in order to obtain \nfederal deposit insurance. In fact, this requirement was cited in the \nregulations as the reason for the denial of flow-through tax treatment \nto banks that have federal deposit insurance.\n  However, this aspect of the banking laws has been changed. In 2003, \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC, issued regulations \npermitting banks to be organized as limited liability companies and to \nqualify for federal deposit insurance.\n  Following this FDIC action, it was expected that the Treasury \nDepartment would likewise change its regulations to allow banks \norganized as LLCs to enjoy flowthrough tax treatment. However, despite \nthe urging of several Members of Congress, including myself, Treasury \nhas declined to make this change administratively. The continued denial \nof flow-through tax treatment of bank limited liability companies is, \nin my view, unjustified and anti-competitive. Moreover, it fails to \nbring the law up to date with current business practices.\n  In 1996, Congress amended the Subchapter S corporation rules, which \nprovide flow-through tax treatment, to allow banks to be organized as S \ncorporations. This change reflected Congress's belief that the S \ncorporation election should be allowed for banks, just as it is allowed \nfor other businesses meeting the qualifications for this important tax \nregime.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is based on exactly the same \nbelief. The flow-through treatment that would be made available under \nthe bill will give America's smaller banks, including the community \nbanks on which we depend to provide funding to allow small businesses \nto expand and thrive, another option for organizing in the most \nefficient manner.\n  The changes we made in 1996 to Subchapter S to allow banks to elect \nflowthrough tax treatment was very well received by the banking \ncommunity, and today there are thousands of S corporation banks \nthroughout America. The Small Bank Tax Equity Act will mean that banks \nwould be able to choose the limited liability company structure, which \nallows even greater flexibility in raising capital than does the S \ncorporation form of entity. I expect that the election for flow-through \ntax treatment for LLCs allowed under this bill to be as well received \nas the election for S corporation status has been and that many smaller \nbanks, especially newly-established ones, will avail themselves of this \nopportunity.\n  My home State of Utah in 2004 enacted laws allowing banks to be \norganized as limited liability companies. In light of the 2003 FDIC \nrule change that allowed LLC banks to qualify for federal deposit \ninsurance, Utah enacted this legislation in order to facilitate the \nmost efficient and flexible structure for small banks. Other states \nhave passed, or are considering, similar laws. Many others would likely \nfollow suit if the tax rules paralleled the deposit insurance \ntreatment. However, the goals of these states in passing these laws \nwill not be realized until the tax law is also updated to provide \nflowthrough tax treatment for banks that choose to operate in this \nform.\n  The following is a brief technical description of the Small Bank Tax \nEquity Act.\n  The Small Bank Tax Equity Act would provide qualifying banks with an \nelection to be classified for tax purposes as a partnership or to be \ndisregarded as a separate entity, in the case of a bank with only a \nsingle ownernlecting this classification would provide flow-through tax \ntreatment to the electing bank. Under the bill, the election is \navailable to State-chartered business entities that conduct banking \nactivities, that have federal deposit insurance, and that are organized \nas limited liability companies. These are the banks that are excluded \nfrom flow-through treatment under the existing Treasury regulations \nthat were written based on pre-2003 FDIC rules.\n  If a bank makes the election allowed under the Small Business Tax \nEquity Act before the end of a two taxable year transition period \nfollowing enactment, the election would not subject the bank to \nimmediate tax on any appreciation in its assets. Instead, the electing \nbank would be subject to special rules with respect to the taxation of \ngains and losses that are recognized during the ten-year period \nfollowing the election. These special rules mirror the special rules \nthat apply when an entity elects to convert to S corporation status.\n  These special rules would not apply, however, to an electing bank \nthat had begun conducting banking activities after February 12, 2003, \nthe date of the FDIC action allowing State-chartered banks organized as \nlimited liability companies to obtain federal deposit insurance. These \nbanks acted with the expectation that flow-through tax treatment would \nbe available and should not be penalized for the delay in being able to \nobtain that treatment. Thus, under the Small Bank Tax Equity Act, \nmaking the election for flow-through treatment will not trigger any \nspecial tax consequences with respect to inherent gains or losses for \nthese banks.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. They are \nresponsible for creating the most jobs in this Nation, particularly \nduring economic slowdowns, such as we are experiencing now. Smaller \nbanks are important for at least two reasons. They are small businesses \nthemselves, and they serve other small businesses and provide them with \nthe capital they need to grow and create jobs.\n  It is our duty to ensure that America's small businesses operate as \nefficiently as possible. This means that our tax laws need to be \nfriendly and offer flexibility, rather than hidebound and obsolete, in \norder to encourage the kind of growth of which our small business \nsector is capable. This bill would take a very significant step in that \ndirection, and I encourage our colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to provide for \nthe oversight of large trades of over-the-counter energy and \nagricultural contracts to prevent price manipulation and excessive \nspeculation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator \nFeinstein, the Over-the-Counter Speculation Act. This legislation will \nprovide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, with the \nability to detect and prevent price manipulation and excessive \nspeculation. In the currently unregulated over-the-counter commodity \nmarkets, this legislation will close a major loophole in our \ncommodities laws that prevents the CFTC from conducting oversight in \ncertain enforcement activities and obtaining information about trading \nin the unregulated over-the-counter market. It will ensure that large \nenergy and other commodity traders cannot use the over-the-counter \nmarket to hide from the CFTC, escape reporting requirements, or avoid \nCFTC enforcement authorities to require traders to reduce their \nholdings of futures contracts in order to prevent manipulation or \nexcessive speculation.\n  This legislation is based on the work of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations, which I chair, regarding effect of speculation on \nrising energy prices. In 2006, the PSI study, called ``The Role of \nMarket Speculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put the Cop \nBack on the Beat,'' found the following:\n  First, over the past few years, speculators have dramatically \nincreased their activities in U.S. energy commodity markets. Second, \nspeculation has contributed to rising U.S. energy prices.\n  The 2006 report estimated that this increased speculation, \nparticularly through commodity index funds, had contributed about $20 \nto the price of a barrel of oil which was then about $70, or roughly 25 \nto 30 percent of the price. The 2006 PSI report also found that CFTC \naccess to daily reports of large trades of energy commodities is \nessential to its ability to detect and deter price manipulation. It \nrecommended that Congress require reports of large trades on over-the-\ncounter electronic exchanges. The 2006 report also recommended that \nCongress eliminate the Enron loophole to put the cop back on the beat \nin the over-the-counter electronic markets. Since the 2006 PSI report, \nthe amount of speculation has increased significantly and so have \nenergy prices. In 2006, there was about $60 billion invested in \ncommodity index funds. Today there is over $200 billion. Since 2000, \nthere has been nearly a 1200-percent increase in the amount of \nspeculative trading compared to only a 200-percent increase in the \ncommercial trading world. Even this understates the increase in \nspeculation, since the CFTC data classifies futures trading involving \nindex funds as commercial trading rather than speculation. A large \namount of speculative trading is taking place in the unregulated over-\nthe-counter market. Many market experts believe this huge increase in \nspeculation in recent years has boosted oil prices.\n  Last fall, as oil prices were nearing $100 a barrel--$40 a barrel \nlower than they are today--the president and CEO of Marathon Oil said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market. It has to be speculation on the futures market that \n     is fueling this.\n\n  Mr. Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer and Company, \ndescribes the oil market as ``a farce.''\n\n       The speculators have seized control and it's basically a \n     free-for-all, a global gambling hall, and it won't shut down \n     unless and until responsible governments step in.\n\n  In January of this year, as oil hit $100 a barrel, Tim Evans, oil \nanalyst for Citigroup, wrote:\n\n       The larger supply and demand fundamentals do not support a \n     further rise and are, in fact, more consistent with lower \n     price levels.\n\n  That is when oil was at $100 a barrel.\n  At the joint hearing of my PSI Subcommittee and Senator Dorgan's \nEnergy Subcommittee last December, Dr. Edward Krapels, a financial \nmarket analyst, testified:\n\n       Of course financial trading, speculation affects the price \n     of oil because it affects the price of everything we trade . \n     . . It would be amazing if oil somehow escaped this effect.\n\n  He said that as a result of this speculation:\n\n       There is a bubble in oil prices.\n\n  There is some concern that some large traders may be avoiding the \nlimits on holdings and accountability levels that apply to trading on \nthe futures exchanges by trading in the unregulated over-the-counter \nmarket. In the absence of data or reporting on the activity in the \nover-the-counter market, it is difficult to estimate specifically the \nspecific impact of this large amount of unregulated trading on \ncommodity prices. Moreover, even if we were to get better information \nabout unregulated over-the-counter trades, the CFTC has no authority to \ntake action to prevent price manipulation or excessive speculation \nresulting from this unregulated trading.\n  The need to control this speculation is urgent. Only yesterday the \npresidents and CEOs of major U.S. airlines warned about the disastrous \neffects of rampant speculation on the airline industry. The CEOs \nstated:\n\n       Normal market forces are being dangerously amplified by \n     poorly regulated market speculation.\n\n  They further stated:\n\n       Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were \n     purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no \n     intention of ever taking delivery. Today, oil speculators \n     purchase 66 percent of all oil futures contracts, and that \n     reflects just the transactions that are known.\n\n  So it has gone up from 21 percent purchased by speculators on these \noil contracts, these futures, to 66 percent during this period, and \nthat, again, excludes some of the transactions.\n  The CEOs wrote that:\n\n       For airlines, ultra-expensive fuel means thousands of lost \n     jobs and severe reductions in air service to both large and \n     small communities.\n\n  Earlier this year, Congress included legislation on the farm bill \nthat closed the Enron loophole. This legislation closed one of the \nmajor regulatory gaps identified in the 2006 PSI report and then again \nin the 2007 PSI report on how a single hedge fund named Amaranth \ndistorted natural gas prices through, in part, using the over-the-\ncounter electronic exchanges that were not regulated under the Enron \nloophole.\n  The legislation to close the Enron loophole placed over-the- counter \nelectronic exchanges under CFTC regulation. However, that legislation \ndid not address the separate issue of trading in the rest of the over-\nthe-counter market, which includes bilateral trades through voice \nbrokers, swap dealers, and direct party-to-party negotiations. The \nlegislation we are introducing today builds on that previous \nlegislation and addresses the rest of the over-the-counter market.\n  Additionally, I have already introduced legislation with Senators \nFeinstein, Durbin, Dorgan, and Bingaman, S. 3129, to close the ``London \nloophole.'' This loophole has allowed crude oil dealers in the United \nStates to avoid the position limits--limits on their holdings--that \napply to trading on U.S. futures exchanges by simply directing their \ntrades onto the ICE Futures Exchange in London. The legislation we have \nintroduced has been incorporated into legislation introduced by Senator \nDurbin, S. 3130, which also would give the CFTC more resources and \nenable them to better obtain information about index trading and the \nswaps market.\n  After these two bills were introduced, the CFTC imposed more \nstringent requirements upon the ICE Future Exchange's operations in the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\nStates, and for the first time the London exchange imposed comparable \nposition limits in order to be allowed to keep its trading terminals in \nthe United States. This is the very action our legislation called for.\n  However, although the CFTC took those important steps that will go a \nlong way toward closing the London loophole, Congress still needs to \npass the legislation to make sure the London loophole is closed. The \nlegislation would put the conditions the CFTC has imposed upon the \nLondon exchange into statute, and ensure that the CFTC has clear \nauthority to take action against any U.S. trader who is manipulating \nthe price of a commodity or excessively speculating through the London \nexchange, including requiring traders to reduce positions.\n  There are additional steps that need to be taken to address the issue \nof ensuring that increasing speculation in our commodity markets is not \ndriving up commodity prices.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a practical, workable \napproach that will enable the CFTC to obtain key information about the \nover-the-counter market to enable it to prevent manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. It will provide the CFTC with the authority to \ntake action in the over-the-counter market to prevent excessive \nspeculation and price manipulation, such as by requiring large traders \nto reduce their holdings of futures contracts. It enables the CFTC to \nobtain information on large trades in the over-the-counter market so it \ncan determine whether any trader or class of traders has excessive \nholdings that may affect market prices, and whether such positions \nshould be reduced.\n  This legislation will ensure that large traders cannot avoid the CFTC \nreporting requirements by using the unregulated over-the-counter market \ninstead of the regulated exchanges. It will ensure that the CFTC can \ntake appropriate action, such as by requiring reductions in holdings of \nfutures contracts against traders with large positions in order to \nprevent price manipulation or excessive speculation, regardless of \nwhether the trader's position is on an exchange or in the over-the-\ncounter market.\n  The approach in this bill is practical and workable. I thank Senator \nFeinstein for her important support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The Levin-Feinstein ``Over-the-Counter Speculation Act''\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The Levin-Feinstein ``Over-the-Counter Speculation Act'' \n     would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \n     authority to direct a trader to reduce its positions in the \n     OTC market to prevent price manipulation and excessive \n     speculation in CFTC-regulated markets. To provide the CFTC \n     with information necessary to prevent price manipulation and \n     excessive speculation in these markets, it also would extend \n     the large trader reporting requirement in the Commodity \n     Exchange Act (CEA)--which currently applies only to trading \n     on the regulated futures exchanges--to trading in the \n     unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) market.\n       Under current law, the CFTC's market oversight and \n     surveillance does not extend to the OTC market, and the \n     CFTC's authority over traders in this market only applies if \n     the trader has a position on one of the CFTC-regulated \n     markets. This bill would extend the CFTC's market oversight \n     and surveillance to large trades in the OTC market, \n     regardless of whether the trader also has a position on a \n     futures exchange, and provide the CFTC with the necessary \n     authority to take action in the OTC market to prevent price \n     manipulation or excessive speculation.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       As a result of various exclusions and exemptions in the CEA \n     and CFTC regulations, commodity trading in the over-the-\n     counter markets is largely unregulated, although trading in \n     these markets may have a direct and substantial effect upon \n     the prices of contracts for future delivery of those same \n     commodities on futures exchanges regulated by the CFTC. \n     According to some estimates, trading of swaps and other \n     instruments in the OTC market exceeds by several multiples \n     the trading of futures contracts in the regulated futures \n     markets.\n       There is substantial concern excessive speculation in the \n     OTC market may be contributing to the extraordinary commodity \n     price increases of the past several months. There is also \n     concern that some large traders may be avoiding the position \n     limits and accountability levels that apply to trading on the \n     futures exchanges by trading in the unregulated OTC market. \n     In the absence of data or reporting on the activity in the \n     OTC market, however, it is difficult to evaluate the specific \n     effect of this large amount of unregulated trading on \n     commodity prices. Moreover, even if the data were to show \n     that large trading in the OTC market is affecting prices, or \n     that traders are using the OTC market to avoid position \n     limits in the regulated markets, the CFTC has limited \n     authority to take action to prevent any price distortions \n     that may result from such trading.\n\n\n                          Explanation of Bill\n\n       CFTC Oversight Authority. The bill provides the CFTC with \n     authority to require large traders in the OTC market to \n     reduce holdings, or suspend trading, in order to prevent \n     price manipulation or excessive speculation.\n       Reporting of Large Over-the-Counter Trades. The bill \n     requires the CFTC to promulgate regulations requiring the \n     reporting of large OTC transactions in order to detect and \n     prevent potential price manipulation or excessive \n     speculations.\n       Recordkeeping for Large Over-the-Counter Trades.
