He talks about her all the time. He is \nfrom Baltimore. She used to give him pennies for memorization, and even \nat that, I am sure she lost a lot of money because he has such a great \nmind. He is the only person I have dealt with over the years with a \nmemory that is comparable to Senator Byrd who has the ability to recite \nthings.\n  I want to make sure those listening to this prayer understand that we \ndon't take this great man for granted.

This morning, following the time Senator McConnell and I \nmay use, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an \nhour. The time is equally divided and controlled. The majority will \ncontrol the first half; Republicans will control the final half. \nFollowing morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nH.R. 3222, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, and then \nconduct up to 30 minutes of debate with respect to the Graham amendment \nrelating to emergency funding for border security. A vote in relation \nto that amendment will occur once the time is used or yielded back, \naround 11 or shortly thereafter.\n  I know I speak for the managers when I say that if Members have any \namendments, they better get here because Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye won't wait. In fact, I think they will ask consent when the bill \nis on the floor that at a certain time, if no other amendments are \noffered, the only amendments in order would be those filed up to that \ntime. Cloture was filed--not that it is necessary. We hope it isn't. I \nhope we can finish this bill today. I have had a short conversation\n\n[[Page S12454]]\n\nthis morning with the Republican leader. We are moving along. If we can \nfinish these two bills this week, we will have done half of what we are \nobligated to do regarding the appropriations bills.\n  I think at that stage--and I told the Republican leader--we are going \nto start conferences on all these bills we have passed, four already, \nstarting today. We need to be in a position where we can start sending \nsome of these bills to the President. As I indicated, I will confer \nwith the Republican leader as to which ones we should send out first. \nWe need to get moving along.\n  We have to do everything within our ability to try to finish our work \nby November 16. That is not going to be easy, but we should try. As I \nhave indicated previously, there are a lot of things left to be done \nprior to the Senate recessing on November 16 and work to be done prior \nto our recess--hopefully, tomorrow--dealing with various work we think \nwe can do by unanimous consent. I urge Members to continue the level of \ncooperation we have witnessed, as we consider other appropriations \nbills.\n  I have also explained this to Senator McConnell, my desires in that \nregard; that is, as soon as we get back, that we start to complete the \nLabor-HHS bill. Before we leave here this week, we are going to do a \ncircuit judge and a number of district court judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12454-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, imagine living under a brutal regime \nthat sends out troops to shoot and kill unarmed, innocent people in the \nstreets.\n  Imagine living under a regime that rewards the winner of a popular \nelection not with political office, but house arrest.\n  And imagine a regime that carelessly allows the bloody and bruised \nbody of a Buddhist monk, whose only crime was presumably to protest on \nbehalf of peace, to float down a river.\n  But we don't have to use imagination, Mr. President. These horrific \nevents are real. They are occurring now.\n  They are actually taking place in Burma, a country ruled by an \nillegitimate military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, \nor SPDC. And since their seizure of power, the Burmese people have seen \nvery little peace or development.\n  The world was reminded of the SPDC's oppression recently as Burmese \ndemocracy activists, led by Buddhist monks, demonstrated for freedom.\n  The government's reaction was brutal and barbaric, like something \nrarely seen since the end of the Cold War. They unleashed soldiers to \nfire at the unarmed demonstrators, killing untold numbers.\n  No one can be sure of the exact number because of the secrecy in \nwhich the SPDC cloaks the entire country. Nor can we be sure how many \nactivists the government has imprisoned.\n  But we do know the fate of democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of Burma's last free \nparliamentary elections in 1990. The SPDC has kept her under house \narrest for 12 of the last 18 years.\n  We are reminded that such tyranny still exists in the 21st century. \nThis despotic regime does not even pretend to seek to adhere to basic \nstandards of human dignity.\n  The SPDC's reign of terror is so complete that even simply turning \noff the television set is an act of political courage for a Burmese \ncitizen.\n  The AP reported yesterday that people in Rangoon are switching off \nthe first 15 minutes of the government-run nightly news broadcast. It \nis one of the last acts of protest they have left, after the uniformed \nthugs and the barbed wire barricades have taken over the \nstreets. ``This is the least dangerous anti-government activity that I \ncan take,'' the AP quoted one Rangoon woman, who was too afraid to \nreveal her name, as saying. ``By doing this, I am showing that I am not \nlistening to what the government is saying.''\n\n  This Senate shares her contempt for the SPDC's empty words. Listen to \nhow one SPDC ambassador explained events in Burma since the crackdown:\n  ``As all are aware, things have calmed down. We are able to bring \nnormalization to the situation.''\n  Such a description, Mr. President, reminds me of the ancient Roman \ndictum, ``They made a desert, and then called it peace.''\n  Just because the protests have been ruthlessly suppressed, and Burma \nis fading from the pages of Western newspapers, does not mean the value \nof Burma's pro-democracy cause has diminished.\n  On the contrary, now more than ever, America and our allies must \ncontinue to press the members of the U.N. Security Council for a strong \nresolution against the Burmese regime.\n  And here in Washington, DC we're going to leave our televisions \nturned on, and continue to help in any way we can to support these \nbrave people's cries for freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12454-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the calendar has just turned to \nOctober. The long-awaited month of September has passed. Why September? \nSeptember, the month of the Petraeus report, was to be the month of \naccountability for Iraq, for its Government, and a time for \naccountability of the President's policy in Iraq. Instead, the result \nof the long-awaited month of September is that we are, once again, \nstaying the course, as the President would have us do. We were not able \nto change course through the Defense authorization bill which passed \nyesterday, though many of us tried. Our efforts to change the mission \naway from deep involvement in Iraq's civil war and toward a more narrow \nfocus on fighting al-Qaida failed, by a narrow margin, but failed. \nEfforts to enforce the transition with the power of the purse came up \nshort as well.\n  Tragically, for well over 4 years into this war, at a time when the \nArmy chief of staff is sounding the alarm about readiness of our Army, \nthe Senate was not even able to provide our troops and their families \nwith predictable deployment schedules--a stunning week. This is far \nless than the American people expect from us, when they elected us to \ndo far more. Over the next few months, I implore my colleagues to use \nthis time well and to think deeply about what our commitment in Iraq \nmeans to our future and the world. I especially want my colleagues and \nthe American people to think about what might happen if there is \nanother attack on the United States, which is always a possibility. The \nfact there has not been says there has been some interdiction and a lot \nof good luck, and al-Qaida takes its time in planning what it really \ncares about.\n\n  What if that attack has nothing to do with Iraq? What if the next \nattack is the result of planning and plotting\n\n[[Page S12455]]\n\nfrom al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates who live in a safe haven on \nthe Pakistani border? Will we regret that we did not do more to force \nthe President to focus on the real threat facing this country--the only \nthreat which wants to take us down in any way, shape, or form, which is \npossible?\n  We cannot continue to repeat the same mistakes over and over. It is \npast time for a thorough understanding of how we got to be mired in \nIraq's civil war, and why we must get out of it.\n  I am often reminded of a prescient quote from Sandra Mackey in her \nbook, ``The Reckoning: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein,'' which \nwas written, incidentally, before the war began.\n  Her book posed the central question: Would a future Iraq without \nSaddam Hussein be even more unstable and more problematic for the \nsecurity of the United States itself?\n  Mackey did what this administration failed to do prior to the war and \ncontinues to fail to do today. She studied the historical, religious, \nethnic, and political landscape that produced Iraq and the combination \nof the above factors that produced Saddam Hussein's dictatorship and \nallowed it to be sustained. She did her homework on the background and \nthe nature of the country and the people and the ebb and the flow of \nthe forces that have worked there for 1,500 years.\n  She predicted that we would pay a great price for our ignorance and \nutter lack of understanding of Iraq as a country.\n  She wrote in her book, looking back to the first gulf war, and now \nthe future:\n\n       Then, in August of 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the \n     media turned its pages and air time over to Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Just say the word ``Saddam,'' and you had people's attention, at \nleast for a few moments.\n\n       Ever since, it has been Hussein, not Iraq, on whom \n     Americans and their [civilian] leaders have riveted their \n     attention. But the time is fast approaching when the United \n     States, for a series of perilous reasons, will be forced to \n     look beyond Hussein to Iraq itself. That is when all \n     Americans will pay the price for what has been a long night \n     of ignorance about the land between the rivers.\n\n  That being the Tigris and the Euphrates.\n  What a horrible price it is: 3,800 brave men and women killed; nearly \n28,000 wounded, maimed, and scarred--most mentally and/or physically \nfor the rest of their lives. Families have been torn apart. Divorce and \nsuicide rates are climbing rapidly. Last year, 99 of our soldiers \ncommitted suicide, which is the highest rate since the Army started \nkeeping records on that 26 years ago.\n  The war has cost us as a people and our security so dearly in lives, \nresources, our standing around the world, our sense of ourselves, our \nself-esteem, and our moral authority.\n  It tears my heart out that our troops are dying every day and \nsuffering from these horrific wounds which are the new property of the \nrecent years because of the White House's misguided policies from which \nit will not move.\n  So I ask, why must we remain bogged down in Iraq--at such great \ncost--when there is a far greater threat that we must face and are not \nfacing? Instead of focusing our resources on Iraq's civil war, we \nshould be focusing all of our efforts on the elimination of al-Qaida, \nand, incidentally, doing something called protecting the American \nhomeland, which seems to be casually handled in budget and in action.\n  We must finally understand the fundamental fact that our brave and \nhighly skilled soldiers cannot resolve Iraq's internal political, \nsocial, and religious fights--there is no argument about that--\nparticularly when enormous majorities of these people--98 percent of \nSunni Arabs and 84 percent of Shia--want our forces to leave the \ncountry. That is more than a hint.\n  This is not defeat. It is not surrender. It is not retreat. It is \nsimply getting a grip on the problems we face.\n  The reality is, it is not our fight. We cannot contribute there. \nThere is very little we can do to affect it, if anything. Iraq is \nchaotic and violent because of deep-seated, centuries-old disputes that \nhave nothing to do with us. It will likely remain chaotic and violent \nfor the long foreseeable future, whether our military is involved in \ntheir dispute or whether it is not involved. It will not make any \ndifference.\n  We had an open intelligence hearing in which a number of experts, \nArabists came and told us that, in fact, America is marginal to what is \ngoing on over there. It is all about Sunnis and Shias and Kurds, and \nabout their ancient fights going all the way back to the death of \nMuhammad. So this sectarian war has nothing to do at all with the \nUnited States, and it has nothing to do with our true enemy, al-Qaida, \nwhich has only latched on to the sectarian competition to take \nadvantage of our own mistaken involvement in it.\n  The only thing that can change the course of Iraq is the Iraqi people \nand their leaders, and only if they can make dramatic changes in the \nway they view one another. I do not think that day will come. That is \nthis Senator's opinion. We have examples of people getting along on a \ntemporary basis when there are lots of troops around, other things, but \nthat is not in their nature. It is not in the nature of that part of \nthe world. We like to think it is because that is our nature. But it is \nnot their nature.\n  There is, however, a vital strategic and tactical role for our \nmilitary, and that is eliminating al-Qaida. But it first requires \nunderstanding that global terrorism inspired by al-Qaida is a different \nproblem from sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia. That is what \nyou have to understand first--very simple, very plain. Our present \npolicy continues to follow al-Qaida's playbook by conflating these two \nproblems to create one single-minded ``enemy,'' thereby tying several \ndifferent strands of violence into a single tangled knot. We must untie \nthis knot and address these issues separately. And we must recognize \nthat our involvement with Iraq is drastically diminishing our ability \nto do anything about al-Qaida.\n\n  The war against al-Qaida and affiliated terrorists has two key \ncomponents, in this Senator's point of view: a tactical component--\nwhich is tracking, catching, and killing terrorists and disrupting \ntheir plots--and a strategic component--which is addressing the \ncircumstances that produce terrorists and countering the ideology that \ndrives them.\n  Our war in Iraq diverts our military and intelligence resources from \nthe tactical component--it is very clear that al-Qaida is gaining \nstrength along with the Taliban in Afghanistan because we moved a lot \nof people out to fight a war that we had no business being in, and so \nwe suffered where we originally were about to be strong--and it limits \nthe amount of money available to address poverty and evolution of \ngovernments in the Muslim world.\n  But perhaps the most damaging effect of the war in Iraq is the war of \nideology. The Intelligence Committee has held several hearings this \nyear looking at the role of ideology in the struggle against violent \nextremism. There is plenty of evidence, including unclassified \nintelligence assessments, that al-Qaida has successfully exploited the \nwar in Iraq to recruit and train a new generation of terrorists--thanks \nto us. We have made that a possibility for them. Civilian leadership \nhas handed them that golden gift, and they have made good use of it.\n  But there is longer term damage the war in Iraq is doing to our \ncounterterrorism efforts. It is making it impossible for us to make any \nprogress in the war of ideas throughout the Muslim world. It is clear \nthat winning this part of the war is the only way we will have an \neffect in the long term on this kind of instability and chaos.\n  Al-Qaida wants us to stay in Iraq. As I said, we are following their \ngame plan faithfully because our presence validates everything about \ntheir message of Westerners trying to dominate Muslims and occupy their \nlands--all of which is sacred to them. As long as we are there, voices \nof moderation toward the West will be drowned out.\n  The bottom line is this: Continued U.S. involvement in Iraq is in al-\nQaida's interest, not America's. The longer we stay mired in Iraq, the \nstronger al-Qaida will grow.\n  Again, declassified intelligence reports and a broad spectrum of \nexperts have noted al-Qaida is as strong as any other time since 9/11--\nthis day--and growing stronger.\n  President Bush says we should not allow Iraq to become ``a safe-haven \nfrom which they could launch new attacks on our country.'' Yet the \nPresident has already allowed al-Qaida to\n\n[[Page S12456]]\n\ncreate a safe haven, a huge safe haven on the Pakistani border. That \nsituation is deteriorating on a daily basis, and it allows al-Qaida to \ncontinue to plan deadly attacks. And, believe me, that is their purpose \nfor existing and living, and that is what they want from us. We have \ngiven them what they want from us.\n  Our struggle to eliminate global terrorism may remain a mystery to \nour President, but it must not remain a mystery to us in the Congress \nand to the American people. We do have a responsibility to act. Whether \nhistory looks kindly on this Congress or not is not really so \nimportant. But we must take every single serious measure available to \nforce the President to face reality and refocus America's mission in \nthat part of the world.\n  We have created deep and profound sadness and left thousands of \npeople sitting in wheelchairs for the rest of their lives with shards \nof steel through their bodies that cannot be removed by surgeons. So \nthey sit in wheelchairs in agony for the rest of their lives. They \ncannot take them out because they are too close to organs, arteries, so \nthey sit in agony, probably a great number of them wishing they had \njust simply been killed.\n  I will end that part and simply say that I would also like to remind \nthe President of the United States that signing the CHIP bill won't \nchange anything in Iraq, but it may have a whole lot to do with \nchanging young people in America in the way they grow up, what their \nopportunities are, and their sense of optimism and commitment to public \nservice and to the good of our country.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator a \nquestion, but first I want to thank him for his very thoughtful and \nalmost scholarly exposition of an examination of the situation in which \nwe find ourselves in Iraq. I thank him for the service to his country, \nfirst in State government, rising to the position of Governor of his \nState, and now these many years as the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The question I want to ask the Senator is, in his statement about the \nantipathy between Sunnis and Shiites--and he noted the historical \nantipathy as it goes back, he said, to the time of Muhammad. Indeed, we \nsaw that first erupt from--I guess it was Muhammad's grandson at the \nBattle of Karbala in 680 A.D., and as a result of the murder--or the \ndefeat of the grandson at that point, it was that group that was \ndefeated that went on, out of revenge, to become the Shiites--a \nminority among all Muslims but nevertheless one that was potent and \nbuilt on revenge. Is this the understanding of history the Senator from \nWest Virginia recalls in his statement and why it is so difficult for \nus as an outside power to come in, in the middle of that sectarian \nstrife, and try to bring about reconciliation?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida, as usual, \nis correct. I thank him for his kind comments; he is not quite so \ncorrect about that.\n  But, yes, that is very much the case. It is simply an example of why \nit is that America--why intelligence is the spear, the tip of the \nspear, and that we never do anything ever again without listening to \nour intelligence--not to Chalabi, not to Richard Perle, but to our \nintelligence--which told us all of these things, which told us what \nwould happen, timidly at first but more boldly later on.\n  We just live in a different world. We are homesteaders. I have always \nfelt that way.\n  After the industrial revolution, the East got sort of flooded up with \nfolks who had come from other places, and they went out West with the \nGold Rush and the land rush, they got their 10 square acres and built \ntheir houses and picket fences and went about educating their children \nand doing good things but paying very little attention to the rest of \nthe world because there was no apparent reason to do so. We had never \nbeen attacked since 1812, and that was marginal, and 1941 had not \narrived. This awakened us in many ways, but, in fact, it really didn't. \nConscription for World War II passed the Congress, I believe--or one \nHouse of the Congress--I believe by one vote, after Pearl Harbor. We go \nover and we fight just wars, and then we come back and we disarm.\n  It is not in our nature to know about the rest of the world. There is \nnot a profound curiosity factor that pulls us, now that we are very \nmuch a part of the world, to understand what is going on in other parts \nof the world and in specific countries where there happens to be a \nthreat of people who have come to see us as greedy, hate our green \nlawns and picket fences, and think that our view of life and morality \nis way off. They are very serious about that. We slough it aside, but \nthey are very serious about that.\n  So how we thought we could somehow do this, come in and mediate \nsomething which had been going on I would say since the death of \nMuhammad in 632--but that doesn't matter; it is a question of how his \nsuccession would be carried out. That has lasted ever since. The \nBritish and French came in and created a place called Iraq, but the \ntribal people who kept living all through those years there were always \nthe same and their habits were always the same, and, in fact, it is \ntrue throughout most of the rest of the world, if you go to the \nPhilippines, if you go to many places--revenge, tribal loyalties, as \nopposed to central government loyalties. I have never been convinced \nthat a constitution or a parliament means a whit to the people of Iraq. \nIt meant everything to us because it is sort of the definition of \ndemocracy on the rise, but I don't think it made any difference to them \nat all.\n  So we misread because we don't read, we don't read and we don't \nstudy, we don't go, we don't learn languages because we don't think we \nhave to, and we have not had to because the world has been very \nsimple--the Soviet soldiers in uniform versus American soldiers in \nuniform, our various planes, tanks, and all the rest of it, but then a \nred phone on each side to try to calm things down. The world is no \nlonger simple. Everybody looks like everybody else in very dangerous \nplaces.\n  When we entered into Iraq, it was without thought, it was without \nstudy. The decision was more or less made within 2 or 3 days of 9/11, \nwhich, when you think about it, is rather silly. So there was no real \nunderstanding of Iraq, even as there is no real understanding of Iran \ntoday, no understanding of North Korea. There is a superficial \nunderstanding, the dramatic parts--nuclear this, something else that, \nstarvation that. But who are they?\n  Why is it that North Korea and South Korea--44 million in the south, \n22 million in the north--that amongst all of those people, 66 million \npeople, there are only 400 surnames--``Nelson'' being a surname, \n``Rockefeller'' being a surname--there are only 400 surnames. The world \nis mixed and varied.\n  Japan disappeared for 250 years during the Tokugawa era. Nobody could \nget in, nobody could get out. That was just 150 years ago, and they \nstill bear some of that with them. Do we understand that? I don't think \nwe do. They are a democracy. Are they? They were handed their \nConstitution by GEN Douglas MacArthur, and except for a period of 3 \nmonths--and I was there during those 3 months--in the last 60 years, \none party has controlled the country in its entirety.\n  So there are many things to understand in this world, but among those \nplaces we did not understand and still do not are the vicissitudes of \nIraq, the Sunni and the Shiites, each of them bearing within them many \nlayers of competition, revenge, family feuds, all the rest of it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senate has just witnessed \none of the most insightful analyses by the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee on the present-day changes on planet Earth and \nhow the United States should adapt to it by virtue of the fact of \nrecounting history. This Senator is grateful to his chairman for that \nstatement.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12456-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12456-S12476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, the Senate is poised to take action \ntoday that is more than two years overdue. Today we will pass the \nFiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization bill.\n  For the first 27 years after Congress created the intelligence \noversight committees, the annual authorization bill was considered \nabsolute-must-pass legislation. Its importance to our national security \nwas obvious to all. But in 2005 and 2006, the bills reported out of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee were never even brought before the Senate \nfor consideration. I still cannot explain the reasons this happened, \nbut thanks to hard work of the committee and the support of the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, we are about to correct that failing.\n  The Intelligence Authorization bill is the tool the Congress uses to \nprovide direction for the execution of some of the most sensitive and \nimportant national security programs conducted by the U.S. Government. \nThis year's bill contains provisions, including specific requests from \nthe Director of National Intelligence, intended to improve the work of \nthe intelligence community. These provisions provide greater \nflexibility and authority to the DNI; require greater accountability \nfrom the intelligence community and its managers; improve the \nmechanisms for conducting oversight of intelligence programs; and \nreform intelligence program acquisition procedures.\n  Let me take a few minutes to provide my colleagues with more detail \non the provisions in each of these areas.\n  The most significant reform of the intelligence community since its \ninseption in 1947 was the creation of the director of National \nIntelligence. With 2 \\1/2\\ years of experience behind us, we have begun \nidentifying ways to bolster the DNI's efforts to better coordinate the \n16 different elements of the intelligence community. Starting with \npersonnel authority, this bill uses a more flexible approach to \nauthorize personnel levels and also gives the DNI the ability to exceed \nthose ceilings by as much as 5 percent.\n  Because control of the budget is a key tool for the DNI, the bill \nchanges reprogramming requirements to make it easier to address \nemerging needs, authorizes the DNI to use interagency funding to \nestablish national intelligence centers, and establishes a contingency \nfund for the DNI, to react to emergencies or unforeseen opportunities. \nThe bill also enables the DNI to fund information-sharing efforts that \nspan across the intelligence community. Finally, it repeals several \nunneeded and burdensome reporting requirements.\n  As it increases the authority of the DNI, the bill also improves \noversight of the intelligence community. The bill creates a strong, \nindependent inspector general for the intelligence community, confirmed \nby the Senate, within the office of the DNI, and establishes statutory \ninspectors general at the NSA, NRO, DIA and NGA. The bill also gives \nthe Congress more oversight of the major intelligence agencies by \nrequiring Senate confirmation of the directors of the NSA, NRO and NGA \nand establishing a Senate-confirmed deputy director for the CIA. And as \nwe increase the DNI's flexibility to manage personnel, we require an \nannual assessment of personnel levels across the intelligence community \nto include a statement that those levels are supported by adequate \ninfrastructure, training and funding, and a review of the appropriate \nuse of contractors.\n\n  The committee has been concerned that intelligence failures and \nprogrammatic blunders too often occur without anyone in a position of \nresponsibility being held accountable. The bill gives the DNI the \nauthority to conduct accountability reviews across the intelligence \ncommunity if he deems it necessary or if requested by Congress. It also \nimproves financial management by requiring a variety of actions related \nto the production of auditable financial statements--a standard most \nintelligence agencies cannot currently meet and an issue the committee \nhas focused on for several years.\n  The final major theme in the bill is the reform of the acquisition \nprocess. The bill requires a vulnerability assessment for all major \nacquisition programs, and attempts to curb the profligate cost overruns \nand schedule delays we have witnessed in recent years by creating an \nannual reporting system on all major intelligence community \nacquisitions similar to the Nunn-McCurdy statute for defense \nacquisitions.\n  In addition to these legislative provisions, the bill is accompanied \nby a classified annex that includes specific budget recommendations. \nThe budgets are necessarily classified, but any Senator wishing to \nreview them has had that opportunity. The committee budget \nrecommendations include a substantial increase for advanced research \nand development programs. The classified annex also includes language \ndirecting the intelligence community to restructure its strategy for \nacquiring imagery intelligence systems.\n  All of these provisions, in the public bill and the classified annex, \nare important to ensuring that the intelligence community has the \nauthority and resources it needs to protect this country, and that \nthere are mechanisms in place for appropriate oversight of these very \nsensitive programs.\n  Before I conclude I would be remiss if I did not mention the people \nwho worked so hard to get this bill to this point. First and foremost \namong those is my incredibly dedicated vice chairman, Senator Kit Bond. \nHe has been tireless in his efforts to identify and remove obstacles to \nthe bill's passage. We would not have gotten here today without that \neffort. His commitment to real oversight, conducted in a bipartisan \nway, represents a return to the way the committee had operated for most \nof its history.\n  Next let me thank the members of the staff who played such a key role \nin preparing the bill and the annex and who have worked many hours on \nthis task. First, the committee staff director, Andy Johnson, has \nimplemented the committee's aggressive oversight agenda and has led the \nstaff with true professionalism. I rely heavily on his counsel. His \ncounterpart on the minority side, Louis Tucker, has not just supported \nVice Chairman Bond but has made an enormous contribution to the success \nof our efforts so far this year. The general counsel, Mike Davidson, \nand minority counsel, Jack Livingston,\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\nhave been extraordinarily meticulous in drafting the legislative \nlanguage that makes up the public bill. The committee is lucky to have \nthem both. The budget director, Lorenzo Goco, did a superb job in \nputting together the classified annex. And as chairmen have been doing \nfor the past 20 years, I give a special thanks to our chief clerk \nKathleen McGhee for making everything on the committee work.\n  I look forward to the passage of this bill and the swift completion \nof a conference with the House so that we can enact a bill to help \nsecure this nation from its enemies.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported amendments--which Senator Bond is about to say some \nwords to and which he had an enormous amount to do with--be agreed to, \nthe amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, \nas amended, be read three times; that the Intelligence Committee be \nthen discharged from consideration of H.R. 2082, the House companion, \nand the Senate then proceed to its consideration; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1538, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that upon passage, \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; that S. 1538 \nbe returned to the calendar, and any statements be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record without intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. No objection on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3160) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The bill, (H.R. 2082), as amended, was ordered to a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, has the time for the majority side expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 51 seconds remaining. I \ndon't see anyone seeking recognition, so the Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. Most of all, I thank my chairman, \nSenator Rockefeller. I thank the chairman of the committee and all of \nthe members of the committee to be able to pass this very important \nintelligence authorization bill. We have had a 3-year hiatus with no \nintelligence authorization bill. This came despite multiple attempts on \nthe Senate floor. Today, we see, fortunately, the end of that cycle \nwith the passage of the fiscal year 2008 intelligence authorization \nbill.\n  Passing this bill is important and noteworthy because it is one of \nthe committee's most important tools in providing strong congressional \noversight of the intelligence activities the American people expect and \ndeserve. This bill we have just passed contains important provisions \nthat would improve the effectiveness of our intelligence agencies, most \nof which were requested by the intelligence community. It is not a \nperfect bill, and there are a few things in it that I may not totally \nagree with, but overall this bill will benefit the intelligence \ncommunity and marks the important reassertion of congressional \noversight over our intelligence agencies and operations.\n  I commend Chairman Rockefeller for all of his hard work and the \ndiplomacy, skill, and patience in putting together the managers' \namendment that brought us to the floor today. In particular, we worked \nvery hard to keep the bill clean and to strip it of challengeable and \npolitically charged amendments, things that would have drawn objections \nfrom this side and the other side. Several Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle had to give until it hurt to reach agreements, and I thank \nthem for their flexibility and cooperation. We cannot get this bill \ndone or any bill done in this Senate without bipartisan cooperation. \nWith this bill, the chairman and I and our committee are making a great \nstep forward in returning the work of the Intelligence Committee to \nnonpartisan oversight and away from the politics that have weakened it \nover the past few years. We have limited the bill to just those \nprovisions that had strong bipartisan support. Chairman Rockefeller and \nI were also able to get a number of good-government positions into our \nbill that will improve the effectiveness of our intelligence agencies.\n  Having said that, my colleagues should know that the chairman and I \nwill fight very hard to keep this agreement in conference.\n  If the House were to put in political amendments or other problematic \namendments which the Senate would not support, I will not support the \nbill. Intelligence should be conducted behind closed doors. When we \ntalk about our intelligence matters openly in other committees or on \nthis floor, we hamper our intelligence ability.\n  I asked the current Director of the Central Intelligence Agency at \nhis confirmation hearing about 16 months ago: How badly have the \ndisclosures of our most sensitive intelligence methods hurt our ability \nto deal with terrorists?\n  He ruefully said: We are now applying the Darwinian theory to \nterrorists. We are only capturing the dumb ones.\n  Every time we talk in public about how we capture information, it \ngives a roadmap to the terrorists to know exactly how to avoid being \nintercepted. Unfortunately, there have in recent days been more \nexamples of such disclosures.\n  But back to this bill. This bill provides for the empowerment of the \nDirector of National Intelligence to conduct accountability reviews of \nthe individual elements of the intelligence community in relation to \nsignificant failures or deficiencies.\n  This provision will encourage the intelligence community to address \ntheir own internal failures or inefficiencies--something they have been \nreluctant to do on their own. In the event that they are reluctant or \nunable to do so, this amendment gives the DNI the authority he needs to \nstep in and conduct his own reviews, authority the Director of National \nIntelligence currently does not have.\n  The Intelligence authorization bill also contains a wide range of \nother important provisions that will improve the efficiency and \naccountability of the intelligence community, while at the same time \nproviding the DNI with additional authority and flexibility, including \ncreation of a strong, independent inspector general for the \nintelligence community; additional authorities for the DNI to improve \ninformation sharing in the intelligence community; measures to protect \nthe cover of our clandestine intelligence officers; and measures to \naddress excessive cost growth in major acquisition programs--a real \nproblem we have seen in recent years.\n  The intelligence community has now gone 2 years without the detailed \nguidance from the Congress that only this Intelligence authorization \nbill can provide. I hope we can move this bill expeditiously through a \nconference with the House to correct that situation.\n  We must do a better job of asserting congressional oversight of the \nintelligence community, and one of the best ways to accomplish that \ngoal is to pass the annual Intelligence authorization bill. I am proud \nto announce that today we have done that.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to talk more broadly about the war on \nterror and say it is with pleasure that we see the President's policy \nof bringing back troops home when they complete their mission \nsuccessfully. Return on success is working. Marines are coming home \nafter having pacified Al Anbar Province and turned the responsibility \nfor maintaining security over to the Iraqi security forces. I know \nabout that personally and it is working. The marines are coming home. \nWe know they are coming home because\n\n[[Page S12476]]\n\nthere was a story this morning on television about how marines were \nheld up for about 2\\1/2\\ hours by the TSA at one of the places they \nlanded in the United States. They refused to allow the marines to go \ninto the terminal because I guess they provided some kind of threat. In \nany event, the marines are now coming back to face additional \nchallenges--not just the challenges of the TSA that we all undergo, \nbut, regrettably, too many of them have mental health problems, TBI and \nPTSD, and in the Defense authorization bill we have passed provisions \nto assist the wounded warriors coming home. But they have been \nsuccessful, and return on success means al-Qaida is no longer able to \nexercise control over Al Anbar.\n  For those who think this is a diversion in the battle in the war on \nterror, all they have to do is listen to the leaders, Osama bin Laden \nand Zawihiri, who have said the headquarters of the caliphate from \nwhich they are going to conduct worldwide operations is the land \nbetween the two rivers. That is, of course, Iraq. If they win there, \nthey are stronger, and they will establish their headquarters there.\n  The intelligence community leaders, in January of this year, spoke in \nopen session before the Intelligence Committee. They said if we \nwithdraw before we have established relative peace and stability in the \narea--in other words, if we withdraw on a political timetable dictated \nby this body--there will be chaos. Three things will happen. There will \nbe increased killing among Shia and Sunni, genocide and bloodshed. Two, \nthat will bring in the other states in the region to protect their \ncoreligionists, and we will see the potential of a regionwide sectarian \nwar. Three, most frighteningly, al-Qaida will establish the safe haven \nthey have sought in Al Anbar and elsewhere from which to embolden their \nefforts and attack the United States and United States persons abroad, \nand our allies.\n  All you have to do to get an idea of the effectiveness of our new \ncounterinsurgency efforts, led by General Petraeus, is to pay attention \nto what was found in the pocket of Abu al-Tunisi, the Tunisian al-Qaida \nleader in Iraq who was responsible for bringing foreign fighters into \nIraq--the ones from Iran, Syria, Yemen, and others, with all of the \nresources they had. Al-Tunisi had written letters to his leader, \nsaying: I am suffering. They are strangling us. I cannot get support.\n  We have hurt them and we have hurt them badly. Yes, al-Qaida is a \nthreat, but al-Qaida is not basing that threat from Iraq. Their leaders \nare probably in the mountains of Pakistan or Afghanistan. I can assure \nyou we are doing everything we can--and we obviously cannot discuss \nwhat we are doing--to capture and kill those leaders. Right now, we \nhave taken advantage and the counterinsurgency strategy is working. I \ncommend our troops and General Petraeus.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we worked together on this, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my understanding is that the Republican \nside is going to extend its request for morning business.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I intend to ask unanimous consent that the \ntime spent on the Intel bill not be deducted from our time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Missouri spoke for approximately 10 \nminutes, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nside be given 10 additional minutes in morning business, 2 of those to \nbe allocated to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, does that include 10 minutes for my \ncolleague from Texas? I will ask for 10 additional minutes for the \nminority side, which may have other subjects to talk about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object. I was protecting your side \nfor the 30 minutes initially allocated.\n  Mr. BOND. In that case, I withdraw my request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is the request there would be an \nadditional 10 minutes on the Republican side?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that 30 minutes was allocated to \nthe Republican side for morning business. The Senator from Missouri \nspoke for approximately 10 minutes on an issue and asked that that not \nbe deducted from the Republican morning business time. I am happy to \nacknowledge that, and I ask that we be given 10 minutes, 2 of which \nwill be given to the Senator from West Virginia. So that protects those \nstill here for the 30 minutes originally allocated for Republican \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the time will be \nso adjusted.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  All I wanted to say is that I think the unanimous consent agreement \nwhich has been reached is the start. I want to use every fiber in my \nbody to thank the distinguished vice chairman, Senator Christopher \nBond, from Missouri, for the enormous role he played in making this \nhappen. It was objected to only a few days ago. It was cleared last \nnight, and I think it exemplified the partnership the Senator from \nMissouri and myself are trying to bring to the Intelligence Committee. \nThis is an example of our work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it now the \nappropriate time for us to begin our 30-minute allocation for morning \nbusiness?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. There is \nadditional time on the Democratic side, but nobody is seeking \nrecognition.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks for up to 10 minutes, Senator Bennett be recognized for up \nto 10 minutes, and then Senator Kyl be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12476-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12476-S12477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, more than 1 month ago, I spoke on the \nfloor regarding the need for the Senate to confirm Jim Nussle as the \nhead of the Office of Management and Budget and about my constituents' \nconcerns that are regularly voiced to me about the runaway Federal \nspending in Washington, DC, and its impact on their ability to earn a \nliving or run a business, and their concern about the direction of the \neconomy for the future if the Federal Government continues to occupy \nmore and more space when it comes to their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  I mentioned my fear that the tax-and-spend season was upon us here in \nWashington, DC, and there seemed to be some early indications that some \nof the progress we have made as a result of progrowth, low-tax policies \nwas going to be reversed under the new management in Washington.\n  In my State of Texas, to give you a snapshot, unemployment is near \nits lowest level in 30 years, while more than a quarter of a million \nnew jobs have been created over the past year. That is out of the 8.3 \nmillion new jobs created in this economy since August of 2003. Instead \nof talking about how we can preserve these hard-won gains for the \nAmerican people and my constituents back home in Texas, we hear more \nand more talk about raising taxes and expanding the size of the Federal \nGovernment. Instead of talking about how can we help support and \nnurture the entrepreneurial spirit in America, we are hearing more \nfolks talking about how can we grow the bureaucracy and Federal \nprograms and the size of the Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, we are beginning to see a trend when it comes to \nraising taxes. Yesterday's suggestion by some members of the House is a \ndisturbing example of that. Yesterday, the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee unveiled a proposal that would\n\n[[Page S12477]]\n\nrequire taxpayers to add anywhere from 2 percent to a 15-percent \nsurcharge to their income tax bill.\n  In the Senate, the majority leader declared that nothing should be \noff the table. I am glad to see that the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives quickly voiced her disagreement with this tax surcharge \nproposed by Congressman Obey. His proposal would amount to an annual \ntax increase of $150 billion a year, or three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars over the next 5 years--a bad idea, in my view.\n  At the same time, with this chart, I will document some of the \nproposals that have been made, because it helps to see them in one \nplace and add them up because you only then begin to understand the \nfull impact of these discrete proposals that are being made, all of \nwhich would result in increased taxes.\n  First, the budget that was passed earlier this year, of course, is \nwhere the Federal Government says how much it intends to spend and \nwhere that money is supposed to come from.\n  The disturbing thing to me was that it contemplated the spending \nlevels in that budget that passed--without my support, by the way--\ncontemplated an increase of $916 billion in additional revenue. The \nproblem is, my concern is, frankly, that the revenue they are talking \nabout--in other words, increased tax revenue--would come from not \nmaking the tax relief we passed in 2001 and 2003 permanent. In other \nwords, it would result in a huge tax increase if allowed to go into \neffect without actually having Congress vote on increasing taxes by the \nmere expiration of those taxes.\n  Then there are some who say we want to tax the rich and don't worry \nabout it because we are only going to tax the rich. I ask how many \ntimes we have heard that before. The alternative minimum tax is the \nlatest example. We know that from roughly 4 million taxpayers who will \nbe hit by this so-called alternative minimum tax this year. According \nto the Wall Street Journal, that number in 2007 could soar to 23 \nmillion Americans, from 4 million to 23 million Americans. In other \nwords, the tendency all too often of the Federal Government is once a \ntax is created to see that tax expand and grow and to gobble up more \nand more taxpayers' dollars.\n  Certainly, that is the case where we see new Government programs \ncreated to provide for a larger and larger Government which, of course, \nhas to be paid for, and guess where that money comes from. It comes \nfrom the beleaguered American taxpayers.\n  In a counterintuitive mood, this second provision of $70 billion, \nactually rather than tax the rich, what my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who recently voted for this new State children's health \ninsurance expansion of 140 percent over the current program, they have \nactually targeted a regressive tobacco tax to fund expansion of \nWashington-run health care.\n  The President has vetoed the so-called SCHIP bill not because any of \nus disagree about the core mission of the SCHIP program, which is to \nprovide health coverage for low-income kids, but the fact is that \nprogram has been hijacked and used as a Trojan horse to take an \nadditional step, a huge incremental step toward a Washington-run health \ncare system, which I believe is bad for the American people.\n  Three things one can say about Washington-controlled health care: No. \n1 is, free health care isn't free because it is going to have to be \npaid for by the American people. No. 2, we can say Washington-\ncontrolled health care will be inevitably bureaucratic and some \nbureaucrat will be deciding what kind of health care you get and what \nkind of health care you don't get. And No. 3, we can be assured the way \nthe Federal Government will control cost, to the extent it can, in this \nnew program will be as a result of rationing and deciding who gets \naccess to care and who does not, and that means more care programs, as \nwe see currently underway in Canada, where people have to wait months \nand years for the kind of diagnostic care and treatment they get in a \nmatter of days in America.\n  The third item, $11.4 billion, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have proposed a massive increase on energy producers in the \nUnited States. We recently had a so-called Energy bill on the floor. \nThe only thing was it didn't produce one drop of additional energy. \nWhat we saw happen was a proposal that actually would have increased \ntaxes on domestic energy producers which would have made us more \ndependent on imported energy, something we have all said is a bad idea. \nWe know it is a bad idea for us to be as dependent as we are on \nimported energy. So why in the world would we want to raise taxes and \nincrease the burden on domestic producers in a way that would make us \nmore dependent on that imported energy?\n  We see there are additional proposals about which we have heard: $6.1 \nbillion in additional taxes on oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico, \nadditional taxes on investing and creating jobs in America by foreign \nbusinesses that want to invest in the United States, that we benefit \nfrom, that actually creates jobs here, but our friends on the other \nside of the aisle have proposed an increased tax on that as well. We \ncan see the other proposals that have been made.\n  This is a disturbing chart, at least to me. When we look at the cost \nfor the average American taxpayer and how many days a week they have to \nwork to pay their Federal taxes, that will invariably go up. Right now, \nAmerican taxpayers have to work 79 days out of the 365 days in the year \nto pay Uncle Sam, to pay their taxes. That is more than 1 out of every \n5 days of the year, and that is more than the average that taxpayers \nwill spend on food, housing, health care or any other category.\n  Of course, working parents face challenges every day when it comes to \nmaking sure their children get what they need and deserve in terms of \nhealth care and education. So why would Congress continue to increase \nand add to their burden by increasing taxes?\n  I ask: Is this how Washington should be working for the American \ntaxpayer? To me the answer is clearly no. We should not force American \ncitizens to work even more days each year for Uncle Sam. I am sad to \nsay, disappointed to say that the tax-and-spend season is indeed upon \nus in Washington, DC.\n  Our country faces a number of challenges when it comes to the war on \nterror, making health care more accessible to more Americans, and \nmaking sure we remain competitive in a global economy. But it seems \nthat every day that passes, some spend their time thinking about more \nways to raise taxes and grow the size of Government. I wish we would \nreconsider and not do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12477-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12477-S12479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, last week a group of us, both Senators \nand Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, had the \nopportunity to sit down with Frederick Kagan, who is a fellow at the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, and listen to his comments about where \nwe are with respect to Iraq.\n  At the end of that very illuminating session, he gave us each a copy \nof a new report that he has authored called ``No Middle Way, The \nChallenge of Exit Strategies from Iraq.'' The report is too long for me \nto ask consent that it be printed in the Record, but I recommend it to \nall my colleagues. It is one of the most thorough and thoughtful \nexaminations of where we are in Iraq I have seen. I will be quoting \nfrom it, but I wish to make a few observations about the situation in \nIraq before I do.\n  The Iraq debate seems to be mired down in arguments about past \ndecisions and whether they were right. These kinds of arguments are \nuseful, and they are particularly useful in the hands of historians who \nare reviewing an entire situation from a vantage point of years \nafterward, but they are not necessarily that valuable as we are \naddressing the question of what do we do now.\n  If I can play the historian for a moment and give examples of how we \nhave entered into conflicts and seen the situation on the ground change \nand, therefore, strategies change, let me go back to the Revolutionary \nWar. At the time of the Revolutionary War, the original strategies the \nCommander in Chief, George Washington, applied didn't work. Indeed, the \nContinental Army was defeated again and again and\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\nagain by the British troops, and Washington was forced to acknowledge \nthat his original strategic decisions were the wrong ones. This did not \nmean we lost the war because Washington adjusted to the conditions on \nthe ground, adopted new strategies, and ended up winning the war.\n  In the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln made the decision to provision \nFort Sumter, he did not understand how long the war would last, how \ndifficult it would be, how much life and treasure it would claim. He \nwas forced to change again and again in reaction to the results that \ncame from the battlefield.\n  In Iraq, we made some decisions based on intelligence at the time \nwhich have proved to be wrong. Spending our time in this Chamber \narguing over those decisions instead of recognizing how conditions have \nchanged on the ground becomes a self-defeating exercise.\n  As I look at the decisions that were made prior to the decision to go \ninto Iraq, the one that strikes me as being the most significant was \nour failure to understand the degree to which Saddam Hussein had \ndestroyed that country, not just physically, not just in terms of its \ninfrastructure but psychologically.\n  We believed there were Iraqis who could step forward and lead a \nresurgence of that country if we simply freed them from the heavy hand \nof Saddam Hussein. That was a false belief. We found Iraqis so \nshattered by 37 years of one of the most brutal dictatorships we have \never seen that the leadership vacuum was huge. For us now to spend our \ntime saying, well, we made the mistake, therefore we have to cure the \nmistake by getting out, is to ignore the conditions on the ground that \nhave evolved as a result of getting into the war in the first place.\n  Mr. Kagan makes the point that there is no middle way. We are trying \nto find a middle way in these Chambers. There are those who say the \nonly way is to withdraw immediately, and there are others who say, no, \nthe only way is to stay the course. That phrase has been hackneyed; it \ndoesn't work anymore. So it is natural for many of us to say: Let's \nfind some middle way. Let's stay in there somewhat, but let's eliminate \na good portion of the American footprint in Iraq and see if that \ndoesn't help us get out without absolute withdrawal.\n  Mr. Kagan makes the point that the conditions on the ground rule out \nsuch a middle way. I find his arguments persuasive, and I would like to \nshare some of them with my colleagues today.\n  He looks not at the question of did Saddam Hussein have anything to \ndo with 9/11, a question we hear debated a great deal. He says: Is al-\nQaida engaged now in Iraq? The answer is overwhelmingly yes. Whether \nal-Qaida and Saddam Hussein had any ties prior to our invasion in Iraq \nis now irrelevant. Al-Qaida is in Iraq. Al-Qaida is a major player in \nIraq.\n  There are those who say Iran is the major threat, and we should be \nlooking at Iran. He points out that Iran is very much involved in Iraq \nat the present time. These are the conditions on the ground. We are not \ndebating 9/11. We are not debating the U.N. resolutions. We are \ndebating conditions on the ground that very much involve both al-Qaida \nand Iran. So those are the conditions to which we need to pay \nattention.\n  If I may quote from Mr. Kagan's report, he says:\n\n       A precipitous American withdrawal from Iraq will likely be \n     portrayed in the region as a defeat for the United States and \n     as a victory for Iran. Arab states are already concerned \n     about the growth in Iranian power and pretensions in the \n     region, but few have the capability to do more than \n     complain. The Saudis and the Gulf states are no match for \n     Iran militarily and would almost certainly seek an \n     accommodation with Tehran rather than allowing themselves \n     to be drawn into a major confrontation.\n\n  That is a very interesting thing to contemplate as you look ahead--\nIran expanding its power in the region, making some kind of \naccommodation with the Saudis and the other Gulf States in order to \nconsolidate its power. Is that something America wants to look forward \nto?\n  He goes on:\n\n       A possible side effect of the U.S. withdrawal is the \n     establishment of Iranian hegemony in the Middle East. Tehran \n     certainly seeks a predominant position in southern Iraq, \n     including Baghdad, and it would be in a position to put great \n     pressure on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States in the absence \n     of a large American presence in the region following a \n     visible U.S. defeat. That pressure might include efforts to \n     deny the U.S. the use of bases or to support Iranian \n     initiatives in the region and in the nuclear realm. The \n     perception of an American defeat at the hands of Iran is \n     likely to fuel seismic shifts in the politics of the Middle \n     East, none of them to our advantage.\n\n  We are having a great debate about what to do about Iran. We are \nshowing great concern about the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear \nweapon. The new President of France, Mr. Sarkozy, has talked about the \nunacceptability of Iran having a nuclear weapon, even to the point of \nsuggesting that military options should be on the table. Military \noptions with respect to an Iranian nuclear weapon, if it comes to that, \nwill undoubtedly involve more American troops and more American \ntreasure than are currently at stake in Iraq.\n  In the conclusion section of Mr. Kagan's report, he says:\n\n       It is simply not possible to design a militarily feasible \n     plan to draw down U.S. forces dramatically and on a rapid \n     timeline that still permits the accomplishment of America's \n     vital interests in Iraq and the region. The CNAS report--\n\n  The report he discusses in the group that tries to find a middle \nway--\n\n     has raised the extremely important question of devising a \n     sound plan for transitioning to an advisory role, and this \n     question deserves a great deal of careful study in the months \n     ahead. But now is the time to start thinking about that \n     transition, not to start implementing it prematurely.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Kagan concludes:\n\n       Any plan that requires a withdrawal based on a timeline, \n     rather than conditions on the ground, is likely to lead to \n     failure. The notion that imposing timelines would somehow \n     force the Iraqi government to ``do the right thing'' and \n     thereby resolve the problems in the country is always \n     presented without any evidence. It is the logical argument \n     without substantiation that appears to be contradicted by \n     past precedent and by facts on the ground. It is a mirage \n     that some people cling to as a way of convincing themselves \n     and others that an action likely to lead to complete failure \n     in Iraq will instead lead to at least partial success. As the \n     president and Congress deliberate on the best way ahead for \n     the United States and Iraq, therefore, the choices are quite \n     stark. Either the United States can continue its efforts to \n     establish security while improving the capabilities of the \n     ISF or it can abandon those efforts, withdraw, and allow Iraq \n     to sink into chaos where terrorists can flourish.\n\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to pay attention to the wisdom of \nMr. Kagan's report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wished to, first of all, echo the comments \nof my colleague from Utah. Fred Kagan is an expert, and what he had to \nsay in that report and in his subsequent summaries of it is something \nall our colleagues should be familiar with because he makes the very \nclear point that, as this mission is working, right now is not the time \nto change the mission and go back to what it was prior to General \nPetraeus's arrival on the scene.\n  Yet we still have Members of this body and the other body trying to \nundercut the Petraeus plan in one way or another. The most recent \neffort to do this is one which is especially distressing. Let me give a \nlittle bit of background.\n  First, I wish to note that our Democratic colleagues have not taken \nvery long to reestablish their reputation--well deserved--as the tax-\nand-spend party, as my colleague from Texas pointed out earlier. Now \nthat the Democratic Party is in control of the Congress, the agenda is \nvery clear. But yesterday, the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee went a step too far because he proposed a new tax on every \nAmerican. This one, ostensibly, to fund the war.\n  Now, there are a lot of different excuses for raising taxes, as my \ncolleague from Texas pointed out a while ago, but I don't think we need \na new tax. If we did, our Democratic colleagues would not be proposing \n$23 billion in more spending than the President proposed in his budget. \nIn other words, if a lack of revenue is the problem, then let us not \nkeep spending more than has been proposed in the budget. The tax-and-\nspend priorities of the Democratic majority are very clear.\n\n  No, the real reason for Chairman Obey's plan to raise more taxes is \nto\n\n[[Page S12479]]\n\nchange our strategy in Iraq, and that is very clear from his own \ncomments. Along with the tax he proposed, in fact, he announced he \nwould not allow his committee to move forward with the bill the \nPresident has requested to fund the troops in Iraq.\n  This is not the Defense authorization or Defense appropriations bill, \nwhich funds the Pentagon and all the military activities over the \ncourse of next year. No, this is the money for the troops who are \nfighting right now in Iraq. As I said, the chairman made it very clear \nthat was precisely what he intended. In fact, quoting from a Wall \nStreet Journal article today, he said:\n\n       Choosing not to move legislation is our strongest card at \n     this point.\n\n  Well, this is not a card game, and you shouldn't be playing with the \nlives of our troops by cutting off their funding while they are out in \nthe field. If you wish to make a policy point that we should change our \nstrategy in Iraq, change our mission, there are ways to do it without \ncutting off the funds while the troops are out there trying to perform \nthe mission we have sent them to perform.\n  I thought the comment of my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, as reported in the Washington Times in a story this morning, \nwas charitable and interesting.\n\n       Senator Pete V. Domenici, New Mexico Republican, said Mr. \n     Obey's threat to block war funds was pretty gutsy. But I \n     don't see how it would work. In the end, you have to feed the \n     soldiers.\n\n  That is the point. You can cut back Pentagon funding, you can try to \npass resolutions that call for a change in strategy, but at the end of \nthe day, you have to feed the soldiers. You can't refuse to send the \nmoney to Iraq while the troops are there or you are literally pulling \nout the rug from under the troops.\n  My colleague, Senator Graham from South Carolina, put it this way:\n\n       The plan to starve the troops of funds would be cheered by \n     America's enemies. This would be a blessing to al-Qaida, \n     which is getting its brains beat out in Iraq.\n\n  I remember when Bob Dole ran for the Presidency, and he was trying to \nmake some pretty important points and people didn't appear to be \nlistening to him. At one point, he said: Where is the outrage? And that \nis the question I ask here. Where is the outrage of pulling the rug out \nfrom under our troops while they are in theater trying to do what we \nhave sent them there to do?\n  This is not just bad policy, it represents a failure to support the \ntroops. Everybody around here says: Well, we all support the troops, we \ndisagree with the policy of being in Iraq. Now we have come to the \npoint where we are going to try to change that policy by not supporting \nthe troops? I don't think this is good policy. I don't think it is fair \nto the troops whom we have sent into harm's way, and it is consistent, \nas I said before, with this whole tax-and-spend ideology.\n  Try to change policy by withdrawing support for the troops but raise \ntaxes on the American taxpayer? It makes no sense at all, unless you \nput it in the context with where the Democratic leadership has been \ngoing now for some time with respect to the Iraq war. Let me go back a \nlittle and quote from an article yesterday in the Associated Press.\n\n       Hoping the political landscape changes in coming months, \n     Democratic leaders say they will renew their fight when \n     Congress considers the money Bush wants in war funding.\n\n  Well, it didn't take long for that to come true. The Associated Press \nnoted:\n\n       The difficulty facing Democrats in the Iraq debate: They \n     lack the votes to pass legislation ordering troops home and \n     are divided on whether to cut money for combat.\n\n  I might say the Speaker of the House has already announced her \nopposition to this new tax plan. Democrats are indeed divided. But for \nthose who are in authority to refuse to move the legislation forward, \nand who talk about it in terms of it is the best card I have to play, \nhave the ability to stop the funding at the very time that the troops \nneed the money in the field.\n  Progress in Iraq, obviously, has been widely reported. An editorial \ntoday in Investors Business Daily says:\n\n       The new strategy being implemented by General Petraeus \n     seems to have worked extraordinarily well. Al-Qaida has been \n     backpedaling furiously.\n\n  So right at the time the strategy is working, we are going to pull \nthe money out? It makes no sense.\n  The Washington Post reports today:\n\n       The numbers of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians reported \n     killed across the country last month fell to their lowest \n     levels in more than a year, a sharp decrease in violent \n     deaths that American military officials attribute in part to \n     the thousands of additional soldiers who have arrived here \n     this year.\n\n  And the New York Times today notes:\n\n       The number of violent civilian deaths in Iraq dropped \n     precipitously in September compared with the previous month.\n\n  So at a time when the strategy of General Petraeus is working, our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are deciding to pull the funding \nso we can no longer continue the operation. That makes no sense at all. \nBut it does fit in with this larger strategy, as I said, to find any \nway they can to change the course in the war.\n  Let me conclude with this point. It is now October 3, past the \nbeginning of the fiscal year on October 1, and yet the Democratic \nmajority has not passed one single appropriations bill to the President \nfor his signature to fund the government next year. It appears to me \nthere is a reason for this.\n  The Associated Press noted the following in an article on September \n30:\n\n       The most basic job of Congress is to pass the bills that \n     pay the costs of running the government. After criticizing \n     the Republicans for falling down on the job last year, \n     Democrats are now the ones stumbling.\n\n  And Roll Call had an editorial 3 days before, and I quote from part \nof it:\n\n       Senate Democrats complain that Republican obstructionism \n     and President Bush's veto threats against nine House-passed \n     bills caused this year's delay. But the arguments don't hold \n     water.\n       Instead, it appears likely that the Democrats' failure to \n     pass these spending bills is part of the plan designed to \n     create a giant Omnibus appropriations bill which will \n     tie very directly into their tax-and-spend policies.\n  According to an editorial today in Congressional Quarterly:\n\n       Democrats may be planning to use a widely supported \n     veterans' bill as the vehicle for their additional spending. \n     Frustrated veterans' groups are trying to pressure Congress \n     to quickly pass a veterans' and military construction bill \n     and not use it as a vehicle for an omnibus measure.\n\n  Now, this wouldn't be the first time this kind of game has been \nplayed, but especially if it is on the Veterans and Military \nConstruction bill, or if it is the Defense authorization bill that was \nheld up for so long, and now the measure to try to fund the troops in \nIraq, there is a very disturbing pattern here. Playing games with money \nfor veterans and the military in order to get more taxes and spending? \nThat is wrong. It is wrong. The American people need to know that at \nthe very time when General Petraeus's strategy is showing very positive \nresults in Iraq, it is the Democratic plan, at least in the House of \nRepresentatives, to hold up that funding, not because there is a lack \nof money, not because we need a tax increase to fund it but in order to \ntry to change the course of the President's strategy.\n  That is playing games with the money the troops need in the field. \nAgain, as Senator Domenici said, it is a pretty gutsy move, but in the \nend, it would not work because you have to feed the soldiers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few minutes ago the President of the \nUnited States vetoed the children's health insurance legislation that \nhas reflected the bipartisan support of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate and which has the support of children, \nfamilies, and Americans all over.\n  How could the President of the United States possibly veto this \nlegislation? How could the President be so misinformed about the needs \nof these children? I think this is probably the most inexplicable veto \nin the history of\n\n[[Page S12480]]\n\nthe country. It is incomprehensible, it is intolerable, and it is \nunacceptable.\n  Democrats pleaded with Members of the Republican Party to give us \ntheir help and their support so we could pass this legislation. Now we \nhave that opportunity. The ball is in our court. We can do something \nabout it. This is a defining issue, not only about children but also \nabout the values of this country. So I hope Democrats and Republicans \nalike will come together and say children ought to come first in the \nUnited States.\n  This is a value issue, it is a family issue, and it is something that \ndemands action, and I hope we will override this veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to be yielded 3 minutes and to give \nthe remaining time to the Senator from Washington after I have \ncompleted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a strange thing when the President \nof the United States uses his veto pen. He does it so rarely. He has \nonly used it on two issues. Once, when we tried to change the policy on \nthe war in Iraq and tried to bring our troops home in a responsible \nmanner, the President vetoed it. The second was on stem cell research. \nWhen we tried to open up this opportunity for medical research to save \nlives and spare suffering for American families, the President vetoed \nit--not once but twice. Today, the President used his veto pen for the \nfourth time. Unlike other vetoes, there were no television cameras, no \nreporters, no announcements made. Quietly, in his office, the President \nsigned the veto of the children's health insurance measure.\n  This children's health insurance measure is a program that has been \nin business for 10 years. It is a successful program, and it has strong \nbipartisan support in Congress. We started this program because 15 \nmillion kids in America did not have health insurance. They were not \nthe poorest kids. The poorest kids have coverage under Medicaid. They \nwere not the fortunate children, those who were lucky enough to have \nhealth insurance through their parents. They were the ones caught in \nthe middle, the kids of working parents who make such a low wage and \nhave so few benefits they cannot provide health insurance for their \nkids.\n  So when President Bush vetoed this bill, why did he veto it? In a \nshort, one-sentence statement he said: It was a middle-class \nentitlement.\n  I would say to the President: Isn't it about time someone stood up \nfor the middle class in this country? To argue that a couple making \n$60,000 a year, without health insurance where they go to work, can \nspend $800 or $900 a month on health insurance and not feel that pain \nin their budget tells me the President or his advisers are out of touch \nwith America.\n  When I go home to Illinois, and our colleagues go home to their \nStates, the first thing you hear about is health insurance. You know \nwhat it is--people say: We don't have it where we work, and we cannot \nafford to buy it. We have health insurance, but it doesn't cover \nenough. Those are the realities of family life in America, and the \nPresident's veto today tells me he is out of touch with the real issues \nchallenging middle-class working families in America.\n  Fortunately, we have put together a bipartisan bill. With the \nleadership of Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Orrin Hatch of Utah on \nthe Republican side, Max Baucus on the Democrat side, and Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts, we have a compromise bipartisan bill. It is \npaid for. It does not add to the deficit. A tobacco tax on cigarettes \nand other tobacco products will pay for health insurance, so we will \nmove from 6.6 million kids covered to 10 million kids, over 5 years, \nmoving toward the goal of all children in America having health \ninsurance.\n  The President's veto today tells me he doesn't share our goal that \nevery American, every family, should have health insurance that they \ncan count on and afford. It tells me the President is not in touch with \nthe real life of middle-class working families struggling to make ends \nmeet, struggling to pay for college, struggling to make sure their kids \nhave health insurance.\n  This is an opportunity for Congress to come together, the House and \nthe Senate on a bipartisan basis, to say to the President: Pay close \nattention to America. America needs a helping hand, and working-class, \nmiddle-class families need an opportunity for health insurance that \nthey can afford for their children.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides, let's continue this effort on \nbehalf of these families to provide affordable health insurance for \nkids across our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the President is turning a deaf ear to \nthe crying needs of millions of American children by vetoing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. The President claims this is an \ninefficient use of Federal dollars, but nothing could be further from \nthe truth. When a family goes without health insurance, it means going \nwithout regular checkups, children missing more school than other \nchildren, and children waiting until the emergency room is the only \nanswer.\n  It means we don't catch ailments like ear infections and cavities and \ndiabetes and asthma. It means treatable conditions are more likely to \nspiral out of control. And it means American taxpayers are spending \nbillions of dollars for uncompensated care instead of spending money up \nfront to provide continuity of care.\n  It is not more efficient to veto this bill. With better coverage, we \ncan treat things like fevers and injuries and infections before they \nturn into something far worse. We can catch chronic illnesses earlier \nand help children manage their conditions. We can save American \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  But the President is turning a deaf ear to over 3.8 million Americans \nwho simply cannot afford health insurance. How could they? Mr. \nPresident, are your budget analysts just numb to the fact that \nAmericans are seeing higher and higher costs of health insurance? Are \nyou choosing to ignore the fact that health insurance premiums grew by \n78 percent since 2001, while wages only grew 19 percent? Are you \nchoosing to ignore that nearly half of the increase of uninsured \nchildren in America in the last several years occurred among those \nbetween 200 percent and 400 percent of the poverty line? That means \nmore Americans are falling into the category of not being able to cover \nhealth insurance.\n  Are you ignoring the fact that record numbers of businesses are \ndropping health insurance for their employees? That means a family with \n$41,000 trying to find health insurance could end up having to pay 30 \npercent of their annual income. What American family can afford to pay \n30 percent of their income to find health insurance? American families \nare being squeezed out of health insurance, and the President of the \nUnited States is turning a deaf ear to the crying health care needs of \nour children. All we are doing is paying the bill later.\n  The President should not be so heartless when it comes to the \nchildren of America. I know my colleagues are working shoulder to \nshoulder, Democrats and Republicans, trying to stop the President's \nveto. I hope my colleagues in the House of Representatives will have \nthe courage to stand up to the President. But be assured that \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate will continue this measure in \nwhatever ways we can on behalf of America's children.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I understand that we can now begin the 30 minutes of debate \nrunning up to the vote on the Graham-Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3117\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me start by offering a few comments about why this \namendment is important. But, first, to put it into context, we have \nmade a lot of progress. We have come a long way toward securing the \nborder and stopping the problem of illegal entry into our country. But \nwe have a long way to go.\n  This amendment is designed to continue the progress that we have been \nmaking with funding that is necessary for that. Just to put a little \ncontext here, for example, in 1994 we had 4,000 Border Patrol agents \nfor the entire border. We now have over 15,000. But we still know there \nare way too many incursions into the United States and more Border \nPatrol will help to end that.\n  We gave the Department of Homeland Security an extra $1.2 billion to \npay for those Border Patrol agents, as well as fencing and vehicle \nbarriers, detention space, and the like.\n  Secretary Chertoff just visited my State of Arizona last week. And he \nreports in addition to the Border Patrol hiring that I mentioned and \nthe addition of some detention space they are on track to complete 70 \nmiles of fencing by the end of this year. With the additional money \nthis amendment will provide for next year, they will be able to \ncomplete at least 371 miles of fencing along the entire Mexican border.\n  This is not just a fence. Some people say: Well, if you build a 10-\nfoot-high fence, they will come in with an 11-foot ladder. That is a \ncute refrain, but the reality is, this fencing I have seen built down \non the Barry Goldwater Gunnery Range just east of Yuma is double \nfencing. They have to have a very heavy pile driver to drive these \nsteel beams into the ground and attach steel flanges to the side. You \ncannot get through there. Now lizards and critters can get through, so \nfrom an environmental standpoint, it is actually a good thing, but \npeople cannot get through. And, importantly, that, combined with \nvehicle barriers, which are also large railroad tie-type structures put \ninto the ground to prevent vehicles from coming across, is particularly \nimportant because it is the vehicles that bring the drugs. Of course, \nthey can bring larger numbers of immigrants. But the reality is, where \nyou have vehicles, most likely you have weapons and you have drugs. \nAnd, of course, where that is involved, you are putting in danger the \nlives of our Border Patrol and other Federal officers and making it \nmore likely that the value of the contraband coming across is going to \nbe significant, thus driving these smugglers into more desperate \nmeasures to protect it.\n  Violence across the entire southern border has increased \nsignificantly. With the double fencing, there is a road in between. And \nthe point of fencing is to slow down those who might find a way to get \nover the fence. The reality is, with additional vehicles, with \nadditional Border Patrol, and this kind of fencing, what you can create \nis a situation where, by the time someone may have gotten over the \nfirst fence, the sensors and the cameras will have alerted Border \nPatrol, and they are stationed at close enough intervals that on the \nroad in between, Border Patrol can get to the site and pick up the \nillegal entrants. So that is why this kind of fencing is so important.\n  As I said, with the money that is provided in this amendment that is \nbefore us right now, we will be able to complete at least 370 miles of \nfencing along the southern border by the end of next year.\n  We need additional detention space. In Del Rio, TX, in Yuma, AZ, \nthere are programs already that apprehend illegal immigrants. When they \nhave been apprehended more than once, they are put into detention \nimmediately. Now, about 85 percent of the illegal immigrants just want \nto come here to work. The other 15 percent are criminals, and some are \nvery serious criminals. You need to detain them.\n  But it is also helpful to detain those who have come across \nrepeatedly to find work. Why? They cannot afford 60 days in jail where \nthey are not providing for their families. And it is a great incentive \nfor them to decide not to cross the border anymore because if they are \ngoing to get put in jail, then they are not going to be able to provide \nthe money to their families that they came across here in the first \ninstance to provide.\n\n  So those programs have reduced the immigration in those areas \ndramatically. But we need more detention spaces for this particular \nkind of detention. Again, this $3 billion will help to provide that. It \ncan help to provide more prosecutors and public defenders and judges \nbecause once you have detention, of course, you also may have criminal \ntrials and you may need to have the entire chain of the criminal \njustice system funded.\n\n[[Page S12482]]\n\n  In addition, this funding that we will be providing in this amendment \nwill help to improve the verification system that employers are \nrequired to use, the so-called E-Verify system, to make sure it is \noperating accurately at full capacity.\n  This is particularly important in my State because, frustrated by the \nlack of action by the Federal Government to have a good system, our \nState passed a law that will provide serious sanctions on employers who \nhire illegal immigrants. But they have to rely on the Federal system to \nmake that determination. It is not, right now, in the best of shape. It \nneeds to be improved. The capacity is there, but the ability to \ndetermine valid identity is not. So money in this bill will help to get \nthe Federal system into a position that States could rely on in order \nto enforce their own State laws against hiring illegal immigrants.\n  So there is much more that this $3 billion provides. But I wanted to \nthank my colleague, Senator Graham, for his work in making sure, \nwhether it is on the Department of Homeland Security bill or this bill, \nwe make sure, one way or the other, that we will have the funding to \ncontinue to work to secure the border and to make sure that we can stop \nthe illegal immigration into this country that has created so many \nproblems for us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham \namendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment. I want to \necho what the distinguished Senator from Arizona just said about the \nborder in his State.\n  I want to talk about the importance of this from two perspectives. \nOne is the reality of what is now beginning to work along our border \nbecause of the construction of walls. In the Yuma sector, at San Luis \nin Arizona, where I went earlier this year, watching the construction \nof the wall and watching the change of practice that is now taking \nplace, you know, people rise and fall to expectations. If there is no \nexpectation of consequence, then people are going to come across the \nborder easily. Quite frankly, in Yuma and San Luis that is exactly what \nwas going on a year ago.\n  But the interventions by the Border Patrol since the wall, the \nconstruction of the fence that has taken place, have dropped \ndramatically. Those interventions mean there are less people coming \nacross illegally and more of those people coming across legally.\n  The wall is a deterrent but, most importantly, it funnels those who \ndo want to cross our border in a legal and manageable way. I always \npoint out San Diego, CA as the perfect example. We have an example \nright now of a wall and access to the United States that works and has \nworked for decades. There is a 16-lane highway in San Diego that comes \ninto the United States and goes out. Through that passage, people and \ncommerce pass every day. There is a bridge above the passage on the \nAmerican border, and there are agents in each row of the cars as they \ncome through. There are detectors for radiation, for illegal drugs, \nthere are dogs, and arrests are made every day. The reason those cars \nflow and the reason it is respected is because on both sides of San \nDiego, there are two parallel walls with cameras, border security \nagents, and the only way to come into the United States is the lawful \nway. So if you picture for a second the high-density population areas \nof the southwestern United States with borders with Mexico, such as \nYuma and San Luis, you can have the same type of thing there that \nhappens in San Diego--a free passage that is legal, defensible, safe, \nand secure. Border Patrol agents can actually concentrate on the area \nof passage rather than trying to be every place at once on a border \nthat is wide open and has no deterrent.\n  We have serious problems in enforcement. Our States are reacting to \nproblems of illegal immigration. Our businesses are reacting to the \nproblems of illegal immigration. Yet we have given them no relief. We \ncan't validate our documents for businesses that hire people or tell \nthem whether they are legal. We are within 18 months of finally \ndigitizing all vital records of all States which will give us a way to \nend Social Security fraud. But we need to step on the accelerator. We \nneed to see to it that respect for the laws of the United States is \nreplete. We need to see to it that we have done the things as the \nFederal Government to allow our State governments to function and \nmanage this country and manage employment and manage our aliens who \ncome here legally.\n  I commend Senator Graham on his continuing hard work on the issue of \nborder enforcement and enforcement of immigration laws. I urge each \nMember of the Senate to adopt the Graham amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues for speaking \non the amendment. Senator Kyl knows as much about this issue as anyone \nI have ever met. Senator Isakson has made it a point to educate \nhimself. He has been to the border several times and was instrumental \nin trying to find a comprehensive approach, which fell last time, to \nensure that the border would be secure before anything else happened. \nWe are building off his work, basically. The $3 billion we have \navailable in this amendment is designated as an emergency, an oft-used \nterm around here when it comes to spending money. But I can assure \neveryone that securing our border is a national emergency, because it \nis a national security problem not to be able to control who comes into \nyour country. The $3 billion appropriations in this amendment will \nallow us to complete projects already designated and to build out \nborder security in a way never known before.\n  I hope it is a confidence builder. The goal of the amendment is prove \nto the public that Congress is very serious about securing the border, \nand we are putting money on the table that has never been there before. \nWe are sort of prepaying the cost of border security as a statement by \nthe Congress to the American people that we are very serious about \nsecuring our border. This is one piece of the puzzle. Fencing is part \nof it, additional border security, Border Patrol agents, more bed space \nto keep people who have been caught coming across the border illegally. \nIt will create a deterrent. It all works together. The verifying of \nemployment, the magnet that draws people to our country is employment, \njobs. We are trying to find a way to verify who is here legally so our \nemployers will be able to tell, if someone is applying for a job, their \nlegal status. Right now that is difficult to do. This $3 billion is an \nemergency appropriations, properly designated, that will fundamentally \nchange border security for the better. It will put money on the table \nthat is needed, help build a fence that is needed, hire more Border \nPatrol guards who are needed, create more bed spaces to house people \nwho have broken the laws--all is needed as part of the puzzle. This by \nitself will not solve the immigration problem, but it is a start. For \npeople who want border security first, this is a recognition that we \nhave listened to you. We understand what you are saying. We are putting \nmoney aside to make sure we secure the border.\n  Mr. TESTER. Will the Senator from South Carolina yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I certainly will. I want to get to the point on both \nborders, but I will yield to my friend Senator Tester.\n  Mr. TESTER. Could the Senator clarify how these dollars will be used? \nCan they be used on the northern border as far as personnel and \ntechnological equipment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for his question. That is correct. \nThey can be. It is our intent that the money in this amendment is not \nspecifically for the southern border but should be used to improve \nstaffing and technology deployment on the entire border, including the \nCanadian border. It can be used for those purposes. I know the Senator \nhas been very insistent that these funds be allocated to all of our \nborder security needs, including our northern border, and they will be. \nI appreciate his efforts to make that a reality.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In conclusion, this has drawn bipartisan support in the \npast, 89\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\nto 1. I expect it will do the same now. There is a lot of division in \nthe Nation over the war and many other issues, but we have come \ntogether along the lines that for America to be secure, we have to \ncontrol who comes into our country. This amendment will provide funds \nthat are missing today to allow us to secure both borders and deal with \nour employment problems. It is a good first step, but it is only a \nfirst step. I appreciate all my colleagues rallying around the idea.\n  One last comment to the chairman. I don't know if people have been \nwatching a PBS show called ``The War.'' It is a documentary by Ken \nBurns. I have been riveted every night watching the story of World War \nII told through the eyes of those who lived it from four communities \nacross the country--I believe Sacramento, CA, a small town in \nMinnesota, Mobile, AL, and Waterbury, CT. The documentary has been \ntrying to explain to my generation and others what it was like to live \nand fight during World War II. One of the people showcased in that \ndocumentary was Senator Inouye. I wanted to say for the record that I \nhave never been more proud to call him my friend, and I would hope \nevery American, particularly young Americans, will get a chance to see \nthis documentary about World War II and what that generation went \nthrough to secure our freedom. There is much to be learned from his \nsacrifice. I end this debate about the challenges of my time, of our \ntime regarding border security, to let America know that there was a \ntime in the past where this country rallied together, pushed the ball \nup the hill, and secured victory against some very vicious enemies. I \nhope we can recapture that spirit. This amendment is offered in the \nspirit of trying to bring the country together to secure our Nation \nfrom a broken immigration system.\n  But to Senator Inouye, he has my undying respect and gratitude for \nhis service to our Nation. And for all those who fought in that war and \nserved here at home and made the outcome possible, well done.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, I rise today to speak in \nopposition to the Graham amendment to provide an additional $3 billion \nin emergency spending for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I want to make clear that I agree with my colleagues that we must \nsecure our borders and provide the resources to do it. Let me remind my \ncolleagues that the Department's overall budget has grown more than 150 \npercent since its creation. Of that total, border security and \nimmigration enforcement represents approximately one-third of the \nDepartment's annual spending.\n  In 2007, Congress provided $12.1 billion in funding for border \nsecurity. For 2008, the President budget requested $13.5 billion for \nborder security, a 12-percent increase over the amount appropriated for \nfiscal year 2007. The $13.5 billion that Secretary Chertoff requested \nfrom Congress was what he felt was needed to continue the Department's \nefforts to secure our borders. The Senate Homeland Security \nAppropriations Committee provided a total of $14.9 billion for border \nsecurity in its mark of the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, a 23-percent increase over the amount appropriated \nfor fiscal year 2007 and a 10-percent increase over the President's \nbudget request for fiscal year 2008.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate voted in favor of a similar amendment \nto the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill. The \nSenate provided a total of $17.9 billion in funding for border security \nand immigration enforcement, a 48-percent increase over the amount \nappropriated for fiscal year 2007. Because Congress failed to complete \naction on any of the appropriations bills, this funding remains in \nlimbo.\n  The Federal Government continues to spend more than it brings in and \nthis amendment continues that practice. If we decide we absolutely need \nto spend $3 billion on something--and I support adequately funding \nborder security--then we need to either raise more revenue or cut other \nspending to pay for it.\n  Thus, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Graham amendment.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nGraham, along with Senators Gregg, McConnell, Vitter, Corker, Kyl, \nDomenici, Chambliss, Cornyn, Sununu, Specter, Isakson and Tester, in \nsponsoring this important amendment. This amendment would set aside $3 \nbillion in emergency funding to help better secure our nation's \nborders.\n  We are facing a crisis on our southern border. Every day, hundreds of \npeople sneak across our borders, many through the State of Arizona. \nWhile the majority of these individuals are coming here to look for \nwork, some of these illegal border crossers are criminals and people \nintending to do our Nation harm. The current situation is a national \nsecurity crisis and we must take action to address it.\n  The amendment Senator Graham has offered would designate $3 billion \nin emergency funding to establish operational control of our \ninternational land borders. These funds would be used to hire more \nfull-time border patrol agents as well as install double layer \npermanent fencing and vehicle barriers. The amendment also calls for \nthe instillation of unmanned aerial vehicles, ground-based sensors, and \ncameras. In order to deter further illegal immigration, the amendment \ndirects funds to be used to continue the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's, DHS, efforts to end ``catch-and release'' programs. If an \nimmigrant knows he will face mandatory incarceration if caught crossing \nthe border, that immigrant may not choose to take that risk. Also, \nthrough this amendment, funds would be made available to reimburse \nstate and localities for costs related to cooperative agreements they \nhave entered into with DHS that allows them to assist in the efforts to \nidentify and deport illegal immigrants. The funds made available by \nthis amendment would provide on-the-ground, real time assets that will \nhelp DHS to secure our Nation's borders in a 21st century way.\n  The final piece of the Graham amendment would address the need to \nimprove the employment eligibility verification system by directing $60 \nmillion to be set aside to enhance the ability of employers to verify \nemployment eligibility. Without an effective, accurate, and accessible \nemployment verification system undocumented immigrants will continue to \nbe hired because they will never truly have to prove that they are \nlegally allowed to work. We need to do away with the archaic paper-\nbased system and utilize technology in a way that allows employers to \ninstantaneously know if the person standing before them is who they say \nthey are and whether or not that person can be hired legally. We must \nimprove this system to help the government to prosecute unscrupulous \nemployers and ensure that they are hiring and employing legal workers.\n  The measures outlined and funded in the Graham amendment are critical \nto our border security efforts and I urge my colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank Mr. Graham for his generous \nremarks.\n  In the spirit of expediting the process before us, I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3119, Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, amendment No. 3119 is withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased the Senate is \nabout to adopt Senator Graham's border security amendment to this bill, \nand I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  We got the message earlier this year: Americans want a strong and \nsecure border. Now we will be sending them a $3 billion down payment on \nit.\n  The border is our first line of defense. The Graham amendment is \nintended to make sure we don't lose sight of that, and our adoption of \nit proves we haven't.\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\n  Thanks to this amendment, we'll soon have thousands more agents \npatrolling the border; Three hundred miles of vehicle barriers; and 105 \nground-based radar cameras.\n  We will finish hundreds of miles of fencing we already promised to \nbuild, and we will have the funds to remove and detain potentially \ndangerous illegal immigrants for overstaying their visas and illegally \nreentering the country.\n  To Republicans, it is simple: There is no defense without a strong \nborder first. I think most Americans agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Graham \namendment No. 3117.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 95, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 361 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--95\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n     Voinovich\n      \n      \n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Specter\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 3117) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, without objection, I yield briefly to \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to the managers, I am going to ask to \nintroduce an amendment. I am not going to ask for it to be considered \nnow. I only want to lay it down.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside to \ncall up amendments Nos. 3167 and 3142 and ask for their immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I could \nsay to the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nwe are trying to work toward the end of this bill. I am wondering, do \nyou want votes on these two amendments?\n  Mr. BIDEN. One I think will be worked out and the other one I wish to \ntalk with the Chair about whether I would ask for a vote. I may ask for \na vote.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, can we do \nit in the regular order?\n  Mr. BIDEN. My friend is accommodating my schedule. I am going to \nallow us to move on rather than come back after he speaks. That is all. \nIt is an accommodation of my schedule; nothing beyond that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment will be pending, right?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I assume unanimous consent will be asked to move off that \namendment and back on to the business of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I might ask \nwhat the Feingold amendment is and how long he expects to take, and \nwhether he expects to vote on that amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment is very similar to the \nprevious Feingold amendment relating to the Iraq war and using the \npower of the purse to terminate our involvement there. I believe there \nwill be a unanimous consent request made to have an hour on each side \nfor the debate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, further reserving, I wonder--and this is a \nbit of an imposition--if I could ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nSCHIP override vote 5 minutes preceding the Senator offering his \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have no objection to deferring our \nconsideration of the amendment so the Senator from Montana can speak \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Montana?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana wishes 5 minutes to \nspeak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Five minutes on the Children's Health Insurance Program \noverride--5 minutes--and then go back to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3167 and 3142\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendments Nos. 3167 and 3142 and \nask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments en bloc.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3167, for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida, and an \n     amendment numbered 3142.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3167\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test, and \n Evaluation, Defense-Wide, $4,000,000 for MARK V replacement research)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.  Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide'', up to \n     $4,000,000 may be available for Program Element 1160402BB for \n     MARK V replacement research for the pursuit by the Special \n     Operations Command of manufacturing research needed to \n     develop all-composite hulls for ships larger than 100 feet.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3142\n\n     (Purpose: To provide an additional $23,600,000,000 for Other \n    Procurement, Army, for the procurement of Mine Resistant Ambush \n      Protected vehicles and to designate the amount an emergency \n                              requirement)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.  The amount appropriated by title III under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Army'' is hereby increased by\n\n[[Page S12485]]\n\n     $23,600,000,000, with the amount of the increase to be \n     available for the procurement of Mine Resistant Ambush \n     Protected (MRAP) vehicles: Provided, That the amount of the \n     increase is hereby designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nGraham, Casey, and Sanders as cosponsors of amendment No. 3142.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  Mr. President amendment No. 3142 is very simple. It provides the \n$23.6 billion in funding needed to replace every Army up-armored HMMWV \nin Iraq with a mine resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicle.\n  It is exactly the same thing we did on the authorization bill that \nwas passed Monday night.\n  Our commanders in the field tell us that MRAPs will reduce casualties \nby 67 to 80 percent.\n  The lead commander on the ground in Iraq, LTG Ray Odierno told us \nmonths ago that he wanted to replace each of the Army's approximately \n18,000 up-armored HMMWVs in Iraq with an MRAP.\n  Instead of adjusting the requirement immediately, the Pentagon has \ntaken its time to study this issue. They originally agreed that the \nArmy should get 380 MRAPs. That was in December 2006.\n  Then, in March of this year, they agreed to 2,500.\n  In August, they added a few more and agreed to 2,726 for the Army.\n  This month, they have agreed that the general needs a little over \nhalf of what he asked for--10,000. Slowly they are getting there.\n  We have seen this movie before with the body armor and with the up-\narmored HMMWVs. Until Congress insisted that the better protection be \nfielded to all those in Iraq, it was not.\n  So, today, we are insisting that the Army get all of the 18,000 MRAPs \nthe commanders in the field have asked for.\n  To be honest, I cannot understand why it is taking so long to agree \nto replace them all. It makes no sense. We know how effective these \nvehicles can be.\n  Just last week, General Pace, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, told the Appropriations Committee that MRAPs have been tested \nat Aberdeen with 300 pounds of explosives below them and they survived.\n  Are we only supposed to care about the tactical advice of our \ncommanders in the field when it is cheap?\n  I don't think that is what the American people or our military men \nand women expect from us.\n  I know some will say that it is not possible to build a total of \n23,000 MRAPs in 12 to 15 months. Why not? Why not?\n  This is basically a modified truck. With real leadership and a \nnational level commitment, America can certainly make this happen. I \nbelieve in the ``can-do'' spirit and deep patriotism of our businesses. \nMRAP manufacturers want to make the 23,000 vehicles needed to save the \nlives of our men and women on the front line.\n  But I also know that we have to do our part. In Congress, the best \nthing we can do to make sure it happens is to fully fund every vehicle \nneeded upfront.\n  Contractors and subcontractors can only expand their capacity if we \nare clear on what we need and that we will fully fund it.\n  This amendment allows us to do that.\n  It also ensures that any delays in dealing with the overall wartime \nsupplemental funding bill do not cause the production lines that are \nonly now getting up to speed to shut down.\n  Once we provide the full funding, American businesses must step up \nand get it done and the Pentagon must manage the program aggressively \nand attentively and the President must make it clear that this is a \nnational priority.\n  But we have no chance of making all of the needed vehicles, as \nquickly as possible, if we fund the program bit by bit, in fits and \nstarts. We must do our part.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to weigh their options.\n  Do we do our best to save American lives, knowing that the only \ndownside is the possible need to reprogram funding at the end of the \nyear? Or do we care more about some unknown total wartime funding limit \nthan those lives?\n  We have an obligation to provide the best possible protection to each \nand every military man and woman while they are in the line of fire. If \nthese vehicles can reduce American casualties by two-thirds or more, \nhow can we do anything else? I agree with the Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, GEN James Conway when he said, ``Anything less is immoral.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                       Back to Work for Children\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their \nindulgence.\n  It was with sadness and frustration and even anger that I learned of \nthe President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program. I am \nsad, because I am thinking first and foremost of the children without \nhealth coverage today. Those children could have had health coverage \ntomorrow had the President signed this bill. For now, thanks to his \nveto, these children will continue to go without doctors' visits. They \nwill go without the medicines they need to stay healthy.\n  I have frustration, because we worked for months on a bipartisan \nChildren's Health Insurance Program agreement in the Senate. The House \nwisely adopted it. It was passed by an overwhelming margin. It deserved \nbetter consideration by the President of the United States.\n  Instead, the carefully crafted compromise that we sent to the White \nHouse became the subject of a campaign of misinformation. That campaign \nwas designed to obscure the true help for families contained in our \nbill, and that is frustrating.\n  There is anger as well, because that is what so many parents in my \nown State of Montana and all across this country are feeling, and are \nright to feel today. There is anger because working families are not \ngetting what they deserve. The pain of not being able to provide \nreliable health care for a child has to be excruciating. The President \nhas the power to end that pain for millions of parents today. Congress \ngave him the chance to help children get the health care they need, but \nthe President said no.\n  It has to make hard-working parents angry. They have a right to be \nangry--for a minute--but then we have to get back to work for America's \nchildren.\n  The President has allowed politics to obscure the good that the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program does for low-income, uninsured \nAmerican children. And he has allowed ideology to obscure the good that \nthis bill could do for millions more.\n  We must take a different path. We cannot allow anger to get in the \nway of the work that must be done. There is too much at stake for our \nchildren.\n  Regardless of the administration's objections, these are still the \nfacts. Our Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act \nalready does what the President has asked:\n  It focuses coverage on the lowest income children--the original \nmission of CHIP. More than 9 out of 10 kids served by CHIP are in \nfamilies earning less than twice the poverty level; it keeps CHIP for \nchildren by curbing and even eliminating adult coverage; and it takes \ngreat pains to reach children who are without insurance--not those who \nalready have coverage. Our bill gives States incentives to find the \nlow-income kids already eligible for CHIP.\n  We worked hard to craft a responsible bill, because we know the good \nthat CHIP has done; and we will not give up on enacting it into law, \nbecause we see how much more good CHIP can do.\n  After months of cooperation, Republicans and Democrats, the Senate \nand the House must work together again to override this ill-considered \nveto. A poll released just yesterday says that nearly out three out of \nfour Americans support the approach in our bill.\n  How can the President turn a blind eye to those who need this bill \nthe most? How can he deny them what they need more than anything: to be \nhealthy? How can he look into a mother's eye and say that he supports \nCHIP, while at the same time his hand strikes it down?\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\n  CHIP is the right answer for thousands of children in Montana and \nmillions across the country. They need health coverage and care today. \nSo here in the Senate, we will do our part to override this veto. We \nare going to make the case to more colleagues who should support this \nbill. We're going to bring together those who value kids over politics. \nWe will vote for America's children. We will seek to end the sadness, \nfrustration, and anger that so many families must feel over this veto. \nWe will tell them that the help and hope of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program is still possible for their own children.\n  Mr. President, we are not finished working for America's children.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I rise with a brief question. I wish to say we would \nnot be at this point, we would not have this bipartisan majority \nwithout the work of the Senator from Montana and Senators Grassley, \nHatch, and Rockefeller. The chairman has been the person who reminds us \nevery day that it is about the children.\n  Isn't it true that we do, in fact, believe we have wonderful \nbipartisan support, enough to override a Presidential veto here and in \nthe House of Representatives?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my good friend from Michigan, it is strongly \nbipartisan. It was enacted first in 1997 as a bipartisan program. \nPeople love it, and it worked well. The legislation we passed in the \nSenate, and that which passed the House, is an extension to help a few \nmore low-income uninsured kids. It is very important and very much \nbipartisan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 120 \nminutes for debate with respect to the Feingold amendment, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between Senators Feingold and \nInouye or their designees; that no amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; that upon the use or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that the \namendment must receive 60 votes to be agreed to, and if the amendment \ndoesn't achieve that threshold, then it be withdrawn; that if it \nreceives that threshold, then it be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Biden amendment No. 3142.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3164\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthat amendment and call up my amendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3164.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To safely redeploy United States troops from Iraq)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107. (a) Use of Funds.--No funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended to continue the deployment in Iraq of members of the \n     United States Armed Forces after June 30, 2008.\n       (b) Exceptions.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall \n     not apply to the obligation or expenditure of funds for the \n     following, as authorized by law:\n       (1) To conduct operations against al Qaeda and affiliated \n     international terrorist organizations.\n       (2) To provide security for United States Government \n     personnel and infrastructure.\n       (3) To provide training to members of the Iraqi Security \n     Forces.\n       (4) To provide training, equipment, or other materiel to \n     members of the United States Armed Forces to ensure, \n     maintain, or improve their safety and security.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment with \nMajority Leader Harry Reid, and Senators Leahy, Dodd, Kerry, Boxer, \nWhitehouse, Kennedy, Harkin, Sanders, Wyden, Schumer, and Durbin. I \nappreciate the support of the Senate Democratic leadership and so many \nof my colleagues for this amendment.\n  The amendment we are offering is simple--it would require the \nPresident to safely redeploy U.S. troops from Iraq by June 30, 2008, \nwith narrow exceptions. It is very similar to the amendment that we \noffered last month, so I won't take up too much time explaining what it \ndoes. I do, however, want to explain why the Senate should take up this \nissue again, so soon after we last considered it.\n  Some of my colleagues like to call Iraq ``the central front in the \nwar on terror.'' But they don't spend as much time talking about the \nother areas where al-Qaida and its affiliates are operating, nor do \nthey recognize that the administration's singular focus on Iraq is \ndepriving those other areas of the attention and resources they need.\n  Take Afghanistan, for example, where an already weak government is \ngrappling with a resurgence of the Taliban and rising instability. \nReports indicate that there has been a 20 to 25 percent increase in \nTaliban attacks in recent months. Because this administration seems \nblind to the threats to our national security outside of Iraq, \nAfghanistan has been relegated to the back burner for far too long, at \ngrave cost to our national security.\n  Last week, President Bush met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in \nNew York City, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly opening \nsession, but according to news reports he made no mention of the \nTaliban's resurgence. That's a pretty big omission. After all, it was \nthe Taliban that supported bin Laden and provided him and his \nassociates with sanctuary in the run up to 9/11, and shortly \nthereafter. President Bush was right to take us to war in Afghanistan. \nThat was a war focused on those who attacked us on 9/11 and on the \ngovernment that provided a safe haven to al-Qaida.\n  But with the 2003 invasion of Iraq we have been significantly \ndistracted and the war in Afghanistan, once the main show, now has a \nsupporting role, at best. As a result, al-Qaida has protected, rebuilt, \nand strengthened its safe haven in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border \nregion. You only have to look at the front page of today's Washington \nPost--and see the headline ``Pakistan Losing Fight Against Taliban and \nAl-Qaeda''--to realize how dangerous this situation is to our national \nsecurity.\n  We have taken our eye off the ball, Mr. President. The war in Iraq \nhas shifted our focus and our resources. We are focused on al-Qaida in \nIraq--an al Qaida affiliate that didn't exist before the war--rather \nthan on al-Qaida's safe haven along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n\n  In Afghanistan, the absence of adequate security and development has \nled to increased disillusionment with the national government, which \nhas in turn resulted in increasing civilian support for the re-emerging \nTaliban. It goes without question that the vast majority of Afghans \nhave no desire to return to the Taliban era, but the inability of \nPresident Karzai to extend control outside the capital has meant that \nmuch of the Afghan population suffers from pervasive fear and \ninstability. We may see Afghanistan once again engulfed by chaos, \nlawlessness, and possibly extremism.\n  As long as Bin Laden and his reconstituted al-Qaida leadership remain \nat large, Afghanistan's future can not be separated from our own \nnational security. But with our myopic focus on Iraq--and so many of \nour brave troops stuck in the middle of that misguided war--we have \nlost sight of our priorities. Mr. President, we are attempting to help \nstabilize and develop Afghanistan ``on the cheap,'' and that just isn't \ngood enough.\n  Afghanistan is teetering on the edge. Pockets of insecurity across \nthe nation are becoming strongholds for anti-government insurgents who \nare, in turn, exploiting the local population to support their anti-\nwestern agenda. This problem is compounded by the dearth of sufficient \ninternational ground troops, which has coincided with coalition forces \nusing increased air attacks\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\nagainst insurgents. Those attacks carry a greater risk of civilian \ncasualties, undermining our support among the populace. Although the \nmajority of attacks on civilians are perpetrated by the Taliban and \nother insurgent groups, the lack of ground troops is seriously \nundermining our efforts in Afghanistan.\n  We also face instability and insurgent attacks in Iraq, of course. \nBut unlike in Iraq, where 165,000 U.S. troops are stuck in a civil war \nthat requires a political solution, in Afghanistan we are fighting with \nfar fewer troops to protect and advance the political progress of the \nAfghan people. Our troops accomplished their mission in Iraq when they \ntook out Saddam Hussein--maintaining a massive troop presence in that \ncountry just fuels anti-Americanism and serves as a recruitment tool \nfor terrorists. We have not accomplished our mission in Afghanistan--\ndenying a safe haven to those who aided and abetted the 9/11 attacks.\n  Instead of seeing the big picture--instead of placing Iraq in the \ncontext of a comprehensive and global campaign against a ruthless \nenemy, al Qaida--this administration persists in the tragic mistake it \nmade over 4 years ago when it took the country to war in Iraq. That war \nhas led to the deaths of more than 3,700 Americans and perhaps as many \nas 1 million Iraqi civilians. It has deepened instability throughout \nthe Middle East, and it has undermined the international support and \ncooperation we need to defeat al-Qaida.\n\n  Mr. President, the war in Iraq is not making us safer; it is making \nus more vulnerable. It is stretching our military to the breaking point \nand inflaming tensions and anti-American sentiment in an important and \nvolatile part of the world. It is playing into the hands of our \nenemies, as even the State Department recognized when it said that the \nwar in Iraq is ``used as a rallying cry for radicalization and \nextremist activity in neighboring countries.''\n  It would be easy to put all the blame on the administration, but \nCongress is complicit, too. With the Defense appropriations bill before \nus, we have another chance to end our complicity and reverse this \nPresident's intractable policy. Finally, we can listen to the American \npeople, save American lives, and protect our Nation's security by \nredeploying our troops from Iraq.\n  I understand that some Members of Congress do not want to have this \ndebate now, on this bill. They would rather keep the Defense \nAppropriations bill ``clean'' and postpone Iraq debates until we take \nup the supplemental. I respect their views, but I disagree. Like it or \nnot, this is, in part, an Iraq bill. It isn't possible to completely \nseparate war funding from regular DOD funding, Mr. President. In fact, \nthis bill pays for a significant part of our operations in Iraq. It is \ntherefore appropriate and responsible that we attach language bringing \nthat war to a close.\n  That is why I am again offering an amendment with Majority Leader \nHarry Reid to effectively bring the war to an end. Our amendment is \nvery similar to the amendment we introduced last month to the Defense \nauthorization bill. It would require the President to safely redeploy \nU.S. troops from Iraq by June 30, 2008. At that point, with our troops \nsafely out of Iraq, funding for the war would be ended, with narrow \nexceptions for troops to do the following: provide security for U.S. \nGovernment personnel and infrastructure; train the Iraqi Security \nForces, ISF, and conduct operations against al-Qaida and affiliates.\n  In order to make clear that our legislation will protect the troops, \nwe have specified that nothing in this amendment will prevent U.S. \ntroops from receiving the training or equipment they need ``to ensure, \nmaintain, or improve their safety and security.'' I hope we won't be \nhearing any more phony arguments about troops on the battlefield \nsomehow not getting the supplies they need. It is false, phony, and it \nis a red herring and should not be used on the floor of the Senate.\n  Passing this amendment will not deny our troops a single bullet or \nmeal.\n  It will simply result in their safe redeployment out of Iraq. When I \nchaired a Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this year on Congress's \npower of the purse, Walter Dellinger of Duke Law School testified about \nmy proposal. This is what he said:\n\n       There would not be one penny less for salary for the \n     troops. There would not be one penny less for benefits of the \n     troops. There would not be one penny less for weapons or \n     ammunition. There would not be one penny less for supplies or \n     support. Those troops would simply be redeployed to other \n     areas where the Armed Forces are utilized.\n\n  The Feingold-Reid amendment is a safe and responsible use of \nCongress's power of the purse. It is the path we took in 1993 when, in \nthe aftermath of the ``Black Hawk Down'' incident, the Senate \noverwhelmingly approved an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill \nthat set a funding deadline for U.S. troop deployments in Somalia. \nSeventy-six Senators voted for that amendment, sponsored by the current \nsenior Senator from West Virginia. And many of these Senators are still \nin this body, such as Senators Cochran, Domenici, Hutchison, Lugar, \nMcConnell, Specter, Stevens, and Warner. They recognized that this was \nan entirely appropriate way to safely redeploy U.S. troops. With their \nsupport, the amendment was enacted, and the troops came home from \nSomalia before that deadline.\n  In order to avoid a rule XVI point of order, this amendment is \nslightly different than the version we offered last month. The new \namendment only covers funds in the 2008 Defense appropriations bill, \nand it omits the first two sections of the old Feingold-Reid amendment \nwhich required the President to transition the mission and to begin \nredeployment within 90 days. In addition, the exceptions for operations \nagainst al-Qaida and for training the ISF are less detailed and \nrestrictive than they were before. But the intent is the same. After \nconsulting with the parliamentarians, we have made these changes to \nensure we are not blocked from getting a vote. The heart of Feingold-\nReid--the requirement that our troops be redeployed by June 30, 2008--\nremains.\n  Some of my colleagues will oppose this amendment. That is their \nright. But I hope they will not do so on the grounds that we should \nkeep the Defense appropriations bill clean, or that a brief debate and \nvote on this amendment will somehow delay that bill. Passing a defense \nspending bill without even discussing the most important national \ndefense and national security issue facing our country is simply \nirresponsible. As long as our troops are fighting and dying for a war \nthat doesn't make sense, as long as the American people are calling out \nfor an end to this tragedy, as long as the administration and its \nsupporters press ahead with their misguided strategy, we have a \nresponsibility to debate and vote on this issue again and again and \nagain.\n  By enacting Feingold-Reid, we can refocus on our top national \nsecurity priority--waging a global campaign against al-Qaida and its \naffiliates. We can refocus on developing a comprehensive strategy for \ndealing with deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan that link together \nthe policies and programs needed to establish a viable state there, and \nwe can focus on the other areas around the world, from North Africa to \nSoutheast Asia, where al-Qaida and its affiliates are operating.\n  The war in Iraq is the wrong war. It is overstretching our military \nand undermining our national security. It is time for the war to end. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we turn again to the Feingold-Reid \namendment. I have cosponsored this amendment in the past, and I am \nhappy to do so again today. This amendment is another chance for us to \nshow real leadership by forging a responsible and binding path out of \nthe quagmire in which we find ourselves in Iraq.\n  In just a few short months, we will be starting the sixth year of \nthis war. We just watched the series on television, the wonderful piece \nthat Ken Burns produced of that war, a terrible, difficult war. It was \nlong over by the time\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\nwe engaged in this war--a war that fought the world, the Far East, \nEurope, Africa, the South Pacific. And here we are soon to start the \nsixth year of this war, and we are in a war that has been fought in an \narea the size of the State of California.\n  This amendment puts before us a binding national policy, a strategy \nthat Democrats and some courageous Republicans have advocated for \nmonths. I don't agree with my friend from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel, on a \nlot of issues, but I say that his leadership, leading Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents, on this war issue is one of the most \ncourageous political acts I have seen. I have told him so. I believe \nit. So there are Republicans who have joined in this effort, and I \nadmire every one of them.\n  We are asking for a strategy that is the best path for the people of \nthe United States and Iraq. It is a path. This legislation changes our \nfundamental mission away from policing a civil war, reduces our large \ncombat footprint, and focuses on those missions which are in the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n\n  It exercises congressional powers that we have within the \nConstitution--powers to limit funding after June 1 of next year well \ninto the sixth year of the war--to counterterrorism, force protection, \nand targeted training of Iraqi forces.\n  This amendment recognizes we have strong interests in Iraq and the \nMiddle East, but it does not permit the open-ended role of the United \nStates in a civil war.\n  Nearly all experts agree that 6 years after our country was attacked \non 9/11, the President's preoccupation with Iraq has not made America \nany more secure. Afghanistan is under attack. We need more forces \nthere, not less. We cannot send them because we are bogged down in \nIraq. The Taliban is attacking us with drug cultivation and trafficking \nat the highest level in years.\n  Pakistan's tribal border areas have become an increasingly alarming \nsafe haven where bin Laden and a new generation of al-Qaida affiliated \nterrorists remain free to plot terrorist attacks.\n  As we all know, Iraq is mired, I repeat, in a civil war, an \nintractable civil war with no political reconciliation in sight. It is \nlong past time for meaningless resolutions and minor policy tweaks. We \nneed a major change of course in Iraq, one that responsibly brings our \ntroops home, rebuilds the readiness of our military, and returns our \nfocus on fighting a real war on terror against bin Laden and his al-\nQaida network.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this responsible and long overdue \nlegislation. I think Senator Feingold and I are not aware of how votes \nhave been taken on this issue in the past, but we want others to step \nforward and do what we believe is right. It is time to chart a course \nout of Iraq and return our forces to the real and growing threats we \nface throughout the world.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed the Tanner bill with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. This legislation would require the \nPresident to provide Congress with reports within 60 days of the \nadministration's plans for drawing the war to a close.\n  Is this a step in the right direction? Some say so. We know the \nadministration failed from the very beginning and repeatedly thereafter \nto adequately plan for the war in Iraq. We know the President took us \nto war without a plan for peace. Since then, his administration has \nresisted any attempts to examine his failures or to consider broad \nchanges to his strategy in Iraq. The White House stubbornly refused to \ntake on all the detailed planning that those changes would require. \nThere is no sign that this shortsighted administering of the war will \nend.\n  If Congress does not act, the administration is bound to repeat the \nsame mistakes--finishing the Iraq war as irresponsibly as it was \nstarted. The administration should begin planning for the end of the \nwar and the redeployment of our troops, and Congress should expect this \nto be made available for oversight and examination.\n  Some of my colleagues would like to see the Senate take up the \nlegislation that passed the House yesterday. It is within their rights. \nIt is legislating on an appropriations bill, and in a conversation I \nhad with one of my colleagues who indicated they might offer it, the \ntwo managers said they will raise a point of order.\n  I am not one for more reports. I think we need more than reports. But \nI admire those people who proffered this amendment that was adopted \noverwhelmingly in a bipartisan vote. I hope we can get those who \nbelieve the war has gone on too long, and we need a change, to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will complete action on \nthis bill today. The Senators from Hawaii and Alaska have worked in a \nbipartisan manner to determine how to provide the resources necessary \nto sustain the operations of the Department of Defense while providing \nthe capability to meet future threats. It is worth noting that this \nbill was reported by the Appropriations Committee by a unanimous vote. \nThe bill does not attempt to force controversial policy changes that \nwould trigger a veto by the President. The bill fully supports our \nmilitary by providing increases in end strength for the Army and Marine \nCorps. It supports military health care reforms, and it provides needed \nfunds to replace or repair and maintain aging and heavily used \nequipment.\n  Our military is providing trained and equipped forces to sustain \nmultiple fronts on the global war on terrorism, while at the same time \ntransitioning the force to meet future threats. Our military leaders \nneed these resources in a timely manner if they are to succeed.\n  It is particularly critical that we complete action on the Defense \nappropriations bill as soon as possible to support our men and women in \nuniform and the civil servants who work with them. We need to complete \naction on this Defense appropriations bill so we can go to conference \nwith the House and deliver a bill as soon as possible to the President.\n  While the continuing resolution we passed last week contains some \nbridge funding to support the troops through November 16, it is not \nadequate for the longer term.\n  The President submitted a fiscal year 2008 war supplemental request \nin February. Last week, in our Appropriations Committee hearing, \nSecretary of Defense Gates made clear the need for this additional \nfunding. We should not delay action on providing supplemental funding \nuntil next year. It is simply unacceptable.\n  The fact is, we have tens of thousands of American men and women in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and around the world performing the mission that our \nGovernment has assigned to them. The new fiscal year has already begun. \nWe should not cause uncertainty or hardship for our Armed Forces or try \nto change American policy in Iraq by starving our troops of needed \nresources. Let's get on with it and provide our men and women in \nuniform the resources they need to perform that mission successfully.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I withhold that \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me say quickly, before I turn to the \nSenator from Connecticut, how much I admire the Senator from \nMississippi. We have worked closely. His response to our amendment is \nabout the need to move on and pass the Defense appropriations bill. \nObviously, this is not getting in the way of doing that. We immediately \nagreed to a 2-hour time agreement. This is perfectly reasonable in \nlight of the fact that this is the biggest military situation we have \nhad in decades in this country. So it seems like a very minor thing to \nspend 2 hours on this amendment. We have a time agreement, so in no way \nwill this be preventing us from moving forward to passage of the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  I now turn to my colleague and very strong supporter on these \nefforts, the Senator from Connecticut, and yield him 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWisconsin. I, once again, express my gratitude to\n\n[[Page S12489]]\n\nhim for raising this issue, as he has on numerous occasions in the \npast. It is no surprise whatsoever that he would do so again on this \nvery critical piece of legislation.\n  Let me say that my friend from Mississippi, for whom I have the \nhighest regard and respect, has a job to do to get this bill out. We \nunderstand that as well. But I would underscore the points made by the \nSenator from Wisconsin. There is no other more important issue, I would \nposit, than the one which is the subject of this amendment: that is, \nthe continued military involvement in Iraq and the important question \nof our increased safety and security, and the possibility of Iraq \nreaching some reconciliation with its political and religious leaders. \nIs there still a rationale for our continued presence there, as posited \nby those in favor of this policy?\n  I would argue that there is not. This subject matter is about as \ncritical as it gets for this body to debate. In fact, one may make the \ncase that debating two hours on an amendment such as this is hardly \nadequate time when you consider what is at stake, not just in terms of \ncontemporary issues, but the long-term security interests of our \ncountry. Those interests are going to be affected and, I would argue, \nadversely affected by a policy that raises serious questions.\n  Last month, I came to the floor of this body to speak in favor of a \nsimilar amendment offered by the Senator of Wisconsin, along with \nSenator Reid. It was, I am convinced, a sensible plan for ending our \ndisastrous policy in Iraq. The reasons for doing so are so crystal \nclear to the public; they hardly need rehearsing here, but for the sake \nof those who may not have followed it, let me summarize those arguments \nbriefly. I would ask my colleagues to forgive me for being redundant, \nbut I find the following exchange that occurred just a few days ago so \nastounding and so telling of the folly of this conflict that it bears \nrepeating.\n  It comes from two full days of testimony before Congress by General \nPetraeus. Let me say that I have tremendous admiration for General \nPetraeus. I don't know him personally, but I admire his service to our \ncountry. It has been a distinguished service. Others have had \ndifficulty with it. I don't. He is not the architect of policy; as a \nsenior military official, he is asked to execute policy. So if people \nare upset about policy, their opposition should be toward those who \ncreate the policy, not those we ask to carry it out.\n  There was an exchange between Senator Warner of Virginia and General \nPetraeus before the Senate Armed Services Committee that I thought was \nincredible in its simplicity and directness, and I admire General \nPetraeus for his candor and honesty in answering the question Senator \nWarner posed to him. It was maybe the most direct and serious question \nraised in all those hearings, and it goes to the heart of all this \ndebate.\n  The question to the General from Senator Warner was the following:\n\n       Do you feel that the war in Iraq is making America safer?\n\n  A very simple question--not any more complicated than that. General \nPetraeus said:\n\n       I believe that this is indeed the best course of action to \n     achieve our objectives in Iraq.\n\n  Senator Warner followed up with:\n\n       Does it make America safer?\n\n  General Petraeus's answer was:\n\n       I don't know, actually.\n\n  I don't know. I don't know, actually. To the families of the 3,808 \nmen and women who have lost their lives, this is cold comfort indeed, \nthat the commanding general has not even convinced himself that this \nwar serves our security.\n  That is the fundamental issue, Mr. President. The basic question we \nmust ask ourselves in matters such as these, first and foremost: Does \nthis policy make us safer, more secure, less vulnerable, less isolated \nin the world? If you don't know the answer to that--and I suspect even \nthe general may have some serious doubts about it or he wouldn't have \nbeen as candidly vague in his answer here--we must reexamine whether it \nis in our interest to pursue that policy. Frankly, I think there are \noverwhelming numbers of us here who have, at the very least, serious \ndoubts about this tactic--and that is what it is; it is not a strategy \nbut a tactic--to achieve our greater security and safety. If your \nanswer to that question is no, as it is for me and I think for many \nothers, the evidence is overwhelming here that we are turning Iraq into \na Petri dish for jihadists and terrorists.\n  We have every other nation packing its bags and leaving. So this \ncoalition of the willing is evaporating. Every other issue we are \ngrappling with internationally is seen through the prism of Iraq. \nWhether it is Darfur, Latin America, Asia, or whatever else the issue \nis, it is all seen through that prism. So not only does it affect the \noutcome in Iraq, it is affecting every other consideration in which \nthis Nation is involved. For anyone who believes we are safer, more \nsecure, less vulnerable, less isolated as a result of pursuing this \npolicy, I have serious reservations, as I believe General Petraeus did \nin his answer to our colleague. The consensus is strong and growing, I \nbelieve, that our current course has failed to make Iraq safe and make \nAmerica safer--that it is, in fact, making this country less safe and \nso must change dramatically.\n  The Constitution does not give us the power to sit here and decide on \na day-to-day, hourly basis how to manage the affairs of the Pentagon, \nand rightfully so. Five hundred and thirty-five Members of Congress \nwith disparate political views cannot sit here and dictate on a day-to-\nday basis how this ought to be managed. We are given one power, one \noverwhelming power: the power of the purse. That is what makes this \nbody unique. So I think that any other exhausting legislative language \ndictating how this conflict ought to be managed, with all due respect \nto its authors, is not well placed. We have one responsibility: to \ndecide, yes or no, this is a matter which deserves the continued \nappropriation of America's money, its tax money, to finance it. That is \nthe question. You either believe it is or it isn't.\n  So the amendment being offered by Senator Feingold goes to the very \nheart of the power this body has when it comes to the matter of Iraq \nand whether we fund it. If you believe we should go forward, that we \nare safer, more secure, then you have an obligation to fund it. If you \nbelieve it is not doing that, then you have a commensurate obligation, \nand that is to say enough is enough and to stop. That is our judgment, \nour job, to make that decision. I am not suggesting that it is not a \npleasant one.\n  General Petraeus can be relatively agnostic on the issue. He is a \ngeneral; it is his job to be agnostic, except in the confines of \nprivate conversation. But we don't have that luxury to be agnostic on \nthese questions. We were elected to do a job, to represent our \nconstituencies and, in a broader sense, the people at large, and we \nhave to decide whether the continued investment of their tax dollars is \nworthy of this cause. I don't believe it is.\n  I believe the time has come--and long ago--for us to come up with a \ndifferent policy that would offer Iraq more hope and our own interests \nin the region a far greater prospect for stability, a policy that would \nreestablish our presence and our moral authority in the world when it \ncomes to the myriad other issues we must grapple with as a people.\n  What more could possibly happen to quell the violence between and \namong Iraq's Sunnis and Shiites to end this civil war?\n  Conversely, how much more do we sacrifice in the absence of a \nreconciliation which has not happened?\n  We all know the honest answers to those questions. And knowing them, \nit seems evident the administration's last-ditch supporters here \nare selling us little more than a policy of blind faith. Do the \nPresident's supporters think this can go on forever, or are they simply \nplanning for it to go on until the end of the President's term and then \nhand it off to someone else? Will they come to this floor and claim we \nare invulnerable?\n\n  If General Petraeus does not know, actually--his honest answer to \nSenator Warner's question--whether this war is making us safer, let's \nask another question: Is this war endangering our security?\n  So the choice we face--and I believe it is a choice--is a clear one. \nIt doesn't make it a painless one. In fact, I haven't been part of a \nmore painful debate in all my years in this body, considering the \nlength it has gone on. But to govern is to make such choices,\n\n[[Page S12490]]\n\neven--especially--when they are painful. Our choice not between victory \nand defeat, which has never been the issue from the very outset, even \nthough the strongest advocates of this policy have always argued that. \nThe issue was never the victory or defeat of our military in Iraq. It \nwas always to create the space and opportunity for reconciliation, a \npositive political conclusion in Iraq.\n  The choice is either trying to end Iraq's civil war through the use \nof military force, or demanding that Iraq's political leaders take \nresponsibility through solving their civil conflict through the only \nmeans possible--through reconciliation and compromise.\n  Yet we are now going into nearly the fifth year, and even with the \npleadings of an American President, the Vice President, senior military \npeople, and Lord knows how many Members of Congress, of both political \nparties--even as recently as a few weeks ago--the political leadership \nof that country has not taken advantage. It has not found compromise.\n  If you argue that the surge has created space, it certainly hasn't \ncreated a reconciliation. It doesn't seem anyone is able to persuade \nthe political leadership of that country to do what all of us \nunderstand they must do, and that is to decide whether they want to be \na country and work with each other, despite their differences. No one \nyet has succeeded in that effort. And I don't believe it is likely to \nhappen if we continue the policy we are following.\n  So I believe the American people are far ahead of us on this issue. \nThey have made their choice. It now seems to be our job, our solemn \nresponsibility, to turn those choices into facts.\n  This is precisely what the Feingold amendment does, by cutting off \nfunds from all combat operations in Iraq after June 30 of next year, \nwith four exceptions: counterterrorism operations, protecting \ngovernment personnel and infrastructure, training the Iraqi security \nforces, and force protection.\n  If all of the reasons for supporting this amendment aren't compelling \nenough, I might add another as well. Almost 5 years into the occupation \nof Iraq, the administration continues to ask us to fund the war through \nsupplemental funding bills. It is simply astonishing to me to think \nthat President Bush, hasn't figured out by now what this war costs on a \nregular basis. He ought to fund it through the regular, long-standing \nbudget process and not hide its true cost from the American people by \ncontinuing to ask for supplemental funding, sinking this Nation further \nand further into a several-trillion-dollar debt.\n  Mr. President, let's be under no illusions as to what all Defense \nauthorization and appropriations bills are supporting. They are \nsupporting the continuation of our troop presence in Iraq. We cannot \nartificially separate a Defense funding bill from an Iraq supplemental \nbill. This is an Iraq bill, have no doubts about it.\n  This legislation is what will make our continued military occupation \nof Iraq go forward for many months to come--and this amendment is our \nchance to stop it. I would argue it is probably the last one until \nmaybe sometime next year, when another supplemental bill comes up, and \nthen we will be talking about 2009 and beyond. So we are already \ncommitting ourselves into the next decade of this century.\n  Moments arrive, Mr. President, and this is such a moment. Moments \ncome and then they pass, and speeches are given later about what we \nwished we had done, or what we wish we had known--statements that will \nhave no value whatsoever. We tolerate a mistake once, not twice, when \nit comes to this policy. This is the moment, this is the hour, this is \nthe 2 hours we have to debate: 120 minutes is what we get to debate a \npolicy that is costing us billions of dollars and thousands of lives \nand disrupting, I believe, very profoundly and seriously, the \nleadership of our country in world affairs.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the remaining moments of this debate to \ngive Senator Feingold a chance here and that we support this particular \neffort. Let us rise to this opportunity while we have it. Let us ensure \nnow, while we have the chance, that all of our combat troops are out of \nIraq by next summer.\n  Our men and women in uniform have served there with bravery, \ndevotion, sacrifice, and incredible distinction, but there is nothing \nthey can do now to bring about the political reconciliation Iraq so \ndesperately needs. The choice belongs to the people of Iraq and their \npolitical and religious leaders. And no further shedding of American \nblood can make that choice come faster or come out right. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Feingold amendment and bring an end to this \ndisastrous engagement in a desperate land.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his very strong voice in support of our amendment and \nin support of ending this mistaken war. I really do appreciate it, and \nI thank him for his help on this and hope for a strong showing on the \nfloor of the Senate on this.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum be equally charged on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 4 minutes, if I may, on the manager's time on the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I assume this will not come out of the \ntime we have on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is being counted on the Republican side.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is correct. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, over the last several days, the Nation \nhas watched Ken Burns' film on World War II. As I mentioned on the \nfloor earlier, it is likely to take its place along with the series on \n``Roots,'' along with Ken Burns' own film on the Civil War, along with \nSuper Bowls, as a part of our collective memory.\n  I saw a preview of Mr. Burns' film about 2 months ago at the Library \nof Congress. My wife and I went there with some others. He showed it. \nWe got a sense of how remarkable it was.\n  He said that it represented the time in our history when our country \npulled together more than at any other time. Of course, all of us have \nseen how that ability to pull together, to be one as a Nation, prepared \nus for so many great accomplishments over the past half century--great \nuniversities, great military power, producing nearly a third of all the \nwealth in the world for 5 percent of the world's people.\n  It also produced an era that is instructive to us on how well we as a \ncountry do when we work together. I think it is fitting this bill is on \nthe floor at the time Ken Burns' film is on television. It is fitting \nbecause this war has been one that has divided us. We have not been \nable to unite on it, although I strongly believe we should speak with a \nsingle voice on it, and have said so by sponsoring--along with Senator \nSalazar and 15 other Senators--legislation that would give us a chance \nto do that by implementing the recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton \nIraq Study Group.\n  But I am not here today to argue the importance of what I believe the \nBaker-Hamilton recommendations offer us. I simply want to note it is \nappropriate that the pending bill is being managed by Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens. Senator Inouye is pictured numerous times during \nhis service with the 442nd Division, which fought bravely in Europe \nduring World War II. His heroism in that war won him the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. He was a Japanese American. Japanese Americans were, as \nthe film reminds us, quarantined, reviled, discriminated against, but \nthere he was, risking his life and limb to win the Congressional Medal \nof Honor.\n\n[[Page S12491]]\n\n  He was in the same hospital in Italy that our former Majority Leader \nBob Dole was in. They were wounded about the same time, and they served \nhere together in the Senate for many years.\n  Then, on the other side of the aisle, the bill manager on the \nRepublican side, is Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. He was also in that \nwar. He flew the first plane to land in Beijing after World War II \nended. Senator Stevens was a member of the Flying Tigers, who are \nprominently mentioned in the film.\n  A group of us Senators were in China last year, in a delegation led \nby Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens. They were received with enormous \nrespect because the Chinese remember Senator Stevens' contribution to \ntheir country, and they know, of course, of Senator Inouye's heroism \nand leadership.\n  I think it is appropriate, at a time when we are debating Defense \nappropriations, when we are considering the motto ``E Pluribus Unum,'' \nhow we take this magnificent diversity in this country and make it one \nNation, that we have the debate on this bill led on this floor by two \nmen of that greatest generation, Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens. It \nis appropriate that they be managing this bill.\n  I thought it important for us to acknowledge that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go back \nto the quorum call and, when we do so, the time be evenly divided \nbetween the sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Product Safety\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our Nation's haphazard trade policy has \ndone plenty of damage to Ohio's economy, to our manufacturers, to our \nsmall businesses.\n  Recent news reports of tainted foods and toxic toys reveal another \nhazard of ill-conceived and unenforced trade rules. They subject \nAmerican families, American children, to products that can harm them, \nthat, in some cases, can actually kill them.\n  Ohio's Ashland University Chemistry Professor Jeff Weidenhamer \nrecently tested 22 Halloween products for lead. Three products tested \nwere found to contain high lead levels.\n  Acceptable levels of lead, according to the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, are 600 parts per million. A Halloween Frankenstein cup, \npresumably a cup that ends up in a child's hand, contained 39,000--not \n600--39,000 parts per million.\n  Both Professor Weidenhamer and I have sent letters to the CPSC \ndemanding action. Exposure to lead can affect almost every organ in the \nbody, especially the central nervous system. Lead is especially toxic \nto the brains of developing young children.\n  In the last century, we made gains in combating health and safety \nissues. Whether it was the FDA banning red dye No. 2 or chloroform in \nmedicines or it was banning lead in paint, the Government created a \nstructure, a safety net that makes it harder for unsafe products to \nreach consumers.\n  That safety net is unraveling before our eyes. The safety net secured \nto keep our families safe from lead is being systematically dismantled \nby our Nation's failed trade policies. Our trade rules encourage unsafe \nimports, our gap-ridden food and product inspection system lets those \nimports into the country, our lax requirements for importers let those \nproducts stay on the shelves, and our foot dragging on requiring \ncountry-of-origin labeling leaves consumers in the dark.\n  It is a lethal combination. From pet food to toothpaste, from auto \ntires to kids toys, the daily news highlights the consequences of \nlacksidasical import rules and ``less is less'' import oversight.\n  Countries such as China lack the basic protections we take for \ngranted. Given the well-known dangers of lead, particularly for young \nchildren, we banned it from products such as gasoline and paint decades \nago. With the total lack of protections in our trade policy, we are \nimporting not just the goods from those countries, but we are importing \nthe lax safety standards of those countries.\n  If we relax basic health and safety rules to accommodate Bush-style, \nNAFTA-modeled trade deals, then we should not be surprised to find lead \npaint in our toys and contaminants and toxins in our toothpaste and our \ndog food.\n  Due to trade agreements, there are now more than 230 countries and \nmore than 200,000 foreign manufacturers exporting FDA-regulated goods \ninto the United States, to our child's bedrooms and our kitchen tables.\n  Unfortunately, trade deals put limits on the safety standards we can \nrequire for imports and how much we can even inspect imports. Our trade \npolicy should prevent these problems, not invite them.\n  Now the President wants new trade agreements with Peru, Panama, with \nColombia, and South Korea, all based on the same failed trade model. \nFDA inspectors have rejected seafood imports from Peru and Panama, \nmajor seafood suppliers to the United States.\n  Yet the current trade agreements, as written, limit food safety \nstandards and border inspections. Adding insult to injury, the \nagreements would force the United States to rely on foreign inspectors \nto ensure our safety. We have seen how well that worked with China.\n  More of the same in our trade policy will mean exactly that, more \ncontaminated imports and more recalls. We need a new approach to trade \npolicy and to import safety. We need to write trade laws that encourage \nquality imports not dangerous ones. We need to empower consumers with \nfull information about the projects they are purchasing.\n  It is time for a new direction in our trade policy. It is time for a \ntrade policy that ensures the safety of food on our kitchen tables and \ntoys in our children's bedrooms. Everyone agrees on one thing: We want \nmore trade, we want more trade with countries around the world. But \nfirst we must protect the safety of our children and the health of our \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time remaining be equally \ncharged.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to our cosponsor on \nthis issue, Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment on this Defense \nappropriations bill goes to the most important single foreign policy \nissue facing America: If this is a bill about spending for the \nmilitary, this may be the most important single amendment we could \nconsider.\n  Senator Feingold and Senator Harry Reid have brought this amendment \nto the floor. It has been discussed before. It is an amendment which \ngoes to the very fundamental question: When will we start bringing \nAmerican troops home from Iraq?\n  The President, of course, and his administration have been reluctant \nto even suggest that possibility will come. I think the President went \nso far as to say that of the 160,000 troops or more in Iraq, perhaps \n5,000 or so will be home by Christmas.\n  At that rate, of course, this President will leave office with almost \nthe same number as we have today, risking their\n\n[[Page S12492]]\n\nlives in the heat of combat in Iraq. Many of us remember the beginning \nof this war and how the American people were misled into this war. The \nAmerican people were told that weapons of mass destruction threatened \nthe United States, threatened our allies such as Israel, threatened the \nstability in the world.\n  We were given chapter and verse and detailed descriptions of \nbiological weapons and chemical weapons and nuclear weapons. We were \ntold Saddam Hussein had arsenals of these weapons. He had reached a \npoint where he had so little credibility we would not even send in \ninternational observers, we knew it, they were there, and it was time \nto take him out.\n  Then obviously we were told about his reign as the leader in Iraq, \nnothing short of barbaric, gassing his own people, killing innocent \npeople, ruling with an iron fist. All true. There was always the \nsuspicion and the suggestion that somehow or another Saddam Hussein of \nIraq had something to do with 9/11, that terrible tragedy we faced in \nthe United States.\n  What happened? After the invasion, our great military, in a matter of \nweeks, took control of the country, searched it far and wide to find \nweapons of mass destruction and found nothing. To this day, the fifth \nyear of this war, no evidence whatsoever of any of those weapons, one \nof the real main reasons we were told we had to go to war.\n  Saddam Hussein eventually was arrested, executed by his own people, \nstill not a shred of evidence that he had anything to do with 9/11. The \nAmerican people were misled into this war. There we sit as a Nation, \nnot only with our reputation in the world at stake and on the line \nevery single day, not only at the expense of allies who stood with us \nin fighting against the terrorism of 9/11, but more importantly, at the \nexpense of 160,000 American lives of our men and women in uniform who \nare there at this very moment risking their lives for this President's \nfailed foreign policy.\n  They are loyal and courageous people. I think we all understand the \ngreat debt we will always owe them and their families for what they \nhave done. But what Senator Feingold has said is it is time now for \nthis Senate to stand up and say, unequivocally: These troops need to \nstart coming home in a responsible way. Not all at once. That would be \ndangerous and foolhardy. Senator Feingold does not suggest that.\n  What he suggests is that by June 30 of next year we will be in a \nposition to redeploy our troops, keeping troops in the field in Iraq \nfor specific reasons: to fight al-Qaida and other affiliated \ninternational terrorist organizations, provide security for Americans \nand our American Government, to provide training for Iraqi security \nforces, training equipment and other materials to the members of the \nU.S. Armed Forces--a much different mission. I will tell you, if you \ntake an honest look at our military today, we have pushed these fine \nmen and women and their families to the absolute limit. It is time for \nus to start bringing them home.\n  Three thousand eight hundred and five of our best and bravest have \ndied; 30,000 seriously injured; 10,000 with amputations, traumatic \nbrain injuries, and terribly burns. That will be a burden for a \nlifetime. That is the reality of this war. That is the reality of this \namendment. This is not another idle debate, this debate goes to these \nmen and women and their families and our Nation, a Nation misled into a \nwar, a Nation which will spend three-quarters of a trillion dollars on \nthis war, if the President has his way, a Nation which understands the \ninvasion was brought about by misrepresentations, misrepresentation of \nreality on the ground.\n  We owe it to our soldiers, we owe it to our Nation, and we owe it to \nfuture generations to start bringing an end to this war. It is time \nonce again for the Iraqis to accept the responsibility for their own \nfuture, to put together a government that can govern, a defense force \nthat can defend, and a nation that wants to be a nation\n  If they cannot do that, we cannot send enough soldiers to make that \nhappen. It has to be led by the Iraqi people, and they will never \naccept that responsibility as long as they can lean on the strength, \nthe military strength of the United States.\n  I hope my colleagues, many of whom have dismissed this kind of \namendment and said: We cannot get into this conversation until maybe \nnext spring, we will reflect on the reality by next spring, hundreds \nmore American soldiers will die by next spring, thousands of American \nsoldiers will be seriously injured by next spring, billions of dollars \nwill be spent on this war. It should be spent in America.\n  A strong America begins at home. This President, with his war budget, \nhas taken away the vital services, education, health care for our \nchildren, medical research. Time and again, we find we cannot do the \nbasics for America because this President is hellbent to stay in this \nwar until January 20, 2009, when he walks out the door on his way back \nto Crawford, TX. That is unacceptable. I thank Senator Feingold and \nSenator Reid for giving us this choice today, a choice to change the \ncourse once and for all, to change the policy and move America in the \nright direction in Iraq.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nFeingold-Reid amendment.\n  I strongly support our troops, but I strongly oppose the war.\n  Our military has served nobly in Iraq and done everything we have \nasked them to do. But they are now caught in a quagmire. They are \npolicing a civil war and implementing a policy that is not worthy of \ntheir enormous sacrifice.\n  The best way to protect our troops and our national security is to \nput the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for \ntheir future, so that we can bring our troops back home to America.\n  As long as our military presence in Iraq is open-ended, Iraq's \nleaders are unlikely to make the essential compromises for a political \nsolution.\n  The administration's misguided policy has put our troops in an \nuntenable and unwinnable situation. They are being held hostage to \nIraqi politics, in which sectarian leaders are unable or unwilling to \nmake the difficult judgments needed to lift Iraq out of its downward \nspiral. We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a failed \npolicy that is making America more vulnerable and is putting our troops \nat greater risk.\n  Our policy in Iraq continues to exact a devastating toll. Nearly \n4,000 American troops have died, and 30,000 have been injured. The toll \non Iraqis is immense. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or \ninjured, and more than 4 million Iraqis have been forced to flee their \nhomes. Nearly a half trillion dollars has been spent fighting this war.\n  Now the President wants to use the supplemental spending bill to pour \nhundreds of billions of dollars more into the black hole that our \npolicy in Iraq has become. It is wrong for Congress to continue to \nwrite a blank check to the President for the war. It is obvious that \nPresident Bush intends to drag this process out month after month, year \nafter year, so that he can hand his Iraqi policy off to the next \nPresident.\n  It is time to put the brakes on this madness. We have to change our \npolicy now. Until we do, our troops will continue shedding their blood \nin the streets of Baghdad other parts of Iraq, and our national \nsecurity will remain at risk.\n  This amendment makes the change we so urgently need. It sets a clear \ntimeline for the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops, and it \nrequires most of them to come home in 9 months.\n  It is up to us to halt the open-ended commitment of our troops that \nPresident Bush has been making year after year. The Iraqis need to take \nresponsibility for their own future, resolve their political \ndifferences, and enable our troops to come home. We need to tell the \nIraqis now that we intend to leave and leave soon. Only by doing so, \ncan we add the urgency that is so clearly necessary for them to end \ntheir differences.\n  We can't allow the President to drag this process out any longer. \nThis war is his responsibility, and it is his responsibility to do all \nhe can to end it. It is wrong for him to pass the buck to his \nsuccessor, when he knows that thousands more of the courageous members \nof our Armed Forces will be wounded or die because of it and when every \nday this misguided war goes on, our service\n\n[[Page S12493]]\n\nmen and women and their families continue to shoulder the burden and \npay the price.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 6\\1/2\\ minutes; \nthe Senator from Hawaii has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleague John McCain cannot be here \ntoday. He has a statement with respect to the Feingold amendment that I \nask unanimous consent be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I join my colleague Senator McCain in opposing the amendment \nand wish to read three paragraphs of his statement, and then the rest \nof it will be in the Record for all to see:\n\n       Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by my good \n     friend, the Senator from Wisconsin.\n       The pending amendment would mandate a withdrawal of U.S. \n     combat forces from Iraq and cut off funds for our troops \n     after June 30, 2008. The one exception would be for a small \n     force authorized only to carry out narrowly defined missions.\n       The Senate, once again, faces a simple choice: Do we build \n     on the successes of our new strategy and give General \n     Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and \n     support needed to carry out their mission, or do we ignore \n     the realities on the ground and legislate a premature end to \n     our efforts in Iraq, accepting thereby all the terrible \n     consequences that will ensue?\n       That is the choice we must make, Mr. President, and though \n     politics and popular opinion may be pushing us in one \n     direction, we have a greater responsibility, the duty to make \n     decisions with the security of this great and good nation \n     foremost in our minds. We now have the benefit of the long \n     anticipated testimony delivered by General Petraeus and \n     Ambassador Crocker, testimony that reported unambiguously \n     that the new strategy is succeeding in Iraq. Understanding \n     what we now know--that our military is making progress on the \n     ground, and that their commanders request from us the time \n     and support necessary to succeed in Iraq--it is inconceivable \n     that we in Congress would end this strategy just as it is \n     beginning to show real results.\n\n  Those are the first three paragraphs of the statement from Senator \nMcCain. I join him in opposing the amendment and express his regret at \nnot being able to be here for this debate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nAmendment No. 3164 to the DOD Appropriations Act for FY 2008: Cutoff of \n                             Funds for Iraq\n\n          (Statement of Senator John McCain, October 3, 2007)\n\n       Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered \n     by my good friend, the Senator from Wisconsin.\n       The pending amendment would mandate a withdrawal of U.S. \n     combat forces from Iraq and cut off funds for our troops \n     after June 30, 2008. The one exception would be for a small \n     force authorized only to carry out narrowly defined missions.\n       The Senate, once again, faces a simple choice: Do we build \n     on the successes of our new strategy and give General \n     Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and \n     support needed to carry out their mission, or do we ignore \n     the realities on the ground and legislate a premature end to \n     our efforts in Iraq, accepting thereby all the terrible \n     consequences that will ensue?\n       That is the choice we must make, Mr. President, and though \n     politics and popular opinion may be pushing us in one \n     direction, we have a greater responsibility, the duty to make \n     decisions with the security of this great and good Nation \n     foremost in our minds. We now have the benefit of the long \n     anticipated testimony delivered by General Petraeus and \n     Ambassador Crocker, testimony that reported unambiguously \n     that the new strategy is succeeding in Iraq. Understanding \n     what we now know--that our military is making progress on the \n     ground, and that their commanders request from us the time \n     and support necessary to succeed in Iraq--it is inconceivable \n     that we in Congress would end this strategy just as it is \n     beginning to show real results.\n       We see today that, after nearly 4 years of mismanaged war, \n     the situation on the ground in Iraq is showing demonstrable \n     signs of progress. The final reinforcements needed to \n     implement General Petraeus' new counterinsurgency plan have \n     been in place for over 3 months and our military, in \n     cooperation with the Iraqi security forces, is making \n     significant gains in a number of areas.\n       General Petraeus reported in detail on these gains during \n     his testimony in both houses and in countless interviews. The \n     number two U.S. commander in Iraq, LTG Ray Odierno, has said \n     that the seven-and-a-half-month-old security operation has \n     reduced violence in Baghdad by some 50 percent, that car \n     bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have fallen to their \n     lowest level in a year, and that civilian casualties have \n     dropped from a high of 32 per day to 12 per day. His comments \n     were echoed by LTG Abboud Qanbar, the Iraqi commander, who \n     said that before the surge began, one third of Baghdad's 507 \n     districts were under insurgent control. Today, he said, \n     ``only five to six districts can be called hot areas.''\n       None of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have \n     suddenly become safe, or that violence has come down to \n     acceptable levels. As General Odierno pointed out, violence \n     is still too high and there are many unsafe areas. \n     Nevertheless, such positive developments illustrate General \n     Petraeus' contention that American and Iraqi forces have \n     achieved substantial progress under their new strategy.\n       The road in Iraq remains, as it always has been, long and \n     hard. The Maliki government remains paralyzed and unwilling \n     to function as it must, and other difficulties abound. No one \n     can guarantee success or be certain about its prospects. We \n     can be sure, however, that should the United States Congress \n     succeed in terminating the strategy by legislating an abrupt \n     withdrawal and a transition to a new, less effective and more \n     dangerous course--should we do that, Mr. President, then we \n     will fail for certain.\n       Let us make no mistake about the costs of such an American \n     failure in Iraq. Should the Congress force a precipitous \n     withdrawal from Iraq, it would mark a new beginning, the \n     start of a new, more dangerous effort to contain the forces \n     unleashed by our disengagement. If we leave, we will be \n     back--in Iraq and elsewhere--in many more desperate fights to \n     protect our security and at an even greater cost in American \n     lives and treasure.\n       In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee in \n     September, General Petraeus referred to an August Defense \n     Intelligence Agency report that stated, `` * * * a rapid \n     withdrawal would result in the further release of strong \n     centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a number of dangerous \n     results, including a high risk of disintegration of the Iraqi \n     Security Forces; a rapid deterioration of local security \n     initiatives; al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost ground and freedom \n     of maneuver; a marked increase in violence and further \n     ethnosectarian displacement and refugee flows; and \n     exacerbation of already challenging regional dynamics, \n     especially with respect to Iran.''\n       Those are the likely consequences of a precipitous \n     withdrawal, and I hope that the supporters of such a move \n     will tell us how they intend to address the chaos and \n     catastrophe that would surely follow such a course of action. \n     Should this amendment become law, and U.S. troops begin \n     withdrawing, do they believe that Iraq will become more or \n     less stable? That the Iraqi people become more or less safe? \n     That genocide becomes a more remote possibility or ever \n     likelier? That al Qaeda will find it easier to gather, plan, \n     and carry out attacks from Iraqi soil, or that our withdrawal \n     will somehow make this less likely?\n       No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the \n     centrality of Iraq to the war on terror, there can simply be \n     no debate that our efforts in Iraq today are critical to the \n     wider struggle against violent Islamic extremism. Last month, \n     General Jim Jones testified before the Armed Services \n     Committee and outlined what he believes to be the \n     consequences of such a course: `` . . . a precipitous \n     departure which results in a failed state in Iraq,'' he said, \n     ``will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists, \n     jihadists . . . in the world, who will believe that they will \n     have toppled the major power on Earth and that all else is \n     possible. And I think it will not only make us less safe; it \n     will make our friends and allies less safe. And the struggle \n     will continue. It will simply be done in different and in \n     other areas.''\n       Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of \n     stability, we invite chaos, genocide, terrorist safehavens \n     and regional war. We invite further Iranian influence at a \n     time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons, \n     training fighters, providing resources, and helping plan \n     operations to kill American soldiers and damage our efforts \n     to bring stability to Iraq. If any of my colleagues remain \n     unsure of Iran's intentions in the region, may I direct them \n     to the recent remarks of\n\n[[Page S12494]]\n\n     the Iranian president, who said: ``The political power of the \n     occupiers is collapsing rapidly . . . Soon, we will see a \n     huge power vacuum in the region. Of course, we are prepared \n     to fill the gap.'' If our notions of national security have \n     any meaning, they cannot include permitting the establishment \n     of an Iranian dominated Middle East that is roiled by wider \n     regional war and riddled with terrorist safehavens.\n       The supporters of this amendment respond that they do not \n     by any means intend to cede the battlefield to al Qaeda; on \n     the contrary, their legislation would allow U.S. forces, \n     presumably holed up in forward operating bases, to carry out \n     ``operations against al Qaeda and affiliated international \n     terrorist organizations.'' But such a provision draws a false \n     distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence. Let us \n     think about the implications of ordering American soldiers to \n     target ``terrorists,'' but not those who foment sectarian \n     violence. Was the attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a \n     terrorist operation or the expression of sectarian violence? \n     When the Madhi Army attacks government police stations, are \n     they acting as terrorists or as a militia? When AQI attacks a \n     Shia village along the Diyala River, is that terrorism or \n     sectarian violence? What about when an American soldier comes \n     across some unknown assailant burying an lED in the road? \n     Must he check for an al Qaeda identity card before \n     responding?\n       The obvious answer is that such acts very often constitute \n     terrorism in Iraq and sectarian violence in Iraq. The two are \n     deeply intertwined. To try and make an artificial distinction \n     between terrorism and sectarian violence is to fundamentally \n     misunderstand al Qaeda's strategy--which is to incite \n     sectarian violence. Our military commanders say that trying \n     to artificially separate counterterrorism from \n     counterinsurgency will not succeed, and that moving in with \n     search and destroy missions to kill and capture terrorists, \n     only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy, is the \n     failed strategy of the past 4 years. We should not, and must \n     not, return to such a disastrous course.\n       The strategy that General Petraeus has put into place--a \n     traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes \n     protecting the population, which gets our troops out of the \n     bases and into the areas they are trying to protect, and \n     which supplies sufficient force levels to carry out the \n     mission--that strategy is the correct one. It has become \n     clear by now that we cannot set a date for withdrawal without \n     setting a date for surrender.\n       Mr. President, this fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq \n     alone. It is greater than that and more important still, \n     about whether America still has the political courage to \n     fight for victory or whether we will settle for defeat, with \n     all of the terrible things that accompany it. We cannot walk \n     away gracefully from defeat in this war.\n       Consider just one final statement from the August National \n     Intelligence Estimate. It reads:\n       ``We assess that changing the mission of the Coalition \n     forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization \n     role to a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and \n     counterterrorist operations to prevent AQI from establishing \n     a safehaven would erode any security gains achieved thus \n     far.''\n       Should we pass this amendment, we would erode the security \n     gains that our brave men and women have fought so hard to \n     achieve and embark on the road of surrender. For the sake of \n     American interests, our national values, the future of Iraq \n     and the stability of the Middle East, we must not send our \n     country down this disastrous course. All of us want our \n     troops to come home, and to come home as soon as possible. \n     But we should want our soldiers to return to us with honor, \n     the honor of victory that is due all of those who have paid \n     with the ultimate sacrifice. We have many responsibilities to \n     the people who elected us, but one responsibility outweighs \n     all the others, and that is to protect this great and good \n     Nation from all enemies foreign and domestic. I urge my \n     colleagues to vote no on the Feingold amendment.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time I have \nbe reserved for further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like 5 minutes, if that is \npossible, to speak against the Feingold-Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To my dear friend from Wisconsin, Russ Feingold, I \nappreciate his passion. I know he is acting on his beliefs. We need \nmore of that. I disagree with him fairly dramatically about the \nconsequences of his proposal. As I understand it, it would stop funding \nin many areas of military operations that are ongoing in Iraq now and, \nby using funding, restrict the mission in a way that would be ill-\nadvised for our own national security interests.\n  The biggest winner of a change in mission through restricted funding \nwould be Iran. The Iranian regime is actively involved in trying to \nkill American servicemembers to drive us out. Their biggest fear in \nIran is to have a functional democratic representative government in \nIraq on their border that would create problems for the way they run \ntheir own country. They are not going to stand on the sideline and \nwatch Iraq be transformed into a representative form of government \nwithout a fight. They have chosen to be involved in militia groups with \nthe goal of killing Americans. The goal is to create casualties and \nbreak the will of the American people so we will leave Iraq.\n  In terms of al-Qaida, the biggest loser of the surge militarily has \nbeen al-Qaida. They have been diminished because of a new way of \nconfronting this enemy where we get out behind the walls. We live with \nthe Iraqi Army and police forces. We are taking the fight to al-Qaida, \nand we have been able to marginalize and diminish their presence.\n  This amendment would embolden an enemy that is literally on the mat. \nIt would send the wrong message to Iran at a time when they need to \nhear something different than America is going to leave. They need to \nhear the message that America is going to stand behind the forces in \nIraq to create a stable Iraq. The last thing this Congress should do is \ncreate a change in mission through funding that will undercut an \noperation that has produced results on the security front never known \nbefore.\n  Under the rules of engagement, how do you determine who al-Qaida is \nwith any certainty over there?\n  So the idea of restricting the military mission against the advice of \nGeneral Petraeus seems to me to be ill-advised. The Congress has a \nrobust role in time of war. But at the end of the day, we have to make \na decision: Whose advice are we going to follow in terms of military \nstrategy: General Petraeus and his colleagues or are we going to try to \nrewrite the mission based on what we think is best on the ground \nmilitarily?\n  I think it would be a huge mistake for this Congress to adopt this \namendment because it would be welcome news in Tehran. It would be seen \nby a very oppressive regime that, America is going to leave Iraq, and \nthey would be the big beneficiary of what would be left behind, which \nwould be a chaotic situation.\n  Does Iran want chaos in Iraq? To some extent. Does Iran want a \nrepresentative government in Iraq? Absolutely not. They are going to do \neverything within their power to make sure that does not happen. It is \nin our national security interest to make sure it does.\n  Al-Qaida has been diminished greatly from the surge. If this \namendment was adopted, it would be cheered on by al-Qaida operatives--\nwe are back in the fight because we know when America is going to \nleave. We know when the mission is going to be changed.\n  So I would argue this amendment comes at the worst possible time for \nAmerican national security interests, and it is ill-advised in concept \nand impossible to execute.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor engaging in debate in the respectful and substantive way he has \ndone so. We agree on many issues but not on this one.\n  Let me, in the very brief time I have, respond to a couple things he \nsaid. First, just an observation. He asked: How, under my amendment, \nare we going to determine who al-Qaida is in Iraq?\n\n[[Page S12495]]\n\n  Well, I guess I ask the question: How are we doing it now? \nPresumably, we are identifying our enemy and attacking them. We are not \njust attacking them indiscriminately.\n  He said: How in the world are we going to determine who al-Qaida is? \nI certainly hope we have some kind of a way to do that now. I am very \npuzzled by that argument.\n  But the broader point of this issue is this: The heart of the \nargument of the Senator from South Carolina is that somehow having a \ntimetable and withdrawing from this mistake in Iraq is going to help \nboth al-Qaida and Iran. I would say it is just the opposite. The \nsituation in Iraq is ideal for al-Qaida. It is sapping our military \nstrength in Iraq and throughout the world at the same time that al-\nQaida, according to our own public National Intelligence Estimate, is \nreinvigorating itself in Pakistan, in Afghanistan, and around the \nworld. So it is just the opposite.\n  Continuing this involvement in Iraq that we have right now completely \nplays into the hands of those who attacked us on 9/11.\n  Now, the Senator from South Carolina poses the notion that somehow \nIran would be pleased to see us leave Iraq. Well, I am sure that is \ntrue eventually. But at this point it is actually ideal for Iran. They \nare expanding their influence, and we are taking the hits. We are \ntaking the hits in terms of casualties, we are taking the hits \nfinancially, and they do not have to go in and invade or try to control \nIraq.\n  So actually it is the status quo that benefits Iran. It is perfect \nfor them, and they are showing it every day. So it is just the \nopposite. Two of the most problematic enemies we have--Iran, in the \nform of a country that is very difficult for us, and al-Qaida, in terms \nof a terrorist organization--they benefit from our mistake of \nindefinitely continuing this involvement in Iraq. I believe that is the \nnational security analysis that is most appropriate. That is why I \noffer this amendment in the spirit of national security, not simply in \nthe spirit of trying to bring our troops out of Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and ask unanimous \nconsent, again, that my time be reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to this \nmeasure, not because I do not agree with the goal sought by this \nFeingold amendment; I agree with it. However, it was the decision of \nthe leadership of the committee that matters that can be appropriately \ndebated in the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill should be debated \nthere.\n  I believe if we open the door to the Feingold amendment, then I am in \nno position to suggest we oppose other appropriate measures for the \nsupplemental. Therefore, reluctantly, but forcefully, I must say I hope \nmy colleagues will support me in opposing this measure.\n  I thank you, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just want to say to the Senator from \nHawaii, through the Chair, how much I respect him. I understand why he \nhas to take this approach on this particular attempt to offer this \namendment. The fact is, this great Senator, this war hero, has \nsupported us on this amendment in other contexts. He is in agreement \nwith us.\n  He has a responsibility on this bill that I respect. But what greater \nstatement that we are on the right track in terms of wanting to have a \nreasonable withdrawal from Iraq than the fact that this great Senator \nhas been supportive. So I thank him. Of course, I hope people will vote \nwith me on this amendment, but I completely understand his reason for \ntaking this approach on this particular bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, what time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 21\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have expressed \nserious concerns about the war in Iraq. I would say now is the time to \nput those concerns into action. We have the power and the \nresponsibility to end a war that is hurting our troops, our fiscal \nsituation, and our national security.\n  By voting for the Feingold-Reid amendment today, we can safely \nredeploy our troops from Iraq. I understand the bill's managers would \nrather not address Iraq on their bill. That is their decision. But I \nnote this amendment has the strong support of the Democratic \nleadership. So I thank Senator Reid for his support and leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3164 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n   Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) is \nnecessarily absent.\n   Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n\n\n               State Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if there is no pending business before the \nSenate, I wish to be recognized to speak for a few minutes on the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which we call affectionately \nSCHIP. I was privileged to be chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation in the late nineties, when Governors and a lot of other \nfolks negotiated with the Congress and the Clinton administration to \ncreate the State Children's Health\n\n[[Page S12496]]\n\nInsurance Program. I am pleased--as I know a lot of people are in this \ncountry--to see all of the good it has done.\n  We know that in America today we have roughly 45 million Americans \nwho have no health care coverage. It is like a quilt that fits over a \nbed, if you will, and the quilt has different patches to it. One of the \nbig patches on the quilt providing health care coverage to a lot of \nAmericans is employer-provided coverage, another is Medicare, and then \nthere is Medicaid for low-income folks. Another piece of the quilt \nwould be the federally funded community health centers; and another \npiece might be veterans health care, or DOD health care. Altogether, \nthey add up to provide enough to cover 85 percent of the American \npopulace that needs health care coverage. For the folks who are not \ncovered, a large part of the 15 percent who have no coverage is people \nwho live with families where somebody works every day, every week. The \nproblem for those families is they don't have employer-provided health \ncare coverage or enough disposable income to pay their share of that \nemployer-provided coverage, and they end up doing without.\n  Most of those people still get health care eventually. That health \ncare coverage comes too frequently in an emergency room of a hospital \nin their community. When somebody gets sick enough, that is where they \ngo to get care.\n  My colleague in the chair and I are both familiar with the tragedy \nthis year where a young boy in Maryland, I think, had a problem with a \ntooth that abscessed, and he ended up going into the hospital through \nthe emergency room and being hospitalized for an extended period of \ntime. The cost of the health care he received was in the hundreds of \nthousands of dollars. The greater cost is that he died; he lost his \nlife. Another tragedy was in the case of a young man who was eligible \nfor SCHIP and his family didn't know it. It is almost like the old \nquestion: If a tree falls in the forest and there is nobody there to \nhear it, is there a noise? If you have a benefit such as SCHIP or \nMedicaid and a family doesn't know they are eligible, is there a \nbenefit? I am tempted to say there probably is not.\n  A lot of people in this country who ought to be eligible for this \nprogram, who could be eligible for the program, would be if the \nPresident had not vetoed the legislation we passed. I listened to \nSenator Grassley talk about the President's veto. I admire him a great \ndeal and the way he stood up, stood tall on this issue, along with \nSenator Baucus and others, to craft the expansion of this program. That \nspeaks volumes about Senator Grassley and his care for young people.\n  Among the criticism we hear of this expansion of this program is that \nit is more of a government fix for our health care woes in America. The \ncoverage that most kids have under the SCHIP program is not provided by \nthe Government. They actually go to a private program and it is \nprovided through any one of a variety of programs. We also hear that \nthis is more Government spending. This is actually Government spending \nwhere we pay for it. We have an offset here, and not everybody likes \nit, but it is an increase in the tax on tobacco, cigarettes, where we \nraise enough money to offset the cost of this program over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Here is a chart. For the Children's Health Insurance Program, the \ncost over the next 5 years is about $35 billion. We raise the money to \npay for it, and we are required to under the rules, which is a good \nthing. Our pay-go procedures require that. We have to come up with an \noffset to pay for that so it is deficit neutral. So this $35 billion is \npaid for. It doesn't make the deficit bigger and it provides health \ncare coverage for about 4 million more kids. They will have a chance to \nhave a primary health care home. They will not have to look for health \ncare coverage in an emergency room of a hospital. They will not end up \nspending days or weeks or longer in a hospital as an inpatient trying \nto get better from something that could have been caught early on by a \nprimary care physician.\n  A good comparison here is the SCHIP program expansion is paid for--\nthe $35 billion is fully paid for. There will be no increase in the \ndeficit. Compare that to what the President is asking for an increase \nin spending with respect to the war in Iraq. The President is going to \nask for additional money in the weeks ahead; he will ask us to \nappropriate $197 billion to pay for our involvement in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for roughly the next year. It is not paid for. It is not \noffset by cuts in spending someplace else. It is not offset by \nincreases in revenue somewhere else. That will be $197 billion in extra \ndebt.\n  Some people think we can run up these deficits and we will print the \npaper to pay for them. We don't. We borrow money from folks all over \nthis country--from investors, and from investors all over the world.\n  Some of those investors crop up in unlikely places. Our debt now to \nChina is in the hundreds of billions of dollars and growing. We owe a \nfair amount of money to folks in South Korea. A lot of debt is held by \nthe Japanese. You kind of wonder sometimes when you consider our \ninability to push back hard on the Chinese for currency manipulation \nand other issues such as the quality of the products, their lack of \nrespect for patent rights and intellectual property rights, it is hard \nfor us to push back when these people are holding hundreds of billions \nof dollars of our paper, money we owe them, because they have helped to \nfund programs for which we have not had the moral courage or fiscal \ndiscipline to raise the money to pay for ourselves.\n  We have a choice. The President is faced with a choice. He is asked \non the one hand to increase the debt by almost $200 billion to support \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to pay for it, to basically \nput that burden on our kids and say, someday you will have the \nopportunity to pay this debt, and to compare that with the SCHIP \nprogram which is not cheap, but over the next 5 years, $35 billion, $7 \nbillion a year to provide health care coverage for 4 million children \nwho otherwise would not have it. But the difference is, it is paid for. \nWe actually raise the money to pay for this program.\n  I said to a group of people yesterday, among the words that are most \nused around here, ``reform'' is one of them. We hear a lot about reform \nin almost everything about which we talk. Another thing we talk about \naround here is bipartisan--bipartisan this or bipartisan that. This is \na place where sometimes bipartisan, a lot of times--the underlying \nappropriations bill on the floor today is actually a bipartisan bill, \nbut we don't always see that.\n  SCHIP, the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program, is \nabout as bipartisan an effort as we can mount around here, especially \nwhen the administration has been fighting us tooth and nail. Again, to \nour Republican colleagues who stood up and joined a number of our \nDemocrats, including Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nI say: Good for you. Not just good for you because it is an example, a \ntangible example of bipartisan cooperation, but good for you because \nyou put the concerns of our children ahead of those other issues and \nyou are willing to pay for something we want to have.\n  Mr. President, in Delaware, we believe that programs worth having, \nfor Government to pay for them, whether it is transportation, \neducation, health care, programs worth having we ought to pay for. If \nwe are not willing to pay for them, we shouldn't have as much of them \nas we otherwise would have. We have taken this principle and embodied \nthis proposal under SCHIP.\n  I am proud of the stand we have taken and the House has taken. I am \nvery disappointed in the decision the President has reached.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have all seen recent news reports about \nsecurity contractors in Iraq, specifically stories about Blackwater, a \nprivate company, which is under contract with the Department of Defense \nand the Department of State, perhaps other agencies, to provide \nsecurity guards for American personnel and others who are in combat \nzones. There have been a lot of questions raised about questionable \nconduct and lack of oversight and a lot of questions about \naccountability. We need answers.\n  Last week, Secretary Gates of the Department of Defense, a man whom I \nrespect, testified before the Appropriations Committee about the needs \nof the Department of Defense. I asked him a\n\n[[Page S12497]]\n\nseries of basic questions about these security contractors: How many \ncontractor personnel are on the ground? Who is there? How long have \nthey been there? What oversight is in place? Who is in charge? I wanted \nto know who has oversight of these contractors and how the people are \nauthorized to use deadly force, how they are held accountable for their \nactions. The Secretary's response was he didn't know.\n  The amendment I filed and hope to offer sets aside funding for the \ninspector general of the Department of Defense to find some answers. \nThe amendment asks for a report that documents how much we are spending \non private security contractors and how many people work for them.\n  The report also details the Department of Defense oversight role and \nthe scope of authority of military commanders over private security \ncontractors.\n  Finally, we need to know the basics. What laws govern the conduct of \nthese contractors? What rules of engagement govern their activities? \nHow is it possible we are in the fifth year of this war and still don't \nhave these questions answered? Six years into the war in Afghanistan, \nand we still don't know for certain what the standards are.\n  The incident a few weeks ago in which Blackwater employees were \ninvolved in the deaths of eight Iraqi civilians raised a lot of \nquestions. In response, let me recount what we have learned.\n  Since 2005, according to Government investigations, Blackwater has \nbeen involved in at least 195 ``escalation of force'' incidents; that \nis, situations in which Blackwater employees fired shots. That is an \naverage of 1.4 shooting incidents per week.\n  In over 80 percent of these incidents since 2005, Blackwater's own \nreports document either casualties or property damage.\n  We have learned in one case the Iraqi casualty was shot in the head. \nIn another, a Blackwater employee tried to cover up a shooting that \nkilled an innocent bystander.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing incident that has come to light is the \npoint-blank shooting of a security guard by a Blackwater employee in an \noff-duty confrontation. The Blackwater employee is reported to have \nbeen intoxicated and was fumbling with his weapon after the shooting.\n  Here is how the New York Times described the company's response:\n\n       The acting ambassador at the United States Embassy in \n     Baghdad suggested that Blackwater apologize for the shooting \n     and pay the dead Iraqi man's family $250,000, lest the Iraqi \n     government bar Blackwater from working there, the report \n     said. Blackwater eventually paid the family $15,000, \n     according to the report, after an embassy diplomatic \n     security official complained that the ``crazy sums'' \n     proposed by the ambassador could encourage Iraqis to try \n     to ``get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their \n     family's future.''\n\n  So who has oversight of these security contractors? Whom do they \nanswer to in Iraq and Afghanistan? What is their relationship to the \nmilitary?\n  The old Coalition Provisional Authority under Mr. Bremer, who \nreceived a Gold Medal from President Bush, exempted security \ncontractors from Iraqi law, and whether they are liable under U.S. law \nis murky at best.\n  If Blackwater employees are accountable under U.S. law, why hasn't \nthere been one investigation or prosecution? Not a single Blackwater \nemployee has been prosecuted. In fact, in the case of the drunken \nemployee who killed the bodyguard of the Vice President, he was quickly \nspirited out of the country, apparently with our Government's blessing, \nto protect him from the Iraqis.\n  Stories such as these do not make the United States look good in the \neyes of the Iraqis, in the eyes of the world, and, frankly, in the eyes \nof most fairminded American citizens. The number of shootings, the \namount of Iraqis killed and wounded, the amount of property damage \ndone--all of it suggests there needs to be a legitimate investigation.\n  I am not going to castigate every private security contractor in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. I have met some of them. Many of them are brave, \ndedicated, professional individuals who risk their lives to protect \nthose whom they are charged to protect. Many are honest and dedicated. \nBut the purpose of the amendment is to demand accountability. Private \nsecurity contractors have to play by the rules--somebody's rules. If \nthey don't, we as a government have to act.\n  These private security contractors are part of America's face in \nIraq. This is a struggle to win the hearts and minds of those people \nand to create a peaceful society. Every time there is a reckless or \nillegitimate shooting of an Iraqi civilian, we take one step back from \nachieving that important goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Senator very much. I would like to take \nadvantage of that offer. President Talabani is in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee at the moment. It would accommodate nicely my schedule.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3142\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Biden amendment on \nMRAPs be called back up. It was the pending business until it was laid \naside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside. The amendment now pending is the Biden \namendment No. 3142.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my good friends, Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens, there are no two more seasoned or devoted Senators \nto protecting the military and our fighting men and women. I know my \namendment with regard to so-called MRAPs, mine-resistant vehicles, is \nan inconvenience, and I am not being facetious when I say that. I know \nthat my friend--and I don't have a closer friend in the Senate than \nSenator Inouye--supports the essence of what I am proposing, but there \nhas been an attempt, understandably, to have all amendments that could \nbe related in any way to Iraq placed on the supplemental. This \namendment will be placed on the supplemental. But the truth is, we are \nnot likely to get to the supplemental until January.\n  I know one of the Democratic leaders, Senator Durbin, is in the \nChamber. He may know better than I if that is accurate, but that is my \nunderstanding. In this place, you have to have, as they say, a horse to \nride. You have to have a vehicle to be able to attach something \nimportant that you support so that it will get some consideration.\n  The amendment I am proposing today is one that calls for a \nsignificant increase in the production of mine-resistant vehicles. I \nknow I sound like a broken record to many of my colleagues since I \nstarted raising it last spring. This amendment is very simple, and it \nis costly. It provides the $23.6 billion needed to replace every Army \nup-armored HMMWV vehicle in Iraq with a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \nvehicle, so-called MRAPs.\n  It is exactly the same thing we did on the authorization bill that \npassed Monday night. Our commanders in the field told us as recently as \n2 weeks ago--I met with some of those commanders, Marine commanders in \nRamadi, and took a ride in a new mine-resistant vehicle. I also sat in \nan up-armored HMMWVs--so the Marines, from the two-star general to the \nsergeant who drove various vehicles, could make a point to me about how \ndifferent they are.\n  They showed me a photograph of a roadside bomb having struck one of \nthe new vehicles--that is a Cougar, which is one size of the up-armored \nmine-resistant vehicles and it showed where on, I believe, August 28, \nin that same city, a roadside bomb had exploded, 250 pounds of \nexplosives. And it literally blew this vehicle, which is many times the \nweight of the largest SUV any American drives in this country--I don't \nknow the exact weight, but it is close to 38,000 pounds fully loaded--\nit blew it so high up in the air that it literally brought down the \ntelephone wires. The wheels got caught in the telephone wires. A \nstandard telephone pole, I don't know, are they 20, 25 feet, maybe \nmore, maybe less? It blew the vehicle so high into the air it literally \nbrought down the telephone wires. And when it hit, the vehicle, \nprobably in an area the circumference of this Chamber, the pieces were \nspread all around the landscape. The engine would have been over by the \nRepublican cloakroom, the drivetrain would have been over by the exit \ndoor on the Democratic side back toward the marble room, the axle would \nbe sitting up by the Democratic cloakroom, and right in the middle of \nthe Senate floor would be the cabin of the vehicle.\n\n  There were seven soldiers in that vehicle. Had that been an up-\narmored HMMWV, everyone would be dead. Not one of those soldiers died. \nNot one. They suffered severe concussions, four of them, but that was \nthe worst of their injuries. And one of those young sergeants, as the \nbrass went through showing me this and I got into vehicles and we drove \nand so on and so forth--we are now inside Ramadi--as I am getting out \nand leaving, one of those young soldiers was exuberant. First, he \nsaluted me and said: Sir, as Senator Reed, a West Point graduate, is \naccustomed to having been done to him in the old days and even now--and \nthen he became emotional in his thanks for that vehicle, thanking us \nfor insisting on building them. It is truly a lifesaving vehicle.\n  Now, our commanders in the field tell us these Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtective vehicles are going to reduce casualties by 67 to 80 percent. \nThat is the range, 67 to 80 percent. Put it another way, had they been \nriding around in these vehicles since we knew they were needed, we \nwould have over a thousand fewer dead and over 10,000 fewer seriously \nwounded, literally, because over 70 percent of all the deaths and \ncasualties are caused by IEDs, or roadside bombs. When I found out \nabout how good these vehicles are last year in Iraq and then again in \ntestimony the beginning of this calendar year, and then when a \nwhistleblower came to me telling me commanders in the field had asked \nfor these in February of 2005, I was dumbfounded as to why we weren't \nbuilding them. With the great help of everyone on this floor, I think \nthe vote was 97 to 0, we accelerated production by adding $1.5 billion \nto last year's wartime funding bill.\n  The lead commander on the ground in Iraq is Lieutenant General \nOdierno, and he told us 6 months ago that he wanted to replace the \nArmy's approximately 18,000 up-armored HMMWVs with these new Mine \nResistant vehicles. Instead of adjusting the requirement immediately, \nthe Pentagon has taken time to study the issue. They originally agreed \nthe Army should get 380--380--of these vehicles. That was in December \nof 2006. Then, in March of this year, after the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps said it was his highest moral priority to get his folks in \n3,700 of these vehicles, they agreed to increase the number to 2,500 \nfor the Army. In August, they added a few more and agreed to 2,726 for \nthe Army. This month, they agreed that the general needs a little over \nhalf of what he asked for--10,000 of these vehicles.\n  Slowly we are getting there. But we have seen this movie before, Mr. \nPresident, with the body armor, with the up-armored HMMWVs. Until the \nCongress insisted that the better protection be fielded for all of \nthose troops in Iraq, it was not. The catalyst came from here. We \ninsisted. Remember just several years ago how many kids we were sending \ninto battle without the proper body armor and how many National Guard \nunits we were sending over who were not adequately equipped and how \ninitially the military was threatening to discipline young women and \nmen who were taking sheets of metal to put on the vehicles they drove \non convoys ferrying equipment from the gulf all the way up into \nBaghdad? They were putting these sheets of steel on the sides of their \ndoors and the bottom. They were threatened with being disciplined.\n  We have very short memories here. Very short memories. But in the \nmeantime, a lot of people die. Some would have died inevitably, but a \nlot--a lot--would not have. So today we are insisting the Army get all \nof the 18,000 MRAPs the commanders in the field have asked for.\n  Now, to be honest, I can't understand why it is taking so long to \nagree to replace all these vehicles. It makes no sense. We know how \neffective these vehicles are. We surely can't be making an economic \nargument. Surely there is no one here who is going to say we can't \nafford to protect these troops with the technology we know--we know--we \nknow--will protect these troops. Surely no one is going to make that \nargument.\n\n[[Page S12499]]\n\n  Last week, General Pace, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, told the Appropriations Committee that MRAPs have been tested in \nAberdeen with 300 pounds of explosives below them--300 pounds--and they \nsurvive. Are we only supposed to care about the tactical judgement of \nthe commanders in the field when it is cheap? I don't think that is \nwhat the American people think we are doing for our military. Our \nmilitary men and women have a right to expect a lot more from us.\n  I know some say it is not possible to build a total of 23,000 MRAPs \nin 12 to 15 months. Why not? Why not? Imagine President Roosevelt, in \nthe middle of World War II--and this war has lasted longer than World \nWar II--having said: You know, we need to get X number more fighter \naircraft over in theater. We need to have more landing craft for D-Day. \nBut you know what. The present system just won't be able to build them \nall. We just can't do it. Can you imagine that being said? Can you \nfathom that being said?\n\n  I don't get it. I don't get it. Are we saying that we cannot \nmobilize, through the President of the United States and the weight of \nthe United States Congress, the construction of vehicles that we know \nwill save lives; that we know will reduce critical injuries? You are as \ndead in Baghdad as you were on Normandy Beach. You are as dead in \nBaghdad as you were on Normandy Beach. And the pain of the family of \nthat fallen angel is not one bit different than the heroism we \ncelebrate today in the Ken Burns documentary series on the Greatest \nGeneration from World War II. There is no difference. There is no \ndistinction. The pain is as searing. So I ask you all a question: Can \nyou imagine during that war the Congress and the President saying: I \ndon't think we can get this done?\n  Mr. President, this is basically a modified truck. With real \nleadership and a national level commitment, America can certainly make \nthis happen. I believe that the can-do spirit and deep patriotism of \nour business men and women is as profound as it was back in the year \n1942 or 1945. MRAP manufacturers want to make the 23,000 vehicles \nneeded to save the lives of our men and women on the frontline. But we \nhave to do our part.\n  In Congress, the best thing we can do to make sure it happens is to \nfully fund every vehicle needed up front. Contractors and \nsubcontractors can only expand their capacity if we are clear on what \nwe need and what we are prepared to fund. This amendment allows us to \ndo that. It also ensures that any delays in dealing with the overall \nwartime supplemental funding bill do not cause the production lines \nthat are only now getting up to speed to shut down. Said another way, \nwe are finally getting these production lines up and running. There are \nfive companies, some relatively small, that, based on contracts, have \ngone out and hired 200, 500, 1,000 more people. They have expanded \ntheir facilities to build these vehicles alone. But they can only \nexpand to the degree to which they know they have a contract.\n  We funded these MRAPs in the last supplemental and the Continuing \nResolution to the point that we are not going to be able to build any \nmore of them by the time March comes along if we do not have money in \nthis bill. We are not going to be able to build any more. If we wait \nuntil the supplemental to let these contracts, we will have a hiatus of \n2 to 4 to 6 months where they shut down these lines. These are not mom-\nand-pop operations, but they are also not General Motors, Chrysler, \nFord, Toyota, or any other major automobile manufacturer. So this is \nabout how many more months in delay getting these vehicles are we going \nto cause by not putting all of the funding in this appropriations bill. \nMy amendment provides all of the funding needed. That is what my \namendment will do.\n  It also ensures that any delays in dealing with the overall wartime \nsupplemental funding bill will not cause production to shut down. Once \nwe provide the full funding, American business must step up and get the \njob done, the Pentagon must manage the program aggressively and \nattentively, and the President is going to have to make it clear this \nis a national priority. But we have no chance of making all these \nneeded vehicles as quickly as possible if we fund that program bit by \nbit, in fits and starts.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to weigh their options. Do we do our \nbest to save American lives, knowing the only downside is the possible \nneed to reprogram funding at the end of the year; or do we care more \nabout the unknown total wartime funding limit than we care about these \nlives? I know every one of my colleagues would do anything in their \npower to increase the possibility that we reduce casualties. Well, here \nis the way to do it.\n  It seems to me that certain things are a matter of sacred honor and \nexceed anything having to do with budgets. We can argue the national \ninterest is better protected and our physical security is better \nprotected by building X, Y, or Z weapon system, and we can argue \nwhether our failing to build it is going to affect the lives of the \nAmerican people. That is a very fundamentally different issue than \nknowing you have something, that if you physically place an American \nsoldier in that vehicle, you will increase by 60 to 80 percent the \nchance of that man or woman living, and yet not doing it. That is a \ndifferent deal. This is not your ordinary appropriations program. It is \na little bit like the ultimate body armor.\n  Would anybody here, if we knew that by spending X dollars more we \ncould increase the life expectancy of every soldier by providing the \nright body armor in the theater, would we not do it, no matter what it \ncost? Well, this is a form of body armor, a form of body armor that we \nknow, if it is possessed, is going to reduce the cause of over 70 \npercent of the casualties in theater. If these vehicles can reduce \nAmerican casualties by two-thirds or more, I don't know how we can do \nanything else.\n  I agree with the Commandant of the Marine Corps, GEN James Conway, \nwhen he said: ``Anything less is immoral.'' Let me say it again: \n``Anything less is immoral.''\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays on this vote when the appropriate time comes. I ask for \nthem now, so that we know when the amendment is called up we get a \nvote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there is no question that these vehicles, \nthe MRAPs, save lives. The committee is well aware of that, and we \nconcur with that. That is why, Mr. President, to date, Congress has \nprovided nearly $11 billion for the rapid production and fielding of \n8,000 MRAP vehicles.\n  As a result, there are now 435 MRAPs fielded in the theater, and by \nMemorial Day 2008 we will have fielded 8,000 MRAPs.\n  Believe me, we are doing everything possible to ensure the Department \nhas sufficient funds to continue this production of MRAPs. On Monday, \nthis week, in the short-term continuing resolution, we provided another \nadditional $5.2 billion exclusively for MRAPs. Providing a specific \nappropriation in a continuing resolution is extremely unusual and \ndemonstrates the commitment of the Congress, and in particular the \nAppropriations Committee, to ensure that all the funding that is \nnecessary for MRAPs will be provided to the Department of Defense.\n  The vehicles manufactured with these funds will be produced in March \nand April of 2008 and fielded in the theater by Memorial Day 2008.\n  We are aware there is a remaining fiscal year 2008 requirement for \n$11.5 billion for MRAPs, even though the administration has not yet \nrequested any funding. The additional $11.5 billion would fully fund \nthe new increased program requirement of 15,274 vehicles, including \n10,000 MRAPs for the Army.\n  The Department of Defense is seeking this $11.5 billion by November \n15 in order to avoid a break in production. This is very important. We \nanticipate addressing this in the upcoming supplemental. But if it is \nnot completed by November 15, it will be in the next continuing \nresolution.\n  The vehicles produced and procured with these funds would be produced \nby May through September 2008, approximately at a rate of 1,200 \nvehicles a month. This additional $11.5 billion for\n\n[[Page S12500]]\n\nMRAP fully funds the program requirement in fiscal year 2008 and \nsaturates the industrial base through the end of 2008--September 2008. \nAny funding provided in addition to the requirement of $11.5 billion, \nwould be for vehicles that would not be produced--and I repeat--would \nnot be produced until fiscal year 2009, and many vehicles would not be \nfielded in the theater until that spring, summer, and fall of 2009.\n  I believe many of us believe our troop presence in Iraq will be \nsignificantly reduced by then.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I may be able to \nstep away from this if--I think I heard my friend correctly. Did I hear \nhim say that if in fact it is not clear that we are going to be able to \nprevent this gap in the shutdown of the line, that by November the \nSenator is saying the committee would have a continuing resolution that \nincluded the specific money?\n  Mr. INOUYE. That is $11.5 billion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Then, if I understand this correctly, I think my friend \nand the Senator from Alaska are doing exactly what I asked for. My only \nworry is that, A, we make a commitment to the total of 23,000 in the \nsupplemental, a commitment that would get us to 23,000; and, B, we do \nnot have to wait until January. Because if that is the case, these \nsmall operations will have needed a 3- to 6-month lead time, once they \nget a contract, to keep the line going. But what I hear my friend \nsaying is that we would, in November, if it didn't look like the \nsupplemental was going to happen, we in November would fill that gap so \nthere would not be a shutdown in these lines. Is that what my friend is \nsaying?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I will give you my word, sir.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is good enough for me. I am happy to withdraw the \namendment. I have never known the Senator from Hawaii or the Senator \nfrom Alaska, when they gave their word, to do anything--do anything but \nthat. The supplemental we are going to revisit in January, that has the \nadditional money to get us to 23,000. What my friend is saying here is \nthat $11.48 billion would be in any continuing resolution if we did not \nget to that?\n  Mr. INOUYE. That is $11.5 billion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is $11.5 billion.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3142 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I would obviously prefer that it be put here. But I \ntell you, if there has ever been appropriate use of the expression \nsomeone's word is ``as good as gold,'' it is about my friend from \nHawaii. I am happy to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. You are very kind, sir. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3129\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been notified by both sides that my \nAmendment No. 3129, the Troops to Nurse Teachers Program to enhance the \nnurse recruitment goals for the military and civilian side, has been \naccepted, and unless there is some objection, I ask this amendment now \nbe called up and by voice vote accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thought \nwe were going to have a package of these amendments.\n  I will not object, but I do think it should have been in a package. I \nhope we get a package here so we do not do them one by one. I do not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no objection. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Ms. Mikulski, \nproposes an amendment numbered 3129.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make available from Military Personnel $3,000,000 for a \n               pilot program on troops to nurse teachers)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107. (a) Amount for Troops to Nurse Teachers Program \n     From Military Personnel, Army.--Of the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by title I under the heading \n     ``Military Personnel, Army'', up to $1,000,000 may be \n     available for a pilot program on troops to nurse teachers.\n       (b) Amount for Troops to Nurse Teachers Program From \n     Military Personnel, Navy.--Of the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by title I under the heading \n     ``Military Personnel, Navy'', up to $1,000,000 may be \n     available for a pilot program on troops to nurse teachers.\n       (c) Amount for Troops to Nurse Teachers Program From \n     Military Personnel, Air Force.--Of the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by title I under the heading \n     ``Military Personnel, Air Force'', up to $1,000,000 may be \n     available for a pilot program on troops to nurse teachers.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are engaged in one of the longest \nconflicts in American history, and the need for qualified nurses in \nmilitary medical facilities is increasing.\n  Unfortunately, the military faces the same difficulty recruiting and \nretaining nurses that civilian medical facilities are facing.\n  Neither the Army nor the Air Force has met nurse recruitment goals \nsince the 1990s. In 2004, the Navy Nurse Corps fell 32 percent below \nits recruitment target, while the Air Force missed its nurse \nrecruitment target by 30 percent.\n  The Army, Navy and Air Force each have a 10 percent shortage of \nnurses, with shortages reaching nearly 40 percent in some critical \nspecialties.\n  Civilian hospitals face similar challenges. According to the American \nCollege of Healthcare Executives, 72 percent of hospitals experienced a \nnursing shortage in 2004.\n  In 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, HHS, found \nthat this country was 110,000 nurses short of the number necessary to \nadequately provide quality health care for both the civilian and \nmilitary sector. By 2005, the shortage had doubled to 219,000. By 2020, \nwe will be more than 1 million nurses short of what we need for quality \nhealth care--a grave problem for military health care as well as the \nnation at large.\n  One of the major factors contributing to the nursing shortage is the \nshortage of teachers at schools of nursing. According to the American \nAssociation of Colleges of Nursing, last year nursing schools across \nthe nation denied admission to over 40,000 qualified applicants \nprimarily because there were not enough faculty members to teach the \nstudents. Just in Illinois, 2,000 qualified student applicants were \nturned away from schools of nursing because there were not enough \nteachers.\n  The American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than \n400 schools of nursing last year.\n  Mr. President, 71 percent of the schools reported vacancies on their \nfaculty. An additional 15 percent said they were fully staffed, but \nstill needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to \nbe trained.\n  The military recruits nurses from the same source as doctors and \nhospitals: civilian nursing schools. Unless we address the lack of \nfaculty, the shortage of nurses will only worsen.\n  My amendment to the Defense appropriations bill provides $3 million \nto begin a Troops to Nurse Teachers program that will help develop \nnurse faculty to address this national shortage.\n  My proposal is based on a successful Department of Defense program \ncalled ``Troops to Teachers,'' which helps address the shortages of \nmath, science and special education teachers in high-poverty schools, \nand helps military personnel transition to second careers in teaching.\n  Today, Troops to Teachers is operating in 30 States and has supplied \nmore than 8,000 new educators since the program's inception in 1995.\n  The Troops to Nurse Teachers Program seeks to address the nursing \nshortage in the different branches of the military while tapping into \nthe existing knowledge and expertise of military nurses.\n  The goals of the Troops to Nurse Teachers program are twofold. First, \nthe program will increase the number of nurse faculty members so \nnursing schools can expand enrollment and ease the ongoing shortage. \nboth in the civilian and military sectors. Second, the Troops to Nurse \nTeachers program will help military personnel make successful \ntransitions to second careers in teaching, similar to Troops to \nTeachers.\n  The program offers incentives to nurses transitioning from the \nmilitary to become full-time nurse faculty members, while providing the \nmilitary a new recruitment tool and advertising agent.\n\n[[Page S12501]]\n\n  For service members who already hold a master's or Ph.D. in nursing \nor a related field, the military will provide career placement \nass1stance, transitional stipends, and educational training from \naccredited schools of nursing to expedite their transition.\n  Officers who have been involved in nursing during their military \nservice are eligible for scholarships to become nurse educators. In \nexchange, recipients of scholarships agree to teach at a school of \nnursing for 3 years.\n  Active military nurses can complete a 2-year tour of duty at a \ncivilian using school to train the next generation of nurses. In \nexchange, the nurse officer can agree to serve longer in the military \nor the College of Nursing can offer scholarships to nursing students \nwho commit to enlisting in the military.\n  Retired nurse officers can accept appointments as full-time faculty \nat accredited school of nursing, without giving up their full retired \npay.\n  This amendment is supported by 20 nursing organizations, including: \nAmerican Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Organization of \nNurse Executives, American Nurses Association, National League for \nNursing, American College of Nurse Practitioners, and the American \nAssociation of Nurse Anesthetists.\n  The Office of the Secretary of Defense, both Personnel and \nRecruitment and Health Affairs, support the program, as do the Nurse \nCorps of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n  With the aging of the baby boom generation and the long-term needs of \nour growing number of wounded veterans, the military and civilian \nhealth care systems will need qualified nurses more than ever.\n  The Troops to Nurse Teacher program will help to alleviate the \nshortage of nurse faculty and ultimately help make more nurses \navailable for both civilian and military medical facilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3129) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska and Hawaii \nfor their cooperation.\n  I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I talked with the managers. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for 3 minutes as in morning business and then at the \nconclusion of my remarks that my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, be \nrecognized immediately after me so we can pay tribute to a State \nlegislator and friend who passed away in Rhode Island.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, and I do not object, will \nthe Senators tell us some timeframe?\n  Mr. REED. I anticipate it will not be more than 5 minutes for myself \nand Mr. Whitehouse. That will be more than enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reed and Mr. Whitehouse are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3144\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take the floor to speak in opposition to \nan amendment that is now pending, amendment No. 3144, offered by my \ncolleagues, Senator Kyl, Senator Sessions, and Senator Thune.\n  This amendment will add $10 million to be available for a program \ncalled the Space Test Bed. The space test bed is not a particularly \ngreat description of what it does, but that is the description of the \nprogram. I want to describe why I believe it would be a huge mistake \nfor us to approve the amendment.\n  First, let me say it deals with missile defense. There is about $8\\1/\n2\\ billion in the bill, the underlying bill, for missile defense \nprograms, $8\\1/2\\ billion.\n  We are, even now, buying and deploying national missile defense \ninterceptors that have never been tested against realistic targets, \nsuch as targets with decoys and multiple warheads. We will, I think, \ncontinue to see, as we have seen before, dramatic cost overruns and \ntest failures.\n  I recognize the newspaper today, the New York Times, I believe, has a \nstory that says: Missile defense system is up and running.\n  That is because they apparently had a successful test last week. It \nhit a target. But it is not the kind of target that would be expected \nin a real missile attack, were we to have a missile attack. And despite \nthe fact that we are rushing headlong to deploy this missile defense \nsystem to essentially create a catcher's mitt for intercontinental \nballistic warheads, you find a catcher's mitt, except it is not as \nsimple as a catcher's mitt. This is about hitting a bullet with a \nbullet.\n  Now, we have spent a massive amount of money on this, over $100 \nbillion so far. Contrast that with the needs that go unmet here at \nhome.\n  But to go to the amendment that has been offered, on the space test \nbed. It is a program to investigate the utility and the feasibility of \nspace-based missile defense systems to complement the ground-based \nballistic missile defense system.\n  In other words, the program would begin to weaponize space. The idea \nis you can destroy a missile from a system orbiting in space. This \nprogram is designed to develop a space-based kill vehicle and to \ndevelop command, control, and battle management, communications \nstructures for space-based missile defense.\n  I am not talking about ground interceptors, I am talking about space-\nbased missile defense, and about eventually launching a number of \ninterceptors from space to test them against the ballistics missiles.\n  Let me describe what has happened to this proposal. Both the \nauthorizing committee in the House and the Senate have rejected it. \nNeither Appropriations Committee has accepted this proposal to spend \n$10 million. In fact, both Appropriations Committees, as I understand \nit, have explicitly rejected spending this $10 million.\n  There is no authorization for this program. Does anybody here recall \nhaving a debate about an authorization to proceed with a space-based \nmissile program? It has not been authorized.\n  The disappointing thing about this debate--and we have had this \nbefore in the Senate--is this: If you take a threat meter, and look at \nwhat are the greatest threats to our country--and, yes, there is such a \nthing as a threat meter. Our intelligence folks have it. They have it \nover in the Department of Defense. If you evaluate what are the \ngreatest threats to our country--well, let's think of some threats. An \nintercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. Is that a \nthreat? Yes, sure could be. They exist. Russia has a lot, China has \nsome, a few countries have them.\n  But we are told the most likely threat to this country comes from \nrogue nations and terrorist groups. Does anybody think they are going \nto launch an attack against this country with an intercontinental \nballistic missile? Not likely at all.\n  Yes, the threat meter would show that the lowest possible threat to \nour country at this point is an intercontinental ballistic missile \naimed at our country. A much greater threat than the threat of an \nintercontinental ballistic missile at 14,000 miles an hour aimed at an \nAmerican city, a much greater potential threat that almost everyone \nwill admit is a greater threat, is a ship pulling up to the dock of a \nmajor American port at 3 miles an hour--not 14,000 miles an hour, 3 \nmiles an hour--with a container on it that might include a nuclear \nweapon or weapons of mass destruction sent here by a terrorist set to \ndetonate in a major American city.\n  Contrast, if you will, what we spend to defend against that \nproposition, that much greater threat, as opposed to the billions and \nbillions, well over $100 billion we have now spent for one of the least \nlikely threats. I am not suggesting missile defense is irrelevant; it \nis not. We should work on missile defense. But once we put in place a \nstar-spangled, gold-plated ballistic missile defense system, then we \nwill understand that a much greater threat than a ballistic missile is \ngoing to be a cruise missile traveling low to the ground at a lower \nspeed, and then we will decide: Well, I guess this catcher mitt we have \ndeveloped for over $100 billion cannot defend against that, and yet \nthat is a much greater likely threat to our country.\n\n[[Page S12502]]\n\n  My only point is this: We are spending a lot of money on missile \ndefense. It is money that well could be used in other areas to protect \nagainst much greater threats on the threat meter against this country. \nBut as much as we are spending, it is not enough for some. My colleague \ncomes to the floor and says: We need $10 million more, because we need \nto begin this process of weaponizing space, believing, apparently, that \nspace belongs to us exclusively. It does not.\n\n  My hope would be that in a world in which we have thousands, yes, \nthousands of nuclear weapons--the best guess is perhaps 20,000, perhaps \n30,000 theater and strategic nuclear weapons, the loss of one of which \nto a terror organization will be a catastrophe for the world. In a \nworld in which we have thousands of these weapons, it seems to me that \npart of our responsibility as a country is to provide international \nleadership, moving to try to, No. 1, prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons to others, and, No. 2, to reduce the number of nuclear weapons \nthat exist in this world. Only then will we feel that perhaps at some \npoint we will eliminate the capability of someone to detonate another \nnuclear weapon. You know it has been many decades since a nuclear \nweapon has been detonated against humans. We hope it never happens \nagain. We used nuclear weapons in Japan. There were many casualties who \nwere not soldiers. But, it ended the war. There was great debate about \nthat. But we have, as a country, tried in every way possible to make \nsure that nuclear weapons have not been used again.\n  So rather than have an amendment saying, let's spend $10 million to \nsee if we can ramp up some kind of a space-based test module so we can \nweaponize space, would it not be much nicer if we could actually bring \nto the floor of the Senate and debate once again the issue of this \nSenate ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty. Do you realize that \nhas never been ratified by this country? One of our leadership \nresponsibilities, I think, ought to be to ratify that treaty. We tried \nsome years ago. Guess what. It lost because of people who apparently \ndid not think we have the responsibility to lead the world away from \nthe use of nuclear weapons, away from the testing of nuclear weapons, \nto lead in a way that prevents others from achieving nuclear weapons, \nand to begin to reduce the number of nuclear weapons we have in this \ncountry.\n  This issue, this amendment, is not about all of that. It is about one \nadditional piece of the nuclear weapon puzzle and the defense systems \nthat some want to create.\n  All of us want defense against those kinds of things that would \nattack this country or do harm to this country, and that includes \ndefenses against missiles. But, as I said, we have spent over $100 \nbillion. We now have a system that, while we are told it has been \ndeployed, has not ever been tested against a realistic threat. And it \nis a defense against the least likely threat against this country.\n  But to go one step further and decide that what we want to do is \ncreate a space test bed to eventually develop a space kill vehicle, and \nto about $300 million between now and 2013 on the program, makes no \nsense to me at all. It has not been authorized. It has been explicitly \nrejected by the Appropriations Committees for both the House and the \nSenate. In my judgment, it would be a giant step in the wrong \ndirection, sending a signal to the world that this country is going to \nembark unilaterally on something that is, in my judgment, very \ndangerous to our efforts at nonproliferation and stopping the spread of \nnuclear weapons and finally beginning to end that arms race.\n  Those are the reasons I strongly oppose the amendment that has been \nfiled, amendment No. 3144. I hope if there is, in fact, a vote on it, \nthe Senate will express itself similarly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator was correct in noting that \nthis amendment was not authorized in the authorizing committees. \nAccordingly, it was not considered or debated in the Appropriations \nCommittee. Unfortunately, we are not here to fully explain what it all \nentails. However, we have been advised that this proposal may be the \nfirst step toward a program that was rejected many years ago, the so-\ncalled Star Wars program of the late President Reagan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3144\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment I offered a \nlittle bit earlier this afternoon, No. 3144. This amendment has been \nmischaracterized and, unfortunately, is obviously misunderstood. It \nhappens to be in the missile defense part of the budget. I would be \nhappy to have it included in a different part of the budget if it would \nmake it clearer to people that it is not solely a missile defense \nprogram. In fact, in my view, the key value of a space-based test bed \nis not its ability to enhance missile defense but its unique ability to \nprotect our satellites against a very significant threat posed to them \nat this time.\n  My colleague from North Dakota talked about a threatometer--\nhypothetical, perhaps, but a rational way to examine prioritization for \ndefense spending. If there is a relatively low-level threat, we might \nwant to set a lower priority in funding to protect against it than a \nthreat that is of higher possibility. By the same token, if almost \neverything you do in military activity is dependent on one thing and \nthat one thing is vulnerable, you obviously want to protect that one \nthing. That is the priority we are not attaching to the defense of our \nsatellites in space, which are critical, vital, of immeasurable \nimportance, not just to everything our military does but a great deal \nof our economic activity as well. It is the ability to defend our space \nassets from attacks either on the ground or in space that the space-\nbased test bed is significantly designed to do research work on.\n  Let us understand, the space-based test bed is merely a research tool \nto understand concepts that are first developed terrestrially on the \nground and, if proof of concept is suggested as potentially valuable, \nlift it into space to see whether it works there as well, to see \nwhether maybe a defensive system can be devised to protect our \nsatellites in space or to provide protection against intercontinental \nballistic missile attack and, if so, to have a program developed and \ndesigned and then researched and ultimately perhaps produced and \nfinally deployed, all of which is years down the road.\n  All we are talking about is a proof of concepts basic research \nprogram of only $10 million in cost. To have it zeroed out because of \nsome belief that we don't need to spend any more on missile defense \nmisses the point.\n  Let me go back to what I was talking about. I received a briefing 2 \ndays ago, a highly classified briefing that, frankly, scares me to \ndeath. But there is enough we can talk about that is unclassified to \nmake the point. As I said, almost everything we do in military fighting \nthese days in one way or another depends upon our satellites. Our \ntroops communicating with each other, the Air Force dropping a bomb on \na precise location, doing intelligence surveillance, the GPS system \nwhich is installed in virtually everything we do now--all of these \nthings are reliant on satellites. That is not to mention all the \ncommunications and financial transactions and all of the other things \nwe depend upon every day, every communication device--almost every. I \nshouldn't say ``every,'' but most of the communications devices we \nhave, whether they are used in the military or in our private lives, \nthe means of sending signals to do things back and forth, the airplanes \nthat fly through the sky--we could go on and on about our society's \ndependence today on communication from satellites. We have to protect \nthose satellites.\n  There are a lot of ways of attacking them. They are all relatively \ncheap. It is called asymmetrical warfare because a country that may not \nbe able to beat us on the battlefield with tanks and planes and \nsubmarines and so on knows all it has to do is literally pick up the \nsand and throw it in our eyes and then we can't fight, no matter how \nbig and strong we are. That is what they do if they knock out our \nsatellite system.\n  How do you do that? There are a lot of different ways. The Chinese \nrecently demonstrated to us a brute force way. They simply sent a \nmissile up and blew up a satellite. They did that to one of\n\n[[Page S12503]]\n\ntheir old weather satellites. It left a lot of debris in the sky. There \nare laser technologies to lase the satellite, which can be done from \nthe ground but more effectively, if you can, from space because there \nyou don't have the air disruptions to divert the laser beam. You have \ndirected energy. You have radio kinds of jamming or electronic jamming. \nThis can be done either from the Earth or in the sky or, frankly, from \nspace. Doesn't it make sense for us to have the capability to stop the \ndestruction of our satellite system on the first day of a war where we \nrely upon all of that to do what we need to do?\n  Let me take a hypothetical. I don't mean to disparage any particular \nnation by engaging in a little bit of hypothetical war-gaming here, but \nit has been no secret that the Chinese Government would like to see \nTaiwan reunited, in their view--in any event, brought within the \nChinese Government sphere. Both the Chinese military and the American \nmilitary, as well as the Japanese and Taiwanese and others, have \ndeveloped weaponry that would be useful in any kind of conflict that \nmight evolve in that situation. But it is very clear that the Chinese \nhave thought about how to keep the United States out of such a war for \nat least 2 or 3 days, giving them the time they would need to actually \ntake over Taiwan. How do you do that? Well, we won't discuss all the \nways it could be done, but the Chinese have developed certain weapons \nthat would be problematic for the United States to deal with, one of \nwhich is an ability to attack our electronics and our satellites. Right \nnow, we have very little in the way of defense against that. What the \nspace-based test bed concept would do is begin to give us an \nunderstanding of what might be possible for part of that defense.\n\n  That is not the end of it. We still would have to protect against \nsomething like a jammer from the Earth or perhaps a laser from the \nEarth. But to the extent that a missile launched from the Earth against \none of our satellites would pose a threat, space-based test bed \nresearch might be able to find a way to stop that. To the extent that \nit is a Chinese satellite in space, for example, we might be able to \nfind a way to stop it.\n  It seems to me to make no sense to say that on a threat which may not \nbe the most likely threat in the case of everyday happening but which \nwould be absolutely devastatingly destructive if it ever happened--and \nit is not hard to postulate a situation in which it could happen--to \nsay we are not going to spend any money on defending our satellites \nmakes no sense to me.\n  I have heard that one of the reasons some groups are opposed to this \nis their fear that somehow or other we are going to weaponize space. \nLet's deal with that right now. First, an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile against the United States or against one of our satellites is a \nweapon in space. We are not weaponizing space if we try to defend \nagainst that. That is a ludicrous argument. We wait until somebody else \nfires an ICBM against us and then we decide we better defend against \nthat, and if we can somehow get something up into the atmosphere, well, \nthat is a weapon in space, but it is probably a pretty good idea to \nstop their weapon in space. If we send up an interceptor missile, that \nis a weapon in space.\n  Suppose the Chinese decide, instead of destroying one of their \nweather satellites, they are going to destroy some of our satellites \nthat provide the means of communication and the means of directing \nweapons and the means of identifying the battlefield and of surveilling \nit, they are going to destroy some of our satellites by sending up a \nmissile that has already destroyed one of theirs, so it is clearly \ncapable of doing so. Let's say we have found that we can, by using this \ntest bed, provide maneuverability of our satellite so it can move out \nof the way, or we have found that we can actually add to it a defensive \nkind of laser or a defensive kind of jamming device that prevents the \nChinese missile from actually hitting or destroying the satellite. Why \nwouldn't we want to do that even if it has some kind of a little steel \nball in it that--because of the vacuum in space, it doesn't take a lot \nof force to get something moving at a very high rate of speed. You \ncould eject that steel ball and have it intercept a missile that is \ncoming up toward the satellite in order to destroy the missile before \nit can destroy our satellite. What is wrong with thinking about solving \nthe problem?\n  We are not talking about developing anything. We are not talking \nabout deploying anything. In fact, before you even do more research in \nspace, it would have to be confirmed in concept on the ground. Is there \nsuch a fear of defending ourselves that we don't even want to think \nabout how to do it in a situation where it would be critical to an \nattack against us? I don't understand the argument against this.\n  Let me make a couple other points. The deputy commander of STRATCOM \nsaid in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee last year:\n\n       Space capabilities have revolutionized the way we fight \n     today.\n\n  He went on to describe a variety of ways in which this is true. I \nhave talked about some of them. I have noted that in the civil sphere, \nsatellites enable our ATMs, the financial markets, our truck fleet \nmanagement. I just met with the CEO of the largest trucking company in \nthe United States, Swift Trucking. He said they have GPS satellite on \nevery one of their trucks. They can tell exactly where every one of \ntheir trucks is at any given time, and this enables them to manage \ntheir fuel mileage so they are environmentally good. They don't exceed \nthe speed limit. They can get them to the destination by the shortest \nroute. All of this is done by satellite, as are credit card \nvalidations. Our first responders rely significantly on this. The next \ngeneration of air traffic control, I mentioned before. I could go on \nand on.\n  The general's point is that it is not just in military activity but \nour civilian life as well. But he makes the point that with regard to \nthe military, loss of our space capabilities would be devastating to \nour military.\n  I mentioned China, but countries such as Iran and Libya have also \nattacked satellites in recent years, as have other countries. I \nmentioned jamming, direct descent antisatellite weapons, directed \nenergy, laser weapons--all of these have been proven, at least \nconceptually. Over 20 nations now have ballistic missiles, and under \nthe right circumstances, these can destroy satellites. They can also \ncome through the atmosphere carrying a weapon and blow it up over \nAmerican soil or they can create an electromagnetic pulse explosion in \nthe atmosphere which would also explode electronics. Since the year \n2002, there have been an average of 90 foreign ballistic missile \nlaunches per year. Last year, there were 100. This is not a theoretical \nconcept; this is a capability many countries have and have tested.\n  Obviously, if we are trying to defend against a ballistic missile \nthreat, having some capability in space could be very helpful. We would \nhave to have the debate about weaponizing space at a future time, if a \nproof of concept through the space-based test bed were ever developed. \nThat is a fight we could have. I would be happy at that point to engage \nmy colleague, who has talked a little bit about that political issue, \nbut it is very premature to talk about that in the context of what we \nare trying to do here today.\n  I mentioned the Iranians. They have a Shahab-3 missile with a range \nof 1,300 kilometers and another one with a range of 1,900 kilometers. \nAccording to our intelligence community, they could have long-range \ncapability in just a few more years. This could evolve into any of the \nkinds of threats I just mentioned a little bit ago.\n\n  So what this space bed does is explore the survivability, \naffordability, the deployability, and the operability of the different \ntypes of capabilities that could be based in space. As I said, it \nbegins with the terrestrial proof-of-concept stage that would take \nseveral years to complete. It would be years before orbital testing \nwould even be considered, and the Congress will have all of that time \nto debate whether we want to move forward with any of these things. But \nat least we would be doing so with knowledge, with facts, with data, \nand not merely speculation.\n  Some fear that in one way or another the program might morph into \nsomething we do not want it to morph into. We cannot engage in that \ninformed debate today. What this program would do is enable us to \nengage in that informed debate.\n\n[[Page S12504]]\n\n  After one more comment, I will ask unanimous consent to have a letter \nprinted in the Record dated July 6 of this year by GEN Henry Obering \nthat talks about the need for the space test bed and describes at least \nwhat its capabilities would be, at least in the context of missile \ndefense.\n  The last thing I want to do is I want to go back to the Chinese \nbecause they are among the countries that have demonstrated the most \ninterest in taking out our satellites.\n  A Chinese military analyst recently wrote that space is ``the U.S. \nMilitary's `Soft Ribs', A Strategic Weakness'' and that ``for countries \nthat can never win a war with the U.S. by using the method of tanks and \nplanes, attacking the U.S. space system may be an irresistible and most \ntempting choice.''\n  We already cut significant parts of our space program. The space \ntracking and surveillance satellites were cut $55 million under the \nSASC bill and $59 million by the Armed Services Committee bill. There \nis a classified program that exists that was further cut, and the \nDefense Department's Space Radar Program was cut significantly. The \ndefense committee cut $200 million from the TSAT Program, which is a \ncommunications satellite for military communications traffic.\n  But General Obering has said the space test bed ``is a proving ground \nfor concepts and integrated technologies. . . . Exploration of \nalternative implementation architectures is a critical part of the \nSpace Test Bed. . . . Ultimately, policymakers will decide to deploy or \nnot. However, the policy debate would be greatly improved if informed \nby a quantitative understanding of the issues. The Space Test Bed will \nprovide essential decision support.''\n  So that is why we should not zero out this program. A very modest $10 \nmillion investment could help us begin a process of deciding whether \nconcepts are worth pursuing. Given the fact that our satellites are \nalmost absolutely vulnerable to a variety of different kinds of \nattacks, I ask whether my colleagues are willing to vote against a mere \n$10 million to begin the basic research to see whether there are not \nsome ways we might want to eventually pursue to protect those \nsatellites.\n  I hope my colleagues will seriously consider this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                       Missile Defense Agency,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for your June 28, 2007, letter \n     requesting my thoughts on the decision by the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee to zero out funding for the Space Test \n     Bed. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your \n     concerns.\n       Space-based missile defenses--as one tier in an \n     architecture of mutually reinforcing layers--could provide \n     on-demand, near global access to ballistic missile threats, \n     free from the obstacles of geography, strategic warning time, \n     or the politics of international basing. Space-based defenses \n     would apply early pressure on launches from land or sea, \n     depriving adversaries of free rides into midcourse with \n     increasingly advanced countermeasures.\n       The Space Test Bed is not an acquisition program for space-\n     based missile defenses. It is a proving ground for concepts \n     and integrated technologies that might someday enable a \n     space-based layer in the BMDS should the data indicate \n     feasibility (survivable, affordable, deployable, operable) \n     and if future policy decisions permit. Exploration of \n     alternative implementation architectures is a critical part \n     of the Space Test Bed.\n       The Missile Defense Agency can determine technical and \n     operational feasibility in the Space Test Bed. Ultimately, \n     policymakers will decide to deploy or not. However, the \n     policy debate would be greatly improved if informed by a \n     quantitative understanding of the issues. The Space Test Bed \n     will provide essential decision support.\n       Network Centric Operations, combined with in-hand \n     lightweight Kill Vehicle components and high performance \n     liquid propulsion, are at the heart of high speed, low mass, \n     highly maneuverable access to targets in their boost and post \n     boost phases of flight. This reference concept exploits an \n     infrastructure of communications, sensors and fire control \n     utilities that are already in place or under development to \n     support global terrestrial engagement. Space Test Bed efforts \n     will use this concept as the point of departure.\n       The centerpiece of the Space Test Bed is a terrestrial \n     Proof of Concept phase. Proof of Concept does not validate a \n     specific design, but is instead a functional proof of \n     feasibility. In the Space Test Bed, critical operational and \n     technical issues are resolved on the ground to the maximum \n     extent possible. Orbital testing--conducted only after \n     notification to Congress as required--would occur in the \n     years beyond the terrestrial Proof of Concept to resolve the \n     limited subset of space basing issues that would otherwise be \n     irresolvable.\n       Fiscal Year 2008 Space Test Bed funding of $10 million is \n     intended to identify alternative architectural options for a \n     space-based missile defense layer and to set the stage for \n     subsequent experimentation and demonstrations. Fiscal Year \n     2008 activities address the following questions:\n       What are the essential components and interfaces of a \n     space-based missile defense layer and how does the space \n     layer fit into the BMDS? What is the concept of operations \n     and what are the detection-to-intercept functional timelines? \n     What is the payoff to the BMDS of a global, on-demand, early \n     intercept layer?\n       How much would a space-based missile defense layer cost, \n     including lift, ground segment support, and period \n     replenishment of the constellation?\n       How susceptible would a space layer be to countermeasures? \n     In particular, can a space-based layer survive against a \n     determined effort to suppress the defense, to include direct \n     ascent or co-orbital ASATs and nuclear detonations in space?\n       What are the critical technical and operational issues that \n     must be resolved by analysis, experimentation, demonstration, \n     and fundamental engineering data collection in the Space Test \n     Bed? Beyond Fiscal Year 2008, what activities would be most \n     appropriate to the resolution of each issue? What components \n     and subassemblies would have to be procured? What \n     instrumentation would be required? What facilities and range \n     support might be needed?\n       The Space Test Bed is designed to assess the feasibility of \n     a space-based missile defense layer against the day when one \n     might actually be needed. It is not a crash effort designed \n     to produce answers by an arbitrary date and will be purposely \n     designed to support the policy debate with real data and \n     concrete assessments of capability.\n       Please contact Mr. Timothy Coy, Director for Legislative \n     Affairs, if you have any additional questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Henry A. Obering III,\n                               Lieutenant General, USAF, Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to speak in favor of the Kyl \namendment, but I do not want to step in front of the speaking order. I \nwonder what the speaking order might be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think the Senator from North Dakota was \nhere before me.\n  I ask the Senator, does he want to speak?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I did speak prior to Senator Kyl. I would \nlike to speak for about 5 minutes in response, but I will be happy to \nwait.\n  Mr. ALLARD. No. I say to the Senator, go ahead and speak. Then I will \nfollow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, will my friend from North Dakota yield?\n  I am just trying to get some order here in terms of the sequencing. I \nunderstand the Senator from North Dakota wants to go for about 5 \nminutes. I was wondering how long my friend from Colorado might want to \nspeak.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nbe, then, that following Senator Dorgan and his comments and Senator \nAllard and his comments, Senator Menendez be recognized to offer an \namendment, and following that, I be allowed to speak for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just ask \nif folks would be willing to amend that unanimous consent request \nslightly to allow me to offer an amendment following all of that and to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I certainly respect the \nviews of my colleague from Arizona. He and I have had these discussions \nbefore. I do not come to the floor suggesting there are not a wide \nrange of threats against our country. I recognize there must be a \ngeneral who would support this program. You show me any program in the\n\n[[Page S12505]]\n\nPentagon, and I will show you four or five generals who are involved in \nit and whose careers are attached to it in many ways. It is why many \nprograms continue long after they perhaps should.\n  But with respect to this issue of the use of space, my colleague, \nwhen he began his statement, said this: The space test bed program is \nnot solely--``not solely''--for the purpose of developing a space-based \nkill vehicle for missile defense. I respect that. But most people \nunderstand this space-based test bed is, in the longer term, being \ndeveloped for a space-based kill vehicle and for space-based missile \ndefense.\n  Yes, it would have satellite capability and antisatellite capability, \nfor that matter, which will cause some real consternation around the \nworld, in my judgment. But I wonder what would happen if today on the \nfloor of the Senate we were here and we read in the newspaper that the \nChinese or the Russians--either--have just passed legislation embarking \non a project to develop a space test bed which can be used for the \npurposes of ballistic missile defense or, perhaps, antisatellite \noperations? We would have people on the floor of the Senate having an \napoplectic seizure: The Chinese or the Russians are trying to weaponize \nspace. How dare they?\n  Yet we are being told we need to proceed with a program that is not \nauthorized, a program that is not appropriated in either the House or \nthe Senate, because it is just research. The problem is, I have seen \nthis ``just research'' sort of thing go on with all of these programs \nand projects. We know where this ``just research'' is leading to. The \n``just research'' is the desire of some to develop a space-based \nantimissile program. It is not enough to have a ground-based system; \nthey want to put it in space.\n  I am just telling you this: Do you think the rest of the world is \ngoing to sit by and say: OK, that is all right. Just stick a test bed \nup there. Do a little research. Then put a kill vehicle up there. That \nwill be all right. It won't bother us very much.\n  Look, we have thousands of nuclear weapons. We have nuclear delivery \nvehicles all around the world. I am, frankly, at this moment much less \nconcerned about a delivery vehicle that is traveling 14,000 miles an \nhour than I am a rusty Yugo car sitting at a dock in New York City with \na smuggled small-yield nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal in it. \nThat is what I am concerned about.\n  Look at the threat meter against this country--and, yes, there is \nreally a threat meter. People have evaluated: What are the greatest \nthreats and what are the lesser threats? Look at the threat meter and \nevaluate what the greatest threats are against this country. Those are \nthe threats we are spending the least amount of money defending America \nagainst. Yet we spend over $100 billion for ground-based interceptors \nin the national missile defense program as it has morphed into other \nprograms to protect against an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  We are told the great threat against our country comes now from rogue \nnations and from terrorist organizations. Does anybody really think a \nrogue nation or a terrorist group is going to attack us with an ICBM? \nIsn't it more likely, isn't it increasingly likely the threat will come \nin other ways? And isn't it true we are responding to that with much \nless money? We are responding to the lesser threat with more money, the \ngreatest threat with less money. I do not understand that.\n  My colleague indicated that laser technology, for example, is more \neffective against a satellite if it is space-based laser technology.\n  So we put up a test bed, do a little research, put some technology up \nthere with laser capability, and so do the Chinese and so do the \nRussians. Now you have two other systems up there much more effectively \nable to knock down a satellite. Wouldn't it be much smarter for all \nthree of us to decide we are not going to weaponize space, we are not \ngoing to take an arms race to space?\n  That is why I say we have responsibilities in the world as a leader, \nthe preeminent nuclear power in the world. We have responsibilities to \ndecide this has to be an international discussion. I believe our \ngreatest responsibility right now as a country is to lead in the \ndirection of deciding we are going to try to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons, prevent other countries from getting nuclear weapons, \nand try to shut down this potential to move weapons into space. That \nought to be our responsibility. That is what will make this a safer \nworld.\n  So my hope is we will defeat this amendment. I think this is a \nprogram which has justifiably been ignored by the authorizing \ncommittees and the money for which has been deleted by the \nappropriations committees. I appreciate very much the work of the \nappropriations committees to delete the $10 million that has been \nrequested for the space test bed. I think that is the right choice for \nour country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my \ngood friend from Arizona to restore funding to the Missile Defense \nAgency's space test bed program.\n  The committee currently provides no funding to the program in this \nbill. Cutting this program will eliminate the ability to identify \nalternative architectural options for the space-based missile defense \nlayer that sets the stage for any and all subsequent experimentations \nand demonstrations.\n  I do not think this issue is as simple as my colleague from North \nDakota mentioned. I think that no matter what we do, our adversaries \nwill continue to try to figure out ways to disable our space \ncapabilities. If we do not watch it, we are going to find ourselves on \nthe short end. I do not think it speaks well for the future of this \ncountry.\n  Think of the assets we have in space. It is not all related to \nmissile defense. Think of our telecommunications systems, our telephone \nsystems. Think of our systems where we are doing mapping from out in \nspace, for example. The fact is, this country is building more and more \nof its infrastructure on the concept of some sort of interaction with \nassets in space. We need to be prepared to defend those assets.\n  This is not something we can deal with at the last minute. We need to \nbe thinking: Where are our vulnerabilities going to be 15, 20 years \ndown the road? Because you just cannot click your fingers and decide \nyou are going to have all the technology there and the assets you need. \nWe need to prepare today to begin to think about our vulnerabilities \nand prepare for those potential risks we may be faced with in the \nfuture. I do not think we can ignore the fact that China set up a \nmissile and destroyed a satellite in space. What do you think the \nmessage is there? That is happening no matter what we do. We have a lot \nof assets in space, some of it is defense related, some of it is not. \nBut it is this test bed that will help us develop the technology that \nwill allow us to protect those vital assets we have.\n  Essentially, by rejecting this amendment, we would be choosing to cut \nthe legs out from underneath the program of missile defense and \ndelaying the possibilities of reaching future missile defense \nsuperiority. But I think it is more than that. Cutting off funding to \nthe space test bed now is the first step of a new direction for MDA \nthat moves away from exploring the future interceptions in space.\n  Supporting Senator Kyl's amendment to restore the program at $10 \nmillion is not an unending commitment to achieving a space-based \nmissile defense system, but it allows a study of concepts and \nintegrated technologies that will someday, perhaps, enable a greater \nspace-based layer in the ballistic missile defense system. But it is \nmore than just that; it is protecting our other space systems and \ncontinuing to refine and develop those capabilities. Without funding \nour space programs, I think we are limiting our future national \nsecurity options and we are putting our assets in space at risk.\n  On a broader scale, I am concerned that the rejection of this \namendment would serve as a precedent in future years to provide further \ncuts to missile defense programs. Obviously, we are no longer involved \nin the Cold War, which prompted the creation of our missile defense \nprograms, but we now face new threats from enemies who are anxious for \nour demise.\n\n[[Page S12506]]\n\n  As we all know, last July, I will reiterate, North Korea tested an \nintercontinental ballistic missile that they had hoped could reach the \nUnited States. Iran is also testing ICBMs and is projected to have the \nability to reach continental Europe and potentially the United States \nby 2015. Certainly, I do not need to reiterate the comments Iran's \nPresident directed at our Nation and Israel.\n  The Space Test Bed is a study for technology that could protect us in \nthe future, and a space-based system that protects our satellites and \nour space assets, and it enables us to have that protection. Cutting \noff funding for this study and ignoring this future threat is simply \nirresponsible, in my mind.\n  General Obering, regarding last week's missile test, asked the \nquestion:\n\n       Does the system work? The answer is yes to that.\n\n  General Obering also said:\n\n       Is it going to work against more complex threats in the \n     future? We believe it will.\n\n  That is his opinion. I think we have more to be concerned about than \njust missile defense. Obviously, I am a strong proponent of that and \neverybody knows where I come from and how essential I think that is to \nprotecting this country and assuring the security of this country in \nfuture years. But even more important, we have to be working on this \ntechnology to protect our other space assets that we have flying around \nup in the sky that are helping us with telecommunications, helping us \nwith the GPS, which we have become more and more reliant on, and other \ninfrastructure that we have been developing.\n  So I hope the rest of the Senators will join me in supporting the Kyl \namendment. I don't think we can continue to ignore the threat to our \nassets in outer space, and that is why I rise to support the Kyl \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, after discussing this matter with the \nSenator from Arizona, I have had my staff do some research. The \nfollowing may be of interest to the Senate: This bill has fully funded \nthe President's budget request for space-based and space-surveilling \nsatellite systems; for example, in the Air Force research and \ndevelopment alone, in excess of $585 million. We have funded above the \nPresident's request in the Air Force research and development; for \nexample, $15 million for space situational awareness programs, $5 \nmillion for space control test capabilities, and $7 million for the \nRAIDRS program, a total of $27 million.\n  I cite this so we will not get the impression that we are not funding \nanything for space and satellite defense, et cetera.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3198\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3198.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself and \n     Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered 3198.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3198\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the expenditure of funds appropriated under \nsubsection (b) of the Border Security First Act of 2007 to address any \n   border security issue, including security at the northern border)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     amounts appropriated under subsection (b) of the Border \n     Security First Act of 2007 may be used to address northern \n     border fencing as well, wherever the greatest security needs \n     are.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I offer this amendment with my \ncolleague, Senator Salazar from Colorado, because we both feel \npassionately about the security of our country.\n  Earlier this afternoon the Senate voted on an amendment to provide \nfunding to create greater security along the border between the United \nStates and Mexico. I voted for that amendment because I recognize we \ncertainly have to do more to protect our borders and, more importantly, \nbecause it had monies for employer verification efforts as well. At the \nsame time, I recognize it is simply not enough. It was not enough \nbecause it made no mention--no mention--of our northern border or the \nsignificant security threat that it presents. That is why Senator \nSalazar and I are offering this amendment--to ensure that the northern \nborder receives the same care and attention as does the southern \nborder.\n  Last week, the Government Accountability Office released a report \ndetailing the serious vulnerabilities of the northern border between \nCanada and the United States. Shortly thereafter, I came before this \nbody to talk about those vulnerabilities, and I had hoped to raise \nawareness about this largely ignored problem. What I may not have \naccomplished last week I hope to accomplish today by offering this \namendment.\n  With all due respect, I question this body's almost single-minded \nfocus on the southern border. Personally, I am sick and tired of voting \non amendment after amendment to build a fence between us and Mexico, \namendment after amendment sending more Border Patrol agents to the \nsouth, amendment after amendment focusing on the gaps in our southern \nborder, without--without--the same attention and the same concern \ndirected toward our northern border.\n  Last week, the Government Accountability Office reported that given \nthe current state of the northern border, almost anyone could enter our \ncountry undetected carrying radioactive material or any other illegal \nand dangerous substance. Almost anyone could bring chemical or \nbiological weapons into our country across the northern border. That is \nsimply unacceptable. But what is more unacceptable and what is more \nshocking to me is that this body continues to ignore these findings and \ninstead focuses, as it did today, almost unilaterally on building a \nfence to separate us from our southern neighbors.\n  Now, what did the previous amendment have to say about the northern \nborder with Canada? What did it have to say about the current gaps that \ncould allow a terrorist to waltz right in and detonate chemical or \nbiological weapons? Absolutely nothing. That is why we are here today. \nWe are here today to make sure we take care of our northern border, and \nthat we make it just as safe and as secure as our border to the south. \nWe either protect the Nation as a whole or we have not protected the \nNation at all.\n  The problems of the northern border, by the way, are not new. In \nfact, the \n9/11 Commission noted that in 1999, there was one single agent on the \nnorthern border for every 13.25 miles. They compared this to the \nsouthern border which had one agent every quarter of a mile. So in one \ncase, we have an agent for every 13.25 miles, and in the other case we \nhave an agent for every quarter of a mile. Sadly, however, not much has \nimproved since the 9/11 Commission pointed that out. In fact, currently \nonly 965 agents out of a total of 13,488 agents are stationed in the \nnorth--only 7 percent. Such numbers are ludicrous when we consider that \nour northern border spans over 5,525 miles and is almost three times as \nlarge as the 1,993-mile southern border, 3 to 1 odds. That is exactly \nwhy the 9/11 Commission specifically recommended that the border \nbetween Canada and the United States be strengthened and that \nimmigration controls be tightened.\n  Now, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you put \n13,000, or a little less than 13,000, border agents in one part of the \ncountry and you put 965 in another part of the country, and I want to \ndo damage to the country, where am I going to come through? Where I \nhave to face almost 13,000 agents in a third of the space or where I \nhave to face 965 agents in three times the space? Of course, those \nagents work on a rotational system, so it is not that they are all out \nthere at the same time. So it is a third of those\n\n[[Page S12507]]\n\npeople who are out there at any given time. It doesn't take a rocket \nscientist to figure how you do harm.\n  Even before the 9/11 Commission issued its report, the Office of the \nInspector General found serious problems with the security of the \nnorthern border. In 2000, the Office of the Inspector General found \nthat Border Patrol agents in northern border sectors experienced more--\nmore--organized criminal activity than agents in the southwest--more \norganized criminal activity than agents in the southwest. It found that \nillegal activity in the north was facilitated by the open nature of the \nborder, the unpatrolled waterways, and the vast stretches of wilderness \nwith little enforcement present. It noted that a severe lack of \nresources prevented the Border Patrol from truly knowing even the \nextent of the problem.\n  Sound familiar? It should, because nothing has really changed. Last \nweek, MSNBC had video clips of people crossing the northern border of \nCanada with bags in their hands, with impunity, totally unobstructed, \nunprotected.\n  Make no mistake about it. Northern border security is a serious \nproblem. It has been a serious problem in the past, and it continues to \nbe a serious problem. Just over the last several years, nearly 69,000 \nindividuals have been apprehended crossing over the northern border. \nThat doesn't include the thousands and thousands who cross without \napprehension.\n  Let me remind my colleagues about the millennium bomber. In 1999, the \nmillennium bomber, Ahmed Ressam, crossed the northern border with \nCanada intending to kill as many American citizens in cold blood as \npossible. While we eventually stopped Ahmed Ressam from carrying out \nhis plans, we have not addressed the problem that allowed him to enter \nthe United States in the first place.\n  We simply cannot afford to ignore the problem of our northern border. \nAnd we will not, if we pass our amendment; we will be able to address \nthat serious concern. Our amendment ensures that the $3 billion \nappropriated under Senator Graham's amendment is also available for use \non the northern border, wherever the greatest security needs are.\n  So we urge our colleagues to support this amendment. Trying to secure \nour Nation by focusing on only one of two borders is a recipe for \ndisaster. We either protect the entire country, or we end up protecting \nnone of it. This amendment guarantees we protect the entire country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \namendment No. 3198 offered by my good friend and colleague, Senator \nMenendez and myself. It is a very simple amendment that addresses one \nof the largest national security issues of our time. It is an amendment \nwhich in its simplicity says a lot, but it is, nonetheless, short. It \nsays that amounts appropriated under this section of the bill, for the \nBorder Security First Act of 2007, may be used to address northern \nborder fencing as well, wherever the greatest security needs are.\n  Let me say that again. It says: May be used to address northern \nborder fencing as well, wherever the greatest security needs are. It is \na simple amendment and one which I hope colleagues on both sides of the \naisle join in and support its inclusion in this Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  I want to step back just for one second and refresh our recollections \non debates we have had on the issue of the overhaul of our immigration \nlaws in our country. I think there was broad agreement that we needed \nto do three things in that particular overhaul. We needed, first of \nall, to secure the borders of America, to secure the borders of this \ncountry. Secondly, we needed to move forward and be serious about being \na Nation of laws and making sure we were enforcing our laws in America, \nthat we honor the rule of law in this country. Thirdly, we needed to \ndeal with the realistic solution to the economic and moral issues which \nare a part of the issue of immigration which still so affects our \ncountry.\n  We were not able to get that done, so the reality of it is that today \nwe have a system which is still in chaos, a system which is in \ndisorder, and we continue to have our national security compromised. We \nhave broken borders in this country which must be fixed. So the \namendment offered earlier today, which I proudly supported, offered by \nmy friend, Senator Graham, was an important amendment because what it \ndoes is it invests in one of the issues that we need to address with \nrespect to immigration, and that is border security.\n  It is border security. I supported that amendment in the same way we \nsupported that concept as we moved forward in our debate over \nimmigration reform. What is unfair, frankly, about what we are doing \ntoday is focusing only on one border--only on the southern border. \nThere is a great disparity in terms of the kinds of resources we are \nputting into the protection of the southern border and almost nothing \nin the northern border. That disparity makes no sense whatsoever when \none considers the challenge we face from a national security point of \nview.\n  When one considers the fact that the border between Canada and the \nUnited States is almost 12,000 miles long--11,986 miles--and there are \nonly 972 Border Patrol agents, and when you consider that number in \ncomparison to what we now have on the border with Mexico, where we have \na 1,900-mile border, with almost 12,000 Border Patrol officers, and we \nhave a border that is much longer in the North, for every Border Patrol \nofficer we have in the North, we have 12 in the South to guard a much \nsmaller border.\n  So the question for us has to be: Are we deploying our resources to \nwhere the greatest vulnerabilities are? The GAO, at the request of \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus, reported to the Finance Committee \nin the last several weeks about the vulnerabilities they found on the \nnorthern border. They have found, through the investigators at the GAO, \nthat there were people who could come across from Canada into the \nUnited States without ever being stopped, with radioactive materials \nbeing a part of what could be placed in those duffle bags the agents \nwere carrying across the border. They were able to come across time and \ntime again without anybody ever catching them.\n  One of the questions I asked the Border Patrol agent was: What is it \nthat the Border Patrol office does in terms of using its resources? He \nsaid: We put them where the greatest vulnerabilities are. I would say \nwhen we look at the issue of national security, we ought to be putting \nthe resources where the greatest vulnerabilities are. There are \nresources, yes, we ought to be putting on the southern border, and we \nhave done that. But we cannot ignore the reality of the northern \nborder--the reality that there are 12,000 miles, most of which is now \nunguarded, where people can come across the border into the United \nStates with impunity and bring with them weapons that would do harm to \nAmericans on American soil.\n  So this amendment goes a long way toward addressing that issue by \nsaying that the money allocated here for border security should, in \nfact, be used where those greatest vulnerabilities are.\n  I will end by simply stating that even in the days after 9/11, when \npeople were looking at the issue of terrorism in the United States, it \nwas the Canadian intelligence service that made the finding that there \nwere international terrorist organizations active in Canada; in making \nthat finding, they were recognizing that one of the things they needed \nto do for national security was to be much more vigilant with respect \nto terrorism in Canada. We know that since that time, we have been \ninfiltrated in this country by a terrorist who attempted to come across \nthe border, Ahmed Rasam, an Algerian terrorist, who came into the \nUnited States, going into Washington, with approximately 100 pounds of \nexplosives in his trunk. With 100 pounds of explosives in his trunk, he \nwas headed to Los Angeles International Airport. That came from the \nnorthern border.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Menendez amendment No. 3198 in \nthe interest of making sure we are securing our borders and that we are \nmoving forward with national security that makes sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n\n[[Page S12508]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3141\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3141.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for Mr. Sessions, \n     for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n     Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3141.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To enhance United States sea-based missile defense \n                             capabilities)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.  Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide'', up to \n     $75,000,000 may be available for Program Element 063892C for \n     the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, of which--\n       (1) $20,000,000 may be for an increase in the production \n     rate of the SM-3 interceptor to four interceptors per month;\n       (2) $45,000,000 may be for long-lead production of an \n     additional 15 SM-3 interceptors; and\n       (3) $10,000,000 may be for an acceleration in the \n     development of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Signal \n     Processor and Open Architecture software for the Aegis \n     Ballistic Missile Defense system.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBayh and Lincoln be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I present this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Sessions, the lead author, as well as many coauthors, including \nmyself, from both sides of the aisle. Senator Nelson of Florida will \nspeak, and Senator Kyl, and Senators Lieberman, Inhofe, Pryor, \nLautenberg, Bayh, and Lincoln.\n  Clearly, this is a very bipartisan initiative and, I believe, a very \nimportant one. This amendment would make available an additional $75 \nmillion for the Aegis ballistic missile defense system. That is a very \nimportant sea-based component of what will hopefully be a multilayered \napproach to missile defense--to defend our country, as well as our \ninterests and allies around the world.\n  That money would come from an existing larger pot of funds already in \nthe legislation, already available, for missile defense more generally. \nSpecifically, $20 million of that money could be used to increase the \nproduction rate of the SM-3 interceptor; $45 million could be used for \nlong-lead production of an additional 15 SM-3 missiles; and $10 million \ncan be used to accelerate the development of the Aegis BMD Signal \nProcessor and Open Architecture software for the Aegis BMD system. They \nare all very important components to the overall Aegis system and \nmoving forward with this sea-based component of our missile defense.\n  This amount that would be made available under the amendment is \nprecisely tied to the amount and the activity authorized in our \nNational Defense Authorization Act--the chairman's mark of that--which \npassed the Senate on Monday. Similar increases for this proven \ncapability were also included in the House Defense authorization and \nappropriations bill--a clear indication that this is a broad, \nbipartisan priority, a very important priority in terms of our overall \nmissile defense network.\n  The additional funding that could be made available by this amendment \nwould increase the production rate of the SM-3 missile interceptor, \nwhich is carried aboard Aegis destroyers and cruisers. There are about \ntwo dozen of these missiles in the inventory today, and this number is \nexpected to rise to 132 by the end of 2013, which is not nearly enough \nto keep pace with the threat. That threat is very real and it is \ngrowing. That has been identified and documented by our military \nleaders.\n  In fact, they said there is a need to nearly double the number of \nplanned interceptors. To be sure, North Korea alone deploys 600 short-\nrange ballistic missiles and 200 medium-range ballistic missiles that \ncan reach U.S. forces in Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, and Guam. \nSimilarly, Iran deploys scores of short- and medium-range ballistic \nmissiles and, of course, both entities are developing longer range \nsystems that could target Europe or even the United States.\n  I believe this is very important. We need a multilayered approach to \nmissile defense. We need to accelerate the development of that, and \nthis Aegis system, which is sea-based, is a very important part of \nthat. It is important to do it; it is important to send the message \nloud and clear to our allies and enemies around the world that we are \ndoing it.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Sessions for his leadership and also \nSenator Nelson of Florida, who will speak very soon, and all the other \nbipartisan cosponsors of this important amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent, first--because he approached me first--for \nSenator Kyl to have up to 5 minutes to respond to other debate on the \nSenate floor and then, immediately after that, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida to speak for an appropriate time on this Sessions-Nelson \namendment No. 3141.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3144\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to respond to four quick points made \nin reference to my amendment, which is amendment No. 3144. First, the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Hawaii, said we have funded \nmany space programs, and he mentioned the Space Tracking and \nSurveillance System and Space Situational Awareness Programs. That is \ntrue, except that they cut $55 million out of the STSS Program. The key \npoint is that those are situational awareness and tracking programs, \nnot defensive programs. There is zero in here for the defense space \ntest research program. That is what I am talking about--not situational \nawareness and tracking but an actual Defense research program.\n  Secondly, the Senator from North Dakota first responded to my \nargument and the fact that I had quoted General Obering's support by \nsaying he is not surprised that the Kyl amendment is supported by a \ngeneral, that they usually are because their careers depend upon \nprograms. Frankly, I am astounded by this ad hominem attack. Let's \nattack the substance of the program, not the general who supports it. \nWe cannot trust our generals? Is that what is being said? We ask them \nto devise ways of protecting us from attack, and that is the thanks \nthey get.\n  Let's turn to the substance of the argument. Two primary points were \nmade by the Senator from North Dakota. First of all, because the space-\nbased test bed program could evolve into a space-based missile defense, \nregardless of its other benefits for satellite protection, we should \nnot fund the program. Well, my first reaction is, God forbid that we \nwould develop a program to defend us from intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles. We would not want to do that. Of course, the point is there \nare years of decisionmaking between the time that a space-based test \nbed program evolves into concepts and potential programs and the \nresearch evolves into specific proposals and the time that the Senate \nwould ever vote on them.\n  Does the Senator have such a lack of confidence in his ability to \nstop such a horrible thing--space-based defenses--that he is not even \nwilling to allow a program to be funded to develop conceptual programs \nto defend our satellites in space, which presumably we all favor?\n  Finally, the last argument was, well, the nations of the world would \nbe better to get together and have an agreement not to develop weapons \nin space. There are two answers to that. First of all, what is a \nChinese missile flying through space to hit a satellite called? That is \nwhat they did. As the Senator from Florida and I discussed the other \nday, that they left a lot of space debris is a problem in the wake of \nthat attack. What is a missile flying through space to hit another \ncountry's satellite called? Is that a weapon in space? Are we so afraid \nof defending our satellite assets that we don't want to defend against \na satellite killer missile from a country coming up from the ground \ninto space that hits our satellite? Would we not want to defend it from \nspace?\n  That is a ludicrous argument. I don't believe we are going to get the \ncountries of the world together to join in a treaty to have them forget \nprograms\n\n[[Page S12509]]\n\nthat they have already been developing--the Chinese in this particular \ncase--because they want to have an asymmetric way of destroying our \nsatellites.\n  The bottom line is this: The United States better get serious about \ndefending our eyes and ears in space and now the satellites that direct \nso much of our military activity. Other countries have the ability to \nturn off the light. They know where the switch is. In times of war, we \ncannot be blind and deaf and be denied our space assets. And yet \nvirtually by turning off the switch, other countries have that \ncapability. Isn't it about time we begin the first steps of developing \na capability against that?\n\n  I note, by the way, that the $10 million program out of a budget for \nmissile defense of over $8 billion is hardly enough to color general \nObering's claims that this would be a good program for us to begin \nresearch on.\n  I hope my colleagues, when this amendment is voted on, will think \nabout the future, will think about the fact that they have plenty of \nopportunities to stop a program should it ever evolve into a space-\nbased missile defense program. If they want to stop that, stop that, \nbut don't use that as an argument to stop research on a satellite \nprotection program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to respond to the \nSenator from Arizona. Yes, the Chinese ASAT test is a threat and is \nparticularly a threat because it could knock out our satellites, and it \nhas left a lot of debris up there that can destroy everybody's \nsatellites if there is a collision.\n  If I could get the attention of the Senator from Arizona, I say to \nhim if what he wants to do is to protect our space assets, there are \nother parts of the defense budget to which it should be addressed \ninstead of the national missile defense part of the budget. There is a \npart that is handled under the strategic command called space \nsituational awareness that would be more appropriate to address the \nissue of protecting our space assets. Most of that is highly classified \nand cannot be discussed here.\n  By the Senator from Arizona wanting to put this amendment into the \npart about national missile defense, it takes us back to the old idea \nof star wars and the starting of weaponization of space.\n  I suggest to the Senator that we can work this out, but it is not \ngoing to be able to be done right here in a few minutes on the floor, \ngiven the classified nature of a number of these programs.\n  I urge the Senator, if his intention truly is the protection of space \nassets, for us to consider those other programs that are now in \ndevelopment and not to take his amendment to a vote, which this Senator \nwould then have to oppose.\n  I yield to the Senator for his response and any questions without \nyielding the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I was going to suggest that, and I \nappreciate the Senator's comments. I am aware of the situational \nawareness programs. The point I was trying to make earlier in response \nto the distinguished chairman of the committee is this is not a \nsituational awareness program. This is a program that could actually \nresult in the development of defenses for our satellites, a lot of \ndifferent potential concepts.\n  The concepts that would protect the satellites from space, of course, \nare different potentially from the concepts that would protect them \nfrom the ground.\n  I am happy to have a different line in the budget, if that is going \nto solve the problem. But what I don't want to do is to have the money \nallocated simply for tracking or surveillance or situational awareness \nas opposed to researching development of potential defenses.\n  I wonder if my colleague will respond.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, by the Senator from Arizona \nwanting to put this as a part of a proposed space test bed, that is \nclearly understood, and that is why all four of the Armed Services and \nAppropriations Committee bills eliminated this $10 million for the \nproposed space test bed because that is the initial step toward \ndeploying space-based interceptors for missile defense. So everybody \nunderstands what that means, the space test bed is intended to deploy \nweapons in space. If that is not the Senator's intention, then we ought \nto look to this space situational awareness which is the question of us \nprotecting assets in space.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator, part of \ndefending a satellite against an attack is being aware the attack is \npending, is about to happen, or is happening. But if all you know is \nthat I am being attacked and you are not capable of defending yourself, \nthe knowledge you are being attacked is of little use. So this is not a \nmatter of surveillance or situational awareness; it is a matter of \ndeveloping defenses.\n  I guess I would put this question to my colleague: As an abstract \nprinciple, would my colleague favor or oppose the concept of a space-\nbased defense of satellites of the United States that have military \nuses, in other words, a defense that would be perhaps based on the \nsatellite itself to jam signals as some weapon homes in or that would \ncreate some kind of effective shield of electromagnetic pulse or other \nkind of electronic defense or even a kinetic kind of defense for the \nsatellite if it is under attack, perhaps some kind of shielding against \na laser attack? In other words, all different kinds of attacks that \nmight come.\n  As a hypothetical matter, would my colleague not agree that it would \nbe very useful and appropriate, even if those defensive capabilities \nare located in space, for us to be able to protect our satellites in \nthat way or would my colleague consider those to be space-based weapons \nthat are impermissible?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I want to be careful in what \nI say because under some highly classified programs, this Senator \nsimply cannot discuss these matters. If the Senator wants to press his \namendment to a vote, this Senator suggests he is not going to have the \nvotes, and if what he is saying is he wants to protect space assets, \nthere are programs that are being developed in this country to do \nexactly that. And that is all this Senator can say.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me say, first, I am aware of what is \nbeing done to protect our assets, and we don't, as has been said before \non the floor of this Chamber, have defenses for our satellites in space \ntoday by an attack by another country. We have to work in this area. \nThe space-based test bed is one of the places in which we could develop \nproof of concept that could be effective both for our satellites and, \nyes, also for an attack by a hostile missile because that is where this \nprogram started, it is in the missile defense budget. But that doesn't \nmean if I drop this amendment, for example, as the Senator is \nsuggesting I do, that, therefore, we can forget about the need to \nprotect our satellites because everything is taken care of. We have a \nneed to develop concepts which include the ability to test, first, \nterrestrially and then in space, proof of concept that would provide \nfor defenses, that would both protect satellites and protect against a \nhostile missile attack.\n  For the life of me, I don't see why my colleague can so confidently \npredict that my amendment will not have the votes to be adopted simply \nbecause on down the road many years from now it is theoretically \npossible that a concept would be developed to protect against a hostile \nmissile attack with some kind of a space-based program.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to say--and all I am \nallowed to say--and let me tell the Senator I don't think he has read \ninto all of the programs--if he would so like to be, then he ought to \npursue this discussion not in this open forum.\n  I will further say the proposed space test bed in a missile defense \nprogram is a missile defense program, not a space asset protection \nprogram that the Senator from Arizona is saying it is. Therein lies the \ndifference.\n  If he is going to insist on pressing his question--somewhere out here \nwe have to have some mutual trust and understanding. I cannot satisfy \nthe Senator by virtue of me being limited in what I can tell him in \nthis open session. So I will leave it up to the Senator as to whether \nhe wants to press his amendment.\n\n[[Page S12510]]\n\n  Madam President, I need to speak on the other amendment, on Senator \nVitter's and my amendment.\n  I yield the floor for the purpose of the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the debate suggests very strongly that \nthere is much uncertainty in this amendment. Therefore, I move to table \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3144 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 3144 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate that very much. As when I \nannounced this bill, I indicated we had two of our most senior Members \nmanaging it, with great experience, and here is an indication of what I \nwas talking about. This is a time when these two men understand this \nbill more than anyone else, because they have managed it for so many \nyears. I appreciate their management on this, and we hope to be drawing \nthis bill to a close.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12510-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       VISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, one of the privileges I have as majority \nleader is the opportunity to welcome, on rare occasion, fellow \nlegislators from various places. Today, we are fortunate to have \nlegislators from the European Parliament who are here as part of a \nregular transatlantic legislative dialog. It is very important. This is \na tradition that started in 1972 and has continued every year since.\n  The current delegation includes members of the Parliament from the \nnewest European Union countries of Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, as well \nas from the founding members of Italy, France, the Netherlands, and \nGermany.

The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Admiral Mike G. Mullen, has made a statement to our American \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and their families. I was privileged \nto get a copy of this, and I think it is the type of letter every \nMember of the Senate should be allowed to read. So I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       To America's Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and your \n     families, I am honored today to begin my term as Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As I do, allow me to thank you for \n     your service at this critical time in our Nation's history.\n       Whether you serve in Baghdad or Bagram, Kabul or Kuwait--\n     whether you find yourself at sea in the Pacific, flying \n     support missions over Europe, on the ground in Africa, or \n     working every day at stateside bases--you are making a \n     difference and so is every person in your family. Your \n     service matters. And I do not take it for granted.\n       The world is a dangerous place. The hundreds of thousands \n     of you who have deployed since September 11th--many of you \n     more than once--already know that. You've stood up to those \n     dangers. You have lost friends to them. You may even have \n     lost some of yourself to them. The dangers of this new and \n     uncertain era have hit you and the people you love squarely \n     in the gut. I will not lose sight of that.\n       Nor should any of us lose sight of the need to continue \n     serving. The enemies we face, from radical jihadists to \n     regional powers with nuclear ambitions, directly and \n     irrefutably threaten our vital national interests. They \n     threaten our very way of life.\n       You stand between these dangers and the American people. \n     You are the sentinels of freedom. You signed up, took an \n     oath, made a promise to defend something larger than \n     yourselves. And then you went out and did it. I am grateful \n     and honored, to be able to serve alongside you.\n       The law says my main job is to advise the President, the \n     Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council on \n     issues of military readiness and capabilities. I will do \n     that. But, I also see myself as your representative to those \n     same leaders, an advocate for what matters to you and your \n     families--your voice in the policies, programs, and processes \n     that affect our National security. I will not forget the \n     impact my decisions have on you.\n       I will remember that you, too, comprise a great generation \n     of patriots, and that among you are combat veterans with \n     battlefield experience that many at my level have never and \n     will never endure. I will tap that experience. I want to make \n     sure we learn from it.\n       I am not interested in planning to fight the last war, but \n     neither am I interested in ignoring the valuable lessons we \n     continue to learn from this one. It would be foolish to \n     dismiss the knowledge you have gained. I will not do that.\n       I know the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are taking a toll \n     on you and your families. They are taking a toll on our \n     equipment, our systems, and our ability to train as well. I \n     worry, quite frankly, that they are taking a toll on our \n     readiness for other threats in other places.\n       But that does not mean our struggles there are not \n     important. They most certainly are important. They are vital.\n       To the degree the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contribute \n     to or detract from a stable,\n\n[[Page S12511]]\n\n     secure Middle East, they bear a direct effect on the security \n     of the United States. That is why my number one priority will \n     be developing a comprehensive strategy to defend our National \n     interests in the region.\n       Next on my list is resetting, reconstituting, and \n     revitalizing our Armed Forces, especially the Army and Marine \n     Corps. I believe our ground forces are the center of gravity \n     for the all-volunteer force and that we need to make sure \n     that force is correctly shaped and sized, trained, and \n     equipped to defend the Nation.\n       Finally, I intend to properly balance global strategic \n     risk. We must stay mindful of our many global security \n     commitments and of the core warfighting capabilities, \n     resources, and partnerships required to conduct operations \n     across the full spectrum of peace and conflict. The demands \n     of current operations, however great, should not dominate our \n     training exercises, education curricula, and readiness \n     programs.\n       The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will one day end. We \n     must be ready for who and what comes after.\n       There is much to do. The speed of war, the pace of change, \n     is too great for any of us to manage it alone. I need your \n     help, your ideas, and your input. Whenever I travel to the \n     field and to the fleet, I expect you to tell me what's on \n     your mind. Tell me what you think. I need your constant \n     feedback. I can't succeed--we can't succeed--without it.\n       You made a promise to defend this country. Let me make one \n     to you: I will listen to you. I will learn from you. And I \n     will endeavor to lead always with your best interest at \n     heart. The way I see it, that is my job now.\n                                                     M. G. Mullen,\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3141\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to pick up on the \nearlier debate on the Sessions-Nelson amendment, No. 3141, that was \noffered by Senator Vitter, and just say I do not think this will be \ncontroversial because it is bringing the appropriations bill in \nconformance with exactly the provision that is in the Defense \nauthorization bill on the Aegis BMD Program with an additional $75 \nmillion. This Aegis system has extraordinary effectiveness and promise, \ngoing after weapons, particularly in the boost phase. It is a sea-based \nsystem.\n  I want to explain what it does and why it is important.\n  In the Senate Armed Services Committee fiscal year 2008 Defense \nauthorization bill that was recently adopted by the Senate, there is an \nauthorization for an additional $75 million for the Aegis BMD program, \nin addition to authorizing the full budget request for the Aegis BMD \nprogram. That increased funding authorization came from our committee \nmarkup of the budget request, which was initiated in the subcommittee \nthat handles missile defense.\n  I have the honor to serve as the chairman of the Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces, and I am pleased to have Senator \nSessions as the ranking member of that subcommittee. For the Armed \nServices Committee markup of the Defense authorization bill, our \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee prepared a proposal for the portion of \nthe defense budget within our jurisdiction, which includes ballistic \nmissile defense.\n  The subcommittee proposal included an additional $75 million for the \nAegis BMD program, which was allocated as follows: $20 million for an \nincrease in the production rate of the interceptor missile for the \nAegis BMD system, known as the Standard Missile-3, or SM-3); $45 \nmillion for long lead of an additional 15 SM-3 interceptors; and $10 \nmillion to accelerate development of computer software for the Aegis \nsystem.\n  This amendment mirrors exactly the additional funding authorized by \nthe Armed Services Committee, and approved by the Senate this last \nMonday. It recognizes that the Aegis BMD system provides an important \ncapability against the existing threats by short- and medium-range \nballistic missiles to our forward deployed forces overseas. It also \nrecognizes that the President's budget request did not provide enough \nfunds for this capability. So we are proposing to add more funding to \nbuild additional near-term and effective capability against existing \nthreats.\n  Last year, when Senator Sessions was the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Strategic Forces, the subcommittee initiated legislation to make it \nU.S. policy that our priority in missile defense should be on effective \nnear-term capabilities. That legislation was later enacted into law and \nis now our national policy. This amendment would take an important step \nto implement that policy.\n  The Aegis BMD system has had an impressive development and testing \nprogram, with a commendable track record of successful and \noperationally realistic testing. I would note that the Navy is a \ncritical component of the success of this system, since it has operated \nthe Aegis weapon system and its standard missile variants for many \nyears on its ships. The Navy has ensured that this missile defense \ncapability works well with its existing systems and procedures, as is \nnecessary to ensure the system would work in real-world combat \noperations.\n  I would note that the Aegis BMD system is planned to improve its \ncapability significantly over the coming years, especially with a \nlarger and faster interceptor we are developing cooperatively with \nJapan. The improved version of the Aegis BMD system is expected to be \nable to defend against intermediate-range missiles and some long-range \nmissiles, as well.\n  This amendment does what I believe the administration should have \ndone. It would place greater emphasis and greater resources into an \neffective, near-term capability to defend our forward deployed forces, \nas well as our allies and friends overseas, against existing and near-\nterm threats.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 3153, As Modified; 3162, 3152, 3127, 3155, As Modified; \n                             3173, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment in question is the Vitter \namendment.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I request the clerk make us a list of \npending amendments, amendments that have been qualified as pending on \nthis bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3130, 3167, 3145, and 3141\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the \nfollowing amendments have been cleared by the leadership of both sides \nand we are ready to consider them en bloc: First, 3130, 3167, 3145, and \n3141. I ask unanimous consent they be considered en bloc and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3130, 3167, 3145, and 3141) were agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3144\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes of comment. I \nknow Senator Kyl withdrew his amendment. But I do want to have the \nRecord corrected, because I was listening to part of the debate when I \nwas back in my office. I think it is important to have an accurate \nRecord.\n  My colleague from Arizona indicated that the space-based test bed \nprogram which I oppose is not a program that would primarily be a \nspace-based missile defense program. He said it is about protecting \nsatellites. That the space test bed is about protecting satellites. \nThat is what my colleague was saying.\n  Let me read the unclassified portion of the Pentagon budget \njustification for the program.\n\n       The space test bed is being explored as a potential \n     solution to enhance ballistic missile defense.\n\n  I guess you can come to the floor and say: Well, that is not what it \nis. But you probably would have to ask the Pentagon to cut out this \npage from its budget justification book.\n  I want the Record to reflect something that is half way accurate. All \nof us understand what that program was intended to be. This is what the \nDefense Department says it was intended to be. So when I come to the \nfloor and talk about why this program ought not proceed, it is not \nauthorized, it has not been funded in either the House or Senate \nappropriations bills and, besides, it is a program that will eventually \nweaponize space by putting ballistic missile defense interceptors in \nspace, I have the facts on my side.\n  Then to have someone say: Well, that is not what it was. Gosh, you \nmust not understand it, Mr. Dorgan. Well, I am sorry; I do understand \nit. So does the Pentagon. They say again:\n\n       The Space Test Bed is being explored as a potential \n     solution to enhance ballistic missile defense capability in \n     the future.\n\n  I went to a small school, but I can understand this. And I read \nfairly fast. There is not a lot of reading on this page. So I wanted \nthe Record to reflect what is accurate about the issue of the space \ntest bed.\n  I think this country has an enormous responsibility with the question \nof nuclear weapons, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, attempting \nto find ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and delivery \nvehicles to protect this country in dozens of different ways against \nthreats that exist against our country.\n  I think it would be a profound mistake for this Congress to decide, \nwithout authorization, with very little debate, to begin funding a \nprogram that eventually will provide weapons in space. We would be \napoplectic if we believed a program existed or was begun today in the \nDuma or in China, because we would believe it would be a threatening \napproach for them to weaponize space. I think they would view the same \nwith activities we would undertake.\n  My hope is we can work with others in the world with respect to \nnonproliferation and with respect to protecting all of us from those \nwho would be aggressive in our future.\n\n[[Page S12514]]\n\n  By the way, my colleague suggested, because I said you can almost \nalways find a general to support a program at the Pentagon--that I \ndenigrated generals. My point was not to denigrate generals. But every \nprogram that exists, and every idea, has sponsors and support. You show \nme a program, I will show you a number of people who are involved in \nthat program, believe in that program, and want that program to move. \nIt is the generals and colonels and captains and lieutenants, and that \nis the way the system works.\n  Now, I promised I was going to compliment the manager and the ranking \nmember. I did it before, but let me do it again. This is a big piece of \nlegislation, hard to put together, and not easy to manage. But they \nhave been on the floor now for some while trying to move this \nlegislation through. Much of it is very important for this country. I \nhope we can move to final passage in an expedited way.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3198\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3198.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I make a point of order that it is legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  While I have the floor, I understand my good friend, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, is concerned. There appears not to be parity between the \nnorthern border and the southern border. I share his concern about some \nof the issues of racism that have been floated into the debate \nregarding our southern border. I think he would admit that there are \ndifferences between the northern border and the southern border. We are \nblessed to have friends on both our northern and southern borders. The \nfailure of the administration to take a truly bipartisan approach to \ncomprehensive immigration reform and the failure of this body to go \nforward and work its way all the way through to a final immigration \nbill reflects some of the problems we have.\n  The way to solve them is not to close the border to a historic \nneighbor on the longest unguarded frontier in the world, one of our \nlargest trading partners. We already have policies of this \nadministration that are about to cost us hundreds of billions of \ndollars in jobs in the United States, which do nothing to enhance our \nsecurity, with the cockamamie idea from the State Department and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security requiring passports to cross between \nCanada and the United States. This will do very little to improve our \nsecurity. Instead of working with Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto find a way where we could have safe, easy transfer between the two \ncountries, keep commerce going, especially after this administration \nhas so badly handled our economy that our dollar has slipped \ndramatically, the administration wants to hastily implement ill-\nconceived barriers to cross-border travel. We seem to want to poke our \nthumb in the eye of a good neighbor.\n  I do not fault the Senator from New Jersey for his amendment. I \nunderstand the reason he does it. As he can well understand, I disagree \nwith the idea of a fence along the Canadian border, just as I voted \nagainst erecting a fence along the southern border last year. I wish we \ncould show some sense in real immigration policy with our southern \nborder. It is a fault in this country to pretend we don't have illegal \nimmigrants looking for a better life and to think that we are going to \nsolve the problem by denying them access to social programs, deny their \nchildren access to our schools, deny them access to assistance with \nfood, deny them access to health care, and to threaten prosecution of \nour churches if they show their respect for the commandments and \nactually want to help the least among us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the views of my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont. I particularly appreciate his \nsupport for comprehensive immigration reform for which he has been a \nchampion. However, I must take the opportunity to note that the \nunderlying amendment Senator Salazar and I were addressing, for which \nno point of order was raised against and which, in essence, was adopted \nby the Senate, goes to the very heart of this issue.\n  As a matter of fact, there was a colloquy between Senator Tester and \nSenator Graham that basically said to some degree that, in fact, the \nresources Senator Graham had in his amendment, adopted by the Senate, \ncould go to the northern border. What Senator Salazar and I want to \nmake clear is that, in fact, either we protect all of the country or we \nprotect none of it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to make sure: The Senator would have been within \nhis rights to have made a point of order against the Graham amendment \nhad he wanted to; is that correct?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Unfortunately, I didn't have notice of it before it was \ncalled up for a vote; otherwise, I would have had the opportunity.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I had heard about an hour before the vote that we were \nhaving it.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would note for the Senator, however, that his concern \nwas in the underlying Graham amendment as well. So here we are, where \nwe as a body consistently pursue one course of action on one part of \nthe U.S. border, and on the other border we actually say it is quite \ndifferent. The reality is, some of us on this issue believe there has \nto be some consistency because, if not, some of us believe either it is \nabout securing the country or it is not. If it is about securing the \ncountry, you can't secure one border and say the other border is free \nfor people to cross undetected, as has been well documented by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, by the 9/11 Commission, and by the \nfact that the millennium bomber came through, and a host of other \nthings. Either we are going to have security, which means north and \nsouth, or we are not going to have security. If it is only about the \nsouthern border, then it is about a lot more than security. It is about \nwho happens to be crossing we don't like. What is the color of their \nskin? What is their ethnicity? Why is that such a threat when the only \nreal terrorist threat we have ever had came through the northern \nborder?\n  This Senator, for one, intends to ensure moving forward that as we \nhave other appropriations bills, I will make it my business to be on \nthe Senate floor to raise points of order because either it is about \nsecuring all of the country or it is about securing none of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the will of the Senate?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3146 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, with the approval of Senator Allard, I ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 3146 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the Allard amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Allard amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President: I want to speak at this point with \nSenators Inouye and Stevens on the amendment offered by Senator Salazar \nand myself designating $5 million--the amount requested by the Pentagon \nand previously approved by the House--for the Missile Defense Space \nExperimentation Center, a facility within the Missile\n\n[[Page S12515]]\n\nDefense Integration and Operations Center on Schriever Air Force Base \nin Colorado Springs, CO. May I ask, are the chairman and ranking member \nof the Defense Subcommittee aware of the potentially valuable work \nproposed for this center?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am as well, and I note that this amendment was \nsubmitted yesterday--coincidentally on the day when it became obvious \nthat our Nation's missile defense system is, according to today's New \nYork Times, ``up and running.''\n  Mr. ALLARD. Exactly. We hear frequent mention on this floor about the \nother, non-Iraq dangers facing this country, and our national missile \ndefense system is designed to deal with some of the most worrisome of \nthose threats--an accidental or rogue nation launch of ballistic \nnuclear weapons against our country. I am sure the chairman and ranking \nmember agree on the value of this system, and that a system as \ntechnologically complex as this one requires constant analysis, \ndemonstration, and integration?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Certainly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I further, then, suggest that the Missile Defense Space \nExperimentation Center fulfills this role, and also supports advanced \ntechnology and algorithm development, and other mission areas such as \nspace situation awareness, technical intelligence, and battle space \ncharacterization.\n  The MDSEC facility buildout began in fiscal year 2006 and continued \nthrough fiscal year 2007 under the STSS program. As the MDSEC supports \nmultiple satellite operations and experiments, the fiscal year 2008 \nrequest of $5 million is contained within the MDA Space Program \nElement. The MDSEC provides the Missile Defense Agency a common support \ninfrastructure and connectivity to the BMDS for the two satellites to \nbe launched in 2008. It will also integrate space data in support of \nthe missile defense mission such as ongoing experiments using Defense \nSupport Program data for missile defense, planned experiments with data \nfrom MDA and other defense and national security systems. MDSEC further \nsupports mission integration of space-based missile track--boost and \nmidcourse phases--sensor and weapons cueing via C2BMC, features and \ndiscrimination, kill and impact point assessments into C2BMC, Aegis, \nterminal high altitude area defense--THAAD--global missile defense--\nGMD--and other non-MDA mission areas to include space situation \nawareness, technical intelligence, and battle space characterization.\n  I believe the mission and task for the MDSEC require our support and \nI urge the distinguished chairman and ranking member of this committee \nto give their full support to this program.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I pledge to my friend from Colorado that when we sit down \nto discuss this matter with the House I will continue to support the \nballistic missile defense system. Let me assure you, as well, that we \nwill carefully examine the merits of the programs at the MDSEC and the \nunique capabilities of the MDIOC when we have our conference \nnegotiations with the House.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank you both.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I call up Senate amendment No. 3166.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3207 to Amendment No. 3166\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration. It is an amendment to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3207 to amendment No. 3166.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3207) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3166), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as \na cosponsor of the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

We would be prepared to enter into an agreement that \nthere be no further amendments.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent that the Sessions amendment be \nthe last one considered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I would ask for a moment before making \nthat final decision to talk to the chairman about an amendment. It is \nthe amendment you have in front of you, but I came down to speak to the \nchairman about that. So I wonder if we might take a moment to consider \nthe Sessions amendment and allow me to have just a moment before that \ndecision is made.\n  Mr. STEVENS. So we will proceed at this time with the Sessions \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3192.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3192.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3192\n\n  (Purpose: To fund Operation Jump Start, the deployment of National \n  Guard personnel, to the southern border, through September 30, 2008)\n\n       On page 114, lines 6 and 7, strike ``$22,445,227,000: \n     Provided,'' and insert ``$23,239,227,000: Provided, That not \n     less than $794,000,000 of such amount shall be made available \n     for Operation Jump Start in order to maintain a significant \n     durational force of the National Guard on the southern land \n     border of the United States to assist the United States \n     Border Patrol in gaining operational control of that border, \n     in addition to any other amounts made available under this \n     Act for such purpose: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nDomenici, Dole, and Ensign be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it is unfortunate and sad, I think, \nthat the Senate--and I would say the administration--has made a \ndecision to prematurely draw down the National Guard presence at the \nsouthern border. That is an unwise event, and it signals uncertainty \nabout our commitment to completing the lawful strategy we have for \nimmigration at our border.\n  It is not impossible for us to create a lawful system of immigration, \nbut we have to do some things. We have allowed unlawfulness to continue \nfor an extraordinary amount of time, to the extent that it is going to \ntake us some effort now to reestablish a rule of law. But the whole \nworld will be better off and everyone who wants to come to our country \nwill be better off if they know what the rules are, how to apply, and \nhave an understanding that their competitors who would like to come \nhere are not going to be allowed to come illegally and then be rewarded \nby amnesty while they wait in line to come lawfully.\n  So the amendment I have offered will fully fund Operation Jump Start \nat its original level--the 6,000 National Guard troops--through the end \nof fiscal year 2008. Currently, the Department of Defense has plans \nonly to keep 3,000 at the border instead of the full 6,000 who were to \nbe deployed through 2008. Furthermore, Operation Jump Start is actually \nnow scheduled to end completely on July 1, 2008. So the increased \nfunding provided for here--and I do believe it is an emergency and it \nis a legitimate emergency expenditure to create lawfulness at our \nborder, which will protect the national security of the United States--\nthis increased funding will be needed to do these things: keep \nOperation Jump Start at the deployment level that has been so \nsuccessful and keep Operation Jump Start running until this time next \nyear.\n  On May 15, 2006, President Bush announced Operation Jump Start, which \nwas the employment of up to 6,000 National Guard members to the \nsouthern land border. According to Operation Jump Start Year 1 Review, \nits intent was to provide:\n\n       An immediate means to enhance border enforcement operations \n     while Border Patrol increased its own internal enforcement \n     resources through hiring additional Border Patrol agents, \n     mission support personnel, and procuring and applying new \n     technology and infrastructure.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       OJS is providing interim support as Border Patrol recruits, \n     hires, and trains 6,000 additional Border Patrol agents by \n     the end of calendar year 2008--\n\n  End of calendar year 2008; that is December of 2008.\n  My amendment would simply carry the strength of the National Guard \nthrough September 30, 2008, the fiscal year. That is important because \nwe are facing a rather substantial drawdown without this amendment.\n  So deployments began on June 15, 2006, to give us a bit of a \nbackground. By August 2006, an average of 5,677 National Guard \npersonnel were deployed. By June 2007--that is June of this year--an \naverage of 5,759 were deployed.\n  Since the beginning, on the border, the National Guard has supported \nthe Department of Homeland Security by providing, among other things, \nthe following skills: construction of tactical infrastructure; that is, \nfencing, roads, and lighting and those kinds of things that are really \ncritical if we are serious about making sure people just don't walk \nacross our border. You have to have those things. We made some progress \nin that regard, although, in truth, we should have made more. They are \ninvolved in fence repair, welding, and facility maintenance. Many of \nthese are engineer Guard units with a lot of capabilities in this area. \nThey provide vehicle and fleet maintenance. Many of these are \ntransportation units that are skilled at fleet maintenance. Entry \nidentification teams, surveillance and reconnaissance teams, law \nenforcement communication assistance, intelligence analysis--we have a \nlot of those capabilities in the National Guard.\n  So I would say they are not being utilized on a daily basis to patrol \nthe border and make arrests. We decided that would not be what they are \ndeployed for. But they are really providing a lot of capability that \nfrees up a limited number of Border Patrol agents to be the front-line \ntroops, to go out and make the arrests and do the day-to-day work that \nhas to be done.\n  The success of the operation is undeniable. By early December of \n2006, just 6 months after the deployment began, Robert Gilbert, the \nchief Border Patrol agent for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, \nstated:\n\n       Jointly, we are making a definite impact on the border. The \n     professionalism and dedication and training the Guard units \n     have brought to our mission and our fight, the way they have \n     made it their mission and their fight, is more than we \n     expected.\n\n  That same month, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, LTG Steve \nBlum, stated:\n\n       I was here 2\\1/2\\ months ago and things that I didn't think \n     would be possible in a year have already been accomplished. \n     Infrastructure is up, fencing is up, roads are built, \n     lighting is up, and apprehensions are down.\n\n  Those aren't just words. The success of Operation Jump Start is \ntangible.\n  According to the Year 1 Review:\n\n       Force multiplication has allowed more Border Patrol agents \n     to remain in the enforcement mode, not the support mode. The \n     additional manpower has allowed DHS to return 563 agents to \n     frontline positions. The result is referred to as ``badges \n     back to the border.''\n\n  The Guard presence has added 337 miles of expanded border \nsurveillance capabilities along the southwest border. Guard personnel \nprovide 6,500 hours of camera monitoring. Somebody has to monitor the \ncameras. There is no doubt that an electronic fence, as some have said, \nis not a worthless idea. You can use cameras and electronic technology \nto enhance our capabilities at the border, but in the high-traffic \nareas, it is not a question of seeing people, it is a question of how \nyou can detain them if they are coming illegally. So I think we made \nprogress there with the help of the National Guard.\n  Guard personnel have assisted in apprehending more than 10 percent of \nthe aliens apprehended during the past year--a total of 84,878 \napprehensions. Overall, apprehensions of illegal immigrants trying to \ncross the border are down by 25 percent. What most experts conclude \nthat means is that an estimated 25 percent fewer illegal immigrants are \nattempting to cross. The Guard's presence is, in fact, having a \ndeterrent effect.\n  With the help of the National Guard, marijuana seizures are up 22 \npercent. The Guard was responsible for seizing 201,000 pounds of \nmarijuana at the border.\n  As a matter of fact, when we talk about security and the need to do \nsomething about openness and illegality at our border, we have to \nconsider drugs to be a big part of that. Guard personnel have assisted \nin the seizure of 4,783 pounds of cocaine, 703 vehicles, and $60,000 in \ncurrency. So this is an important matter in the success we are having.\n  The Guard presence has produced sizable gains in critically needed \ntactical infrastructure along the border. They have already repaired \n428 miles of roads. You have to have roads if you are going to be \neffective in maintaining a border. And 16 miles of all-weather roads \nhave been repaired and maintained. They have installed 58 miles of \nvehicle barriers. At least it prohibits people from driving into our \ncountry loaded with drugs or illegal items.\n  They have constructed 18.2 miles of fencing, which is a disappointing \nnumber. After all that we funded in this Congress, which was 700 miles \nof fencing, we have only 18 miles completed.\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\nWe voted for it. We talked about it. We go back home and tell our \nconstituents we have done it. The President says we are doing it. The \nSecretary of Homeland Security says we are doing it. We have not \naccomplished much, but the Guard has played a role by using their \nengineering capability. Frankly, if they had been focused more on \nactual barriers, they probably would have accomplished more.\n  The real reason is the way we planned this out has been very slow in \ndevelopment, in terms of building our fencing. In fact, we are informed \nthat the fencing numbers are improving right now; that miles of fencing \nare appearing and coming much more rapidly on line than before. If you \nexamine the situation closely, you will see there appears to be a move \nafoot to draw this out and end up with far less fencing than the \nCongress contemplated both with our authorization and appropriations \nbills.\n  The Department of Homeland Security indicates that the Guard's \npresence will have an even greater impact on tactical infrastructure \nover the next year:\n\n       The deployments will be focused on providing a greater \n     residual value by raising the percentage of troops that are \n     working on tactical infrastructure projects. This \n     infrastructure will greatly enhance the ability of the men \n     and women of the border patrol to access the border and be \n     more effective in the enforcement efforts for many years to \n     come.\n\n  OK. What they are saying is they have projected in the coming months \nthat the Guard is going to be even more effective because they will be \nproviding a greater residual value by raising the percentage of troops \nworking on infrastructure projects. Now, there are people who don't \nwant infrastructure at the border, and they would like to bring the \ntroops home, I suppose, before that happens. That would be a big \nmistake.\n  The National Guard is helping the border to save lives. In the last \nyear, they have rescued 91 people--illegal aliens--in the area who were \nin desperate trouble for lack of water or being lost. They rescued \nthem. Now, this is what has happened. Despite the proven success of the \nprogram, the operation is scheduled to stop by next July. Troops are \nalready being reduced. By the end of July, troops were down to 4,500; \nthat is July of 2007. By the end of August of this year, troops were \ndown to 3,500. So it dropped even more. Today, only 3,000 personnel are \non Operation Jump Start orders, and, of those, only 2,300 are actually \nat the border.\n  So already there has been a drawdown of more than half of the \nNational Guard personnel, and not communicating that to the American \npeople is leaving us in a difficult situation, I suggest. The National \nGuard was supposed to fill the gap until 6,000 new Border Patrol agents \ncould be recruited, hired, trained, and stationed at the border. That \ngoal has only been accomplished halfway. Only 3,000 new agents have \njoined the 1,000 who were on the border when President Bush announced \nOperation Jump Start. The National Guard is assisting in fence and \nother critical infrastructure construction.\n  The Secure Fence Act that we passed mandated that the Department of \nHomeland Security construct more than 700 miles of new fencing. The \nadministration's goal apparently is not to do that. Apparently it is to \njust complete 300 miles by the end of the whole next year, 2008. So \nwith 2 years of authorization and funding, they will have only \ncompleted less than half of the fencing. To date, only 70 new miles \nhave been constructed, for a total of 145 miles of fencing on the \nborder. That is not the kind of signal we need to be sending.\n  The reason that is important is because it has a psychological \nimpact, as well as an actual apprehension impact. What about alien \napprehensions? To date, alien apprehensions on the border are down 25 \npercent. While this is positive, because it indicates the attempts at \ncrossings are likely down by 25 percent as well, the job is certainly \nnot finished. The year before that, we arrested 1 million people at the \nborder. Can you imagine that? One million people were arrested at the \nborder. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a wide-open, \nlawless area that needs attention from our Government. If we don't give \nit, we are breaking faith with the American people because we have said \nwe are going to fix that, we are going to do something about it. We \njust haven't.\n  I have to tell you there are some people who really don't care about \nit. They talk about it, but they don't care. We have some progress; 25 \npercent is a lot. It is not insignificant. But if we really got that \nfencing up and built, if we kept the National Guard down at the border, \nif we broaden the Border Patrol and motivate them to be as effective as \nthey possibly could be, I absolutely believe--absolutely believe--we \ncan reach a tipping point where the whole world begins to say the \nborder of the United States is no longer wide open; that you can get in \ntrouble going across there. Most people are getting caught. It is an \nentirely different place, so maybe we better not try it this time. \nMaybe somebody suggested we can do that, but that is not a good idea. \nBut for the last 20 years-plus, it has been a well-known fact worldwide \nthat you can just walk across our border, if you have very much \ninitiative, and be successful at it. If they catch you, nothing ever \nhappens.\n  Now, I will conclude by noting that, according to the year review of \nOperation Jump Start:\n\n       OJS is one of the many enforcement initiatives employed to \n     expand enforcement capabilities to gain better operational \n     control along the Southwest border. OJS, combined with other \n     initiatives, such as Operation Streamline, Zero Tolerance, \n     Arizona Border Control Initiative, and the Expedited Removal \n     Program, has resulted in a cumulative, positive impact on \ncurrent levels of border control.\n\n  Good news. A positive impact. What it should do is give us \nencouragement. If we will just follow through, expand what we are \ndoing, adjust to the changing tactics of those who want to enter \nillegally, and do it with will and determination and a positive \nattitude, we can make a difference. We can end this open border, end \nthe illegality that has made the immigration system a mockery of law \nand an embarrassment to our people.\n  Operation Jump Start is a proven success. It is a critical component \nof our strategy. Guardsmen are filling critical law enforcement roles. \nThey are building fencing and infrastructure and interdicting narcotics \nand conducting surveillance and reconnaissance; and, by the way, a \nsubstantial majority of our cocaine and methamphetamines, for that \nmatter, are coming into our country through Mexico. I talk to law \nenforcement officers in Alabama all the time. They say we used to get a \nlot out of Miami and south Florida. Now it is all coming across the \nMexican border. So we have a law enforcement interest in this also.\n  There is no reason Operation Jump Start should end this June. At a \nminimum, it should be extended until all 6,000 Border Patrol agents are \non duty. The way we have been going, we authorize it and say we are \ngoing to add 6,000 Border Patrol agents, and they don't get added, if \nyou want to know the truth. We have seen that happen time and time \nagain. They said we were going to continue this Operation Jump Start \nand the National Guard, but we have already reduced our Guard personnel \nby more than half. That adds credibility problems with the American \npeople. No wonder they are suspicious about what we are doing here. \nThis amendment will provide the needed funding to keep Operation Jump \nStart at its original capacity, 6,000 Guard personnel, instead of what \nthey have planned now. It makes no sense to the American people to say \nwe found something that is effective, that is beginning to work to \nreduce the illegality we are facing, but we are stopping the program \nbefore the job is done. The border is not yet secure. It is too early \nto end this program. We need to step it up, and I think we will be in a \nposition to have greater progress than anyone can imagine.\n  Madam President, to sum up, the good news is we have made some \nprogress, but we have not really begun to get to finishing up. If we \nget the fencing up and keep our Guard there full-time and get our new \nBorder Patrol agents up and we move to ending the catch-and-release and \nadopt the Texas plan, where individuals are prosecuted for violating \nthe laws by entering illegally--that has reduced border crossings in \nthat area by 45 percent or more--and if we can do other things\n\n[[Page S12518]]\n\nlike that, this will work and we can make good progress.\n  The problem is, I think some are not desirous of us being successful. \nEverything that tends to work seems to be delayed and slowed down and \nundermined. If we move forward, we can send a message to the world that \nour National Guard is there, our troops are there, the Border Patrol \nhas been increased, we are building barriers, and you are not going to \nget in easily anymore, so you better wait in line and come here \nlawfully, and the whole country will be better off. This amendment will \nbe a big part of doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sessions amendment is the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask that amendment be accepted by \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3192) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3131\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment in \nbehalf of Senator Stabenow and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Ms. Stabenow, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3131.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test, and \n    Evaluation, Army, $4,000,000 for the Virtual Systems Integrated \n  Laboratory-Armored Vehicle Components and Systems Simulated In Cost-\n             Effective Virtual Design and Test Environment)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8107.  Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation, Army'', up to $4,000,000 \n     may be available for the Virtual Systems Integrated \n     Laboratory-Armored Vehicle Components and Systems Simulated \n     In Cost-Effective Virtual Design and Test Environment.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3131) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Stryker Brigade Combat Teams\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with my \ngood friend, the Senior Senator from Hawaii, chairman of the Senate \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Inouye, ranking member of the \nSenate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, regarding the need for additional \nStryker Brigade Combat Teams in our Army National Guard.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be happy to discuss this important issue with the \nSenators from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Sir, we have all watched with pride the bravery of our men \nand women in uniform as they defend freedom around the world. We are \nparticularly proud of the members of the National Guard, who fight \nside-by-side with active duty forces. These guards men and women \ndeserve the same protection and equipment as the active force with \nwhich they stand shoulder to shoulder. In combat operations, the \nStryker vehicle has performed exceptionally and proven itself to be a \nsuperior fighting vehicle that protects the precious lives of our \nservicemembers. I would like to express my strong support for our \nguards men and women and ask that the Army ensure that funding for \nadditional Stryker vehicles with the intent of forming a second Stryker \nBridge Combat Team for the National Guard figures prominently in \nimmediate planning.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would like to join my colleague from Oregon in \nrecognizing the Guard soldiers who leave their community to fight for \ntheir country. And I agree that they deserve the best equipment \navailable, including the Stryker vehicles. I think it is also important \nto point out that in the hands of the Guard the Stryker vehicles would \nalso be used during domestic disaster situations as well as combat \noverseas. Our citizen soldiers deserve the same equipment as the active \nduty Army, and I too hope that the Army will see the wisdom of \nestablishing a Stryker Brigade Combat Team for the National Guard.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senators from Oregon for unwavering support \nof our men and women in the Army National Guard. We all recognize and \nare deeply grateful for the service that the National Guard has \nprovided in domestic disasters and international conflict. It is well-\ndocumented that the Stryker brigades have indeed performed \nexceptionally in Iraq. The House has added over $1 billion for \nStrykers. Your and your colleagues' views on Strykers for the Guard are \nnoted and will be taken into consideration as we enter into conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish to echo my colleague's support for the men and \nwomen in the National Guard. I am extremely grateful for their service \nand dedication to our country. I reiterate my colleague's sentiment \nthat we will take into consideration our colleague's views on a Stryker \nBrigade for the National Guard.\n\n\n                  improved engineering design process\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to express my support for a \nprogram sponsored by the U.S. Navy, which will significantly streamline \nthe process for planning and executing repair and modernization of our \nsubmarine fleet at our naval shipyards. The Improved Engineering Design \nProcess uses advanced 3-D digital scanning techniques to accurately \ncapture the ``as is'' layout of specific ship spaces that will be \nimpacted in the repair process. These digital 3-D images can then be \neasily shared to allow collaboration among our public shipyards to \nfacilitate greater efficiency in planning and executing repairs and \nmodernization. Because of the high operating tempo of our fleet, it is \nessential that we find ways to accomplish these repairs faster and \nreturn our submarines to operational readiness more quickly. I \nunderstand that implementation of this process in our public shipyards \nhas the potential to produce annual savings of $30 million. I ask the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee if he \nwould agree such a program should be further developed and implemented \nas quickly as possible?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The project described by the Senator from Maine appears \nto have great merit. Savings of this magnitude are especially important \nat a time when our resources are stretched very thinly.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The distinguished ranking member makes a very important \npoint regarding the need for pursuing initiatives of this kind so that \nour scarce dollars can go further. I understand that the Navy believes \nstrongly in the merits of this program and has considered this program \nfor inclusion in future budget requests. I encourage the Navy to not \nonly include it in its budget request, but to also identify existing \nfunds that may be applied to keeping this program moving forward. In \naddition, I ask the committee ranking member to join me in encouraging \nthe Navy to continue supporting this critical program and, if possible, \nto identify potential fiscal year 2008 funds that could be made \navailable as we finalize those budget deliberations. I thank the \nSenator for his interest in and support for this important initiative.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Maine for bringing this \nimportant program to my attention.\n\n[[Page S12519]]\n\n                                Hawklink\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, along with my colleagues from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson, and Florida, Senator Martinez, I rise to \naddress the issue of funding for a key common data link system which \nwill provide sensor connectivity for the Navy's MH-60R light airborne \nmultipurpose, LAMPS, helicopters with ships in our Navy's carrier \nbattle groups. I want to express my sincere appreciation to Chairman \nInouye for his willingness to consider our concerns regarding this \nvital program. The MH-60R LAMPS helicopter provides the fleet's primary \ncapability to detect, identify, and destroy surface and subsurface \nthreats to the carrier battle group. Essential air-to-ship sensor \nconnectivity will be provided by CDL Hawklink, a high-speed, air-to-\nship, common data link--CDL--compliant, digital data link that \ntransmits tactical, video, radar, acoustic, IFF, and raw sensor data \nfrom MH-60R helicopters to host surface ships. CDL Hawklink will \nprovide a significant improvement over current capabilities and will \ngreatly improve fleet interoperable communications, dramatically \nenhance transmission of threat identification and targeting data for \nshipboard analysis, and replace current hardware facing critical \nobsolescence and parts non-availability.\n  The Navy requested $31.8 million for this shipboard equipment for \nfiscal year 2008. While the House bill would provide full funding, the \nSenate bill would cut $9.6 million from the request. I understand the \ncommittee cut the request due to excessive cost growth. While we agree \nthat this is a reasonable basis for the committee to make such cuts, \nSenator Isakson, Senator Martinez, and I have asked Chairman Inouye to \nconsider some of the reasons for the cost growth and the detrimental \nimpact such a cut would have on this important program.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank my colleagues, Senator Chambliss and Senator \nMartinez, for their work on this issue, as well as Chairman Inouye for \nhis consideration and willingness to work with us to restore full \nfunding for this critical program. This is an important program for the \nNavy and the Department of Defense. The proposed reduction of $9.6 \nmillion equates to a 30-percent reduction to the Navy's request. A \nfunding reduction of this magnitude will result in a quantity reduction \nof seven of the 10 data link units intended to be procured in fiscal \nyear 2008. A quantity reduction of this magnitude will significantly \nincrease the average unit cost for these units and drive up costs to \nthe total program. The initial operational capability for the program \nwould also be delayed for at least 1 year, negatively impacting the \nintegration of the MH-60R helicopter with the Carrier Strike Group. I \nappreciate the committee's consideration, and I, along with my \ncolleagues, appreciate very much the chairman's willingness to work \nwith us to restore funding for this essential program in conference.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I wish to join my friends and colleagues from Georgia \nin supporting funding for the LAMPS MK III procurement line at the full \nauthorized level of $31.8 million. This vital program, which the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on which Senator Chambliss and I serve, fully \nauthorized the President's request, brings needed capability to the \npilots and crews of the MH-60 aircraft and the carrier battle groups \nwith which they work. Mr. Chairman, I thank you and your committee for \nyour hard work on this crucial spending bill and ask that as you go to \nconference with the House you consider our support and the support of \nthe Navy and administration for this important program.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from Georgia as well as Chairman Inouye \nand Senator Stevens for their time and hard work.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate very much the diligent work of these three \nSenators in researching this important issue regarding the critical \nair-to-ship sensor connectivity within our Navy's carrier battle groups \nand bringing it to my attention. I appreciate that they understand the \nrationale for the reduction in funding we have proposed for this \nprogram, and I have listened carefully to their description of the \nimpacts that such a reduction might cause in the program. I assure my \nfriends, Senator Chambliss, Senator Isakson, and Senator Martinez, that \nI will continue to examine this program carefully as we proceed to \nconference.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the chairman for his generous consideration of \nour concerns, and I also thank my colleagues for their hard work on \nthis issue. Senator Inouye is one of the great heroes of our country \nand continues to earn our highest respect and admiration every day here \nin the Senate. It is a privilege and an honor to work with him on these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere \nappreciation to Chairman Inouye for his willingness to address our \nconcerns. We all appreciate his great service to our Nation--as a \ncourageous soldier and a great Senator as well.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank my colleagues for their work on this issue and \nChairman Inouye for listening to our concerns. We all appreciate his \ncommitment to our Nation.\n\n\n          Battlefield surveillance and Management Radar System\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the need to \ncontinue development of a vital next-generation battlefield \nsurveillance and management radar system. Battlefield surveillance and \nmanagement is more important than ever for the safety and effectiveness \nof our military, engaged in a variety of combat operations. With the \nadvent of increasingly difficult-to-track targets, new technology is \ncritically important to keep pace with expanding threats to our men and \nwomen in uniform. Indeed, U.S. technology should be honed to detect \nthreats such as cruise missiles, rockets, as well as slow moving land \nbased targets common on the battlefield in counterterrorism operations.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for raising this \nimportant issue and for his recent letter informing me of the \ncriticality of this program.\n  Mr. DODD. As the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee knows, production of the Joint Surveillance and Target \nAttack Radar aircraft, or JSTARS--our Nation's principal platform for \nperforming these vital missions--was canceled in 2003, with its last \ndelivery occurring in 2005. The E-10 multisensor command and control \naircraft was intended to replace this platform, but that too was \ncanceled last year. Fortunately, after constructive discussions with \nthe Department of Defense, the Pentagon agreed to continue developing \nthe high-tech sensor and radar technologies that were being designed to \noutfit the E-10, the multiplatform radar technology insertion program, \nor MP-RTIP. Unfortunately, the Department of Defense would only commit \nto developing the system via supplemental appropriations instead of the \nstandard Defense budgeting process. I remain concerned that such an \nuncertain funding strategy could jeopardize our Nation's ability to \ndevelop the critical tools our military needs to maintain modern \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleagues for bringing up this critical \nmatter. The threats that our troops face on the battlefield continue to \ngrow. We, and they, are fortunate that they have JSTARS and its radar \nto give them a critical edge. JSTARS has proven its value on the \nbattlefield many times, beginning with Desert Storm when it was rushed \nto the field to give our commanders an unprecedented view of the \nbattlefield. Since then, every warfighting commander that has testified \nbefore us has said that JSTARS is absolutely essential to success. \nIndeed, as the senior Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, the \ncancellation of the E-10 means that JSTARS will remain essential for \nyears to come. But the radar on JSTARS is aging at the same time that \nthe battlefield is getting more complex and threats harder to detect. \nFortunately, MP-RTIP can be available to put on JSTARS. I believe we \nmust move quickly to develop a version of MP-RTIP and install it on our \nJSTARS aircraft to give our commanders and soldiers the absolute best \ncapability that we can. In fact, the Pentagon acknowledged in its most \nrecent Quadrennial Defense Review the critical importance of the United \nStates improving its ability to detect incoming cruise missiles and \nslow-moving ground\n\n[[Page S12520]]\n\nvehicles. Current technologies such as JSTARS are simply inadequate to \ntrack small airborne targets that may easily be used to attack our \nforces with little warning and with horrible effect.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to add to my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut's remarks. While our troops deserve nothing less than the \nbest equipment, it is also essential that we maintain the ability to \ndomestically produce this type of advanced technology. I am convinced \nthat failure to support MP-RTIPs continued advancement would result in \na devastating loss to our domestic industrial base, essential for \nproducing this type of crucial radar technology. Additionally, it would \nseem as though we had wasted the $1 billion already invested in this \nvital program. Now is not the time to forgo dominance in the realm of \nbattlefield surveillance and management--and that is precisely what \nwould happen if we ended domestic production of this vital system.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senators from Connecticut for bringing this \nissue before us today. I assure you that I will examine this program \ncarefully as the committee reviews the supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this important \nissue.\n\n\n                            Patriot Missiles\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, on Patriot \nmissiles. It is my understanding that the Patriot missile is the Army's \nonly fielded air and missile defense capability. With only 13 total \ndeployable battalions in the force, the Army operational and personnel \ncapacity to respond to the needs of the combatant commanders is \nseverely stressed.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator for raising this very important \nissue. As the Senator knows, I am a strong supporter of the Patriot.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Your support is well known and very much appreciated. \nThis year is a very active year for Patriot--the Patriot pure fleet \neffort will upgrade three tactical battalions from the PAC-2 to the \nPAC-3 configuration and the Patriot ``Grow the Army'' effort to upgrade \ntwo nontactical battalions of Patriot equipment from the PAC-2 to the \nPAC-3 configuration, and purchase the remaining new equipment for \nstand-up of these battalions.\n  It is my understanding that the funding for this effort is a little \ncomplicated. The Army requested $208 for the Patriot pure fleet effort \nand $294 million in the amended fiscal year 2008 President's budget \nrequest to fund the activation and equipping of the first additional \nbattalion fiscal year 2008 with the second in fiscal year 2010. This \nfiscal year 2008 funding is critical to this schedule to procure long \nlead materials to prevent slip into fiscal year 2012 and beyond. I \nunderstand that providing these funds in fiscal year 2008 avoids almost \n$100 million in costs. And if that funding is provided, the plan for \nPatriot pure fleet and the ``Grow the Army'' initiative is executable \nand not ahead of the need to establish the two additional battalions. I \nbelieve that fully funding the Army's amended request in fiscal year \n2008 is in the best interests of the taxpayer and will avoid almost \n$100 million in costs if the Army can award all this work under one \ncontract.\n  I strongly support conforming the Senate bill to the House mark, \nwhich included the $294 million for the ``Grow the Army'' effort.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator. As the Senator surely knows, we \nfully funded the Patriot pure fleet effort, one of the Army's top \npriorities in the past 2 years. We will certainly consider the \nadditional information provided as we conference the bill.\n\n\n                        Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nesteemed Senator from Hawaii in order to speak about the important role \nmedium to high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, play in \noperations across the world today. We are concerned that the DOD is \nsimply not fielding enough of these systems. Despite constant increases \nin procurement and assurance from the Department that they are working \nto address this requirement, medium to high altitude UAVs remain a low \ndensity high demand asset.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from Indiana for raising this \nimportant issue and agree with my good friend that improving our \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities is a \ncritical issue for our military today.\n  Mr. BAYH. As my chairman is already fully aware, today's \ncounterinsurgency and counterterror operations remain intelligence \ndriven. The ultimate success of so many of our military's missions \ndepends on the effectiveness of our intelligence capabilities. Truly, \neach and every single operation has an intelligence component.\n  I do not believe that these assets can ever replace people or the \nhuman intelligence they produce, but they remain highly valuable given \ntheir limited footprint and ability to collect data across multiple \nspectrums. Simply put, they are force multipliers. Systems like the \nPredator, Reaper, and Sky Warrior have long loiter times and an ability \nto strike immediately. Further, they do not have to wait on the arrival \nof other manned assets before engaging a target, which is something \nthat we cannot currently duplicate.\n  I have visited Iraq and Afghanistan, where I was told over and again \nthe importance of these ISR assets. Further, during a recent Armed \nServices hearing, I was able to question our new Special Operations \nCommander, Admiral Olson, about medium to high altitude UAV \nrequirements. He told the committee that there is currently a 30 UAV \norbit requirement in CENTCOM. However, we only have 12 orbits available \ntoday. I find this unacceptable.\n  In both major theaters of operation, we have been told how difficult \nit can be to have constant surveillance of suspected enemy hideouts. \nGiven that insurgents are nearly always local, these hideouts and safe \nhavens can often be in the midst of innocent bystanders and be \ndifficult to observe covertly. Having eyes on a site to provide the \ntarget discrimination our commanders need is invaluable.\n  No matter how long American forces remain in either theater, I \nstrongly believe that some of the last assets to leave will be ISR \ncollection in nature. Medium to high altitude UAVs do just that, and I \nask that my colleague from Hawaii look to address this significant \nshortfall in the upcoming fiscal year 2008 supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I can assure the junior Member from Indiana that my \ncommittee will examine this program carefully and give this request all \ndue consideration as the committee reviews the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I thank my colleague for his concern and \nleadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. BAYH. And I thank my colleague from Hawaii for his continued \ndedication to the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces.\n\n\n                            Army R & D--FED\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend from \nHawaii, the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Inouye.\n  The bill before us includes two significant cuts to the President's \nbudget request in the area of Army research and development on combat \nvehicle and automotive technology. The House-passed version of this \nbill and both the House and Senate-passed versions of the National \nDefense Authorization Act do not include these cuts.\n  The first cut of $10 million eliminated funding for a fuel efficiency \nground vehicle demonstrator, FED. This program is scheduled to be a 3-\nyear effort by the ground vehicle experts at the U.S. Army Tank-\nAutomotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center to develop a \ntactical ground vehicle that is significantly lighter and more fuel \nefficient than current high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles, \nHMMWVs. Specifically, this program will focus on the overall design of \nthe vehicle as well as components including hybrid electric propulsion \nsystems, fuel cells, advanced batteries, and new armor solutions.\n  This project is key to advancing technologies that will allow the \nDepartment of Defense to meet the fuel efficiency goals it has \nestablished. Additionally, this project is complementary to the \ndevelopment of the new joint light tactical vehicle and will provide an \nopportunity to demonstrate a number of new technologies, including on-\nboard power solutions, that can\n\n[[Page S12521]]\n\nbe spun into the vehicle as its development moves forward. Lastly, this \nproject provides the opportunity to test technologies that will give \nour military new capabilities, including silent overwatch and mobile \npower sources on the battlefield.\n  The second cut of $14.215 million eliminated funding for future \ncombat systems, FCS, science and technology activities in the area of \nrobotics. FCS is the Army's only major transformation project, and we \nmust remain committed to this program. These funds would be used to \nsupport the development of electronics and control systems for unmanned \nground vehicles that will eventually be integrated into the FCS \nnetwork. Without these funds, the Army will not have the ability to \nbuild a large scale unmanned ground vehicle demonstrator to test new \nrobotics technologies.\n  These funds are critical to advancing and testing new robotics \ntechnologies so they can be rapidly deployed to our warfighters around \nthe world. Cutting these funds will reduce the Army's ability to \ndevelop and test robotics technologies needed by our troops and \nincrease the risk that they will not be available for rapid transition \ninto the hands of warfighters.\n  I am sure my colleague would agree that we should do more, not less, \nto achieve increased fuel efficiency in our military ground vehicles \nand more rapidly mature the capabilities of unmanned ground vehicle \ntechnologies.\n  Mr. INOUYE. My colleague from Michigan raises some important points. \nReducing fuel consumption in the field is an urgent need of our \nmilitary. It will not only reduce costs but also reduce the risk to our \ntroops because fewer fuel deliveries will need to be made to dangerous \nareas.\n  I also agree that future combat systems, and especially the new \nrobotics technologies it will bring, are critically important to our \ntroops. These technologies will continue to play an important role in \nthe transition of our military to a more mobile, lethal, and effective \nforce.\n  I commit to my colleague from Michigan that the committee will \nreevaluate the cuts he has highlighted when the bill goes to conference \nwith the House.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the Record, the \nBudget Committee's official scoring of H.R. 3222, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $459.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2008, which will result in new outlays of $312.2 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $476 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is at its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and $3 million below its allocation for outlays. No \npoints of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        H.R. 3222, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................    459,332          0    459,332\n    Outlays............................    475,977          0    475,977\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........    459,332\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........    475,980\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...................    459,319         13    459,332\n    Outlays............................    473,026         53    473,079\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................    462,879          0    462,879\n    Outlays............................    477,836          8    477,844\n   Senate-Reported Bill Compared To:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........          0\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........         -3\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...................         13        -13          0\n    Outlays............................      2,951        -53      2,898\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................     -3,547          0     -3,547\n    Outlays............................     -1,859         -8     -1,867\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the Defense Appropriations Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2008 is one of the most important of the appropriations \nmeasures that we will consider this year. This legislation will provide \ncritical funding for the men and women in our Armed Forces who, at this \nvery moment, are in harm's way. Because we must continue to support \nthem, I support the passage of this bill, but I have serious concerns \nover the earmarks contained in the committee report accompanying this \nbill.\n  The bill reported out of committee appropriates over $448 billion. \nThis is more than $3.5 billion below the President's request and, \nnotably, does not include any additional funds for ongoing operations \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. As is the case with so many of the \nappropriations bills that come to the floor, the report accompanying it \ncontains numerous earmarks that were neither requested nor authorized, \nto the tune of over $5 billion. During a time of war, we should be \nmaking every effort to support the President's budget request instead \nof slashing it and then adding earmarks for favored projects.\n  Every day, we ask the brave men and women who fight for freedom on \nbehalf of our great Nation, and their families, to make sacrifices. \nThey sacrifice in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere throughout the \nglobe. We in the Congress should exercise some degree of self-restraint \nand sacrifice, as well.\n  Let me mention a few of the add-ons that were included in the bill's \naccompanying report: $2 million for a project involving brown tree \nsnakes; a total of $3 million for an electronic futures trading \nprogram; $2 million for research on high-pressure microwave processing \nfor meals-ready-to-eat; $2 million for the Marines to buy boot socks \ncushioned with merino wool; $2 million to buy extended cold-weather \ngloves for the Army; $2 million for research on a technology that \nextracts pure water from the air; $2 million for research on a \nmultispectral fingerprint device; $4 million to study the Northern \nLights; $6.5 million for small instrument development for Magdalena \nRidge Observatory; and $10 million for Eielson Utilidors.\n  Once again, there are also many earmarks that may be for worthy \ncauses, but there is no compelling national defense reason for these \nitems to be funded through this legislation. These earmarks include \n$150 million for a peer-reviewed breast cancer research program; $80 \nmillion for a similar prostate cancer research program; $10 million for \novarian cancer research; $27.5 million for the Hawaii Federal Health \nCare Network; $10 million to a program called Ceros, for river and \noceanic research; $6.1 million for research on a new engine called \nhomopolar hybrid drive; $2 million for research into putting humans \ninto a state similar to hibernation so they can be kept alive long \nenough for doctors to administer treatments; and $3 million for \nresearch for a 2D-3D face-recognition system.\n  As we are engaged fully in the global war on terror, it is imperative \nthat we get the most out of each and every defense dollar. The money \nthat is being diverted to projects like the ones I have mentioned could \ninstead be used for body armor or other critical needs to protect our \ntroops and help win the war on terror. The earmarks I have mentioned \nare just a small sampling of the many unrequested earmarks that fill \nthe accompanying report. These earmarks are draining our precious \nresources and are not vital to our long-term national security. I \nstrongly encourage the Federal agencies affected to use their judgement \nto ensure they are not allocating resources to projects that are not \nlegislatively mandated or authorized but rather, are merely the wish \nlists of the committee.\n  In the report accompanying the bill, there are several authorizing \nprovisions, which by their nature have no place in an appropriations \nvehicle, including language directing the Air Force to provide funding \nto continue the operation of the 36th Rescue Flight assigned to \nFairchild AFB in Washington State and a provision requiring funding for \nNaval archeology programs in the Lake Champlain Basin.\n  Similarly, in the bill, a provision directs the Air Force to complete \nupgrades and additions to Alaskan range infrastructure and training \nareas, as well as at Hickman AFB in Hawaii. A similar provision calls \nfor $3 million to be spent on upgrades and maintenance at the Pacific \nMissile Range Facility. Another provision prohibits the \ndisestablishment of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in \nMississippi.\n  Some of these authorizing provisions are outside of the scope of \ndefense policy, including language providing for the Navy to transfer \nup to $20 million\n\n[[Page S12522]]\n\nto the Interior Department for any expenses associated with the \nconstruction of the USS Arizona Memorial Museum and Visitors Center.\n  I would also like to discuss the ``Buy America'' restrictions that \ncost the Department of Defense and the American taxpayers. Like in \nprevious appropriations bills, this year's bill imposes a number of \n``Buy America'' restrictions. For example, the bill would prevent the \nDefense Department's purchase of particular welded shipboard anchor and \nmooring chain; carbon alloy or armor steel plate; ball and roller \nbearings, unless they are manufactured in the United States. It would \nput similar restrictions on the Department's buying public vessels, \nfood, certain textile materials, particular Navy supply ships, as well \nas its purchase of coal as a fuel source for certain military \ninstallations in Germany. Another ``Buy America'' provision prohibits \nthe Department's buying any supercomputer that is not manufactured in \nthe United States.\n  I continue to be very concerned about the potential impact on \nreadiness of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. From a \nphilosophical point of view, I oppose these types of policies as \nprotectionist. I believe free trade is an important element in \nimproving relations among all nations and essential to economic growth. \nFrom a practical standpoint, ``Buy America'' restrictions, such as \nthose contained in this bill, could seriously impair our ability to \ncompete freely in international markets and also could result in the \nloss of existing business from long-standing trade partners.\n  I have no doubt that some of these provisions may be important while \nothers are questionable at best. What is important is that we follow \nthe authorization process and restrain ourselves from using \nappropriations bills to authorize projects on this bill that have not \nbeen requested by the Department of Defense, nor approved by the \nauthorizing committee.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt that this legislation is very \nimportant to the ultimate success of our ongoing war on terror. Yet I \nbelieve it is important to point out to the American taxpayer where \nsome of their money is going and some of it is not going to projects \nthat have anything to do with our defense.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 3222, the fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations \nbill. We have no greater obligation as elected officials, than to take \ncare of our troops and their families who have sacrificed on our \nbehalf. I am proud to support my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee who have crafted a bill that sets the right priorities for \nour military and our country by providing critical equipment and \ntraining, strengthening military health care for our troops and their \nfamilies, and giving our military families the pay raise they deserve.\n  The legislation before us today provides over $1 billion more for \nNational Guard equipment than the administration requested. This \nfunding is critical, not only to support National Guard troops who are \nfighting for our country overseas but to the Guard's ability to protect \nus here at home. National Guard units across the country have been \ngiving up the great majority of their equipment to units headed to Iraq \nand Afghanistan. The resulting shortages were felt just recently in \nGreenburg, KS, when that town was flattened by a tornado. Kansas \nGovernor Kathleen Sebelius said the State's response was hampered \nbecause much of the equipment usually positioned around the State to \nrespond to emergencies was in Iraq.\n  While Maryland does not face the same threat of tornadoes, my home \nState, like every State, has its own unique challenges. Maryland must \nbe prepared to respond not only to hurricanes and severe snow storms \nbut to attacks against Federal assets in the national capital region. \nAfter the mobilization of several Maryland Guard units to Iraq, the \nGuard has said it is without the necessary equipment to provide the \nrobust response that Marylanders and the rest of our Nation expect. \nH.R. 3222 takes action to address this critical shortfall in my State \nand every State.\n  This important bill provides military personnel 3.5 percent pay \nraise, half a percent more than the administration requested. President \nBush has threatened to veto this bill over the 0.5 percent additional \nincrease stating that the ``[t]roops don't need bigger pay raises.'' \nWell, I disagree.\n  The 3 percent raise would be enough to keep pace with the average \nincrease in private sector wages last year. The 3.5 percent raise is \nenough to not just match the private sector but to slightly close the \nestimated 4 percent gap that remains between average military and \nprivate sector raises. This gap hurts recruiting and retention for our \nAll-Volunteer Force and is not a handicap our military should shoulder \nwhen the war effort has forced the military to increase its overall \nsize at the same time it has depressed recruiting efforts.\n  H.R. 3222 makes care for our mentally and physically wounded military \nmen and women a priority. The legislation adds $948.9 million above the \nPresident's request for military health care, totaling $23.5 billion. \nOf the $23.5 billion, $486 million was added to reverse planned cuts to \nmilitary hospitals.\n  In addition, H.R. 3222 provides significant funds to develop \ntreatments for the signature injuries of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan including brain injury and loss of limbs. Uncontrolled \ninternal or external hemorrhage is the foremost preventable cause of \ndeath in the prehospital period for military combat trauma. Some 50 \npercent of the deaths our troops have suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan \ncould have been prevented if better products were available to control \nbleeding.\n  The measure provides $73 million to fund programs authorized in the \nSenate-passed Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warrior Act. The Wounded \nWarriors bill addresses the urgent medical needs of wounded \nservicemembers, especially those suffering from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and traumatic brain injuries.\n  I am particularly proud that H.R. 3222 funds promising techniques \nbeing pioneered in Maryland to develop bandages that are capable of \nstopping severe bleeding in the field and limb and tissue transplants \nthat are viable over the many years we hope our young wounded warriors \nwill live after returning home from war.\n  H.R. 3222 places a premium not only on providing our troops the \nequipment they need to avoid injury in the first place but to develop \nbetter technology going forward. The legislation provides $75.4 \nbillion, $268.9 million above the administration's request for \nresearch, development, test, and evaluation of new technologies. Some \nmoney will go to folks in Maryland developing methods of detecting \nexplosives at a greater distance as well as hybrid and alternative fuel \nsource engines. These engines not only reduce our dependence on oil and \ndecrease emissions; they reduce the need to ship fuel along supply \nroutes in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been a point of vulnerability \nfor our forces.\n  Today, I am proud to be part of a body that is meeting its \nobligations to our troops, their families, and our military as an \ninstitution. I applaud Senators Byrd, Cochran, Inouye, and Stevens and \nmy other colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their excellent \nwork and look forward to quick passage of this critical legislation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order and that the bill be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to say that my \nwife and I watched closely Ken Burns' production of ``The War'' or, as \nKatharine Phillips Singer from Mobile,\n\n[[Page S12523]]\n\ncalled it, ``The Wah.'' Some of the people we know there have enjoyed \nand been so impressed with the remarks of Senator Inouye as he was \ninterviewed about his experiences during World War II. His heroism and \ncommitment to America was demonstrated in so many different ways in \nthat program. He spoke so eloquently and so insightfully about the \nnature of war, the difficulty and brutality of war. I think not only \ndid he affirm the courageousness of our soldiers, but he gives us cause \nto look for ways to avoid such events in the future. It is worth \nnoting.\n  Hopefully, that whole production will be seen around the country and \nmore people will get a better picture of the enormity, the breadth, the \ncommitment our Nation gave during that decisive period in our history.\n  Senator Stevens also, of course, was a person who served courageously \nin that conflict. It is an honor for me today to be with these two fine \npatriots as we apparently move to final passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \ngenerous remarks.

Mr. President, today, I was pleased to support the fiscal \nyear 2008 Defense Appropriations Act. I would like to thank the \nChairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my good friend and \ncolleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens for \ntheir leadership in managing this bill with such impartiality and \nexpediency. Not only does this bill fully support the facility, \ntraining and equipment requirements of our men and women in uniform, \nbut it also provides a much needed increase in funds for military \nhealth over the President's budget request to ensure that members of \nour Armed Forces receive the care that they deserve. As chairman of the \nVeteran's Affairs Committee, I strongly supported the additional \ninclusion of $73 million to fund the programs authorized in the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warrior Act which addresses shortfalls \nin the care provided to our injured or ill soldiers.\n  I also applaud the inclusion in this bill of a provision which \nrecognizes the dedication and sacrifices made by both the members of \nour Armed Forces and their civilian counterparts by providing a 3.5 \npercent increase in basic pay for all servicemembers and civilian \npersonnel, a 0.5 percent increase above the President's request. I was \nalso pleased to support the addition of $1 billion to properly equip \nthe National Guard and Reserve forces who risk their lives to defend \nour nation.\n  As this bill moves toward conference I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues in both the Senate and the House to ensure that our military \nmembers and their families have the resources they need and the support \nthey have earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12523-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12523-S12524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL CROWLEY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my friend, Senator \nWhitehouse, to recognize the life of Paul Crowley, a Rhode Island State \nRepresentative who distinguished himself with an extraordinary career \nas a business leader and particularly as a civic leader in the State of \nRhode Island.\n  Paul passed away on September 24, 2007, after serving nearly 27 years \nas a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly. Indeed, I had the \nprivilege and pleasure of serving with Paul years ago. He was a friend \nto me. He was a source of wise counsel, and he was someone who was \nuniversally admired for his commitment, particularly his commitment to \nchildren.\n  Paul's passion was to try to reform the educational system of Rhode \nIsland. He brought that passion with him every day to the State House \nin Providence. He was someone who was unafraid of taking on anybody \nwhen it came to helping children perform better in school. It was not \nconfrontation for the sake of confrontation; it was constructive, \nrobust debate--always with the focus on improving the opportunities for \nchildren to learn in our State so they can take those skills and build \nstrong families, a strong community, and a great nation.\n  Paul is a contemporary. He was born, as I was, in 1949. He graduated \nfrom the University of Rhode Island in 1973 and was first elected as a \nDemocrat from Newport in 1981. In the intervening years he has, more \nthan any one person in Rhode Island, profoundly shaped education policy \nfor our State. As I said, he took it upon himself with a passion, with \na commitment, with a sense that this country is all about opportunity, \nand the greatest engine of opportunity for Americans is a good public \neducation.\n  He was an unstinting advocate. He was someone who understood the \nnature of the educational process. He worked ceaselessly, tirelessly, \nand he bore the frustrations of public service with a sense of purpose. \nAt the end of his career, he could look back at profound changes for \nthe better in the educational system of Rhode Island.\n  He was way ahead of his time in terms of emphasizing school \naccountability, standards-based reform, and measuring student progress. \nYears before these ideas were embraced and supported at the Federal \nlevel, Paul was talking about them at the State level and led a State-\nwide reform effort. He was committed to making sure education was \navailable for all our citizens, regardless of race, background, or \nincome; that they would have access to a high-quality public education \nas a foundation to higher education.\n  He was also an advocate for career and technical education, \nunderstanding that one size does not fit all; that the essence of \neducation is finding the talent in that child and giving that child the \nopportunity to use that talent. For many, it is career and technical \neducation.\n  He understood that in this new global economy, Americans could not \nstand pat when it came to education. They\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\nhad to be better than they were before, better than the rest of the \nworld. He fought for that vigorously and tirelessly.\n  He was someone who understood it very well and every day gave his all \nso every child in our State would have a better chance to make the \nprogress that is the essence of this country and seize all its \nopportunities.\n  Paul's greatest passion was for his family, Diana, and their three \nchildren, Meredith, Matthew, and Edward. In his family, he has a \nreflection of all the values he stood for, honesty, decency, integrity, \neffort, success and community spirit--reaching out to help others. All \nof these good people do it every day. They are inspired and sustained \nby his example.\n  Also high among his cherished ideals was his Irish heritage. Paul \nlooked like a map of Ireland, with a shock of white hair and his ruddy \ncomplexion and his great Irish tenor voice. He would sing Irish ballads \nwith his musical group, and he would remind us all of the great poets \nof Ireland and the great dreamers of Ireland. But similar to many of \nthem, he transformed the songs, the poems, and the dreams into real \naction.\n  Today we come to this floor to praise him, to thank him, to let his \nfamily know what they already know. He has won the esteem and the love \nof his neighbors in Rhode Island, richly deserved for a life well spent \nserving others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join my \ndistinguished senior Senator Jack Reed in remembering a great Rhode \nIslander, Representative Paul Crowley, of Newport. With his passing \nearly last week, the ``Ocean State'' lost not only a champion for our \nchildren and powerful advocate for Newport, the city he loved, but a \nfriend and mentor for many of us who served and worked with him. In a \nplace such as Rhode Island, a loss like that of Paul touches us \npersonally as well as politically.\n  So together with Senator Reed, I wish to share briefly with the \nSenate the Paul Crowley I know.\n  Paul was a Newporter heart and soul, a lifelong resident of the fifth \nward and a warm and generous host at Laforge Casino Restaurant, long \nowned by his family. He loved his old city and worked tirelessly to \nstrengthen its economy and bring new vitality to its proud history.\n  Paul's role in founding the Newport County Convention and Visitors \nBureau helped make Newport a world-class destination, and he led \nefforts to build a sister city relationship that endures today, between \nNewport and Kinsale, Ireland.\n  A loyal member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and former Grand \nMarshal of the Newport St. Patrick's Day Parade, Paul treasured his \nIrish heritage. He loved his family, his native city, and his ancestral \nIreland, I think in that order.\n  Paul was a deeply respected leader. In 27 consecutive years of \nservice in our General Assembly, his work as deputy chair of the Rhode \nIsland House Finance Committee, among many other posts, cemented Paul's \nreputation as a hard worker, an honest broker, and a skilled \nnegotiator.\n  Paul relentlessly dedicated those skills to improving education in \nRhode Island. He believed Rhode Island children deserved the best \neducation and he never compromised that commitment. He pushed schools \nand teachers to take responsibility for their students' successes and \nfailures, and he pushed the State to ensure that schools improved, from \naccountability measures to State aid for poorer districts. Paul was \nparticularly focused on middle schools, a concern he and I shared.\n  His legislative deeds are the shoulders on which education reform in \nRhode Island will stand for a generation. Paul was a friend especially \nto Senator Reed's colleague and mine in our delegation, Patrick \nKennedy. Paul befriended Patrick when they both served together in the \nGeneral Assembly. I know Paul watched with great pride as Patrick rose \nfirst in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, and later in \nCongress, where he has earned the great honor and responsibility now of \nserving on the House Appropriations Committee.\n  Paul will be so deeply missed. Hearts all over Rhode Island go out to \nPaul's family--his wife Diana, his daughter Meredith, his sons Matthew \nand Edward, and his entire family.\n  I join Senator Reed in offering my condolences, on behalf also of \nSandra, my wife, who worked with Paul in the legislature and who was so \nfond of him.\n  Newport, the city Paul loved, and the Ocean State, whose people he \nserved unselfishly and with great integrity, are lessened today because \nhe is no longer with us.\n  Paul, may the road rise up to meet you, and the wind be always at \nyour back. May the sun shine warm upon your face; may the rain fall \nsoft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may the Lord hold you \nin the palm of His hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12524-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12524-S12525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, hate crimes violate everything our \ncountry stands for. They send a loud and clear message to some of our \nfellow citizens that they are not welcome in our society. The Matthew \nShepard Hate Crimes Act, passed last week by the Senate as an amendment \nto the Defense authorization bill, makes clear that we will not stand \nby and allow our fellow citizens to be brutalized.\n  Enactment of such legislation is vitally important to the Arab-\nAmerican community, that has suffered a surge in hate crimes against \nthem in recent years because of 9/11. After the terrorist attacks that \nday, the FBI documented a ninefold increase in hate crimes against \npersons believed to be Arab or Muslim and a 130-percent increase in \nincidents directed on individuals because of their ethnic background or \nnational origin. When the terrorists attacked our Nation, they also \ndelivered a second attack against Americans who shared their ethnic \nbackground and religion but not their hate or violence.\n  In their recent publication, ``Report on Hate Crimes & Discrimination \nAgainst Arab Americans: The Post-September 11 Backlash (2003),'' the \nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee identified a number of \nconfirmed and suspected hate crime murders of Arab Americans and those \nperceived to be Arab or Muslim. In Mesa, AZ, Balbir Singh Sodhi, an \nIndian Sikh, was shot while he was planting flowers outside his Chevron \nstation. His murderer, Frank Roque, had spent the day drinking and \nraving about how he wanted to kill the ``rag heads'' responsible for \nthe terrorist attacks four days earlier. After being kicked out of a \nbar, Roque went on a shooting rampage. He first shot and killed Sodhi, \nand afterwards fired on the home of an Afghan family. He then fired \nseveral times at a Lebanese-American clerk, who, fortunately, escaped \ninjury. During his arrest he yelled, ``I am a patriot!'' and ``I stand \nfor America all the way!''\n  In Dallas, Waqar Hasan, a Pakistani Muslim, was shot in the face \nwhile cooking hamburgers in his grocery store. Mark Anthony Stroman \nconfessed on a Dallas radio program to the murder, saying he killed \nHasan and another man and shot a third person in revenge for the \nterrorist attacks. During an interview, Stroman confessed that he \nwanted to ``retaliate on local Arab Americans or whatever you want to \ncall them.'' He also added that he ``did what every American wanted to \ndo but didn't. They didn't have the nerve.'' Stroman was convicted and \nsentenced to death. In Lincoln Park, MI, Ali Almansoop, a U.S. citizen \noriginally from Yemen, was shot to death while fleeing his attacker. \nThe victim was asleep with his girlfriend when her ex-boyfriend broke \ninto her apartment and dragged him out of bed. According to his own \npolice confession and the woman's statements, he threatened, ``I'm \ngoing to kill you for what happened in NY and DC.'' The victim fled \noutside and was shot in the back trying to escape.\n  Several other incidents have also occurred that are suspected to be \nhate crime killings, including the murder of an Egyptian-American \ngrocery store owner, who was killed at work. He was confronted by two \nmen who shot him and rode off in a Honda driven by a third man, leaving \nthe money in the cash register intact.\n  In Reedley, CA, Abdo Ali Ahmed, a 50-year-old Arab-American store \nemployee, was shot several times and\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n\nkilled at work late one afternoon. Witnesses told detectives that they \nsaw four males leave the site in a white four-door sedan. No money or \nmerchandise was stolen. The employee had received threats since mid-\nSeptember.\n  In Minneapolis, a Somali man waiting at a bus stop was beaten \nunconscious and later died in the hospital. His son believes the \nassault was the result of an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, \nwhich reported that local Somalis might have inadvertently donated to \nan organization now linked to Osama bin Laden. In Los Angeles, Syrian-\nborn liquor storeowner, Ramez Younan, was shot to death behind his cash \nregister. Police said they had no suspects and no clear motive for the \nshooting and no money was stolen from the store. The Los Angeles Police \nDepartment found Younan's body but no witnesses.\n  These examples emphasize the need for effective legislation and the \nimportance of providing adequate resources to state and local law \nenforcement to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. Violent hate \ncrimes can't be tolerated. We can reverse the tide of hatred and \nbigotry, by sending a loud, clear message that hate crimes will be \npunished to the full extent of the law, and will not be tolerated \nagainst any member of society.\n  The Matthew Shepard Act is supported by a broad coalition of 210 law \nenforcement, civic, disability, religious and civil rights groups, \nincluding the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Anti-\nDefamation League, the Interfaith Alliance, the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, the Human Rights Campaign, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. All of these \ndiverse groups have come together to say now is the time for us to take \naction to protect our fellow citizens from the brutality of hate-\nmotivated violence. The Senate did just that last week, and we must do \nall we can to see that this urgently needed federal legislation is \nenacted into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I commend the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nCommittee for calling the Nation's attention to this serious problem, \nand I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from their recent report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee\n\n       Passing legislation to prevent hate crimes is also vitally \n     important to the Arab American community. Arab Americans have \n     experienced a surge in hate crimes directed against them over \n     the past several years. Following the September 11 terrorist \n     attacks on our nation, the FBI documented a 1,600 percent \n     increase in hate crimes against those perceived to be Arab or \n     Muslim and a 130 percent increase in incidents directed at \n     individuals on the basis of ethnicity or national origin. \n     When terrorists attacked our nation, they served a second \n     blow against Americans who shared their ethnicity and \n     religion but not their hate and violence.\n       Taken from the landmark report, Report on Hate Crimes & \n     Discrimination Against Arab-Americans: The Post-September 11 \n     Backlash (2003:69-70) produced by the American-Arab Anti-\n     Discrimination Committee Research Institute, the following \n     are examples of confirmed hate crime murders and those \n     suspected to be hate crime murders against Arab Americans and \n     those perceived to be Arab or Muslim. As hate crimes continue \n     against the community, ADCRI will issue their next report on \n     hate crimes in late fall 2007.\n\n                      confirmed hate crime murders\n\n       September 15--Mesa, AZ: 49-year-old Indian Sikh, Balbir \n     Singh Sodhi, was shot while planting flowers outside his \n     Chevron station. His murderer, 42-year-old Frank Roque, had \n     spent the day drinking and raving about how he wanted to kill \n     the ``rag heads'' responsible for the terrorist attacks four \n     days earlier.

He then \n     shot several times at a Lebanese-American clerk who escaped \n     injury. During his arrest he yelled, ``I am a patriot!'' and \n     ``I stand for America all the way!'' The U.S. Department of \n     Justice investigated the slaying as a hate crime murder.\n       September 15--Dallas, TX: 46-year-old Pakistani Muslim \n     Waqar Hasan was shot in the face while cooking hamburgers in \n     his grocery store. 32-year-old Mark Anthony Stroman, \n     confessed on a Dallas radio program to having committed the \n     murder, saying that he had killed Hasan and another man (see \n     below) and shot a third out of revenge for the terrorist \n     attacks (see also below) battery, September 21--Dallas, TX. \n     During the interview, Stroman confessed that he wanted to \n     ``retaliate on local Arab Americans or whatever you want to \n     call them.'' He also added that he ``did what every American \n     wanted to do but didn't. They didn't have the nerve.''

The victim fled outside and, as he was running, he \n     was shot in the back. The U.S. Department of Justice \n     investigated the slaying as a hate crime murder.\n       October 4--Mesquite, TX: Vasudev Patel, a 49-year-old \n     Indian gas station owner, was shot to death during an armed \n     robbery. His killer, Mark Anthony Stroman (see above), \n     initially explained that the killing resulted from the \n     robbery, but later gave a conflicting explanation, telling \n     police that he was motivated by vengeance for the terrorist \n     attacks. Stroman alleged that he had lost a relative in the \n     World Trade Center. A security camera recorded the armed \n     man walking into the station, ordering the owner to give \n     him all of the money before shooting him. Stroman then \n     attempted to open the cash register and failed. He then \n     fled without taking any of the money. (The Dallas Morning \n     News, 11/3/01) On April 4, 2002, Mark Anthony Stroman was \n     sentenced to death for this slaying.

Mr. President, for 10 years, I have advocated for \nstronger measures to ensure that America's nursing home residents \nreceive the quality of care they deserve. Currently, over 1.7 million \nAmericans live in nursing homes. This number will grow by leaps and \nbounds as the baby boomer\n\n[[Page S12526]]\n\ngeneration ages. Therefore, there has never been a more critical time \nto make sure that the Federal Government does all it can to protect the \nmost vulnerable among us from substandard care.\n  In late September, an article on the front page of the New York Times \nunderscored this issue and brought to light some troubling data. The \narticle, entitled ``At Many Homes, More Profit and Less Nursing,'' \nstudied the quality of care at investor-owned nursing homes. The \nfindings were alarming, to say the least.\n  Using numbers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nthe article compared several investor-owned nursing home chains to \nindustry-wide averages for several indicators. Here is what was found. \nThe investor-owned homes, on average, had fewer clinical registered \nnurses per resident and higher numbers of serious health deficiencies. \nThe article also reported that, in some cases, long-stay residents in \nthese investor-owned homes suffered from higher rates of deterioration \nin their condition.\n  I would like to highlight one case in particular. Following its \npurchase by a large investment firm, one nursing home cut its number of \nclinical registered nurses in half. Budgets for nursing supplies, \nresident activities, and other services were also cut. Investor profits \nsoared and resident care plummeted. Indeed, visits by regulators found \nfire exits that didn't work, dirty kitchens, and other health and \nsafety violations. Fifteen residents died in 3 years due to negligent \ncare, according to their families.\n  Our elderly and disabled nursing home residents our own grandparents, \nmothers, fathers, and other loved ones deserve better.\n  Is this a case of profits before care? Well, I am not sure. But I \ncertainly intend to look into it. I intend to investigate allegations \nthat some large investment firms are buying up nursing homes across the \ncountry and are hurting quality of care. And as a result, achieving, as \nthe New York Times said, ``More profit and less nursing.''\n  And let's not forget that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices shoulder some responsibility for these problems too CMS needs \nto do a better job of protecting seniors in our Nation's nursing homes \nand I am going follow up with them to see what they have to say.\n  So I say to my fellow Senators, we must do what is necessary to \nprotect America's nursing home residents. We need to closely examine \nthis matter. I plan to take a very active role in looking at this issue \nand will be speaking with nursing homes, equity firms, and to CMS. We \nowe it to America's nursing home residents and we owe it to their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referrd earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 23, 2007]\n\n              At Many Homes, More Profit and Less Nursing\n\n                          (By Charles Duhigg)\n\n       Habana Health Care Center, a 150-bed nursing home in Tampa, \n     Fla., was struggling when a group of large private investment \n     firms purchased it and 48 other nursing homes in 2002.\n       The facility's managers quickly cut costs. Within months, \n     the number of clinical registered nurses at the home was half \n     what it had been a year earlier, records collected by the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicate. Budgets \n     for nursing supplies, resident activities and other services \n     also fell, according to Florida's Agency for Health Care \n     Administration.\n       The investors and operators were soon earning millions of \n     dollars a year from their 49 homes.\n       Residents fared less well. Over three years, 15 at Habana \n     died from what their families contend was negligent care in \n     lawsuits filed in state court. Regulators repeatedly warned \n     the home that staff levels were below mandatory minimums. \n     When regulators visited, they found malfunctioning fire \n     doors, unhygienic kitchens and a resident using a leg brace \n     that was broken.\n       ``They've created a hellhole,'' said Vivian Hewitt, who \n     sued Habana in 2004 when her mother died after a large \n     bedsore became infected by feces.\n       Habana is one of thousands of nursing homes across the \n     nation that large Wall Street investment companies have \n     bought or agreed to acquire in recent years.\n       Those investors include prominent private equity firms like \n     Warburg Pincus and the Carlyle Group, better known for buying \n     companies like Dunkin' Donuts.\n       As such investors have acquired nursing homes, they have \n     often reduced costs, increased profits and quickly resold \n     facilities for significant gains.\n       But by many regulatory benchmarks, residents at those \n     nursing homes are worse off, on average, than they were under \n     previous owners, according to an analysis by The New York \n     Times of data collected by government agencies from 2000 to \n     2006.\n       The Times analysis shows that, as at Habana, managers at \n     many other nursing homes acquired by large private investors \n     have cut expenses and staff, sometimes below minimum legal \n     requirements.\n       Regulators say residents at these homes have suffered. At \n     facilities owned by private investment firms, residents on \n     average have fared more poorly than occupants of other homes \n     in common problems like depression, loss of mobility and loss \n     of ability to dress and bathe themselves, according to data \n     collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n       The typical nursing home acquired by a large investment \n     company before 2006 scored worse than national rates in 12 of \n     14 indicators that regulators use to track ailments of long-\n     term residents. Those ailments include bedsores and easily \n     preventable infections, as well as the need to be \n     restrained. Before they were acquired by private \n     investors, many of those homes scored at or above national \n     averages in similar measurements.\n       In the past, residents' families often responded to such \n     declines in care by suing, and regulators levied heavy fines \n     against nursing home chains where understaffing led to lapses \n     in care.\n       But private investment companies have made it very \n     difficult for plaintiffs to succeed in court and for \n     regulators to levy chainwide fines by creating complex \n     corporate structures that obscure who controls their nursing \n     homes.\n       By contrast, publicly owned nursing home chains are \n     essentially required to disclose who controls their \n     facilities in securities filings and other regulatory \n     documents.\n       The Byzantine structures established at homes owned by \n     private investment firms also make it harder for regulators \n     to know if one company is responsible for multiple centers. \n     And the structures help managers bypass rules that require \n     them to report when they, in effect, pay themselves from \n     programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n       Investors in these homes say such structures are common in \n     other businesses and have helped them revive an industry that \n     was on the brink of widespread bankruptcy.\n       ``Lawyers were convincing nursing home residents to sue \n     over almost anything,'' said Arnold M. Whitman, a principal \n     with the fund that bought Habana in 2002, Formation \n     Properties I.\n       Homes were closing because of ballooning litigation costs, \n     he said. So investors like Mr. Whitman created corporate \n     structures that insulated them from costly lawsuits, \n     according to his company.\n       ``We should be recognized for supporting this industry when \n     almost everyone else was running away,'' Mr. Whitman said in \n     an interview.\n       Some families of residents say those structures unjustly \n     protect investors who profit while care declines.\n       When Mrs. Hewitt sued Habana over her mother's death, for \n     example, she found that its owners and managers had spread \n     control of Habana among 15 companies and five layers of \n     firms.\n       As a result, Mrs. Hewitt's lawyer, like many others \n     confronting privately owned homes, has been unable to \n     establish definitively who was responsible for her mother's \n     care.\n       Current staff members at Habana declined to comment. \n     Formation Properties I said it owned only Habana's real \n     estate and leased it to an independent company, and thus bore \n     no responsibility for resident care.\n       That independent company--Florida Health Care Properties, \n     which eventually became Epsilon Health Care Properties and \n     subleased the home's operation to Tampa Health Care \n     Associates--is affiliated with Warburg Pincus, one of the \n     world's largest private equity firms. Warburg Pincus, Florida \n     Health Care, Epsilon and Tampa Health Care all declined to \n     comment.\n\n\n                        Demand for Nursing Homes\n\n       The graying of America has presented financial \n     opportunities for all kinds of businesses. Nursing homes, \n     which received more than $75 billion last year from taxpayer \n     programs like Medicare and Medicaid, offer some of the \n     biggest rewards.\n       ``There's essentially unlimited consumer demand as the baby \n     boomers age,'' said Ronald E. Silva, president and chief \n     executive of Fillmore Capital Partners, which paid $1.8 \n     billion last year to buy one of the nation's largest nursing \n     home chains. ``I've never seen a surer bet.''\n       For years, investors shunned nursing home companies as the \n     industry was battered by bankruptcies, expensive lawsuits and \n     regulatory investigations.\n       But in recent years, large private investment groups have \n     agreed to buy 6 of the nation's 10 largest nursing home \n     chains, containing over 141,000 beds, or 9 percent of the \n     nation's total. Private investment groups own at least \n     another 60,000 beds at smaller chains and are expected to \n     acquire many more companies as firms come under shareholder \n     pressure to sell.\n\n[[Page S12527]]\n\n       The typical large chain owned by an investment company in \n     2005 earned $1,700 a resident, according to reports filed by \n     the facilities. Those homes, on average, were 41 percent more \n     profitable than the average facility.\n       But, as in the case of Habana, cutting costs has become an \n     issue at homes owned by large investment groups.\n       ``The first thing owners do is lay off nurses and other \n     staff that are essential to keeping patients safe,'' said \n     Charlene Harrington, a professor at the University of \n     California in San Francisco who studies nursing homes. In her \n     opinion, she added, ``chains have made a lot of money by \n     cutting nurses, but it's at the cost of human lives.''\n       The Times's analysis of records collected by the Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Services reveals that at 60 percent \n     of homes bought by large private equity groups from 2000 to \n     2006, managers have cut the number of clinical registered \n     nurses, sometimes far below levels required by law. (At 19 \n     percent of those homes, staffing has remained relatively \n     constant, though often below national averages. At 21 \n     percent, staffing rose significantly, though even those homes \n     were typically below national averages.) During that period, \n     staffing at many of the nation's other homes has fallen much \n     less or grown.\n       Nurses are often residents' primary medical providers. In \n     2002, the Department of Health and Human Services said most \n     nursing home residents needed at least 1.3 hours of care a \n     day from a registered or licensed practical nurse. The \n     average home was close to meeting that standard last year, \n     according to data.\n       But homes owned by large investment companies typically \n     provided only one hour of care a day, according to The \n     Times's analysis of records collected by the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n       For the most highly trained nurses, staffing was \n     particularly low: Homes owned by large private investment \n     firms provided one clinical registered nurse for every 20 \n     residents, 35 percent below the national average, the \n     analysis showed.\n       Regulators with state and federal health care agencies have \n     cited those staffing deficiencies alongside some cases where \n     residents died from accidental suffocation, injuries or \n     other medical emergencies.\n       Federal and state regulators also said in interviews that \n     such cuts help explain why serious quality-of-care \n     deficiencies--like moldy food and the restraining of \n     residents for long periods or the administration of wrong \n     medications--rose at every large nursing home chain after it \n     was acquired by a private investment group from 2000 to 2006, \n     even as citations declined at many other homes and chains.\n       The typical number of serious health deficiencies cited by \n     regulators last year was almost 19 percent higher at homes \n     owned by large investment companies than the national \n     average, according to analysis of Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services records.\n       (The Times's analysis of trends did not include Genesis \n     HealthCare, which was acquired earlier this year, or HCR \n     Manor Care, which the Carlyle Group is buying, because \n     sufficient data were not available.)\n       Representatives of all the investment groups that bought \n     nursing home chains since 2000--Warburg Pincus, Formation, \n     National Senior Care, Fillmore Capital Partners and the \n     Carlyle Group--were offered the data and findings from the \n     Times analysis. All but one declined to comment.\n       An executive with a company owned by Fillmore Capital, \n     which acquired 342 homes last year, said that because some \n     data regarding the company were missing or collected before \n     its acquisition, The Times's analysis was not a complete \n     portrayal of current conditions. That executive, Jack \n     MacDonald, also said that it was too early to evaluate the \n     new management, that the staff numbers at homes over all was \n     rising and that quality had improved by some measures.\n       ``We are focused on becoming a better organization today \n     than we were 18 months ago,'' he said. ``We are confident \n     that we will be an even better organization in the future.''\n\n\n                        A Web of Responsibility\n\n       Vivian Hewitt's mother, Alice Garcia, was 81 and suffering \n     from Alzheimer's disease when, in late 2002, she moved into \n     Habana.\n       ``I couldn't take care of her properly anymore, and Habana \n     seemed like a really nice place,'' Mrs. Hewitt said.\n       Earlier that year, Formation bought Habana, 48 other \n     nursing homes and four assisted living centers from Beverly \n     Enterprises, one of the nation's largest chains, for $165 \n     million.\n       Formation immediately leased many of the homes, including \n     Habana, to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus. That firm spread \n     management of the homes among dozens of other corporations, \n     according to documents filed with Florida agencies and \n     depositions from lawsuits.\n       Each home was operated by a separate company. Other \n     companies helped choose staff, keep the books and negotiate \n     for equipment and supplies. Some companies had no employees \n     or offices, which let executives file regulatory documents \n     without revealing their other corporate affiliations.\n       Habana's managers increased occupancy, and cut expenses by \n     laying off about 10 of 30 clinical administrators and nurses, \n     Medicare filings reveal. (After regulators complained, some \n     positions were refilled and other spending increased.) Soon, \n     Medicare regulators cited Habana for malfunctioning fire \n     doors and moldy air vents.\n       Throughout that period, Formation and the Warburg Pincus \n     affiliate received rent and fees that were directly tied to \n     Habana's revenues, interviews and regulatory filings show. As \n     the home's fiscal health improved, those payments grew. In \n     total, they exceeded $3.5 million by last year. The companies \n     also profited from the other 48 homes.\n       Though spending cuts improved the home's bottom line, they \n     raised concerns among regulators and staff.\n       ``Those owners wouldn't let us hire people,'' said Annie \n     Thornton, who became interim director of nursing around the \n     time Habana was acquired, and who left about a year later. \n     ``We told the higher-ups we needed more staffing, but they \n     said we should make do.''\n       Regulators typically visit nursing homes about once a year. \n     But in the 12 months after Formation's acquisition of Habana, \n     they visited an average of once a month, often in response to \n     residents' complaints. The home was cited for failing to \n     follow doctors' orders, cutting staff below legal minimums, \n     blocking emergency exits, storing food in unhygienic areas \n     and other health violations.\n       Soon after, nursing home inspectors wrote in Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services documents that Habana was at \n     fault when a resident suffocated because his tracheotomy tube \n     became clogged. Although he had complained of shortness of \n     breath, there were no records showing that staff had checked \n     on him for almost two days.\n       Those citations never mentioned Formation, Warburg Pincus \n     or its affiliates. Warburg Pincus and its affiliates declined \n     to discuss the citations. Formation said it was merely a \n     landlord.\n       ``Formation Properties owns real estate and leases it to an \n     unaffiliated third party that obtains a license to operate it \n     as a health care facility,'' Formation said. ``No citation \n     would mention Formation Properties since it has no \n     involvement or control over the operations at the facility or \n     any entity that is involved in such operations.''\n       For Mrs. Hewitt's mother, problems began within months of \n     moving in as she suffered repeated falls.\n       ``I would call and call and call them to come to her room \n     to change her diaper or help me move her, but they would \n     never come,'' Mrs. Hewitt recalled.\n       Five months later, Mrs. Hewitt discovered that her mother \n     had a large bedsore on her back that was oozing pus. Mrs. \n     Garcia was rushed to the hospital. A physician later said the \n     wound should have been detected much earlier, according to \n     medical records submitted as part of a lawsuit Mrs. Hewitt \n     filed in a Florida Circuit Court.\n       Three weeks later, Mrs. Garcia died.\n       ``I feel so guilty,'' Mrs. Hewitt said. ``But there was no \n     way for me to find out how bad that place really was.''\n\n\n                          death and a lawsuit\n\n       Within a few months, Mrs. Hewitt decided to sue the nursing \n     home.\n       ``The only way I can send a message is to hit them in their \n     pocketbook, to make it too expensive to let people like my \n     mother suffer,'' she said.\n       But when Mrs. Hewitt's lawyer, Sumeet Kaul, began \n     investigating Habana's corporate structure, he discovered \n     that its complexity meant that even if she prevailed in \n     court, the investors' wallets would likely be out of reach.\n       Others had tried and failed. In response to dozens of \n     lawsuits, Formation and affiliates of Warburg Pincus had \n     successfully argued in court that they were not nursing home \n     operators, and thus not liable for deficiencies in care.\n       Formation said in a statement that it was not reasonable to \n     hold the company responsible for residents, ``any more, say, \n     than it would be reasonable for a landlord who owns a \n     building, one of whose tenants is Starbucks, to be held \n     liable if a Starbucks customer is scalded by a cup of hot \n     coffee.''\n       Formation, Warburg Pincus and its affiliates all declined \n     to answer questions regarding Mrs. Hewitt's lawsuit.\n       Advocates for nursing home reforms say anyone who profits \n     from a facility should be held accountable for its care.\n       ``Private equity is buying up this industry and then hiding \n     the assets,'' said Toby S. Edelman, a nursing home expert \n     with the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that \n     counsels people on Medicare. ``And now residents are dying, \n     and there is little the courts or regulators can do.''\n       Mrs. Hewitt's lawyer has spent three years and $30,000 \n     trying to prove that an affiliate of Warburg Pincus might be \n     responsible for Mrs. Garcia's care. He has not named \n     Formation or Warburg Pincus as defendants. A judge is \n     expected to rule on some of his arguments this year.\n       Complex corporate structures have dissuaded scores of other \n     lawyers from suing nursing homes.\n       About 70 percent of lawyers who once sued homes have \n     stopped because the cases became too expensive or difficult, \n     estimates Nathan P. Carter, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Florida.\n       ``In one case, I had to sue 22 different companies,'' he \n     said. ``In another, I got a $400,000 verdict and ended up \n     collecting only $25,000.''\n       Regulators have also been stymied.\n       For instance, Florida's Agency for Health Care \n     Administration has named Habana and\n\n[[Page S12528]]\n\n     34 other homes owned by Formation and operated by affiliates \n     of Warburg Pincus as among the state's worst in categories \n     like ``nutrition and hydration,'' ``restraints and abuse'' \n     and ``quality of care.'' Those homes have been individually \n     cited for violations of safety codes, but there have been no \n     chainwide investigations or fines, because regulators were \n     unaware that all the facilities were owned and operated by a \n     common group, said Molly McKinstry, bureau chief for long-\n     term-care services at Florida's Agency for Health Care \n     Administration.\n       And even when regulators do issue fines to investor-owned \n     homes, they have found penalties difficult to collect.\n       ``These companies leave the nursing home licensee with no \n     assets, and so there is nothing to take,'' said Scott \n     Johnson, special assistant attorney general of \n     Mississippi.\n       Government authorities are also frequently unaware when \n     nursing homes pay large fees to affiliates.\n       For example, Habana, operated by a Warburg Pincus \n     affiliate, paid other Warburg Pincus affiliates an estimated \n     $558,000 for management advice and other services last year, \n     according to reports the home filed.\n       Government programs require nursing homes to reveal when \n     they pay affiliates so that such disbursements can be \n     scrutinized to make sure they are not artificially inflated.\n       However, complex corporate structures make such scrutiny \n     difficult. Regulators did not know that so many of Habana's \n     payments went to companies affiliated with Warburg Pincus.\n       ``The government tries to make sure homes are paying a fair \n     market value for things like rent and consulting and \n     supplies,'' said John Villegas-Grubbs, a Medicaid expert who \n     has developed payment systems for several states. ``But when \n     home owners pay themselves without revealing it, they can pad \n     their bills. It's not feasible to expect regulators to catch \n     that unless they have transparency on ownership structures.''\n       Formation and Warburg Pincus both declined to discuss \n     disclosure issues.\n       Groups lobbying to increase transparency at nursing homes \n     say complicated corporate structures should be outlawed. One \n     idea popular among organizations like the National Citizens' \n     Coalition for Nursing Home Reform is requiring the company \n     that owns a home's most valuable assets, its land and \n     building, to manage it. That would put owners at risk if care \n     declines.\n       But owners say that tying a home's property to its \n     operation would make it impossible to operate in leased \n     facilities, and exacerbate a growing nationwide nursing home \n     shortage.\n       Moreover, investors say, they deserve credit for rebuilding \n     an industry on the edge of widespread insolvency.\n       ``Legal and regulatory costs were killing this industry,'' \n     said Mr. Whitman, the Formation executive.\n       For instance, Beverly Enterprises, which also had a history \n     of regulatory problems, sold Habana and the rest of its \n     Florida centers to Formation because, it said at the time, of \n     rising litigation costs. AON Risk Consultants, a research \n     company, says the average cost of nursing home litigation in \n     Florida during that period had increased 270 percent in five \n     years.\n       ``Lawyers were suing nursing homes because they knew the \n     companies were worth billions of dollars, so we made the \n     companies smaller and poorer, and the lawsuits have \n     diminished,'' Mr. Whitman said. This year, another fund \n     affiliated with Mr. Whitman and other investors acquired the \n     nation's third-largest nursing home chain, Genesis \n     HealthCare, for $1.5 billion.\n       If investors are barred from setting up complex structures, \n     ``this industry makes no economic sense,'' Mr. Whitman said. \n     ``If nursing home owners are forced to operate at a loss, the \n     entire industry will disappear.''\n       However, advocates for nursing home reforms say investors \n     exaggerate the industry's precariousness. Last year, \n     Formation sold Habana and 185 other facilities to General \n     Electric for $1.4 billion. A prominent nursing home industry \n     analyst, Steve Monroe, estimates that Formation's and its co-\n     investors' gains from that sale were more than $500 million \n     in just four years. Formation declined to comment on that \n     figure.\n\n\n                           Analyzing the Data\n\n       For this article, The New York Times analyzed trends at \n     nursing homes purchased by private investment groups by \n     examining data available from the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services.\n       The Times examined more than 1,200 nursing homes purchased \n     by large private investment groups since 2000, and more than \n     14,000 other homes. The analysis compared investor-owned \n     homes against national averages in multiple categories, \n     including complaints received by regulators, health and \n     safety violations cited by regulators, fines levied by state \n     and federal authorities, the performance of homes as reported \n     in a national database known as the Minimum Data Set \n     Repository and the performance of homes as reported in the \n     Online Survey, Certification and Reporting database.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12528-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nsubmit for the Record an article published today in the Miami Herald \nregarding the situation in Cuba. The article captures the situation \nimposed on the Cuban people by the authoritarian rule of the Castro \nbrothers, as well as challenges the international community to stand \nfirm in its commitment to true democratic change in Cuba. For decades \nFidel Castro, and now his brother Raul, have deprived the Cuban people \nof freedom and the hope of a better future. It is clear that Cuba finds \nitself in a time of transition, yet surely the Castro brothers will do \neverything in their power to ensure that the system of repression that \nthey have built up for the past half century will remain in place \nwhenever Fidel Castro passes away. For this reason, it is incumbent on \nall of us who aspire for a free and democratic Cuba to ensure that this \nmoment of opportunity for democratic change on the island is not lost.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objcection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Appeasing the Castros Will Backfire\n\n                           (By Frank Calzon)\n\n       The ``Stockholm syndrome'' describes the phenomenon of \n     hostages who identify, cooperate with and, finally, defend \n     their kidnappers. The longer they are held, the more victims \n     are likely to be affected by the syndrome, because they are \n     totally dependent on their abusers. The control over every \n     aspect of life convinces the victim that he or she is alone, \n     there will be no help from others; resistance is useless and \n     only makes things worse.\n       That's the kind of control Fidel Castro, and now his \n     brother Raul, exercise in Cuba.\n       There, everything comes from Castro and his government. The \n     regime wants the Cuban people to believe they have no other \n     friends. And, alas, even foreign diplomats and their \n     dependents stationed in Havana begin after time to feel this \n     intimidating dependency and to become reluctant to protest \n     outrages directed at them because ``it only results in more \n     abuse.''\n       Castro's abuse--his ability to order windows smashed or \n     call out street demonstrations--becomes ``revenge'' for \n     inviting unapproved Cuban guests to the embassy, for reaching \n     out to engage ordinary Cubans in ways not preapproved by \n     Castro's government.\n       Foreign observers in Cuba seem to have great difficulty \n     imagining what the regime will do next. One reason why is \n     that they keep looking for logical reasons to explain the \n     regime's actions. Yet the reality is that much of what has \n     happened in Cuba over the last 50 years cannot be explained, \n     except as the whim of a man whose only goal is to be in \n     control of everything Cuban. Castro has a lot in common with \n     Stalin.\n       The Castro regime simply deems any independent action--\n     however small--to be a challenge to its totalitarian control. \n     Thus, inviting Cuba's political dissidents to an embassy \n     event is ``a hostile act.'' To give a short-wave radio to a \n     Cuban national is, curiously enough, ``a violation of human \n     rights.'' Any Cuban daring to voice support for change in \n     Cuba is ``a paid agent'' of the United States.\n       What to do in a situation such as this? The principle that \n     should guide foreign governments is that they should show \n     Cubans that they have friends on the outside.\n       Foreign governments can start by, at the very least, always \n     insisting on reciprocity in the freedom allowed Castro's \n     diplomats and embassies to operate in their capitals. This is \n     not what happened. Foreign missions--America's among them--\n     accede to Castro's restrictions on how their diplomats and \n     embassies function in Cuba.\n       Cuba's diplomats take full advantage of their freedoms in \n     the U.S. capital. They attend congressional hearings, have \n     access to the American media, develop relationships with \n     businessmen and ``progressive'' activists, host student \n     groups, speak at universities and enjoy tax-exempt status. \n     Yet U.S. diplomats in Cuba have no similar privileges in \n     Havana. They are subject to petty harassments. The Cuban \n     government goes so far as to detain shipping containers of \n     supplies sent to the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba and has \n     broken into the U.S. diplomatic pouch.\n       Attempting to appease Cuba's kidnappers will backfire, as \n     it always has. It is instructive that the refugee crises in \n     1980 and 1994, which involved 125,000 and 30,000 Cubans \n     respectively, and the 1996 murder of Brothers to the Rescue \n     crews over the Florida Straits occurred at times when \n     Washington actually was trying to improve relations.\n       Eventually, Cuba's long nightmare will end. If governments \n     around the world would also shake free of ``the Havana \n     Syndrome,'' they might hasten Cuba's democratic awakening.\n       Fidel and Raul Castro will attempt to turn their day of \n     reckoning into a negotiation with Washington--a negotiation \n     excluding dissidents and exiles. Yet it is Cubans who must \n     decide the fate of Cuba. All evidence indicates that \n     President Bush will remain firm. If the Department of State \n     does not flinch, Cuba's interim president and new leaders \n     will have to talk with and listen to their political \n     opponents. That is what democracy means and that is what the \n     world community should boldly support today.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12529-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12529]]\n                      RETIREMENT OF GEN PETER PACE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on Monday, GEN Peter Pace completed his term \nas Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A highly decorated officer, \nGEN Peter Pace was the first Marine officer to serve as Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff in our Nation's history.\n  General Pace graduated the U.S. Naval Academy in 1967. After \ncompleting the Basic School in 1968, he deployed to Vietnam as a marine \nrifle platoon commander. After Vietnam, General Pace served overseas in \nThailand, South Korea, Japan, and Somalia.\n  His style as a humble commander, selflessly dedicated to his \nobligations, brought accolades from both superior officers and enlisted \nsoldiers. General Pace has held command at nearly every level, and \nexcelled in all respects in the uniformed service of his country.\n  As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Pace served as an \nadviser to the President a role he conducted with unquestionable \nprofessionalism. As a confidential advisor and military man, General \nPace did his utmost to steer clear of the public disputes and political \nbattles that so often afflict Washington decisionmaking.\n  General Pace's professional conduct, through a period of time marked \nby new and uniquely difficult tribulations, is a model for those to \ncome. A strong voice for providing security to Iraq's population and \nholding areas cleared of terrorists, General Pace's counsel has played \na role in building consensus for the military strategy that is \nproducing successes on the ground in Iraq. It should be noted that \nGeneral Pace assumed his duties in the face of a rising insurgency in \nIraq. He leaves office with a successful strategy in place, an \nimproving situation in Iraq, and troop draw downs taking place due to \nprogress on the ground. In short, he has left his office in better \ncondition than it was when he entered it. For his exemplary service he \nhas earned the gratitude of a safer, more secure Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12529-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROY SCUDERI\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I bring to the attention of \nthis body and the Nation the remarkable service of Roy Scuderi. For \nover 18 years, Roy has served A Presidential Classroom for Young \nAmericans with diligence, dedication and commitment. Roy has helped \nmake Presidential Classroom the premiere civic education program for \nhigh school students in America.\n  On October 5, 2007, Roy Scuderi will retire from his position as \nchief financial officer and vice president of this national nonprofit \norganization. In his role, Roy has established financial projections, \noverseen investments, negotiated contracts, and facilitated the annual \naudits--all of this done with professionalism and integrity.\n  Roy Scuderi's commitment to Presidential Classroom's success and \nperformance has inspired the well-deserved trust and affection of the \nboard members and his colleagues. His judgment has improved every \naspect of Presidential Classroom. Roy's daily efforts to ensure the \nprogram's quality and viability have sustained a record of unmatched \ndedication and achievement over the course of the organization's nearly \n40-year history.\n  I have had the personal honor and privilege as a board member, \nchairman of the board, and now as honorary board member of Presidential \nClassroom to work closely with Roy Scuderi throughout his entire career \nwith Presidential Classroom.\n  Presidential Classroom is stronger as a result of Roy's dedication \nand commitment to the classroom. Throughout his 18 years, the staff and \nboard members of Presidential Classroom have relied on Roy Scuderi for \nhis outstanding leadership and service.\n  Today, we salute Roy Scuderi for the central role that he has played \nin helping Presidential Classroom fulfill its mission of inspiring and \nchallenging the leaders of tomorrow to devote their talents and \nenergies in the service of our constitutional government on behalf of a \nbetter nation and a better world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12529-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARTHA ANNE DOW\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, famed educator Henry Adams once \nsaid, ``a teacher affects eternity. They never know where their \ninfluence will stop.'' I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Martha Anne Dow, \nwho passed away on September 29 after a courageous battle with breast \ncancer. Martha Anne had served for the past 9 years as president of the \nOregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls, OR. In that position--\nand throughout her career--she had a positive impact on countless \nlives. Her influence will truly continue for generations and \ngenerations to come.\n  Martha Anne came to the Oregon Institute of Technology after teaching \nfor more than a quarter century in the fields of biology, microbiology, \nenvironmental science, and water quality. She served for 6 years as \nprovost and vice president for Academic Affairs at OIT and moved into \nthe president's office in May of 1998.\n  I had the privilege of meeting President Dow on several occasions and \nwas always impressed with her intelligence, enthusiasm, and vision for \nOIT. Her leadership transformed the institute, expanding the \nengineering, computer science, and renewable energy programs.\n  President Dow's greatest passion was, perhaps, for the health care \nfield. She realized the shortage of health care professionals in Oregon \nand across our country, and she believed that OIT could help.\n  Through her leadership, OIT expanded their health care training \nprograms with the goal of doubling the number of students in training \nfor health care professions. Included in this expansion was the \nconstruction of a new center showcasing the most modern, \ntechnologically advanced equipment available. The first wing of the new \nfacility opened on September 12 in Klamath Falls. In her honor, the \nbuilding was officially named the ``Martha Anne Dow Oregon Center for \nHealth Professions.''\n  As she battled breast cancer, President Dow would often ask medical \ntechnicians providing her treatment where they had received their \ntraining. She was very proud to hear that many had been trained at OIT, \nin the very programs she helped to expand.\n  Those professionals, and countless more to follow, are Martha Anne \nDow's legacy. And I am proud to say her legacy will truly affect \neternity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12529-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12529-S12530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2003.

    By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2133. A bill to authorize bankruptcy courts to take certain \nactions with respect to mortgage loans in bankruptcy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S12534]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce the \nHomeowners' Mortgage and Equity Savings Act of 2007. In recent years, \nlow interest rates and easily available credit have significantly \nincreased home ownership in this country. The U.S. home ownership rate \nincreased from 64 percent in 1994 to over 69 percent in 2004. The \nincrease has been particularly dramatic among minority groups. During \nthat same period, the home ownership rate among Hispanics and Latinos \nrose by around 20 percent, to nearly 50 percent. For African Americans, \nthe rate rose by 14 percent, also nearing 50 percent.\n  However, with interest rates at all-time lows, lenders increasingly \noffered mortgages to those who previously either would not have \nqualified for a mortgage or could not have afforded the payments on a \nmortgage. To do this, lenders offered new types of mortgages designed \nto keep monthly payments low, at least in the short term. In \nparticular, lenders issued large numbers of adjustable rate mortgages, \n``ARMS'', loans that often feature low introductory interest rates that \nlater adjust to significantly higher rates. Lenders also issued no-\ndown-payment or interest-only mortgages, which also often featured low \nintroductory interest rates that later increase significantly.\n  With the era of easy money and low interest rates over, a crisis \nlooms. Many borrowers with adjustable rate, interest-only or no-down-\npayment mortgages have been unable to keep up with their monthly \nmortgage payments that have reset to higher rates. In many cases, \nresetting interest rates means monthly payments increase by $250 to \n$300 on a typical $1,200 monthly mortgage. Moreover, many ARMS featured \nearly repayment penalties, making it difficult for homeowners to fix \nthe situation by refinancing and obtaining less risky mortgages.\n  As a result of resetting interest rates, delinquencies and \nforeclosures involving ARMs have risen dramatically. Delinquencies and \nforeclosures have been particularly high among borrowers with weak \ncredit who were issued loans at subprime rates. According to the \nMortgage Bankers Association, between the second quarter of 2006 and \nthe second quarter of this year, the percentage of homeowners with \nsubprime ARMs who are seriously delinquent, those who are either more \nthan 90 days past due or in foreclosure, has nearly doubled, from 6.52 \nto 12.40 percent. The number rose by over 20 percent during the second \nquarter of this year alone. The Center for Responsible Lending projects \nthat 2.2 million Americans with subprime loans originated between 1998 \nand 2006 have lost or will lose their home to foreclosure.\n\n  While the situation has been most severe for homeowners with subprime \nloans, the problem now is spreading to those with prime rate loans. In \nthe past year, the percentage of homeowners with prime rate ARMs that \nwere seriously delinquent on their mortgage payments more than doubled \nfrom 0.92 to 2.02 percent. According to the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation, in the second quarter of this year, the number of \nhomeowners who got foreclosure notices reached an all time high of 0.65 \npercent, largely because of increases among homeowners with ARMs, \ndelinquencies and foreclosures for fixed rates mortgages have increased \nonly moderately. The situation will only get worse in coming months as \nan estimated 2 million homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages see \ntheir interest rates reset to much higher rates. According to some \nsources, a quarter of those homeowners face losing their homes.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, the number of homeowners with \nsubprime ARMs who are seriously delinquent has risen to 13.82 percent, \nan increase of over 40 percent since this time last year. Among \nhomeowners who qualified for prime rate ARMs, the number who are \nseriously delinquent has increased to 2.43 percent, an increase of over \n50 percent since last year. Especially hard hit is the Allentown-\nBethlehem-Easton area, where the foreclosure rate for subprime loans \noriginated in 2006 is 20 percent.\n  In some cases, borrowers made bad decisions by ignoring the risk and \ntaking on mortgages they knew someday they might not be able to afford. \nIn other cases, it appears that borrowers were steered to riskier \nmortgages when they qualified for safer options. There is also evidence \nthat lenders failed to fully disclose the risks involved with certain \nmortgages and instead emphasized low monthly payments. The push to \nissue subprime and adjustable rate mortgages was aggravated by Wall \nStreet investors chasing high rates of return on the secondary market.\n  Many homeowners facing foreclosure will seek relief in bankruptcy. \nBankruptcy has traditionally provided a second chance for borrowers by \ngiving them relief from their creditors. Chapter 13 in particular has \nenabled homeowners facing foreclosure to keep their homes. Chapter 13 \ngives debtors breathing space by imposing a stay on collection of \ndebts, including mortgages, which prevents lenders from foreclosing for \na period of time. During that time, debtors are given an opportunity to \nget caught up on their mortgage payments. Finally, Chapter 13 makes it \nmore likely that debtors will be able to make their mortgage payments \nover the long term by giving them a discharge from many of their other \ndebts.\n  However, the drafters of the bankruptcy code never anticipated the \ncurrent crisis where so many face possible bankruptcy, not because of \nconsumer debts, but because of their mortgages. When the current \nbankruptcy code was drafted in the late 1970s, most homeowners had \ntraditional 30-year fixed rate mortgages with substantial down \npayments. As a result, few homeowners faced bankruptcy because of their \nmortgage. As such, the drafters did not see a need for bankruptcy \njudges to have the power to alter the terms of mortgages on primary \nresidences.\n  Given the fact that so many homeowners now face foreclosure and \npossible bankruptcy because of their mortgages, I believe Congress \nshould take action. I am therefore introducing a targeted bill which \nwill allow bankruptcy courts to provide relief to homeowners caught up \nin the current crisis. The bill will provide relief for low-income \nhomeowners who, because of changed circumstances, can no longer afford \ntheir mortgages. Easily available credit made homeownership a reality \nfor many lower income Americans. It is these same homeowners who are \nthe ones now caught up in the credit crunch and facing the loss of \ntheir homes.\n  The bill will allow bankruptcy judges to provide relief by \nrestructuring the mortgage terms that have created the biggest problems \nfor homeowners. Most importantly, the bill will allow bankruptcy judges \nto prevent or delay interest rate increases as well as to roll back \ninterest rates that have already reset. This will make it possible for \nmany more debtors to hold onto their homes in the long run.\n  The bill also will allow bankruptcy judges to waive early repayment \nor prepayment penalties. Many lenders impose large penalties on \nhomeowners that repay their mortgages early, penalties that prevent \nmany homeowners from refinancing and switching to a sounder mortgage. \nThese penalties are particularly egregious since they don't reflect any \nincreased risk taken on by the lender. They are merely intended to \ndiscourage borrowers from making a better choice for themselves by \nswitching to another loan.\n  This bill is not a bailout and it is not aimed at those who knew the \nrisk and proceeded anyway. When housing prices were rising, speculators \nbid up the prices of homes hoping to quickly sell them for an easy \nprofit. With prices falling, many of those speculators find themselves \nwith properties worth less than what they paid. These speculators took \nthe risk that housing prices would fall and now must live with the \ndownside of that risk.\n  The bill will allow judges to write down the principal value of the \nloan, but only if both the debtor and creditor agree. Giving judges \ndiscretion to write down the principal value of loans could provide a \nsignificant windfall to those who gambled that housing prices would \nnever fall, including speculators. That is a gamble lenders and future \nhomeowners should not be forced to finance.\n  Taking too broad an approach to this problem will only hurt future \nborrowers. Allowing bankruptcy judges free rein to rewrite mortgage \nloans will only increase the risk that lenders take on when they issue \nmortgages. Investors respond to increased risk by insisting on higher \nrates of return and\n\n[[Page S12535]]\n\nmortgage lenders must respond in kind by raising their rates. That will \nonly make it more difficult for those Americans who wish to become \nhomeowners in the future.\n  In the longer run, the market will correct some of what has gone \nwrong. The number of risky loans being issued has already declined \ndramatically, in large part because investors are refusing to provide \nthe liquidity necessary to issue such loans. In addition, as predatory \nor fraudulent practices come to light, the Congress, and in particular \nthe Banking Committee, should take action to prevent such practices \nfrom occurring in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in offering relief for those who are \ncaught up in the current crisis and face losing their homes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Brownback):\n  S. 2135. A bill to prohibit the recruitment or use of child soldiers, \nto designate persons who recruit or use child soldiers as inadmissible \naliens, to allow the deportation of persons who recruit or use child \nsoldiers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act of 2007. This narrowly-tailored bipartisan \nlegislation would make it a crime and a violation of immigration law to \nrecruit or use child soldiers. Congress must ensure that perpetrators \nwho commit this war crime will not find safe haven in our country.\n  I would like to thank the other original cosponsors of the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator \nRussell Feingold of Wisconsin, and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas. \nThis bill is a product of the Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on \nHuman Rights and the Law, which is the first ever congressional \ncommittee dealing specifically with human rights. I am the Chairman of \nthis Subcommittee and Senator Coburn is its ranking member.\n  Up to 250,000 children currently serve as combatants, porters, human \nmine detectors and sex slaves in state-run armies, paramilitaries and \nguerilla groups around the world. These child soldiers are denied the \nchildhood that our children and grandchildren have and to which every \nchild has an inalienable right. Moreover, their health and lives are \nendangered.\n  Children are recruited and used in combat situations because their \nemotional and physical immaturity makes it easy to mold them into \nobedient combatants who will witness and partake in horrific violence, \noften without comprehending their actions. Child soldiers are \nfrequently recruited in areas of long-standing conflict where there are \nno longer eligible adults for recruitment. In many cases, they are \nprovided with drugs and alcohol to numb them to the atrocities they are \nrequired to commit, as well as to increase their dependency upon the \narmed group.\n  Children are more likely to be killed, injured or become ill in \ncombat situations than adults. In combat, child soldiers have been \nforced to the front lines, sent into minefields ahead of older troops \nor even used for suicide missions.\n  The devastating effects of war and abuse on the physical, emotional \nand social development of children are long lasting. Former child \nsoldiers require extensive care and support from family and others in \norder to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. In the absence \nof such support, former child soldiers may comprise a generation of \nadults who will perpetuate conflict and undermine security, creating \nunforeseen challenges that our children will have to address.\n  There is a clear legal prohibition on recruiting and using child \nsoldiers. Under customary international law, recruitment or use of \nchild soldiers under the age of 15 is a war crime. Over 110 countries, \nincluding the United States, have ratified the Optional Protocol to the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the recruitment \nand use of child soldiers under 18.\n\n  While there have been positive developments internationally in the \nprosecution of child soldier recruitment and use, especially by the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone, the ability of international tribunals \nor hybrid courts to try these cases is limited. The average perpetrator \nstill runs very little risk of being prosecuted. National courts can \nand should play a greater role in prosecuting perpetrators.\n  Unfortunately, recruiting and using child soldiers does not violate \nU.S. criminal or immigration law. As a result, the U.S. government is \nunable to punish individuals found in our country who have recruited or \nused child soldiers. In contrast, other grave human rights violations, \nincluding genocide and torture, are punishable under U.S. criminal and \nimmigration law.\n  This loophole in the law was identified during a hearing entitled \n``Casualties of War: Child Soldiers and the Law,'' held by the Senate \nSubcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. Ismael Beah, a former child \nsoldier and author of the bestselling book A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of \na Boy Soldier, testified at this hearing. Mr. Beah said this gap in the \nlaw ``saddens me tremendously'' and that closing this loophole ``would \nset a clear example that there is no safe haven anywhere for those who \nrecruit and use children in war.'' Mr. Beah also posed a moral \nchallenge to all of us:\n\n       When you go home tonight to your children, your cousins, \n     and your grandchildren and watch them carrying out their \n     various childhood activities, I want you to remember that at \n     that same moment, there are countless children elsewhere who \n     are being killed; injured; exposed to extreme violence; and \n     forced to serve in armed groups, including girls who are \n     raped (leading some to have babies of commanders); all of \n     them between the ages of 8 and 17. As you watch your loved \n     ones, those children you adore most, ask yourselves whether \n     you would want these kinds of suffering for them. If you \n     don't, then you must stop this from happening to other \n     children around the world whose lives and humanity are as \n     important and of the same value as all children everywhere.\n\n  The Child Soldiers Accountability Act will help to ensure that the \nwar criminals who recruit or use children as soldiers will not find \nsafe haven in our country and allow the U.S. government to hold these \nindividuals accountable for their actions.\n  First, this bill will make it a crime to recruit or use persons under \nthe age of 15 as soldiers. Second, it will enable the government to \ndeport or deny admission to an individual who recruited or used child \nsoldiers under the age of 15.\n  This legislation will send a clear message to those who recruit or \nuse child soldiers that there are real consequences to their actions. \nBy holding such individuals criminally responsible, our country will \nhelp to deter the recruitment and use of child soldiers.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask themselves the question Ishmael Beah \nposed: Would we want our children or grandchildren to endure the pain \nand suffering that Mr. Beah and other child soldiers face? As Mr. Beah \nreminded us, the lives of child soldiers are just as important as those \nof our children and grandchildren. We have a moral obligation to take \naction to help these young people and to stop the abhorrent practice of \nrecruiting and using child soldiers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to address the treatment of primary mortgages in \nbankruptcy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over 2 million families are going to lose \ntheir homes in the next few years. Mr. President, 28,000 of those \nfamilies are in Illinois.\n  Why?\n  Because they are stuck in bad mortgages.\n  Homeowners across America don't need to hear from me to know that the \nhousing boom has busted. From Wall Street to Main Street, we see the \nspillover effects on the economy.\n  I am pleased that in Congress we are now talking about how to tighten \nlending regulations so we don't repeat this type of market meltdown--\nand there is certainly more work to be done on that--but in the \nmeantime, millions of families are stuck in the current mess. They need \nour help.\n  It is true that some families knowingly stretched a bit to buy more \nhouse than they should have. But many families were sold mortgages they \ncouldn't afford by unscrupulous brokers. Some families were given \nfaulty appraisals, only to find later that their homes weren't worth as \nmuch as they thought. Still other families have been hit with a \nmountain of excessive fees that have pushed them over the edge.\n  Regardless of the reason, a family pushed into foreclosure is a \ndisaster for the homeowner and the surrounding community, and it is a \nbad deal for the banks as well.\n  That is why I am introducing the Helping Families Save Their Homes \nAct, which will help around 600,000 families who have nowhere else to \nturn to save their homes.\n  I support the constructive efforts of all of my Democratic colleagues \nin both the Senate and the House to deal with this crisis, and with \nthis bill I add one more targeted solution to that list.\n  Bankruptcy should be the last resort, to be sure, but this change in \nhow family homes are treated in bankruptcy will help hundreds of \nthousands of families who would otherwise be out on the street.\n  Today, a bankruptcy judge in Chapter 13 can change the structure of \nany secured debt, except for a mortgage on a principal residence. When \nthis exception was added to the law in 1978, mortgages were largely 30-\nyear fixed rate loans that required 20 percent down and were originated \nby a local banker who personally knew the homeowner. In 1978, it was \nrare for the mortgage to be the source of financial difficulty that \nsent a family into bankruptcy.\n  The mortgage market has changed since then, to put it mildly. Now, \nunregulated out-of-town mortgage brokers can sell exotic ``no-doc,'' \n``interest-only,'' ``2-28,'' or other mortgages to families, with few \nquestions asked. The mortgages are then securitized by big banks and \nsold into the secondary market to investors who have no knowledge of \nthe homeowner's financial situation. Risk is dispersed, but so is \nresponsibility.\n  In 1978, when a family realized it might begin having trouble making \nthe house payments, it could go down to the local bank and work out a \nnew plan to keep up. Today, families struggle to even get a straight \nanswer on the phone.\n  As the New York Times documented on Sunday, one homeowner made around \n670 phone calls to her loan servicer over a 3-month period in an \nattempt to work out a modified mortgage that she could pay and that \nwould still be profitable to the bank. She spoke to 14 different people \nand received nine different answers on how she should proceed. \nCommunity activists confirm that this type of struggle is not unusual. \nFor millions of families who are nearing foreclosure, this just isn't \ngood enough.\n  We need another solution for families that aren't being helped by \ntheir bank.\n  If mortgages on vacation homes and family farms can be modified in \nbankruptcy, why can't mortgages on primary homes?\n  My bill would allow bankruptcy judges to work out payment plans with \nhomeowners and banks and would also protect families from excessive \nfees.\n  The bill would help families who are at risk of losing their homes. \nBut it also protects property values for every other family on that \nblock. In fact, this change in the way mortgages are handled in \nbankruptcy would save an estimated $72.5 billion in existing property \nvalues for the neighborhood, since each foreclosure on a neighborhood \nblock reduces the property value for every other family on that block.\n  As for the banks? Foreclosures cost banks around $50,000 to process, \nso every home saved from foreclosure represents a good deal for them \ntoo. My bill would allow judges to modify mortgages only in ways that \nwould still be profitable for the banks and their investors.\n  Everybody wins, right? Well, the banks are still opposing this bill, \nso I would like to take a moment to directly address some of the \nprimary complaints that I have heard. There are too many families in \nneed--and this bill makes too much sense--for the bill to be shot down.\n  While everyone seems to agree on the problem--millions of families \nare going to lose their homes when the variable rate loans that were \noriginated in 2005 and beyond begin to reset, and fall--some argue that \nwe shouldn't do anything to help these families keep their homes in \nbankruptcy. I have heard three main complaints, none of which stand up \nto scrutiny.\n  The first complaint is that banks are already helping homeowners with \ntheir mortgage problems, and so this change is unnecessary.\n  In fact, the banks aren't doing nearly enough. A recent study by \nMoody's Investors Service Inc. found that the 16 largest subprime \nservicers, which manage a combined $950 billion of loans, modified just \n1 percent of the loans that were made in 2005 and that reset in \nJanuary, April, and July. Shouldn't we try to help some of the other 99 \npercent of homeowners who are at risk of\n\n[[Page S12537]]\n\nforeclosure but who could make payments on a different mortgage that is \nstill profitable for the banks?\n  The second argument is that Congress shouldn't modify the bankruptcy \ncode again so soon after the 2005 amendments were implemented.\n  However, the changes made to the bankruptcy code in 2005 had nothing \nto do with mortgages on primary residences. My bill would change \nelements of the code that date from 1978.\n  Would the banks argue that the tax code shouldn't be changed in 2007 \nbecause a completely unrelated area of the tax code was modified in \n2005? Not if they don't want to get laughed out of the Finance \nCommittee room, they wouldn't.\n  Finally, I have heard that allowing mortgages on principal residences \nto be modified in bankruptcy would introduce ``uncertainty'' in the \nmarket and would cause the market for loans for low-income families to \ndry up.\n  But mortgage lending is a hypercompetitive market. There is no \nevidence to suggest that a full-scale exodus will occur because of a \nchange to the bankruptcy law. Banks are still willing to lend for \nvacation homes and family farms and those mortgages can be modified in \nbankruptcy, so this argument has no basis in fact.\n  As a spokesman from JP Morgan Chase said in the American Banker: ``It \nis always in the best interest of the servicer, the borrower, and the \ninvestors if we can modify a loan, because foreclosure means there's no \nchance the investor is going to recoup their money.'' It should make no \ndifference if a modification is agreed to outside of the context of \nbankruptcy or within it, if the modification itself is identical.\n  I would like to conclude by noting that only families that \ndesperately need this help will file for bankruptcy, and only \nreasonable mortgages will result. My bill has been carefully \nconstructed to avoid unintended consequences in several ways:\n  First, families that are helped by these changes to the law have to \nlive within the strict IRS spending guidelines for Chapter 13 filers. \nFamilies that don't desperately need the help will be very unlikely to \ntry to take advantage of this provision.\n  Second, every mortgage restructured by a bankruptcy judge will be a \nbetter deal for the banks and investors than foreclosure. The minimum \nvalue of the mortgage in a restructured deal would be the fair market \nvalue of the home, which is the same price the bank would earn if it \nsold the house after a foreclosure. Plus, the banks will avoid the \naverage of $50,000 in foreclosure fees.\n  Finally, giving bankruptcy judges the flexibility to restructure \nmortgages should provide an incentive for banks and investors to do \nmore to restructure mortgages outside of bankruptcy, which is in \neveryone's best interest.\n  I repeat that quote from a major bank: ``It is always in the best \ninterest of the servicer, the borrower, and the investors if we can \nmodify a loan, because foreclosure means there's no chance the investor \nis going to recoup their money.''\n  I agree. It shouldn't be so hard for customers to modify their loans \noutside of bankruptcy since it's in everyone's best interest to do so. \nBut allowing families to modify loans within bankruptcy as a last \nresort so they can keep their homes is the right thing to do.\n  This bill is supported by the AARP, ACORN, AFL-CIO and SEIU, the \nCenter for Responsible Lending, the Consumer Federation of America, \nNAACP and La Raza, the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy \nAttorneys, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and many \nothers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to \nhelping families save their homes. Over the next few years, hundreds of \nthousands of families will desperately need it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plan of the Chief of Naval Operations to \n     recapitalize the United States Navy to at least 313 battle \n     force ships is essential for meeting the long-term \n     requirements of the National Military Strategy.\n       (2) Fiscal challenges to the plan to build a 313-ship fleet \n     require that the Navy exercise discipline in determining \n     warfighter requirements and responsibility in estimating, \n     budgeting, and controlling costs.\n       (3) The 55-ship Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program is \n     central to the shipbuilding plan of the Navy. The inability \n     of the Navy to control requirements and costs on the two lead \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship program raises serious \n     concerns regarding the capacity of the Navy to affordably \n     build a 313-ship fleet.\n       (4) According to information provided to Congress by the \n     Navy, the cost growth in the Littoral Combat Ship program was \n     attributable to several factors, most notably that--\n       (A) the strategy adopted for the Littoral Combat Ship \n     program, a so-called ``concurrent design-build'' strategy, \n     was a high-risk strategy that did not account for that risk \n     in the cost and schedule for the lead ships in the program;\n       (B) inadequate emphasis was placed on ``bid realism'' in \n     the evaluation of contract proposals under the program;\n       (C) late incorporation of Naval Vessel Rules into the \n     program caused significant design delays and cost growth;\n       (D) the Earned Value Management System of the contractor \n     under the program did not adequately measure shipyard \n     performance, and the Navy program organizations did not \n     independently assess cost performance;\n       (E) the Littoral Combat Ship program organization was \n     understaffed and lacking in the experience and qualifications \n     required for a major defense acquisition program;\n       (F) the Littoral Combat Ship program organization was aware \n     of the increasing costs of the Littoral Combat Ship program, \n     but did not communicate those cost increases directly to the \n     Assistant Secretary of the Navy in a time manner; and\n       (G) the relationship between the Naval Sea Systems Command \n     and the program executive offices for the program was \n     dysfunctional.\n       (b) Requirement.--In order to halt further cost growth in \n     the Littoral Combat Ship program, costs and government \n     liability under future contracts under the Littoral Combat \n     Ship program shall be limited as follows:\n       (1) Limitation of costs.--The total amount obligated or \n     expended for the procurement costs of the fifth and sixth \n     vessels in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class of vessels \n     shall not exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (2) Procurement costs.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     procurement costs shall include all costs for plans, basic \n     construction, change orders, electronics, ordnance, \n     contractor support, and other costs associated with \n     completion of production drawings, ship construction, test, \n     and delivery, including work performed post-delivery that is \n     required to meet original contract requirements.\n       (3) Contract type.--The Navy shall employ a fixed-price \n     type contract for construction of the fifth and following \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship class of vessels.\n       (4) Limitation of government liability.--The Navy shall not \n     enter into a contract, or modify a contract, for construction \n     of the fifth or sixth vessel of the Littoral Combat Ship \n     class of vessels if the limitation of the Government's cost \n     liability, when added to the sum of other budgeted \n     procurement costs, would exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (5) Adjustment of limitation amount.--The Secretary of the \n     Navy may adjust the amount set forth in paragraphs (1) and \n     (4) for either vessel referred to in such paragraph by the \n     following:\n       (A) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or \n     local laws enacted after September 30, 2007.\n       (B) The amounts of outfitting costs and costs required to \n     complete post-delivery test and trials.\n       (c) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 124 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-163; 119 Stat. 3157) is repealed.\n\n     SEC. 133.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PROCUREMENT PROGRAM FOR \n                   THE KC-X TANKER AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Aerial refueling is a critically important force \n     multiplier for the Air Force.\n       (2) The KC-X tanker aircraft procurement program is the \n     number one acquisition and recapitalization priority of the \n     Air Force.\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\n       (3) Given the competing budgetary requirements of the other \n     Armed Forces and other sectors of the Federal Government, the \n     Air Force needs to modernize at the most cost effective \n     price.\n       (4) Competition in defense procurement provides the Armed \n     Forces with the best products at the best price.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Air Force should--\n       (1) hold a full and open competition to choose the best \n     possible joint aerial refueling capability at the most \n     reasonable price; and\n       (2) be discouraged from taking any actions that would limit \n     the ability of either of the teams seeking the contract for \n     the procurement of KC-X tanker aircraft from competing for \n     that contract.\n\n     SEC. 144.

REPORT ON CONTROL OF THE BROWN TREE SNAKE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), an invasive \n     species, is found in significant numbers on military \n     installations and in other areas on Guam, and constitutes a \n     serious threat to the ecology of Guam.\n       (2) If introduced into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States, \n     the brown tree snake would pose an immediate and serious \n     economic and ecological threat.\n       (3) The most probable vector for the introduction of the \n     brown tree snake into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States is \n     the movement from Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and \n     cargo, including the household goods of military personnel.\n       (4) It is probable that the movement of military aircraft, \n     personnel, and cargo, including the household goods of \n     military personnel, from Guam to Hawaii, the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United \n     States will increase significantly coincident with the \n     increase in the number of military units and personnel \n     stationed on Guam.\n       (5) Current policies, programs, procedures, and dedicated \n     resources of the Department of Defense and of other \n     departments and agencies of the United States may not be \n     sufficient to adequately address the increasing threat of the \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report on the \n     following:\n       (1) The actions currently being taken (including the \n     resources being made available) by the Department of Defense \n     to control, and to develop new or existing techniques to \n     control, the brown tree snake on Guam and to ensure that the \n     brown tree snake is not introduced into Hawaii, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island, or the \n     continental United States as a result of the movement from \n     Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and cargo, including \n     the household goods of military personnel.\n       (2) Current plans for enhanced future actions, policies, \n     and procedures and increased levels of resources in order to \n     ensure that the projected increase of military personnel \n     stationed on Guam does not increase the threat of \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n\n    Subtitle C--Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations\n\n     SEC. 321.

HATE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \n     Prevention Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim poses a serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated \n     by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and \n     the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages \n     the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be \n     selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including the following:\n       (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, \n     and members of such groups are forced to move across State \n     lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.\n       (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (E) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n\n[[Page S12619]]\n\n       (10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, \n     and Indian tribes.\n       (c) Definition of Hate Crime.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 16, title 18, United States Code;\n       (2) the term ``hate crime'' has the meaning given such term \n     in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note); and\n       (3) the term ``local'' means a county, city, town, \n     township, parish, village, or other general purpose political \n     subdivision of a State.\n       (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by \n     State, Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement Officials.--\n       (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--At the request of State, local, or Tribal \n     law enforcement agency, the Attorney General may provide \n     technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of \n     assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of \n     any crime that--\n       (i) constitutes a crime of violence;\n       (ii) constitutes a felony under the State, local, or Tribal \n     laws; and\n       (iii) is motivated by prejudice based on the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim, or is a violation of the State, local, or Tribal hate \n     crime laws.\n       (B) Priority.--In providing assistance under subparagraph \n     (A), the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes \n     committed by offenders who have committed crimes in more than \n     one State and to rural jurisdictions that have difficulty \n     covering the extraordinary expenses relating to the \n     investigation or prosecution of the crime.\n       (2) Grants.--\n       (A) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to \n     State, local, and Indian law enforcement agencies for \n     extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation and \n     prosecution of hate crimes.\n       (B) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant \n     program under this paragraph, the Office of Justice Programs \n     shall work closely with grantees to ensure that the concerns \n     and needs of all affected parties, including community groups \n     and schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed \n     through the local infrastructure developed under the grants.\n       (C) Application.--\n       (i) In general.--Each State, local, and Indian law \n     enforcement agency that desires a grant under this paragraph \n     shall submit an application to the Attorney General at such \n     time, in such manner, and accompanied by or containing such \n     information as the Attorney General shall reasonably require.\n       (ii) Date for submission.--Applications submitted pursuant \n     to clause (i) shall be submitted during the 60-day period \n     beginning on a date that the Attorney General shall \n     prescribe.\n       (iii) Requirements.--A State, local, and Indian law \n     enforcement agency applying for a grant under this paragraph \n     shall--\n\n       (I) describe the extraordinary purposes for which the grant \n     is needed;\n       (II) certify that the State, local government, or Indian \n     tribe lacks the resources necessary to investigate or \n     prosecute the hate crime;\n       (III) demonstrate that, in developing a plan to implement \n     the grant, the State, local, and Indian law enforcement \n     agency has consulted and coordinated with nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental victim services programs that have experience \n     in providing services to victims of hate crimes; and\n       (IV) certify that any Federal funds received under this \n     paragraph will be used to supplement, not supplant, non-\n     Federal funds that would otherwise be available for \n     activities funded under this paragraph.\n\n       (D) Deadline.--An application for a grant under this \n     paragraph shall be approved or denied by the Attorney General \n     not later than 30 business days after the date on which the \n     Attorney General receives the application.\n       (E) Grant amount.--A grant under this paragraph shall not \n     exceed $100,000 for any single jurisdiction in any 1-year \n     period.\n       (F) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2008, the Attorney \n     General shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     applications submitted for grants under this paragraph, the \n     award of such grants, and the purposes for which the grant \n     amounts were expended.\n       (G) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this paragraph $5,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\n       (e) Grant Program.--\n       (1) Authority to award grants.--The Office of Justice \n     Programs of the Department of Justice may award grants, in \n     accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General may \n     prescribe, to State, local, or Tribal programs designed to \n     combat hate crimes committed by juveniles, including programs \n     to train local law enforcement officers in identifying, \n     investigating, prosecuting, and preventing hate crimes.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this subsection.\n       (f) Authorization for Additional Personnel To Assist State, \n     Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement.--There are authorized to \n     be appropriated to the Department of the Treasury and the \n     Department of Justice, including the Community Relations \n     Service, for fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 such sums as \n     are necessary to increase the number of personnel to prevent \n     and respond to alleged violations of section 249 of title 18, \n     United States Code, as added by this section.\n       (g) Prohibition of Certain Hate Crime Acts.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 249.

100 Stat. 992) provides precedent for Congress to \n     consider legislation designed to promote increased \n     cooperation and integration among the primary Federal \n     departments and agencies charged with managing post-conflict \n     contingency reconstruction and relief operations.\n       (2) Inclusion in study.--The study conducted under \n     subsection (a) shall include the following elements:\n       (A) A synthesis of past studies evaluating the successes \n     and failures of previous interagency efforts at planning and \n     executing post-conflict contingency relief and reconstruction \n     operations, including relief and reconstruction operations in \n     Iraq.\n       (B) An analysis of the division of duties, \n     responsibilities, and functions among executive branch \n     agencies for such operations and recommendations for \n     administrative and regulatory changes to enhance integration.\n       (C) Recommendations for legislation that would improve \n     interagency cooperation and integration and the efficiency of \n     the United States Government in the planning and execution of \n     such operations.\n       (D) Recommendations for improvements in congressional, \n     executive, and other oversight structures and procedures that \n     would enhance accountability within such operations.\n\n     SEC. 1044.

REPORT ON SUPPORT FROM IRAN FOR ATTACKS AGAINST \n                   COALITION FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since January 19, 1984, the Secretary of State has \n     designated the Islamic Republic of Iran as a ``state sponsor \n     of terrorism,'' one of only five countries in the world at \n     present so designated.\n       (2) The Department of State, in its most recent ``Country \n     Reports on Terrorism,'' stated that ``Iran remained the most \n     active state sponsor of terrorism'' in 2006.\n       (3) The most recent Country Reports on Terrorism report \n     further stated, ``Iran continued [in 2006] to play a \n     destabilizing role in Iraq. . . Iran provided guidance and \n     training to select Iraqi Shia political groups, and weapons \n     and training to Shia militant groups to enable anti-Coalition \n     attacks. Iranian government forces have been responsible for \n     at least some of the increasing lethality of anti-Coalition \n     attacks by providing Shia militants with the capability to \n     build IEDs with explosively formed projectiles similar to \n     those developed by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard was linked to armor-piercing explosives \n     that resulted in the deaths of Coalition Forces.''\n       (4) In an interview published on June 7, 2006, Zalmay \n     Khalilzad, then-United States ambassador to Iraq, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We can say \n     with certainty that they support groups that are attacking \n     coalition troops. These groups are using the same ammunition \n     to destroy armored vehicles that the Iranians are supplying \n     to Hezbollah in Lebanon. They pay money to Shiite militias \n     and they train some of the groups. We can't say whether \n     Teheran is supporting Al Qaeda, but we do know that Al Qaeda \n     people come here from Pakistan through Iran. And Ansar al \n     Sunna, a partner organization of Zarqawi's network, has a \n     base in northwest Iran.''\n       (5) On April 26, 2007, General David Petraeus, commander of \n     Multi-National Force-Iraq, said of Iranian support for \n     extremist activity in Iraq, ``The level of financing, the \n     level of training on Iranian soil, the level of equipping \n     some sophisticated technologies. . . even advice in some \n     cases, has been very, very substantial and very harmful.''\n       (6) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus also said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We know \n     that it goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is \n     the head of the Qods Force. . . . We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country.''\n       (7) On May 27, 2007, then-Major General William Caldwell, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, said, ``What we \n     do know is that the Iranian intelligence services, the Qods \n     Force, is in fact both training, equipping, and funding Shia \n     extremist groups. . . both in Iraq and also in Iran. . . . We \n     have in detention now people that we have captured that, in \n     fact, are Sunni extremist-related that have, in fact, \n     received both some funding and training from the Iranian \n     intelligence services, the Qods Force.''\n       (8) On February 27, 2007, in testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Lieutenant General Michael \n     Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We believe \n     Hezbollah is involved in the training as well.''\n       (9) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Kevin Bergner, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, stated, ``The \n     Iranian Qods Force is using Lebanese Hezbollah essentially as \n     a proxy, as a surrogate in Iraq.''\n       (10) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner detailed \n     the capture in southern Iraq by coalition forces of Ali Musa \n     Daqdaq, whom the United States military believes to be a 24-\n     year veteran of Lebanese Hezbollah involved in the training \n     of Iraqi extremists in Iraq and Iran.\n       (11) The Department of State designates Hezbollah a foreign \n     terrorist organization.\n       (12) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the Iranian Qods Force operates three camps near Teheran \n     where it trains Iraqi extremists in cooperation with Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, stating, ``The Qods Force, along with Hezbollah \n     instructors, train approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, \n     sending them back to Iraq organized into these special \n     groups. They are being taught how to use EPFs [explosively \n     formed penetrators], mortars, rockets, as well as \n     intelligence, sniper, and kidnapping operations.''\n       (13) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     Iraqi extremists receive between $750,000 and $3,000,000 \n     every month from Iranian sources.\n       (14) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     ``[o]ur intelligence reveals that senior leadership in Iran \n     is aware of this activity'' and that it would be ``hard to \n     imagine'' that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of \n     Iran, is unaware of it.\n       (15) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated, \n     ``There does not seem to be any follow-through on the \n     commitments that Iran has made to work with Iraq in \n     addressing the destabilizing security issues here in Iraq.''\n       (16) On February 11, 2007, the United States military held \n     a briefing in Baghdad at which its representatives stated \n     that at least 170 members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have been killed, and at least 620 wounded, by weapons tied \n     to Iran.\n       (17) On January 20, 2007, a sophisticated attack was \n     launched by insurgents at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center in Iraq, resulting in the murder of five \n     American soldiers, four of whom were first abducted.\n       (18) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus stated that the \n     so-called Qazali network was responsible for the attack on \n     the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center and that \n     ``there's no question that the Qazali network is directly \n     connected to the Iranian Qods force [and has] received money, \n     training, arms, ammunition, and at some points in time even \n     advice and assistance and direction''.\n       (19) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the United States Armed Forces possesses documentary evidence \n     that the Qods Force had developed detailed information on the \n     United States position at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center ``regarding our soldiers' activities, \n     shift changes, and defenses, and this information was shared \n     with the attackers''.\n       (20) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated of \n     the January 20 Karbala attackers, ``[They] could not have \n     conducted this complex operation without the support and \n     direction of the Qods Force.''\n       (21) On May 28, 2007, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     Ryan Crocker, met in Baghdad with representatives of the \n     government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to express United \n     States concern about Iranian anti-coalition activity in Iraq;\n       (22) Section 1213(a) of the fiscal year 2007 John Warner \n     National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 109-364) \n     required that the intelligence community produce an updated \n     National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable and \n     unacceptable act against the United States by the foreign \n     government in question; and\n       (2) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must \n     take immediate action to end any training, arming, equipping, \n     funding, advising, and any other forms of support that it or \n     its agents are providing, and have provided, to Iraqi \n     militias and insurgents, who are contributing to the \n     destabilization of Iraq and are responsible for the murder of \n     members of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S12646]]\n\n       (3) It is imperative for the executive and legislative \n     branches of the Federal government to have accurate \n     intelligence on Iran and therefore the intelligence community \n     should produce the NIE on Iran without further delay;\n       (4) Congress supports United States diplomacy with the \n     representatives of the government of Islamic Republic of Iran \n     in order to stop any actions by the Iranian government or its \n     agents against United States service members in Iraq;\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 60 days thereafter, the \n     Commander, Multi-National Forces Iraq and the United States \n     Ambassador to Iraq in coordination with the Director of \n     National Intelligence shall jointly submit to Congress a \n     report describing and assessing in detail--\n       (A) any external support or direction provided to anti-\n     coalition forces by the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran or its agents;\n       (B) the strategy and ambitions in Iraq of the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       (C) any counter-strategy or efforts by the United States \n     Government to counter the activities of agents of the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Iraq.\n       (2) Form.--Each report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     be in unclassified form to the extent practical consistent \n     with the need to protect national security, but may contain a \n     classified annex.\n       (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize \n     or otherwise speak to the use of Armed Forces against Iran.\n\n     SEC. 1536. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF A \n                   FAILED STATE IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n       (2) The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic \n     Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally''.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray \n     any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant \n     victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for \n     their cause in the region and around the world''.\n       (4) A National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \n     consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq would be \n     that--\n       (A) Al Qaeda would attempt to use Anbar province to plan \n     further attacks outside of Iraq;\n       (B) neighboring countries would consider actively \n     intervening in Iraq; and\n       (C) sectarian violence would significantly increase in \n     Iraq, accompanied by massive civilian casualties and \n     displacement.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group found that ``a premature American \n     departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater \n     sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions. . \n     . . The near-term results would be a significant power \n     vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, \n     and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our \n     withdrawal as a historic victory.''\n       (6) A failed state in Iraq could lead to broader regional \n     conflict, possibly involving Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n     Turkey.\n       (7) The Iraq Study group noted that ``Turkey could send \n     troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdistan from declaring \n     independence''.\n       (8) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Iran could send \n     troops to restore stability in southern Iraq and perhaps gain \n     control of oil fields. The regional influence of Iran could \n     rise at a time when that country is on a path to producing \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       (9) A failed state in Iraq would lead to massive \n     humanitarian suffering, including widespread ethnic cleansing \n     and countless refugees and internally displaced persons, many \n     of whom will be tortured and killed for having assisted \n     Coalition forces.\n       (10) A recent editorial in the New York Times stated, \n     ``Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around \n     it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans \n     leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with \n     American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. \n     Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and \n     Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power \n     grabs.''\n       (11) The Iraq Study Group found that ``[i]f we leave and \n     Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could \n     eventually require the United States to return''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should commit itself to a strategy that will \n     not leave a failed state in Iraq; and\n       (2) the Senate should not pass legislation that will \n     undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in \n     Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 1537. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FEDERALISM IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iraq continues to experience a self-sustaining cycle of \n     sectarian violence.\n       (2) The ongoing sectarian violence presents a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the long-term security \n     interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq \n     that is stable, not a haven for terrorists, and not a threat \n     to its neighbors.\n       (3) A central focus of al Qaeda in Iraq has been to turn \n     sectarian divisions in Iraq into sectarian violence through a \n     concentrated series of attacks, the most significant being \n     the destruction of the Golden Dome of the Shia al-Askariyah \n     Mosque in Samarra in February 2006.\n       (4) Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable \n     political settlement in order to achieve stability, and the \n     failure of the Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary \n     cause of violence in Iraq.\n       (5) Article One of the Constitution of Iraq declares Iraq \n     to be a ``single, independent federal state''.\n       (6) Section Five of the Constitution of Iraq declares that \n     the ``federal system in the Republic of Iraq is made up of a \n     decentralized capital, regions, and governorates, and local \n     administrations'' and enumerates the expansive powers of \n     regions and the limited powers of the central government and \n     establishes the mechanisms for the creation of new federal \n     regions.\n       (7) The federal system created by the Constitution of Iraq \n     would give Iraqis local control over their police and certain \n     laws, including those related to employment, education, \n     religion, and marriage.\n       (8) The Constitution of Iraq recognizes the administrative \n     role of the Kurdistan Regional Government in 3 northern Iraqi \n     provinces, known also as the Kurdistan Region.\n       (9) The Kurdistan region, recognized by the Constitution of \n     Iraq, is largely stable and peaceful.\n       (10) The Iraqi Parliament approved a federalism law on \n     October 11th, 2006, which establishes procedures for the \n     creation of new federal regions and will go into effect 18 \n     months after approval.\n       (11) Iraqis recognize Baghdad as the capital of Iraq, and \n     the Constitution of Iraq stipulates that Baghdad may not \n     merge with any federal region.\n       (12) Despite their differences, Iraq's sectarian and ethnic \n     groups support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\n       (13) Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, ``[t]he crisis is political, and the ones \n     who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of \n     innocents are the politicians''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should actively support a political \n     settlement in Iraq based on the final provisions of the \n     Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of \n     government and allow for the creation of federal regions, \n     consistent with the wishes of the Iraqi people and their \n     elected leaders;\n       (2) the active support referred to in paragraph (1) should \n     include--\n       (A) calling on the international community, including \n     countries with troops in Iraq, the permanent 5 members of the \n     United Nations Security Council, members of the Gulf \n     Cooperation Council, and Iraq's neighbors--\n       (i) to support an Iraqi political settlement based on \n     federalism;\n       (ii) to acknowledge the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of Iraq; and\n       (iii) to fulfill commitments for the urgent delivery of \n     significant assistance and debt relief to Iraq, especially \n     those made by the member states of the Gulf Cooperation \n     Council;\n       (B) further calling on Iraq's neighbors to pledge not to \n     intervene in or destabilize Iraq and to agree to related \n     verification mechanisms; and\n       (C) convening a conference for Iraqis to reach an agreement \n     on a comprehensive political settlement based on the \n     federalism law approved by the Iraqi Parliament on October \n     11, 2006;\n       (3) the United States should urge the Government of Iraq to \n     quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the \n     equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical \n     component of a comprehensive political settlement based upon \n     federalism;\n       (4) the steps described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n     could lead to an Iraq that is stable, not a haven for \n     terrorists, and not a threat to its neighbors; and\n       (5) nothing in this Act should be construed in any way to \n     infringe on the sovereign rights of the nation of Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 1538. SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) General David Petraeus, commander of the Multi-National \n     Force Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``[i]t is increasingly apparent to both coalition \n     and Iraqi leaders that Iran, through the use of the Iranian \n     Republican Guard Corps Qods Force, seeks to turn the Shi'a \n     militia extremists into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its \n     interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and \n     coalition forces in Iraq''.\n       (2) Ambassador Ryan Crocker, United States Ambassador to \n     Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``Iran plays a harmful role in Iraq. While \n     claiming to support Iraq in its transition, Iran has actively \n     undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to the enemies \n     of the Iraqi state''.\n       (3) The most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, \n     published in August 2007, states that ``Iran has been \n     intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups \n     of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM [Jaysh al-\n     Mahdi], since at least the beginning of 2006. Explosively \n     formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically''.\n       (4) The Report of the Independent Commission on the \n     Security Forces of Iraq, released on September 6, 2007, \n     states that ``[t]he Commission concludes that the evidence of \n     Iran's increasing activism in the southeastern part of the \n     country, including Basra and Diyala provinces, is compelling. \n     . . It is an accepted fact that most of the sophisticated \n     weapons being used to `defeat' our armor protection comes \n     across the border from Iran with relative impunity''.\n       (5) General (Ret.) James Jones, chairman of the Independent \n     Commission on the Security\n\n[[Page S12647]]\n\n     Forces of Iraq, stated in testimony before the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate on September 6, 2007, that \n     ``[w]e judge that the goings-on across the Iranian border in \n     particular are of extreme severity and have the potential of \n     at least delaying our efforts inside the country. Many of the \n     arms and weapons that kill and maim our soldiers are coming \n     from across the Iranian border''.\n       (6) Ambassador Crocker further testified before Congress on \n     September 11, 2007, with respect to talks with Iran, That ``I \n     think that it's an option that we want to preserve. Our first \n     couple of rounds did not produce anything. I don't think that \n     we should either, therefore, be in a big hurry to have \n     another round, nor do I think we should say we're not going \n     to talk anymore. . . I do believe it's important to keep the \n     option for further discussions on the table.''\n       (7) Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated on September \n     16, 2007, That ``I think that the administration believes at \n     this point that continuing to try and deal with the Iranian \n     threat, the Iranian challenge, through diplomatic and \n     economic means is by far the preferable approach. That's the \n     one we are using . . . we always say all options are on the \n     table, but clearly, the diplomatic and economic approach is \n     the one that we are pursuing.''\n       (8) General Petraeus said of Iranian support for extremist \n     activity in Iraq on April 26, 2007, that ``[w]e know that it \n     goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is the \n     head of the Qods Force. . . We believe that he works directly \n     for the supreme leader of the country''.\n       (9) Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the president of Iran, stated on \n     August 28, 2007, with respect to the United States presence \n     in Iraq, that ``[t]he political power of the occupiers is \n     collapsing rapidly. Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in \n     the region. Of course we are prepared to fill the gap''.\n       (10) Ambassador Crocker testified to Congress, with respect \n     to President Ahmedinejad's statement, on September 11, 2007, \n     that ``[t]he Iranian involvement in Iraq--its support for \n     extremist militias, training, connections to Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, provision of munitions that are used against our \n     force as well as the Iraqis--are all, in my view, a pretty \n     clear demonstration that Ahmedinejad means what he says, and \n     is already trying to implement it to the best of his \n     ability''.\n       (11) General Petraeus stated on September 12, 2007, with \n     respect to evidence of the complicity of Iran in the murder \n     of members of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq, \n     that ``[t]e evidence is very, very clear. We captured it when \n     we captured Qais Khazali, the Lebanese Hezbollah deputy \n     commander, and others, and it's in black and white. . . We \n     interrogated these individuals. We have on tape. . . Qais \n     Khazali himself. When asked, could you have done what you \n     have done without Iranian support, he literally throws up his \n     hands and laughs and says, of course not. . . So they told us \n     about the amounts of money that they have received. They told \n     us about the training that they received. They told us about \n     the ammunition and sophisticated weaponry and all of that \n     that they received''.\n       (12) General Petraeus further stated on September 14, 2007, \n     that ``[w]hat we have got is evidence. This is not \n     intelligence. This is evidence, off computers that we \n     captured, documents and so forth. . . In one case, a 22-page \n     document that lays out the planning, reconnaissance, \n     rehearsal, conduct, and aftermath of the operation conducted \n     that resulted in the death of five of our soldiers in Karbala \n     back in January''.\n       (13) The Department of Defense report to Congress entitled \n     ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'' and released on \n     September 18, 2007, consistent with section 9010 of Public \n     Law 109-289, states that ``[t]here has been no decrease in \n     Iranian training and funding of illegal Shi'a militias in \n     Iraq that attack Iraqi and Coalition forces and civilians. . \n     . Tehran's support for these groups is one of the greatest \n     impediments to progress on reconciliation''.\n       (14) The Department of Defense report further states, with \n     respect to Iranian support for Shi'a extremist groups in \n     Iraq, that ``[m]ost of the explosives and ammunition used by \n     these groups are provided by the Iranian Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. . . For the period of \n     June through the end of August, [explosively formed \n     penetrator] events are projected to rise by 39 percent over \n     the period of March through May''.\n       (15) Since May 2007, Ambassador Crocker has held three \n     rounds of talks in Baghdad on Iraq security with \n     representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n       (16) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 10, 2007, with respect to these talks, stating that \n     ``I laid out the concerns we had over Iranian activity that \n     was damaging to Iraq's security, but found no readiness on \n     Iranians' side at all to engage seriously on these issues. \n     The impression I came with after a couple rounds is that the \n     Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of \n     discussions, of being seen to be at the table with the U.S. \n     as an arbiter of Iraq's present and future, rather than \n     actually doing serious business. . . Right now, I haven't \n     seen any sign of earnest or seriousness on the Iranian \n     side''.\n       (17) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 11, 2007, stating that ``[w]e have seen nothing on \n     the ground that would suggest that the Iranians are altering \n     what they're doing in support of extremist elements that are \n     going after our forces as well as the Iraqis''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the manner in which the United States transitions \n     and structures its military presence in Iraq will have \n     critical long-term consequences for the future of the Persian \n     Gulf and the Middle East, in particular with regard to the \n     capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to pose a threat to the security of the region, the prospects \n     for democracy for the people of the region, and the health of \n     the global economy;\n       (2) that it is a critical national interest of the United \n     States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran from turning Shi'a militia extremists in Iraq into a \n     Hezbollah-like force that could serve its interests inside \n     Iraq, including by overwhelming, subverting, or co-opting \n     institutions of the legitimate Government of Iraq;\n       (3) that the United States should designate Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act and place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, \n     as established under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and initiated under Executive Order 13224; and\n       (4) that the Department of the Treasury should act with all \n     possible expediency to complete the listing of those entities \n     targeted under United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     1737 and 1747 adopted unanimously on December 23, 2006 and \n     March 24, 2007, respectively.\n\n     SEC. 1539.

SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AFGHANISTAN \n                   RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is \n     vital to the national security of the United States and to \n     combating international terrorism.\n       (2) Since the fall of the Taliban, the United States has \n     provided Afghanistan with over $20,000,000,000 in \n     reconstruction and security assistance. However, repeated and \n     documented incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse in the \n     utilization of these funds have undermined reconstruction \n     efforts.\n       (3) There is a stronger need for vigorous oversight of \n     spending by the United States on reconstruction programs and \n     projects in Afghanistan.\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and \n     departmental Inspectors General provide valuable information \n     on such activities.\n       (5) The congressional oversight process requires more \n     timely reporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan \n     that encompasses the efforts of the Department of State, the \n     Department of Defense, and the United States Agency for \n     International Development and highlights specific acts of \n     waste, fraud, and abuse.\n       (6) One example of such successful reporting is provided by \n     the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     (SIGIR), which has met this objective in the case of Iraq.\n       (7) The establishment of a Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) position using SIGIR as a \n     model will help achieve this objective in Afghanistan. This \n     position will help Congress and the American people to better \n     understand the challenges facing United States programs and \n     projects in that crucial country.\n       (8) It is a priority for Congress to establish a Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan position with similar \n     responsibilities and duties as the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction. This new position will monitor \n     United States assistance to Afghanistan in the civilian and \n     security sectors, undertaking efforts similar to those of the \n     Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n       (b) Office of Inspector General.--There is hereby \n     established the Office of the Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction.\n       (c) Appointment of Inspector General; Removal.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The head of the Office of the Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction is the \n     Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Inspector General''), who \n     shall be appointed by the President. The President may \n     appoint the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     to serve as the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction, in which case the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction shall have all of the duties, \n     responsibilities, and authorities set forth under this \n     section with respect to such appointed position for the \n     purpose of carrying out this section.\n       (2) Qualifications.--The appointment of the Inspector \n     General shall be made solely on the basis of integrity and \n     demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial \n     analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or \n     investigations.\n       (3) Deadline for appointment.--The nomination of an \n     individual as Inspector General shall be made not later than \n     30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Removal.--The Inspector General shall be removable from \n     office in accordance with the provisions of section 3(b) of \n     the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

RELIABLE REPLACEMENT WARHEAD PROGRAM.''.\n\n       (2) The table of contents for that Act is amended by \n     inserting after the item relating to section 4204 the \n     following new item:\n\n``Sec. 4204A. Reliable Replacement Warhead program.''.\n\n                Subtitle D--Nuclear Terrorism Prevention\n\n     SEC. 3131. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) The term ``Convention on the Physical Protection of \n     Nuclear Material'' means the Convention on the Physical \n     Protection of Nuclear Material, signed at New York and Vienna \n     March 3, 1980.\n       (2) The term ``formula quantities of strategic special \n     nuclear material'' means uranium-235 (contained in uranium \n     enriched to 20 percent or more in the U-235 isotope), \n     uranium-233, or plutonium in any combination in a total \n     quantity of 5,000 grams or more computed by the formula, \n     grams = (grams contained U-235) + 2.5 (grams U-233 + grams \n     plutonium), as set forth in the definitions of ``formula \n     quantity'' and ``strategic special nuclear material'' in \n     section 73.2 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (3) The term ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'' means the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (21 UST 483).\n       (4) The term ``nuclear weapon'' means any device utilizing \n     atomic energy, exclusive of the means for transporting or \n     propelling the device (where such means is a separable and \n     divisible part of the device), the principal purpose of which \n     is for use as, or for the development of, a weapon, a weapon \n     prototype, or a weapon test device.\n\n     SEC. 3132. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The possibility that terrorists may acquire and use a \n     nuclear weapon against the United States is the most horrific \n     threat that our Nation faces.\n       (2) The September 2006 ``National Strategy for Combating \n     Terrorism'' issued by the White House states, ``Weapons of \n     mass destruction in the hands of terrorists is one of the \n     gravest threats we face.''\n       (3) Former Senator and cofounder of the Nuclear Threat \n     Initiative Sam Nunn has stated, ``Stockpiles of loosely \n     guarded nuclear weapons material are scattered around the \n     world, offering inviting targets for theft or sale. We are \n     working on this, but I believe that the threat is outrunning \n     our response.''.\n       (4) Existing programs intended to secure, monitor, and \n     reduce nuclear stockpiles, redirect nuclear scientists, and \n     interdict nuclear smuggling have made substantial progress, \n     but additional efforts are needed to reduce the threat of \n     nuclear terrorism as much as possible.\n       (5) Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has \n     said that a nuclear terror attack ``would not only cause \n     widespread death and destruction, but would stagger the world \n     economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire \n     poverty''.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) \n     reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with \n     the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international \n     peace and security caused by terrorist acts, and directs all \n     countries, in accordance with their national procedures, to \n     adopt and enforce effective laws that prohibit any non-state \n     actor from manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, developing, \n     transporting, transferring, or using nuclear, chemical, or \n     biological weapons and their means of delivery, in particular \n     for terrorist purposes, and to prohibit attempts to engage in \n     any of the foregoing activities, participate in them as an \n     accomplice, or assist or finance them.\n       (7) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei, has said that it is a ``race \n     against time'' to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear \n     weapon.\n       (8) The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital \n     role in coordinating efforts to protect nuclear materials and \n     to combat nuclear smuggling.\n       (9) Legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar, Senator \n     Pete Domenici, and former Senator Sam Nunn has resulted in \n     groundbreaking programs to secure nuclear weapons and \n     materials and to help ensure that such weapons and materials \n     do not fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\n     SEC. 3133. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear \n     terrorist attack on the United States of the highest \n     priority;\n       (2) the President should accelerate programs, requesting \n     additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear \n     terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling, securing \n     and accounting for nuclear weapons, and eliminating, \n     removing, or securing and accounting for formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material wherever such \n     quantities may be;\n       (3) the United States, together with the international \n     community, should take a comprehensive approach to reducing \n     the danger of nuclear terrorism, including by making \n     additional efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups \n     that aim to acquire nuclear weapons, to ensure that nuclear \n     weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that \n     formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material \n     worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted \n     for to a degree sufficient to defeat the threat that \n     terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, and to \n     increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts to \n     manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear \n     explosives and materials anywhere in the world;\n       (4) within such a comprehensive approach, a high priority \n     must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons worldwide \n     are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are \n     eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for; and\n       (5) the International Atomic Energy Agency should be funded \n     appropriately to fulfill its role in coordinating \n     international efforts to protect nuclear material and to \n     combat nuclear smuggling.\n\n     SEC. 3134.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from consideration of S. 2106, and that the \nSenate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2106) to provide nationwide subpoena authority \n     for actions brought under the September 11 Victim \n     Compensation Fund of 2001.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 6 years ago, just days after the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle \ncame together to pass comprehensive legislation entitled ``the Air \nTransportation Safety and System Stabilization Act,'' which provided \nvictims of the terrorist attack the option of filing a claim with a \nnational compensation program or seeking limited damages in one Federal \ndistrict court--the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York.\n  This Federal cause of action was designed to give victims and their \nfamilies a choice in the aftermath of September 11. I supported giving \nthe victims and their families a Federal cause of action in court to \npursue civil damages, but it has come to my attention that an important \nprocedural protection was left out of the bipartisan legislation we \npassed 6 years ago.\n  The 9-11 victims' case currently being litigated in the Southern \nDistrict of New York includes parties and witnesses from across the \ncountry. However, the existing Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nrestricts the reach of trial subpoenas to a 100-mile radius of the \nplace of trial. This procedural rule effectively prevents subpoenas \nfrom being served in the very cities where the flights originated and \nwhere two of them crashed on the morning of September 11.\n  The bipartisan solution to the problem that Congress created is the \nProcedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act, S. 2106. It provides \nfor nationwide service of subpoenas for the September 11 victims. \nCongress has repeatedly provided for nationwide subpoena power in other \ninstances such as the False Claims Act, the Veterans' Benefits Act, and \nthe Civil RICO statute.\n  I call on my colleagues to pass this procedural fix that will allow \nthe victims to have a chance to have their claims fairly and thoroughly \nheard in court. The heart of every American aches for those who died or \nwere injured because of the tragic attacks in New York, Virginia, and \nPennsylvania on September 11. Although no amount of compensation can \nreplace a lost loved one, the Procedural Fairness for September 11 \nVictims Act offers a technical fix that is crucial to assisting the \nSeptember 11 victims and their families.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2106) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Procedural Fairness for \n     September 11 Victims Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The September 11th Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 \n     (49 U.S.C. 40101 note) establishes a Federal cause of action \n     in the United States District Court for the Southern District \n     of New York as the exclusive remedy for damages arising out \n     of the hijacking and subsequent crash of American Airlines \n     flights 11 and 77, and United Airlines flights 93 and 175, on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (2) Rules 45(b)(2) and 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure effectively limit service of a subpoena to \n     any place within, or within 100 miles of, the district of the \n     court by which it is issued, unless a statute of the United \n     States expressly provides that the court, upon proper \n     application and cause shown, may authorize the service of a \n     subpoena at any other place.\n       (3) Litigating a Federal cause of action under the \n     September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 is likely to \n     involve the testimony and the production of other documents \n     and tangible things by a substantial number of witnesses, \n     many of whom may not reside, be employed, or regularly \n     transact business in, or within 100 miles of, the Southern \n     District of New York.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I am sure he has spoken with Senator \nSpecter. It is time we did some of these, and we are going to do them \ntomorrow, the exact time of which I do not know, but they will be done \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand adjourned until 9 a.m. tomorrow, \nOctober 4; that on Thursday, following the prayer and pledge, the \nJournal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed \nexpired, the time for the two leaders reserved for their use later in \nthe day, and there then be a period of morning business for 60 minutes, \nwith Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled between the Democrats and \nthe Republicans, with the Republicans controlling the first half; that \nat the close of morning business, the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3093, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and \nScience Appropriations Act.\n  Mr. President, I would also say to all the Members, we are going to \ndo our best to finish this bill tomorrow.\n  We are going to give it the old college try. I think we should be \nable to do it. It is an important bill. We are going to do our very \nbest to do that.\n  I would also say that the next appropriations bill we are going to \nmove to is the Labor-HHS bill, which is extremely important. Again, I \nhave had conversations the last several days with the Republican \nleader, and we are now moving through the process. The bill to go to \nconference has not been held up by the Republicans. The Democrats have \nheld themselves up. We have not been able to get the 302(b) allocations \nand the other things we needed to work out to be able to do that. Now \nwe are in the process of being able to do that as of yesterday, so we \nexpect to move very expeditiously on these bills so that we can get a \nbill or bills to the President as soon as possible.\n  My goal is to finish what we need to do here by November 16. It is \neasy to say that and it is hard to do, but that certainly is my \ntimetable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just add that I couldn't agree \nmore with what the majority leader has just indicated his goals are, \nand he will have great cooperation on this side of the aisle to achieve \nthe goal of finishing these bills and wrapping up our business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/03/senate-section/article/S12693-8", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
