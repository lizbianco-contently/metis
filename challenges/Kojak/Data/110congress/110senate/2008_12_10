Mr. President, following the leaders' remarks, I ask \nunanimous consent that we stand in a period of morning business until \n12:30 today; and that from 12:30 to 2:15 the Senate stand in recess.\n  The Republicans are going to hold a caucus at that time. I ask \nunanimous consent that be approved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is Wednesday, and each day we come here \nand say the document that is going to be the bill that we are going to \nreport on is done. Now I understand it is done. But the piece of paper \nis not before the Senate. There are two provisions I have instructed \nSenator Dodd--and he has agreed--to take out of the document we are \nmoving forward on, and that should be done momentarily.\n  I understand, in fairness, that all parties, Democrats and \nRepublicans, deserve the opportunity to study this bill. It is about 25 \npages long, as I understand it. But even though we have some speed \nreaders in the Senate, they still need time to study it. In speaking \nwith various Senators today, it appears pretty clear that the minority, \nthe Republicans, are not going to move forward on this unless there is \na lot of opportunity to study this legislation.\n  Therefore, it appears unlikely we will be able to have a vote on this \ntoday. That being the case, let me say I will file the work done by the \nBanking Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, because they are not \ntotally in agreement with what is done by the House.\n  That way I will have it here, we will file the necessary motions on \nthat, which would mean we would have a cloture vote on Friday on a \nmotion to proceed to it. Now, we can always move that forward with \nunanimous consent. But everyone should understand, if this is something \nthat everyone is going to make us dot every I and cross every T, then \nwe would have that cloture vote early Friday morning, maybe as early as \n9 o'clock.\n  If we did that, then the second vote would not take place until \nSaturday afternoon at about 3 o'clock, give or take a little bit of \ntime. Then everyone can do the math as well as I can. The next vote \nwould probably take place about 9 o'clock on Sunday. So the point is, \nif everybody is not cooperative and wants to create problems, we would \nnot be able to complete this until Saturday or Sunday, but we are going \nto complete it. And when I say ``complete it,'' that means we are going \nto have our final vote on it, it will either pass or fail, but we are \ngoing to give Senators an opportunity to vote.\n  As indicated in the press today, Senator Biden said he would be \nwilling to come back and vote if his vote were necessary. I apologize \nto everyone but not too sincerely, because I have done the best I can \nto move this forward. It is difficult.\n  We have the House, the Senate, the White House, and once in a while \nwe hear from the new administration. So it has made it real difficult \nto come up with a final piece of paper, which I hope will be \nforthcoming in the next few minutes. But I think I have done the best I \ncan to alert everyone. I know there are lots of people, Democrats and\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\nRepublicans have a lot of important work to do. But this is also \nimportant business we are dealing with, dealing with the Detroit \nautomobile manufacturers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10842-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me pick up on the issue the \nmajority leader was discussing. Of course, we are not going to agree to \nexpedite a procedure to a bill we have not read. The fundamental \nproblem here--I know this is not the majority leader's fault--is we \nhave not been able to get a copy of the bill that we believe represents \nan agreement that has been reached between congressional Democrats and \nthe White House on the automobile package.\n  Until we get the actual bill and can read it, it is unrealistic to \nexpect that I can ask my Members to advance consideration of the bill \nuntil we know what is in it. So as soon as we can have a look at it--we \nwill be having a conference today on my side. Hopefully, we will have \nthe bill by then. But as of this morning, we still have not seen a \nfinal version of the bill. Once we do, we will review it and see if it \nmeets our standard for support, which will be the taxpayers' standard \nfor support.\n  But as I indicated--and the majority leader has already picked up on \nthat--there cannot be a vote on the legislation today because we do not \nknow what it looks like.\n  On a bill this critical, with so much taxpayer money at stake, we \ncannot rush this through without adequate review. We are happy to begin \nthe review process as soon as we get a product. My Members will be \ndiscussing the merits of the latest version of the plan, as I \nindicated, at our weekly policy lunch, which will occur today around \nnoon. So this afternoon I expect to have some more substantive thoughts \non this latest proposal's chances for support within the Republican \nconference. We will address this issue before the end of the week. I \nagree with the majority leader on that.\n  For those who need a refresher, let me remind everyone of the \nRepublican criteria for this legislation: First and foremost, we will \nnot let taxpayers spend their hard-earned money on ailing car makers \nunless these companies are forced to reform their bad habits, either \ninside or outside bankruptcy.\n  This means workers will not be paid not to work, it means a final \nbill would not interfere with pending environmental lawsuits in a one-\nsided manner, and it means struggling car companies will have to \nrationalize their cost structures because a company that does not \nrespond to market conditions is a company that is doomed to failure \nanyway. Republicans will not allow taxpayers to subsidize failure.\n  As I have said repeatedly, my Republican colleagues and I wish to put \nstruggling car makers on a path to long-term success, but, obviously, \nthere will not be widespread support for a plan that does not do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say in response to my friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, we have had cooperation in moving \nforward on this legislation. I have not been a big fan of the White \nHouse, as everyone knows, for the last 8 years. But they have, in good \nfaith, worked with us trying to get a piece of legislation we can bring \nbefore this body.\n  That is one reason it has taken so long. But President Bush is still \nPresident of the United States. He has tremendous power and rightfully \nso. Senator Obama is not, in any way, wanting to step on that. So this \nis something that is important. I totally understand what the \nRepublican leader is saying. If I were in his place, I would do the \nsame thing. It is not fair to ask that we move forward on this \nlegislation without people having the opportunity to read it and study \nit and talk to others about what is in it.\n  I would hope, through, after we get the legislation, we can work \nsomething out to expedite the procedural matters. No one is under the \nillusion that we can do it on a simple majority; we are going to have \nto get 60 votes. I hope there is support from both sides of the aisle. \nI am fairly confident there will be. We will, later tonight, revisit \nwhat we might be able to do tomorrow and/or Friday to complete this \nlegislation. We will do our very utmost to get this legislation \ncompleted so the Republican leader can take to his caucus the document \nso people can start, hopefully even before that, poring through it.\n  I have said so many times this thing is done, it is on its way, and \nhave been disappointed when my staff says: Well, there are a few more \nissues that have come up. I think that has ended. I certainly hope so. \nI hope that at 12:30, when we recess, both the Republicans and the \nDemocrats have a piece of legislation they can look at.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10842-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the floor of this \nChamber for the final time in my service as a Senator from the State of \nNorth Carolina. As I do, I cannot help but think back some 12 and a \nhalf years ago, when I sat up in the Senate Gallery to watch another \nSenator Dole, my husband Bob, deliver his farewell speech in this \nChamber after nearly three decades of service.\n  Bob began his remarks by reflecting on words spoken by Abraham \nLincoln in 1860, when a delegation arrived in Springfield, IL, to \nofficially inform him he had been nominated by his party for the \nPresidency. Lincoln spoke just two sentences, and then he said to the \nlarge crowd of friends and neighbors gathered on his lawn:\n\n       Now I will no longer defer the pleasure of taking each of \n     you by the hand.\n\n  I rise with a heart full of gratitude, and, like President Lincoln \nand like Bob Dole, what I wish I could do is to take the hand of all \nthose who have helped me on my life's journey and to express my \nheartfelt thanks. I would begin with friends from my home State. I have \nbeen blessed to serve the public in numerous capacities during my \ncareer. Without question, the highest honor has been representing North \nCarolina in the Senate. I thank my fellow Tar Heels for granting me the \nprivilege of serving them.\n  Then there are a number of North Carolinians now gone whom I wish I \ncould take by the hand again to thank them for the examples they set, \nthe values they instilled in me and the love, guidance, and support \nthey provided.\n  There is my grandmother, Mom Cathey. I can still vividly recall the \nSunday afternoons spent with other neighborhood children at her home. \nWe would enjoy lemonade and homemade cookies while Mom Cathey read from \nher Bible, which is now one of my most cherished possessions. My \ngrandmother practiced what she preached, and she truly lived her life \nfor others.\n  My beloved father John Hanford always supported my interests and \ntaught me that anything worth doing deserved my best effort. When I \nwanted to run for president of my high school, which was not something \ngirls did in those days, he stood right behind me cheering me on. He \nwas protective but not overbearing.\n  My precious mother Mary, who passed away just shy of 103 years old, \nwas also front and center in my life. She taught me at a very young age \nthat the real joy in life is giving back to your community and helping \nthose around you, and she was always there to urge me to go the extra \nmile: You finished your homework early. Have you thought about entering \nthat essay contest? Unbeknownst to her, mother's example of hard work \nand dedication drew me toward public service as my mission field, my \npassion. She was a constant source of inspiration.\n\n[[Page S10843]]\n\n  My dear brother John, 13 years my senior, who passed away earlier \nthis year, was a role model I put on a pedestal. He encouraged me at \nevery turn, providing me with invaluable counsel and infinite support. \nAnd there is no finer example of a beautiful, caring heart, a person \nwho lives her faith, than John's wife Bunny.\n  Speaking of faith, I am so proud of my two nephews, John Hanford III, \ncurrently traveling the world as our U.S. Ambassador at Large for \nreligious freedom, and Jody Hanford, his brother, 17 years with Campus \nCrusade for Christ and 15 visits to work in Russia and Ukraine.\n  I also wish I could thank teachers such as Agnes Weant, whose \ndedication to young people led her outside the classroom on more than \none evening to discuss colleges and future opportunities with my \nparents, and Duke University's dean, Florence Brinkley, who encouraged \nme to spend a summer in England studying at Oxford.\n  Because of the support and encouragement I received from family, \nfriends, and teachers, I ventured to Washington, seeking to be part of \nsomething greater than myself. As a young adult, I was incredibly \nfortunate to encounter several great mentors who offered me direction, \nopportunity, and encouragement, mentors such as Bill Cochrane, who was \nthought of by many as North Carolina's third Senator. Bill served in \nthe office of North Carolina Democratic Senator B. Everett Jordan, and \nhe was like a one-man personnel office, assisting eager young people in \nfinding jobs in Washington. During the summer of 1960, I worked in \nSenator Jordan's office. Knowing that firsthand historical experiences \nare much treasured by young people, Bill helped me get a front-row \nticket to my first national campaign on board Vice Presidential nominee \nLyndon B. Johnson's whistle stop tour of the South. Although my \nstaunchly Republican father was concerned about my riding through the \nSouth, especially through Salisbury, my hometown, on LBJ's train, I \nknew Bill Cochrane was giving me an unmatchable learning experience, \nand I was right.\n  And how I wish I could hold out a hand of thanks to a remarkable \nwoman who served in this Chamber for many years, Margaret Chase Smith \nof Maine. While working for Senator Jordan, I had the gall to request a \nmeeting with Senator Smith. She didn't know me from Adam, but not only \ndid she agree to see me, she devoted an entire hour to sharing her \nthoughts and encouraging me to get a law degree so I could bring some \nadditional skills to a public policy job. I took her advice and entered \nHarvard Law School 2 years later. Senator Smith's example taught me the \nimportance of having an open door for younger people who also seek \npublic service as a noble endeavor and might need a little advice and \nmentoring along the way.\n  I was privileged to have the best mentor imaginable in Virginia \nKnauer, special assistant to President Nixon for consumer affairs. \nVirginia, a truly unselfish boss, wanted me as her deputy to have every \nexperience that she had--my first testimony before Congress, my first \npress conference, speeches across America. After working with her for 5 \nyears, Virginia wanted to support my nomination to the Federal Trade \nCommission. ``Oh, no, Virginia,'' I remember telling her. I said, ``I \nlove being your deputy'' when she broached the subject. Virginia \nreplied:\n\n       Elizabeth, you have grown and learned as much as you can in \n     this job. It is time for you to spread your wings.\n\n  In other words, she nudged me out of the nest. To this day, Virginia, \nat age 93, remains one of my most cherished friends, and I am grateful \nto President Nixon for my many years on the Federal Trade Commission.\n  I am indebted to former President Ronald Reagan for asking me to \nserve as his Secretary of Transportation and to President George \nHerbert Walker Bush for the privilege of serving as Secretary of Labor. \nAnd I thank the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross and their \narmy of millions of volunteers for allowing me to serve 8 years as \ntheir president. At each of these positions, I have been fortunate, \nindeed, to be part of a team of extraordinary, hard-working men and \nwomen. I thank all those who have shared the mission fields with me \nover the years.\n  My special thanks to my very talented and capable Senate staff. These \nincredible men and women understand what it means to be true servants \nof the public, to have a passion for what they do. Yes, we have shared \na mission field. We have worked hard. We have had some fun along the \nway, too, and we made a positive difference for North Carolina and \nAmerica.\n  I thank all Members of the U.S. Senate. I knew many of you as friends \nlong before becoming your colleague, and you will remain my friends \nafter I depart the Senate. You will surely be in my thoughts and \nprayers as you steer our country through the challenging times ahead.\n  Most especially, I thank my incredibly supportive husband Bob, who is \na constant example--and probably for some of you as well--that a leader \nshould have not only a strong backbone but also a funny bone. From \narmed service to public service, elected six times by his Republican \ncolleagues to be their leader, Bob's more than half a century of \nservice to our country is a constant inspiration. Because of his \nleadership, we now have the beautiful memorial to the men and women of \nWorld War II. Bob's compassion and caring for his fellow man, exhibited \nthrough his actions in both public and private life, are to me \nunparalleled. He remains the light of my life. For all that you have \ndone for me and for countless others and for our country, I thank you, \nBob, from the bottom of my heart.\n  I could never have dreamed of the people I have been privileged to \nmeet, the jobs I have been privileged to hold, or the issues I have \nbeen privileged to influence. Perhaps Theodore Roosevelt said it best \nwith these words:\n\n       Far and away, the best prize life has to offer is the \n     chance to work hard at work worth doing.\n\n  I am so very fortunate to have found that best prize as a servant of \nthe public. While I don't know what awaits me in life's journey, what \nwill come next, I pray that I will find a way to continue to work hard \nat work worth doing.\n  May God bless America, and may God bless the United States Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10843-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10843-S10844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BAILOUT DECISION\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the very important issue \nbefore the Congress this week: the proposed bailout of the three major \nU.S. auto manufacturers. Of course, I have looked at this issue and the \nproposals that have been put forward very carefully because this is \nsuch a serious issue. I have studied the draft language that was \nreleased on Monday that certainly constitutes the proposal as we have \nknown it for the last few days. I have followed all of the discussions \nand ongoing negotiations and ongoing changes to that language proposed \nMonday. In fact, I have offered concrete--hopefully helpful--\nsuggestions of movements that could possibly garner my support. Based \non all of that, after very careful thought and consideration, I have \nreached two inescapable conclusions for me. First, I cannot support \nthis proposed bailout of the three U.S. auto manufacturers. Second, \nbecause I believe this proposal actually dooms those companies to \nfailure, doesn't save them from it, I will use every procedural tool \navailable to demand an amendment process on the floor of the Senate and \nto delay and block the measure as it presently stands.\n  I don't come to this conclusion lightly. I certainly realize that the \nfailure of these companies, should they go under, would be devastating, \nfirst for millions of individuals and fine American families and \nsecondly for our economy as a whole. In reaching this decision, I don't \ntrivialize or minimize in any way the impact of that sort of failure. \nCertainly that has been brought home to bear in my State, particularly \nin northwest Louisiana. We have a significant GM plant in Shreveport. I \nam very aware of the positive impact of that plant. I am very aware of \nthe workers there, the families, the suppliers who are affected. And, \nof course, all across our State, I am very aware of auto dealers and \nother folks who are tied so closely to this industry. I oppose this \nbailout plan, not in spite of the suffering to all those folks and our \neconomy that failure of these companies would bring, I oppose this\n\n[[Page S10844]]\n\nbailout plan because of that level of suffering, because of that \nsignificance to individual workers and families and the economy as a \nwhole.\n  That may seem a bit of an odd statement to some folks. Why do I say \nthat? Well, for two reasons. No. 1, this proposal, at its core, is \nabout giving these companies $15 billion of loans, $15 billion on the \npromise of a detailed restructuring plan yet to come. So we give them \nsignificant amounts of money--$15 billion--so that they go through that \nprocess, so that they start that discussion, so that they come back to \nus months later with a detailed restructuring plan.\n  Well, my reaction to that is pretty simple. I think the average \nAmerican would say: What? Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? \n$15 billion, and then later, after that is out the door, we will see a \ndetailed restructuring plan? Secondly, even more important than that, \nit means that the impetus, the pressure to make that restructuring \ntruly fundamental, truly to the core, which is absolutely necessary for \nthese companies to survive, that pressure is not nearly as great as if \nwe held the money until that detailed restructuring plan was presented.\n  The second reason I will vote against this bailout plan, the second \nreason I believe it actually would doom these companies to failure is \nthat I believe it politicizes the management of these companies right \nat a time where they need to move in the opposite direction so that \nbusiness and engineering considerations alone guide their company's \nfutures.\n  Let me say bluntly, I have no confidence--absolutely no confidence--\nin the present management of these three companies. But let me also \nsay, if there is a way for that to go from bad to worse, it is by \ninjecting into the process politics and a political appointee such as \nthis so-called car czar. That would make a very bad situation very much \nworse. It would politicize further the management of these companies, \nagain, when they need to move to a situation where business and \nengineering considerations alone guide their decisions.\n  Another good, specific example of this politicization is language \nwhich has been in the proposal so far to actually prohibit these \ncompanies from legally challenging various moves for individual States \nto impose onerous, complicated, different environmental standards on \nthem. Again, we are bringing political mandates, political pressure, \npolitical decisions to bear right at a time when these companies need \nto move in the opposite direction, get away from all of that, which has \nbeen a part of the reason they are where they are today, and base their \nfuture decisions on business and engineering considerations alone.\n  For these companies to survive, no matter what taxpayer dollars are \ninvolved, they need truly core fundamental restructuring. They need to \nrevamp and revisit all their obligations, all their business models, \nall their labor contracts, all their dealership associations--\neverything that constitutes them as they presently are. They need to do \nthat; if not in a bankruptcy process, they need to do that through a \nprocess which is the equivalent of bankruptcy, just by another name.\n  This plan which is being worked on and will be presented before us is \nnot that. What is worse, it is not only not that, I believe it will \nprevent that from ever happening and will, therefore, doom these \ncompanies to failure, no matter what taxpayer dollars are thrown at \nthem.\n  Again, for this reason, I have reached what is for me a clear and \ninescapable conclusion. No. 1, I cannot support this general bailout \nplan. No. 2, because I believe this plan will actually doom the \ncompanies to failure, I will use every procedural tool available to \ndemand a fair and open amendment process on the floor of the Senate and \nto delay and block the measure as it presently stands.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield back the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, yesterday, I came before the Senate to pay \ntribute to Pennsylvanians who gave, as Abraham Lincoln said, ``the last \nfull measure of devotion'' to their country serving in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  Therefore, today, I would like to take this opportunity to honor the \nmen and women of Pennsylvania who have served in Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan. This struggle began in the weeks following the \ngravest attack on American soil; it was a direct response to eliminate \nthe sanctuary of those who plotted the horrific events of 9/11.\n  The men and women who have served in Afghanistan have faced extreme \ndanger but have persevered with a can-do spirit. Our men and women of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces are indeed in a class of their own--all their \nown, I should say. And, like their brothers and sisters serving in \nIraq, they mourn the sacrifices of their own.\n  So today in the Senate, I would also like to enter into the \nCongressional Record the names of those 25 Pennsylvanian heroes who may \nhave fallen in the battles of Afghanistan but who have only risen in \nour appreciation for their service and sacrifice.

Mr. President, I rise during this Christmas season to \nshare with the Senate and the Nation an inspirational story from my \nhome State of Montana. As a former public school teacher myself, I have \nknown for a long time how amazing Montana's young people can be. This \nstory is a story of triumph over tragedy that serves as the latest \nreminder.\n  Early on the morning of September 18, Montanans in and around \nYellowstone County woke up to learn the tragic news that the Huntley \nProject\n\n[[Page S10845]]\n\nschool in Worden, MT, was on fire--an act of arson. Despite the valiant \nefforts by crews from the Worden, Shepherd, Lockwood, and Billings fire \ndepartments, the school burned to the ground.\n  Although sad and angry about the fire, teachers, parents, students, \nand the whole community rallied to support the student body. As the \nBillings Gazette reported at the time:\n\n       Huntley Project High was still burning when people in the \n     tight-knit community vowed that the loss wouldn't affect \n     their spirits.\n\n  Montana's Superintendent of Schools, Linda McCulloch, put out a \nrequest statewide for schools and businesses to donate school supplies \nand books and backpacks and computers. Montana's business community and \ncitizens opened their hearts and their wallets, even in this tough \neconomic time, to help these students.\n  Billings School Superintendent Jack Copps arranged for classes to \ncontinue in the Billings school district at Skyview High School and at \nother facilities to help them get through the first days after the \nfire. Later, temporary trailers were brought to the Huntley campus to \nhelp during the rebuilding process. The 230 Huntley High School \nstudents soldiered on in the spirit of their homecoming theme--that \nbeing warriors. They simply refused to give up. I met with \nSuperintendent Dave Mahon last month and toured the burned campus.\n  The Huntley Project Red Devils have long been a power in Class B \nfootball. After the fire, the whole community rallied to cheer the team \nthat symbolized Huntley's toughness in the face of an unbelievable \nchallenge. The principal said it well: ``We're red and black and we're \nback,'' as Huntley beat the Townsend Bulldogs in their first game after \nthe fire. There would be many more victories as the team finished a \nperfect season with a record of 12-0. Last month, Huntley beat the \npowerful team from Fairfield 41 to 28 to win the Class B State \nchampionship in football as players from both teams played their guts \nout and left it all out on the field. It was the first State \nchampionship for the project since 1998.\n  I wish to congratulate head coach Jay Santy, as well as assistant \ncoaches Rick Dees, Mark Wandle, and Lenny Brown, all of the players and \ntheir parents, their teachers and friends and supporters throughout the \nHuntley community.\n  America faces some tough challenges today. Last month, more than a \nhalf a million American workers lost their jobs. Many parts of the \ncountry are suffering from the foreclosure crisis in the housing market \nand the domestic automobile industry teeters on the brink of collapse. \nAs we work here to tackle those tough challenges, I suggest we follow \nthe example of perseverance of these tough young Montanans. I suggest \nwe lace up our cleats, strap on our helmets, and go out and get the job \ndone.\n  As we approach the Christmas season, I urge the Senate to look at \nHuntley Project school and the greater community and look to the future \nwith hope and grit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise in tribute to the spirit of \nrecovery for the Huntley Project High School which was destroyed in an \nearly morning fire on Thursday, September 18. The bottomless community \nspirit and immediate outpouring of support from around Montana has \nenabled this school, its faculty and staff, 230 students, their parents \nand supporters to put their energies and efforts into opening its \ndoors. Through the extraordinary leadership of school superintendent \nDave Mahon and principal Tynie Mader, students gathered in the junior \nhigh auditorium at 8:15 a.m. on Monday, September 22, to receive school \nsupplies and restart the school year in the wake of the fire. Classes \nare being held in trailers located on the practice field west of the \nburned high school.\n  The weekend following the fire, families and members of the community \ncame together to clean up temporary classrooms for use, donate funds to \nreplenish music and sports equipment, books and computers lost in the \nfire. Donations have come in from communities across Montana  the Malta \nSchool District sent $500 to help, having experienced a devastating \nfire in 1995. The school has received bandstands from Absarokee \nschools, cleats from a major sports corporation, backpacks from \nBillings elementary schools, donations from the local banks and area \nbusinesses and offers from as far away as North Carolina.\n  The students have taken it upon themselves to shoulder part of the \nburden. They have applied to the television show ``Extreme Makeover'' \nto get their school rebuilt. They have been an integral part of \nsorting, carrying and cleaning school equipment. And their academic and \nextracurricular activities are getting an extra dose of school spirit \nthese days.\n  The school and community rallied around the athletic teams at Huntley \nProject following the devastating fire. This burst of school spirit \nhelped propel the Huntley Project Red Devils to the Montana Class B \nState championship in football on November 22. Huntley Project defeated \nFairfield High 41-28. The victory in the State title game on the Red \nDevils home field capped off a perfect season for coach Jay Santy and \nhis players. A sign on the fence encircling the field said ``Devils \nrisen up with the flames.'' Indeed this statement is true of all in the \nHuntley Project community. The Red Devils girls volleyball team also \nrose to the occasion to excel this season. After being displaced from \ntheir gym due to the fire, the team was forced to practice and play all \ntheir games away from home. Despite this added challenge the squad led \nby coach Iona Stookey placed third at the State class B volleyball \ntournament. I would like to congratulate these fine student athletes, \ntheir coaches and teachers, and all in the Huntley Project community \nnot only for their achievements on the playing field but also for \ncoming together to support each other and working to rebuild the \nschool.\n  Much has been done. More will need to be done. But we are Montanans, \nand we have that frontier spirit and grit that pulls a community \ntogether without question and without hesitation in times of need. In \nthe meantime, we are all pulling for the Huntley Project Red Devils \nuntil their school is rebuilt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, obviously we have been in negotiations \nwith a tremendous amount of work going on around the question of the \nAmerican auto industry and the position they find themselves in as a \nresult of, first of all and foremost, a global credit crisis. So I \nstand here today on behalf of hundreds of thousands of incredibly \nsmart, productive, working men and women in Michigan and the millions \nof others around the country who design, build, service, finance, and \nsell American-made automobiles and have done so now for over a \ngeneration--the people who not only build the parts that are given to \nthe auto industry but to the vehicles that our brave men and women \ndrive right now in Iraq and around the globe, those who have built \nAmerica and the American middle class, those who advertise and market \nand are engaged in so many different ways in the foundation of American \nmanufacturing, which is the American auto industry.\n  I also wish to speak on behalf of Americans today who have benefited \nfrom a great American middle class, built on the notion that we don't \njust move paper around on Wall Street, we actually make things and we \ngrow things. I know the distinguished occupant of the chair, from \nPennsylvania, understands that, coming from a great State that makes \nthings, grows things, adds value to it, people who work hard every day. \nThe shower they may take is after work rather than before work, but \nthey are just as valuable--and, I argue, maybe more valuable--in terms\n\n[[Page S10846]]\n\nof creating economic vitality and strength of an American middle class. \nThat is why every other country in the world looks to us and is rushing \nto support their auto industry and manufacturing, to create what we \nhave had in America as a result of hard-working men and women in the \nauto industry and other parts of manufacturing. So that is really why \nwe are here.\n  I thank our leader for his incredible diligence and patience. Senator \nReid understands the importance of this issue. He understands what is \nat stake in terms of 3 million Americans and their jobs and the broader \nimpact on the economy. I thank him for his incredible leadership.\n  I thank the Speaker of the House for coming forward and being willing \nto negotiate and be a part of the solution and for the great leadership \nshe is now providing and will be providing in the House.\n  I also thank our chairman, Chris Dodd, who has had, as chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, so many things he has had to confront, from the \nhousing crisis, where he was way ahead in calling for action that we \nnow know should have been done back when he called for it to be done, \nas well as his willingness to work with us now on the other piece for \nAmericans. Most Americans invest in a home, and they hope they will \nhave equity that will help them in retiring or taking care of their \nchildren's college education or will be there in an emergency. The next \nthing they buy is their automobile to get them to work, to get the kids \nto school, to go on vacation, to be able to enjoy the American dream. I \nthank Chairman Dodd because he has had crises in both of these \nincredibly important industries to our economy and to American families \nplaced at his doorstep. He and his staff have done an amazing job.\n  I also say that for Chairman Barney Frank, for the same efforts and \nwillingness to focus on people on Main Street--the majority of \nAmericans--not just on Wall Street. That is what this is really all \nabout.\n  I thank the Republican colleagues who have been and will continue to \nbe involved. Senator McConnell has been working and raising legitimate \nissues relating to accountability, transparency, things that are \nresolved, I believe, in this work that will be coming before us. I \nthank the White House for working with us in good faith, and Senator \nVoinovich and Senator Kit Bond--all of those who care deeply and have \ncome together in what is a bipartisan bill that is in front of us.\n  Mr. President, how did we get here? There are a lot of scenarios. I \nunderstand people who are mad at the industry for making the Hummer and \nare mad at decisions made 10, 15, 20 years ago, and some think workers \nget paid too much. I don't agree with them. All kinds of perspectives \nhave come together to make this a difficult issue to deal with.\n  What is lost, unfortunately, in all this is the real story of today's \nauto industry. This is not your father's factory. These are people \nproducing the marquee vehicles in quality, competing, winning awards, \nand are highly productive. They are the envy of the world in \nproductivity. These are companies that have turned the corner and are \nrushing to the fuel efficiency vehicles. We could argue that it is not \nfast enough. I argue it is not fast enough. The early decisions should \nhave been different, but they now find themselves in a situation where \nthey are doing exactly what we want them to do. We have passed a 40-\npercent increase in fuel efficiency standards. We put in place in the \nfall funding for a provision, which I was proud to champion, in the \nEnergy bill to help keep the jobs here in America, poised to take major \ncosts off of the industry by the United Auto Workers stepping up and \nbeing willing to take the risk on retiree health care, to move it off \nof the employer, and a major focus on a year from now when the new \nvehicles will be coming out and retooling is happening. Everything is \nmoving just as we would want it to be.\n  And then a global credit crisis. We know about that because of the \nmajor debate and what we were asked to do by this administration, to \nstep up in an unprecedented way to be able to address this crisis. \nUnfortunately, money that was given to the banks has not been lent. I \nhave suppliers that I have met who are not able to get the financing \nthey need. We know dollars given to Wall Street have not made their way \nto the financing arms of the auto industry, to people needing the \nloans, to auto dealers, and so on. We also know in a global credit \ncrisis that this is not just in America. All around the world now, we \nare in a situation where there is the perfect storm that is occurring. \nSo we look at a result of the tight credit crisis and low consumer \nconfidence right now and the concern, frankly, we start seeing that \nsomeone may go bankrupt and people hold back on buying a car. So the \nwhole debate we are having is actually making it worse, unfortunately, \neven though we have to have a debate.\n  In November, auto sales dropped more than 30 percent--can you imagine \nany business that sees a 30-percent drop from a year ago--the worst \nmonth in 25 years for the second straight month. This is not just the \ndomestic automakers. Yes, GM sales dropped 41 percent; Chrysler, 47; \nFord, 31. Toyota dropped 34 percent, the folks they are always compared \nto, as somehow they are magically more efficient, which is not true. \nToyota dropped 44 percent; Honda, 32 percent. The reality is, this is a \nglobal credit crisis.\n  We have a severe global credit crisis, consumers unwilling or unable \nbecause they have lost their job--they are cutting back--to purchase a \nvehicle, and it has hit capital-intensive companies the hardest. We can \ntalk to those who make washing machines or refrigerators or furniture \nand so on. These are capital-intensive companies. Here we go, we can \nsay, we shouldn't make anything anymore. Instead of worrying about \nforeign oil, let's worry about foreign tanks. See how many folks want \nto give us a tank in the war. Let's worry about foreign furniture, \nrefrigerators, batteries. We are America, the greatest country in the \nworld. We don't need to make anything. We can trade credit swaps. \nObviously, that makes no sense. This is about where we go as a country \nin terms of our basic industries.\n  Automakers in Great Britain, China, Japan, Brazil, and the European \nUnion have all asked for help and are getting it, by the way. They are \nreceiving it. French President Sarkozy has introduced a $25 billion \nstrategic investment fund because they understand they want an \nautomobile industry in France and how important it is to their economy, \nand they want to compete with us. The European Investment Bank is \nconsidering $51 billion in loans. China has done the same kind of thing \nfor Chery Automobile. Brazil has stepped up. Australia has stepped up. \nYou can go right around the globe. It seems that everybody, but some \nhere understand this is more than just penalizing a company you are mad \nat. This is about the underpinnings of our economy and fundamentally \nwhether we are going to compete with every other country and make \nthings in an advanced manufacturing economy that we are in right now.\n  Everyone understands we are in a race. Everybody else is racing, \ngiving hundreds of millions of dollars to their companies, government \nfunding for innovation. We don't do that. We put it on the backs of the \ncompanies. Every other country funds health care differently. Their \ncompanies don't have to have health care costs. Our companies pay for \nit.\n  We can go right across the board when we talk about parity, how we \nneed to get parity. I am all for parity, if we look at the full \npicture. Parity includes saying to South Korea that sold over 700,000 \nvehicles to us last year: You have to let more than 6,300 American cars \ninto your country. We did have a big discussion about parity. I welcome \nit. I have stood on this floor more times than I can count to talk \nabout parity. But that is not what this is about. This is about a \nglobal credit crisis.\n  The question is: Does it matter if we have an American auto industry? \nIs it important to make cars in America, trucks in America, tanks, the \nStryker? Is it important to make airplanes? Or as long as we can buy \nthem it doesn't matter? I hope the answer is, yes, we need in America a \nmanufacturing base, an auto industry.\n  One out of 10 jobs in this country is auto related--1 out of 10. In \nthe middle of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, can we \nafford to say: 1 out of 10, it doesn't matter. I certainly hope not.\n\n[[Page S10847]]\n\n  Our country lost 533,000 jobs just in November, bringing our \nunemployment rate nationally to 6.7 percent, which, by the way, we in \nMichigan would take that 6.7 percent and I bet you would too. We are in \nthe heart of where this global economic crisis has hit.\n  The domestic auto companies provide health care and pensions to over \na million retirees and their families which, by the way, if anybody \ngoes bankrupt, open your checkbook because the Federal Government is \ngoing to take over those payments.\n  When we talk about what happens if only one of these companies goes \nbankrupt and the cost to the taxpayers, it will make the numbers we are \nasking for in a loan look like pennies, look like nothing. That is the \nreality of where we are.\n  Motor vehicle parts suppliers provide over 780,000 direct employment \njobs, contributing 4.5 million private industry jobs and 5.5 percent of \nall manufacturing jobs. When we stop and think about it, there is more \ncomputer power in our automobiles than anything else we own. When we \ntalk about Silicon Valley, their customers are automation alley--\nMichigan. Think about what is in your automobile--the computer power, \nthe radios, the leather, and the cloth for the seats, the tires, the \nglass. I can go on and on. It is all connected.\n  In fact, the U.S. military relies, for instance, on Chrysler Cummins \nB series engine, which is commonly known as the Dodge Ram, for uses as \nboth propulsion and electric generator power. This is one example of a \nproduction line that has to be kept open for our national security. Let \nme give other examples for the military.\n  Even for my colleagues who don't care about the domestic auto \nindustry but care very much about defense and national security and \nwhat is happening to our brave men and women around the world, \nArvinMeritor, a major supplier to all three automakers, has been a \nmajor supplier of axles to the Army for its 2\\1/2\\ and 5-ton vehicles \nfor over 50 years. Axles--it makes sense--tank axles, truck axles. It \nmakes sense. Do you think their major auto customer can go bankrupt and \nnot pay them and have them continue to do business in this economy. \nHighly unlikely.\n  Goodyear Tire, GM's second largest tire supplier, has supplied tires \nfor the U.S. military for over 100 years.\n  Navis, a key supplier of engine technology to Ford, produces a \nvariety of widely deployed military trucks and light vehicles, \nincluding the MRAP. Where have we heard about the MRAP? A key supplier \nof Ford supplies the MRAP, the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, \nthe deployment of which was, by all accounts, pivotal in the Iraq \ncampaign. Ford supplied technology--the joint light tactical vehicle \nand the future tactical truck system.\n  Dana Corporation is a leading supplier of highly specialized axles to \nboth the American auto industry and the military.\n  I could go on and on.\n  The point is, you don't shut down one piece of this and not have it \naffect everything else. This is a case of dominos going right across \nthe country to every single person's State.\n\n  The failure of our industry would have debilitating ramifications for \nour entire industrial base and undermine our ability to respond to \ncurrent and future military challenges.\n  As I indicated, other countries understand and have been investing \nhuge amounts of money to get ahead of us in a number of areas, \nincluding the battery technology we all want in America for that next \ngeneration of hybrid vehicle, that electric vehicle about which we are \nall talking.\n  Germany has announced the Great Battery Alliance which will invest \n$160 million in advanced lithium-ion batteries,\n  South Korea will spend $700 million; China also. India has developed \nan automotive mission plan. We don't even have a manufacturing strategy \ntoday for America. Our strategy is: Hey, they can't make it on their \nown, we will go buy it somewhere else. That is just batteries. That is \nnot all the other pieces.\n  We could go into health care and what is happening in trade and what \nhas happened.\n  I have heard colleagues--and I am sure we are going to hear it \nagain--say: Just let them go into bankruptcy. They will reorganize, \nrestructure, come out a stronger company, and go forward. \nUnfortunately, in the automobile industry, it is not the same as a \nbankrupt airline. I flew on an airline in bankruptcy. You buy a ticket, \nyou take one flight. That is it. That is different. This is the second \nmost important purchase a family makes. You want to look at whether \nparts will be available, will they be able to meet their warranties. It \nis a whole different situation in automobiles.\n  The Center for Automotive Research, in looking at this very closely, \nfound that if one or more of the top three automotive companies files \nfor bankruptcy, we can expect about 2.5 million lost jobs, direct job \nlosses, as well as a number of other industries about which I talked.\n  How tragic and, I say, outrageous, at a time when we have a wonderful \nvisionary new President coming in, carrying all the hopes and dreams of \nall of us, talking about creating 2.5 million jobs next year, to have \nall that wiped out by our inability to come together and address this \nsituation this week. I am optimistic we will come together and do that. \nIt would certainly be a blow to the hopes and dreams of the American \npublic of creating new jobs for next year and beyond.\n  I talked about the fact that suppliers would be affected. I have had \nvery specific conversations with those who indicated very specifically \nthe companies--and I will not name them, but if we saw a company go \ninto bankruptcy now, the suppliers that would immediately begin to \nfollow suit, suppliers that supply the Department of Defense, \naerospace, other parts of the economy.\n  We are seeing that suppliers, particularly with all the talk of \nbankruptcy now, find themselves in a situation where matters are even \nworse, of banks not being willing to give loans. The questions in the \nhearings I would like to have of the folks who have already gotten \ntaxpayer money is where are they in trying to be a part of the solution \nright now, people who have not had to go through what this industry has \nhad to go through.\n  I certainly welcome accountability and transparency. It would be nice \nif it was on everybody getting Federal money. But the reality is we \nhave suppliers that cannot get their upfront funding. They are now \nhaving to turn to the automakers to ask for prepayment, where in the \npast they waited until the product was shipped and then they would have \n120 days or longer to make the payment. From a cash-flow standpoint, \nsuppliers are saying: We need the money upfront, which makes the \nsituation even worse.\n  This is a complicated situation which is, in fact, only going to be \nmade worse if we cannot provide a short-term bridge loan.\n  Let me also say, as I wrap up, I mentioned before about taxpayer \nfunding, the billions of dollars in liability we will assume in \npensions, health care, unemployment costs, Medicare and Medicaid, and \nthe lost taxpayer dollars. Bankruptcy would result in the reduction of \npersonal income of $276 billion--much more than $15 billion in a bridge \nloan we are talking about--which would lead to a total Government loss \nof $108 billion over 3 years, not to mention States borrowing.\n  The reality is this bill, I believe, is a fair and reasonable \ncompromise that reflects the global credit crisis that allows a short-\nterm bridge loan until the end of the first quarter but then sets up \nrigorous oversight and transparency with requirements to come to the \ntable to make the changes that are being talked about by colleagues, \nlegitimate issues that have been raised about the need to restructure, \ndeal with lower capacity, and continue to deal with costs on all \nsides. That structure is being put in place to do just that. The \noverseer, or the person now being dubbed the ``car czar,'' can actually \nrecommend that the dollars not continue during that time period if they \nare not making progress on all of the areas that have been put together \nin terms of criteria. And no additional dollars would be given unless \npeople were satisfied by March 31 that in fact there was long-term \nviability, that restructuring had been done. This gives us an \nopportunity to have the restructuring that is needed to create or to \nsustain an American automotive industry and American manufacturing in \nthis country. It makes sense.\n\n[[Page S10848]]\n\n  A lot of tough negotiations have gone on. This is a tough bill on \naccountability, it is tough on oversight. It is much tougher than \nanything that anyone on Wall Street has been asked to do, that is for \nsure. At the same time, it recognizes that we are in a global credit \ncrisis and that the ability for them to borrow--to get a loan for a \nshort period of time--is essential if we are going to have American \nmanufacturing.\n  Mr. President, I hope we are going to come together. I know the House \nintends to vote, and we will be coming together to vote on this issue. \nI hope we will see a resoundingly bipartisan ``yes'' for a commitment \nto the middle class of this country to advance manufacturing for the \nfuture and that we will make sure people's feet are kept to the fire, \nthat the right things are done, but that we will not give up on the \nmiddle class of this country. We are not going to give up on 2\\1/2\\ to \n3 million people who are watching everything we are doing now to \ndetermine whether they have a future for their families that will give \nthem a living wage and allow them to continue to be a part of this \ngreat American dream. I hope we are going to come together. I am \noptimistic that we will come together in the next couple of days and \nsay yes and allow a whole lot of people to have a holiday season, a \nChristmas, that will allow them to know they have a future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all of us in this country are nervous and \nvery worried about the American economy. This is an economic engine \nthat has been the wonder of the world. It has provided so much good for \nso many people, expanding opportunities for jobs and careers, and for \npeople to own homes. This is an extraordinary place, this place called \nthe United States. We have been through tough times and good times, and \nthis turns out to be one of those pretty difficult times for our \neconomy. This ship of state has sort of stopped in the water, the \nengine isn't working very well, and we have a lot of trouble.\n  Since the first of this year, nearly 2 million people have lost their \njobs. That sounds like just a statistic, but in a home where one spouse \nhad to tell the other that they had lost their job, that is a disaster. \nSo almost 2 million people have lost their jobs, and the question is, \nHow many more will lose their jobs before we find a way to provide a \nfoundation for building this economy back to an economy of strength and \nopportunity once again?\n  We are discussing here in the Senate and in the Congress a proposed \n$15 billion bridge loan for the automobile industry. My colleagues have \nbeen speaking about that, and there are a lot of jobs at stake, so \nthere is a lot of passion on both sides of this issue. It appears to me \nthat there are somewhere around 3 to 4 million jobs at stake with the \nautomobile industry. I think the question is, at this precarious \nmoment, teetering on the edge of a cliff with this economy, what would \nit mean if somehow we decide whatever happens will happen and we will \nlet it happen, watch it happen, but we won't take action? What would it \nmean if a couple of million American people lost their jobs on top of \nwhat we have just seen? So I don't think the prospect is for us to sit \naround and be observers. We have to be active. We have to be involved, \nand we have to try to find ways to provide confidence that there will \nbe an economic recovery.\n  Now, I am concerned about this recession, which is very deep. It is \ndevastating to American families who have lost a substantial part of \ntheir assets and their 401(k)s and their retirement accounts. It is \ndevastating to those who have lost their jobs. But I am concerned about \nsomething else as well: I am concerned about a government and a \nconstitution that somehow seems to have invented a completely separate \napproach to governing. And let me describe what I mean. I am perfectly \nunderstanding of those that need to take and want to take emergency \naction to try to provide opportunities for the recovery of this \neconomy. I understand that. I have studied economics. I taught \neconomics briefly. I understand, having studied what happened in the \nGreat Depression, the need to take aggressive action. But no one, in my \njudgment, has ever suggested that the need to take aggressive action \nshould somehow obliterate the requirement for oversight and for \naccountability. But that is exactly what I think is happening today \nwith an extraordinary kind of government outside of the regular process \nthat we understand government to adopt based on our Constitution.\n  Let me describe what I mean and my concern about it. As I look at \nwhat has happened with bailout funds, rescue funds, all kinds of \nemergency actions, there is about $8.5 trillion in taxpayer funds that \nhas now been put at risk. I am not talking billions, I am not talking \nabout millions or thousands, I am talking about $8.5 trillion of \ntaxpayer funds that appears to me to have been placed at risk. In \nalmost all cases, this was done without the consent of the Congress, \noutside of any vote that occurred here in the Congress.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that the emergency powers, for example, at \nthe Federal Reserve Board that Chairman Bernanke is using--should not \nhave been a significant part of this effort to try to create emergency \nmeasures to address the economic trouble we face. I am not suggesting \nthat at all. What I am saying is this: We have people huddled in rooms \naround here for days and days and days talking about what kinds of \nconditions should you put on the proposal of $15 billion that would be \na bridge loan for the automobile industry, what kinds of tough \nconditions should they be, spell them out, make sure they are there. \nWell, guess what. With almost all of the Wall Street bailout money, \nthere are no conditions, no real accountability that I am aware of.\n  Nobody was sitting in a room saying: You know what, let's establish \ntough conditions when we open the Fed's window for the first time in \nhistory for the investment banks to come and get direct lending from \nthe Federal Reserve Board. I didn't see any conditions attached to \nthat. You go down the list of things, and the Federal Reserve programs \nare $5.55 trillion.\n  Now, I am not suggesting the taxpayers are going to lose that money. \nThey will perhaps lose some of it for sure, but some of it represents \nmortgages that likely will be good in the long term. The guarantee of \ncertain kinds of mortgage securities, the funding for certain \ninvestment bank operations--you know I am not suggesting all of this is \ngoing to be lost, but clearly some will be lost. The taxpayers are at \nrisk. Did anyone talk about what kinds of conditions should exist for \nthat?\n  As I said, for a week now there have been people huddling about what \nare the strict and strong conditions you can attach to this $15 \nbillion. I am in favor of strict and strong conditions to the things we \ndo to move money into these circumstances. I am in favor of that. But \nwhy is it just here? Why not the $5.5 trillion? The FDIC program, $1.5 \ntrillion, the Treasury Department, $1.1 trillion, $700 billion of which \nis called the Troubled Asset Relief Program--that, by the way, is a \nmisnomer. That is what the Secretary of the Treasury asked for. He \nasked for $700 billion to buy troubled assets from financial firms. The \nCongress gave him the $700 billion. I did not vote for that, but the \nCongress gave him $700 billion, and very quickly he said: Well, that is \nnot what I meant. I have changed my mind. We are not going to buy \ntroubled assets, we are going to invest in capital in banks. So he \npromptly put $125 billion into nine banks--some of which apparently \ndidn't want it--in order to, as the Treasury Secretary said, expand \nlending because the credit markets were frozen.\n  Well, guess what. That $125 billion called troubled asset relief \nmoney was put into banks instead as capital investments with no \nrequirement at all that they expand lending. The purpose\n\n[[Page S10849]]\n\nof the investment was to expand lending, but there was no requirement \nthat they expand lending. Pretty inexplicable to me. But the point is, \n$700 billion of this $1.1 trillion is the troubled asset relief fund, \nand then Federal housing has about $300 billion.\n  By the way, this has not been easy information to get. Some \nenterprising work by a number of reporters--Bloomberg, for example--was \nfirst to try to figure out what is out here in terms of liability. What \nare the risks? What are the American taxpayers being asked to assume \nwith respect to a burden? The fact is, it was hard to find. And despite \nthe promises and pledges of transparency and accountability, it doesn't \nexist. We are told: Well, this is not transparent because it is \ndifficult to do that, to tell folks at so-and-so that this company got \na loan and this company didn't. I don't understand that. The promise of \ntransparency was not some sort of tepid promise; it was a promise that \nwhat was going to be done would be available to be observed by the \nAmerican people. That regrettably has not been the case.\n  So the Troubled Asset Relief Program was a program that actually was \nthe only portion of this $700 billion that was considered by the \nCongress. Despite the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury wanted \n$700 billion with a three-page piece of legislation, those who worked \non that did put some conditions, accountability and oversight \nrequirements in the legislation. These requirements that have existed \nfor the TARP program don't exist for any other program.\n  What I suggest we do is this: I am going to introduce legislation \nthat would the apply the conditions and other safeguards that exist for \nthe TARP program--the Troubled Asset Relief Program--to all of the \nother federal lending activities so that we have tough conditions \nattached to all of these activities and some accountability and \ntransparency and oversight.\n  It is almost unbelievable to me that we have this massive amount of \nmoney being moved around with no one--except for the $700 billion--in \nan elective position responsive to the American people. The American \npeople, after all, are the ones who assume the risk of all of this--\nwith no one in an elective position making these judgments.\n  This is kind of an extraordinary form of government we are seeing. It \nis one I do not think you read in the Constitution. Again, my criticism \nis not to those who are interested in being active to address an \neconomic crisis. I believe you have to be active to address a crisis. \nBut I think those who are working now on the auto issue, who are \ninsisting on strict conditions, are completely at odds with virtually \neverything else that has been done without conditions or oversight at \nall. That makes no sense to me at all.\n  The TARP program has conditions of oversight, accountability, and \ntransparency. None of them are applicable to the other portions--which \nis about $7.8 trillion. Is anybody asking why? Is anybody asking why \nshould they not be applicable? I am going to introduce legislation that \nwould make these same conditions applicable to all these areas. It \ndoesn't matter whether it is an open Fed window or some other \nguarantee--we have $7.8 trillion of other guarantees that put the \ntaxpayers at risk. In one way or another the American people deserve to \nbe able to see what is happening to them.\n  I am going to introduce a number of pieces of legislation. One of \nthem will be to impose the same conditions and oversight in the \ntroubled asset program to all the other programs that exist here. \nSecond, I am going to propose a piece of legislation called the \nFinancial Reform Commission, creating a high-level commission that \nwould report back to the Congress in about 6 months about how we would \nreform our system of finance in this country.\n  We can't continue this. The fact is, what happened threw this \ncountry's economy into the ditch. It caused an enormous wreck. And we \nare going to keep doing it? I don't think so. It has to change. It has \nto be reformed. Some of the largest financial enterprises in this \ncountry have gotten massive amounts of money, hundreds of billions of \ndollars, but no one has shut the gate, as I described yesterday.\n  I come from a rural background where we had cattle and horses. I \nunderstand about closing the gate. No one has closed the gate here. I \ndescribed yesterday what caused all this--unbelievable reckless \nbehavior, unbelievable greed. Lots of interests were making lots of \nmoney.\n  The story the other day was about someone who was in charge of risk \nmanagement for one of the big investment banks. One guy is in charge of \nrisk management, the other guy is in charge of trading CDOs--\ncollateralized debt obligations. The guy in charge of trading CDOs \ndidn't have a very difficult time getting his activities through the \nrisk manager and they loaded up. Both of them were making over $20 \nmillion a year. Let me say that again--both of them make over $20 \nmillion a year. This company loads up with massive quantities of toxic \nassets.\n  Now we are all stuck with the proposition of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, the Treasury Department, and others, including the FDIC, trying \nto come to the rescue but coming to the rescue without any notion of \nhow you close the gate on that kind of behavior, first of all; and, \nsecond, what kind of conditions attach to that rescue.\n  Again, I say about all this effort today and in the last week about \nimposing conditions on the automobile industry--sign me up. I am for \nthat. I am not for using taxpayers' money without substantial \nlimitations and conditions. But then why are we standing here with $7.8 \ntrillion having been put at risk for the American taxpayer with few or \nno conditions, with little or no transparency, with almost no \naccountability, when Treasury comes up and says we will stick $45 \nbillion into a big financing agency, one of the biggest in the country, \nand, by the way, you don't have to get rid of anybody. Nobody loses his \njob. We don't impose a requirement that you cannot pay big bonuses. We \nwill just give you the money.\n  The question is, What caused the requirement to give them the money? \nThe answer is unbelievable recklessness by people who were greedy, \nmaking lots and lots of money. Why would you provide money to an \nenterprise of that type without very substantial restrictions and \nconditions attached to that money? That is a question I think the \nTreasury Secretary should answer, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard should answer. The American people deserve that answer. We need a \nfinancial reform commission that decides how do we reform this going \nforward.\n  Let me tell you about the reform that happened 9 years ago. The \nreform 9 years ago, by the ``smartest guys in the room,'' was: We are \nhopelessly old-fashioned in our finance, hopelessly out of date.\n  Leading up to the Great Depression--the 1920s, leading up to the \n1930s--we saw banks that were engaged in very risky enterprises: Real \nestate, securities, a whole series of things that were risky. The \ncountry plunged into a big old depression, banks closed all over the \ncountry, and emergency legislation was put together--Glass-Steagall \namong them--that said: You know what. It is nuts to have banks engaged \nin risky enterprises. We are going to separate them, and we are going \nto make sure you can never do it again. That is why legislation such as \nGlass-Steagall was passed. It protected that banking system whose not \nonly reality of safety and soundness is important, but the perception \nof safety and soundness is critical, because without that perception, a \nrun on the bank can bring a bank down.\n  We went on after the Great Depression, having separated those kind of \nrisk activities from banking. Then, in 1999, Senator Phil Gramm from \nTexas led the effort in the Senate, and the effort was in the House as \nwell, to say: This is hopelessly old-fashioned. Are you kidding me? We \ncan't create big financial institutions, holding companies that allow \nus to merge investment banks with real banks and get involved in the \nissues of real estate and securities and so on? Let's pass a piece of \nlegislation called the Financial Modernization Act and get rid of all \nthis obstruction that has been put in place after the Great Depression.\n  I wish to put up what I said during the debate in 1999 on the floor \nof the Senate. When the Financial Modernization Act left the Senate, \nthe conference\n\n[[Page S10850]]\n\nreport, eight of us voted no. I was one of the eight who voted no. Here \nis what I said in a speech on the floor of the Senate: ``This bill will \nalso in my judgment raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer \nbailouts.''\n  I am not prescient. I am not someone who can see the future. But I \nbelieved what we were doing in 1999 was unbelievably ignorant of the \nlessons we should have learned from the Great Depression.\n  ``The bill will also in my judgment raise the likelihood of future \nmassive taxpayer bailouts,'' I said in May of 1999. I wish I was wrong. \nNine years later, here we are on the floor of the Senate, and we are \nseeing bailouts in every direction from the Federal Reserve Board, the \nTreasury, and others. I also said during that same debate: ``I say to \nthe people who own banks, if you want to gamble, go to Las Vegas.''\n  But that wasn't enough. We had a lot of folks who decided, you know \nwhat, we need to get banking, once again, involved in some of the more \nprofitable enterprises such as real estate and securities. We ought to \nbe able, they said, to pass a financial modernization act that allows \nthe creation of big financial holding companies with a homogenization \nof all kinds of different enterprises under one roof. They said we will \nput up firewalls, apparently firewalls made of balsa wood or paper, but \nwe will put up firewalls, and things will be great, and so it passed. \nOnly eight of us voted no in the Senate when that conference report \nleft.\n  Yesterday, I described what happened as a result. It was similar to \nhogs in a corncrib, grunting and shoving and snorting. You heard it for \na decade, especially in recent years. The most egregious part of it \nstarted with the subprime loans, but it was also with derivatives and \ncredit default swaps. I said this back in 1999:\n\n       If you want to trade in derivatives, God bless you. Do it \n     with your own money. Do not do it through the deposits that \n     are guaranteed by the American people.\n\n  There were four pieces of legislation I introduced during the interim \ngoing back to 1995 to try to prohibit banks from trading in \nderivatives. Let me put up a chart that shows what has happened with \nderivatives. The top five bailed-out banks: JPMorgan Chase got $25 \nbillion in bailout funds from the U.S. Government. They have a notional \nvalue of derivatives of $91.3 trillion. The Bank of America got $15 \nbillion in bailout funds. They have a $39.7 trillion notional value of \nderivatives. The list goes on. Citigroup, $45 billion in bailout funds, \n$37 trillion in notional value of derivatives.\n  This sort of mixes the terms. There is something called credit \ndefault swaps out there, something over $50 trillion of credit default \nswaps. If someone wants to know what they are, look at the AIG story. \nYou will understand what brought them down. It was run by a little \noperation over in London with several hundred people. All this \nrepresented an unbelievable amount of reckless speculation that should \nnever have been allowed to happen. That bill passed the Congress. \nPresident Clinton signed it. We have people--some of whom will come \ninto this new administration--who were supportive of it. I think it was \na horrible mistake. If we do not recognize it now, even as we are \ntrying to dig out of this hole, we are going to head right back to the \nnext hole. We need to have the Financial Reform Commission that \ndevelops the recommendations similar to what happened post-depression \nthat will allow us to put together the kind of protections, once again, \nto make sure this will never again happen.\n  Let me also say I am going to introduce legislation calling for a \nNational Financial Crimes Task Force. There needs to be accountability. \nI am not suggesting all of it is criminal or even a major part of it is \ncriminal, but some of it undoubtedly represents criminal behavior. Yet \nthere is virtually no investigation going on, on these issues. It is so \nunbelievable. I chaired the hearings in the Senate on the Enron \nCorporation. You remember Enron. That was a criminal enterprise that \nbilked particularly the west coast taxpayers and ratepayers for \nelectricity out of billions of dollars. I chaired the hearing when Ken \nLay, the chairman of Enron, came and lifted his hand to tell the truth \nand then took the fifth amendment.\n  Think of this, Enron was a big deal, a big scam and, in part, a \ncriminal enterprise. In retrospect, the amount of money involved there \nis minuscule compared to the trillions of dollars we are talking about \nhere that resulted from reckless business management and reckless \npractices.\n  I talked about derivatives and credit default swaps. I'll just \nmention, once again, the issue of subprime loans, when companies were \nadvertising to the American people they should come to their company to \nget a loan, because if you were bankrupt, if you had slow pay, if you \nhad bad credit, they wanted you to get a loan with them. In fact, they \nwould encourage you to get a loan with them, and you wouldn't have to \ndocument it. That is called a no doc loan. You don't have to document \nyour loan. Come to us, Zoom Credit said, come to us and get a loan. \nSlow pay? Bankruptcy? Troubles? It doesn't matter--come to us. That is \njust an example.\n  In fact, yesterday I showed that the largest mortgage banker in the \ncountry was engaged in the same sort of thing and that has already \ncollapsed as well and the guy who ran it got off with a couple hundred \nmillion dollars, at least as I understand it.\n  My time is about up. My interest is in protecting the economy and \nprotecting this country and protecting American taxpayers. We need to \ntry to give some protection to American jobs and to protect taxpayers \nand that means strong conditions, strong oversight, transparency, and \naccountability. I am for taking emergency action. I am for doing what \nwe can to pull this country out of this hole. But we ought not decide \nwe are going to impose very strict conditions on this tiny little piece \nand on all the rest of trillions of dollars, it is Katy bar the door; \nwhatever happens, happens; and don't complain.\n  That is not what the role of the Congress should be. This Congress \nshould insist on every dollar that is committed on behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayers that we have accountability, responsibility and \ntransparency and strong conditions. That has not been the case to this \npoint and I intend to introduce legislation that requires it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10850-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It means jobs at auto \nassembly plants and it means jobs at auto-stamping plants and engine \nplants in all those States I mentioned. It means communities would not \nsuffer yet another blow from massive job loss. It means Ohio's economy \nand our Nation's economy will have a fighting chance to get back on \ntrack.\n\n[[Page S10851]]\n\n  Inaction means a present of pink slips for millions of American \nworkers this Christmas. Bah humbug. There are some in this Chamber who \nwould rather see our largest manufacturing industry go bankrupt rather \nthan provide a bridge loan to success.\n  Let's be clear about what this legislation will do. The legislation \nprovides a bridge loan to auto companies, a loan that comes with strict \noversight and with strict conditions--something, frankly, the Treasury \nDepartment did not do with the financial services industry. If the auto \ncompanies don't negotiate a real plan for restructuring their \nbusinesses, all the interested parties--that means the auto dealers, \nthe suppliers, the bondholders, the workers, management--if they don't \nnegotiate a real plan for restructuring their businesses with all the \ninterested parties, then the loan gets called in March or in April. \nThis is not handing a checkbook over to the industry to make out \nwhatever they think is fair. This legislation means accountability. It \nmeans transparency. It means no more corporate jets. It means no more \ngolden parachutes when they hit turbulence. More importantly, passing \nthis legislation means saving millions of jobs nationally, hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in Ohio and Michigan, and tens of thousands of jobs \nin Pennsylvania--as I said, millions of jobs all over this country. \nThis legislation means the potential, as the industry gets better and \nbetter--and it has shown improvement in the last couple years--it means \nthe potential for new job creation.\n  This bipartisan compromise legislation will help ensure the long-term \nviability of the most important component in U.S. manufacturing--the \nauto industry. It will help ensure global competitiveness. It will help \nensure and promote energy efficiency by developing advanced technology \nvehicles.\n  Let me say it again. This legislation will save jobs. This bill is \nabout jobs. It is about creating a middle class and strengthening the \nmiddle class. It is about jobs.\n  Back in November, the auto companies were given the task of \ndeveloping detailed plans of how they would use taxpayer support and \nwhether we, as Members of Congress and as the public, could have some \nassurance they would be able to survive and ultimately thrive. They \nsubmitted their plans on December 2, and they gave detailed proposals \nof how they will return to profitability. There are no absolute \nguarantees their plans will succeed, nor can there be guarantees. But \nbased on reasonable assumptions--again, a much higher standard than the \nfinancial institutions to which the Treasury Department has handed \nhundreds of billions of dollars--based on reasonable assumptions, these \nauto companies will return to financial health, and they will repay the \nFederal loans they are seeking within a few years' time.\n  Thirty years ago, Chrysler borrowed more than $1 billion. They paid \nit back. The Government made money. They paid it back, in fact, more \nquickly than the Government asked them to initially. In the last month, \nthe auto companies, dealing with us in this Congress, have done their \npart, and now it is our turn. We have two choices. We can either \nprovide bridge loans to the auto industry or we can drive the economy \noff a bridge.\n  Seldom are the consequences of inaction so clear. If we do nothing, \nthere will be a cascade of bankruptcies, not just in Detroit but across \nthe country, including in the Presiding Officer's State of Missouri, in \nmy State of Ohio, and across the country.\n  Last week a steelmaker in Cleveland announced that 450 men and women \nneed not come to work on Monday. Another week before that, in \nLordstown, OH, GM announced a layoff of some number of autoworkers at \nthe Lordstown GM assembly plant and, within days, major suppliers also \nannounced layoffs. Some 40 percent of production goes to the auto \nindustry from the steel plant I was talking about. It is already \ncompeting in an industry where foreign governments subsidize hand over \nfoot.\n  What happens to that steel mill if one or all of the big three go \nbankrupt?\n  These layoffs are not just numbers. A young woman from Youngstown, \nnear Lordstown, wrote me about how her family moved off welfare when \nher father found a job when GM was hiring. She said the interview and \ntesting process was extensive and the stakes for her family immense. \nWhen her father got the job, he was so happy he cried tears of joy. As \nsomebody recently hired, she fears for her father and her family. The \ntears may soon be those of sorrow.\n  Next week, Lordstown workers will conduct their annual food drive, \nfeeding hundreds of families through the holidays. They contribute a \nthird of the United Way budget. This plant contributes a third--these \nworkers--to the United Way budget. They keep the hardware stores open. \nThey keep the restaurants open. They fund the public schools with tax \ndollars. They keep firefighters on the street, police officers on the \nstreet.\n  My colleagues may not appreciate the dramatic changes that have taken \nplace in this industry. Employment, as a whole, has been cut in half. \nProductivity has started to match or exceed the foreign transplant \nfactories. The UAW has agreed to extraordinary reductions in the pay \nand benefits of autoworkers in 2005, again last year, in 2007, and \nagain now. The UAW has been a partner in these negotiations, as \noutlined by UAW President Gettelfinger to the Banking Committee only \nlast week, and in putting the industry on the path to match the costs \nof the competition.\n  If we fail to act, the consequences will be felt throughout the \neconomy--in the credit markets, the supplier industries, even the local \nnewspaper.\n  A little over 2 months ago it was the banking industry that faced a \ncrisis with an urgent need for Federal help. As I said earlier, the \ndifferences in how we responded to the two crises are striking. The \nbanking industry, initially, through the Secretary of the Treasury, \ngave us a three-page plan, a three-page bill for spending $700 billion. \nWe obviously threw the three pages out because we wanted much more than \nthat, but the revisions that came a week and a half later passed this \nSenate by a vote of 74 to 25.\n\n  The financial companies themselves, five of which have received more \nthan $25 billion each, not only did not appear before Congress, they \nnever produced a plan on how they would spend the money, nor had they \nbeen asked for one by Congress or the Bush administration. Contrast \nthat with what we have talked about for the auto industry. They didn't \nhave to testify about why they built or marketed structured investment \nvehicles, but we have heard plenty of debate about the building and \nmarketing of sport utility vehicles.\n  The idea Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke made before the \nSenate Banking Committee on behalf of the banking industry is it needed \nwhat it called patient capital that only the Federal Government could \nprovide. The banking industry--Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke \ntold us--was in peril, but given Federal support, in a few years' time, \nit would be back on its feet. I don't quarrel with the need to help the \nbanking industry, though I have plenty of concerns for the way we are \nproceeding. The need here is exactly the same in the auto industry, \neven though the standards for transparency we are setting are almost \nliterally contrasted like night and day. The auto industry has been hit \nby the same collapse in the credit market that brought Secretary \nPaulson and Chairman Bernanke to Capitol Hill on behalf of bankers. It \nhas the same need for patient capital, a bridge loan to take it to the \nother side of the recession.\n  We know this can work; we have seen it work in the past, but we have \nno basis to believe people will buy cars from a company in bankruptcy. \nThat is why we can't let it go to chapter 11 bankruptcy. A structured, \nprepackaged bankruptcy--whatever term the lawyers in this body wish to \nuse--if it goes into bankruptcy, people would not buy cars in \nsufficient numbers to get this industry back on its feet.\n  As we saw with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, standing by while a \ncompany goes bankrupt would send shock waves to unexpected places \nthroughout the economy. It was a terrible mistake that Secretary \nPaulson let Lehman Brothers collapse. It would be a terrible mistake if \nthe Treasury Department doesn't step up--which apparently they will \nnot--but it would be a terrible mistake if now the House and Senate do \nnot step up.\n\n[[Page S10852]]\n\n  If we fail to act, years from now some future Professor Bernanke, now \nChairman of the Fed, will study our actions and will absolutely marvel \nat the missed opportunity--trillions of dollars committed to the \nfinancial sector, tens of billions denied the manufacturing sector, \nwith millions of people losing their jobs on top of the more than 1 \nmillion who have already been laid off this year. If we fail to act, we \nwill commit one of the biggest economic sins of omission in our \nhistory.\n  Majority Leader Reid is absolutely right to insist that we stay here \nas long as we need to get this job done. Let's make it a truly merry \nChristmas in millions of living rooms in Lordstown, in Walton Hills, in \nToledo, in Dayton, in Sharonville, in Mansfield, in towns all across \nthe State.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10852-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Madam President, I have sought recognition for a few \npurposes. First, I ask unanimous consent that my statement regarding \nU.S. policy toward Israel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      U.S. Policy Regarding Israel\n\n       I have sought recognition to address the subject of United \n     States policy regarding Israel and the Mideast peace process \n     as we look forward to a new Administration and a new Congress \n     next year. It is my expectation that the United States will \n     maintain the close, strong relationship with Israel based on \n     U.S. national interests, especially security interests, and \n     our close cultural and historic ties with Israel.\n       While efforts are being made to bring democratic \n     institutions to Iraq and Afghanistan, Israel is the only \n     democracy in the region with our shared values. The record \n     shows the U.S. vigorously supports a close relationship with \n     Israel for good reason. Since the accords between Israel and \n     Egypt in 1978, the United States has given substantial \n     foreign aid to those two countries to improve their security \n     and to promote the Mideast peace process. Since my election \n     in 1980, I have voted for aid to Israel in the amount of \n     $81.6 billion, consisting of $28.8 billion in economic aid--\n     including $1.3 billion to resettle Jewish refugees--and $52.8 \n     billion in military aid. In the case of Egypt, I have \n     supported $35.2 billion in military aid and $23.9 billion in \n     economic aid.\n       The importance of Israel as a strategic U.S. ally has \n     motivated the U.S. to place special emphasis on Israel's \n     security, part of which is promoting the Middle East Peace \n     Process. During my 28 years in the Senate, I have traveled to \n     many foreign countries in connection with my membership on \n     the Intelligence Committee, which I chaired in the 104th \n     Congress, and my membership on the Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, where I am now the \n     longest serving Republican on the Subcommittee.\n       As part of these travels, I have visited Israel 25 times \n     and Syria 17 times with a view to assisting on a peace treaty \n     between those two countries. As I see it, the key to such an \n     accord is the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 \n     War. Syria has long sought a return of the Golan. Only Israel \n     can decide for itself whether its interests warrant returning \n     the Golan to Syria for significant reciprocal concessions. \n     Obviously, the strategic considerations are vastly different \n     now than they were in 1967 since rockets can easily fly over \n     the Golan. If Israel could rely on Syrian commitments to \n     allow Lebanon to function as a sovereign nation, stop \n     assisting Hezbollah and withdraw support for Hamas, Israel \n     might conclude it was in its interest to return the Golan to \n     Syria.\n       Israel and Syria were reportedly very close to a pact in \n     1995 when Yitzhak Rabin was Prime Minister and in 2000 when \n     Ehud Barak was Prime Minister. Diplomacy has produced some \n     results many thought impossible. Negotiations with North \n     Korea have reduced that nation's nuclear threat although that \n     situation remains volatile and uncertain. Negotiations have \n     moved Libya's Muammar Qaddafi from horrendous acts of \n     terrorism, including the blowing up of Pan Am 103 and bombing \n     of a Berlin discotheque, resulting in the murder of US \n     military personnel, to a willingness to negotiate and reform. \n     Libya made reparations in excess of $1,000,000,000 and \n     abandoned plans to design nuclear weapons in order to be \n     admitted to the family of nations.\n       My studies and travel in the region lead me to believe that \n     next year may be the right time to secure an Israeli-Syrian \n     Peace Treaty if the new Administration aggressively pursues \n     that objective.\n       As I prepare to travel to Israel and Syria in the next \n     several weeks, I have reviewed my Senate activities on this \n     subject. I think it would be useful to list some of the steps \n     I have taken so that my colleagues and others will understand \n     my reasons for optimism and so that the incoming Obama \n     Administration will have my thinking in setting its course on \n     foreign relations in the Mideast.\n       I first became deeply involved in an Israeli security issue \n     shortly after being elected in 1981 regarding the proposed \n     sale of E-3A airborne warning and control system (AWACS) \n     aircraft by the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. President Reagan \n     notified the Congress that he intended to sell Saudi Arabia \n     $8.5 billion in arms--which at the time would have been the \n     largest weapons transfer in U.S. history--including 5 AWACS \n     aircraft and 101 sets of conformal fuel tanks for F-15 \n     aircraft. I opposed the sale on the grounds that it undercut \n     the Camp David accords. I wrote to President Reagan in August \n     1981 to urge him not to proceed with the proposed sale, and \n     on October 28, 1981 I said on the Senate floor:\n       ``Until the Saudis are prepared to embrace the principles \n     of the Camp David accords and support the United States on \n     this cornerstone of United States-Mideast foreign policy, it \n     is my judgment that they should not be rewarded with the \n     AWACS and the F-15 enhancement. . . . By focusing on the \n     special United States-Saudi relationship . . . the \n     administration has already moved a step away from the best \n     hope for a Middle East peace--the Camp David accords and the \n     now-reinstated autonomy talks between Egypt and Israel.''\n     I was one of 12 Republican senators to vote for a resolution \n     disapproving the proposed arms sale. The resolution was \n     rejected 48-52.\n       The same policy that led me to oppose the sale of AWACS to \n     Saudi Arabia has guided my actions throughout my Senate \n     career on Israeli security issues. Before being elected to \n     the Senate in 1980, I visited Israel in 1964, 1969 and 1980. \n     My first visit as a United States Senator came in September \n     1982. During my 1982 visit I met with Prime Minister Menachem \n     Begin, Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, and other Israeli \n     leaders. I urged Prime Minister Begin to discuss with \n     President Reagan the issue of a Mideast peace. I understood \n     the two differed on what approach to take, but as I said on \n     the Senate floor following my trip:\n       ``As I [saw] it, there [were] major misunderstandings which \n     could be resolved, or at least clarified, by personal \n     diplomacy between these two men of good will.''\n     Prime Minister Begin and I also spoke about my meeting with \n     Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel who was assassinated \n     shortly after I visited him in his Beirut office in September \n     1982. I said that I saw some hope of Lebanese unification, \n     and Prime Minister Begin stressed that a peace treaty with \n     Lebanon was very important to Israel.\n       I returned to Israel in May 1983 and met with Prime \n     Minister Begin, Defense Minister Moshe Arens, and Labor \n     leader Shimon Peres. Prime Minister Begin stressed his desire \n     to secure the delivery of F-16's to Israel before the \n     scheduled date of 1985, saying that the planes were crucial \n     for Israel's security.\n       Following my meetings in Israel, I traveled to Egypt, where \n     I met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. As I stated in \n     my trip report:\n       ``I began [the meeting] by conveying Prime Minister Begin's \n     respects as Prime Minister Begin asked me to do, and \n     President Mubarak responded about his esteem for Prime \n     Minister Begin, saying that the Prime Minister was a man of \n     his word and also . . . tough.' ''\n     I pursued a discussion with President Mubarak on the question \n     of further negotiations between Israel and Egypt in pursuance \n     of the principles of the Camp David accords.\n       In October 1983, I was an original cosponsor of legislation \n     introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that would have \n     required that the U.S. Embassy in Israel and the residence of \n     the American Ambassador to Israel be located in Jerusalem. \n     Hearings were held, but the legislation was not passed by the \n     Senate.\n       I made my first trip to Syria in 1984 and met Foreign \n     Minister Farouk al-Shara. Following the lead of Congressman \n     Stephen Solarz on an important issue, I urged the Foreign \n     Minister to permit Syrian Jewish\n\n[[Page S10853]]\n\n     women to emigrate because the limited number of Jewish men in \n     Syria presented them with limited opportunities of marriage. \n     Mr. Shara demurred. I raised the issue with President Hafez \n     al-Asad four years later.\n       I returned to the Mideast in January 1987 to examine \n     Persian Gulf security concerns as affected by the Iran-Iraq \n     war, and again a year later, in January 1988. In Israel in \n     January 1988, I met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and \n     Minister of Industry and Commerce Ariel Sharon. I urged Prime \n     Minister Shamir to enter into negotiations that would provide \n     guarantees for peace. From Israel I traveled to Egypt, where \n     I voiced my objections to President Mubarak's statement that \n     the Camp David accords ``were a thing of the past.''\n       It was during my second trip to Syria, in January 1988, \n     that I first encountered President Hafez al-Asad in a meeting \n     that lasted 4 hours 38 minutes. We covered a wide range of \n     issues: the Iran-Iraq war, which had just concluded; Syrian-\n     Israeli relations; and U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. I found \n     President al-Asad at that time to be a very engaging \n     interlocutor. I suggested, on a number of occasions, that I \n     had taken a sufficient amount of his time, offering to leave, \n     but he generously extended the time until we had discussed a \n     very wide range of issues.\n       I also urged Asad to permit Syrian Jewish women to move \n     abroad. Asad resisted, saying that Syria was ``at war'' with \n     Israel, and that such emigration could only strengthen \n     Syria's enemy. I continued to press the issue in subsequent \n     meetings with Asad, and as I reported in a January 1994 \n     editorial in The New York Post:\n       ``Asad responded with a romantic offer that he would allow \n     any Jewish woman to leave when a suitor came to Syria and \n     took her to the United States to marry.''\n     I relayed that offer to the active Syrian Jewish community in \n     Brooklyn and elsewhere. Ultimately, Damascus altered its \n     policy and allowed Jews to emigrate.\n       At the time of my first meeting with President Hafez al-\n     Asad, Syria was totally uninterested in peace negotiations \n     with Israel. Upon returning to the Senate, I voiced my desire \n     to see the Secretary of State appoint an Ambassador \n     Plenipotentiary, like former Secretary of State Kissinger, to \n     concentrate on the Middle East peace process, as I understood \n     that the President could not focus all his attention on the \n     region.\n       I again traveled to the region in January 1989. In \n     Bethlehem that January, I met with the Bethlehem's \n     beleaguered mayor, Elias Friej, who had been personally \n     threatened by Palestinian Leader Yasir Arafat after the mayor \n     had proposed a truce with the Palestinian Liberation \n     Organization (PLO) in which the Israeli Army would cease \n     using force in return for a cessation of violence by the \n     Intifada. In my report to the Senate following my travels, I \n     urged the prospective new secretary of state, James Baker \n     III:\n       ``to reexamine the merits of our dealing with the PLO. At \n     an absolute minimum, we should require that the substantial \n     showing by the PLO of deeds instead of rhetoric.''\n       I traveled with Senator Richard Shelby to the region in \n     January 1990. In a visit to Damascus, I again met with \n     President Hafez al-Asad. As I outlined in my December 2006 \n     article in The Washington Quarterly, Asad initially rebuffed \n     offers to open talks with Israel, stating that Syria would \n     only participate in talks sponsored by all five permanent \n     members of the UN Security Council. Israel opposed this \n     format, believing that the odds would be stacked four to one \n     against it, with only the United States supporting it in \n     negotiations. When I pressed Asad on this issue again in \n     1990, he indicated that he had changed his position on the \n     proposal and that Syria would be willing to participate in \n     meetings organized only by the United States and the Soviet \n     Union. As I reported in a March 6, 1990 floor statement, this \n     change was significant because it appeared to be part of a \n     broader Syrian initiative:\n       ``In our January 1989 meeting, I asked on three separate \n     occasions, separated by respectable periods of time, what it \n     would take for Syria and Israel to become friends. President \n     Asad answered, after a third query, that it was not a \n     question of friendship, but that `normalizing' a relationship \n     between Syria and Israel might be possible under certain \n     circumstances.''\n       When I arrived in Tel Aviv from Damascus in January 1990, I \n     was greeted with the news that Senator Bob Dole proposed to \n     cut aid to Israel, Egypt and three other countries by five \n     percent in order to increase aid to Eastern Europe. In \n     response to U.S. and Israeli news media inquiries, I publicly \n     stated my opposition to Senator Dole's proposal, opposition \n     which I later restated in a February 7, 1990 speech to the \n     Senate:\n       ``This is not the time, in the midst of delicate regional \n     negotiations being encouraged by Secretary of State Baker, to \n     withdraw support from our allies. It is the wrong signal to \n     send, especially to Israel, which faces enormous additional \n     costs as a result of a continuing emigration from the Soviet \n     Union.''\n       During a January 1990 meeting with Israeli Prime Minister \n     Yitzhak Shamir, I relayed the news that Asad was willing to \n     attend a conference sponsored only by the U.S. and U.S.S.R. \n     On January 23, 1990, I said on the Senate floor:\n       ``When I was talking to President Asad of Syria, I noted a \n     significant change in his position. For example, on the \n     convening of an international conference where it has been \n     Syria's position that a conference had to be convened by all \n     five permanent members of the United Nations, he now is \n     willing to have the international conference convened by only \n     the United States and Soviet Union.\n       ``When I brought that information to Prime Minister Shamir, \n     he expressed interest because there had been a concern that \n     there would be undue pressure on Israel, and that is another \n     point where President Asad, of Syria, was willing to make a \n     very flat statement that there should not be undue pressure \n     and that the parties should sit down and have the \n     discussions.''\n     One year later, in October 1991, Syria participated in the \n     Madrid peace conference cosponsored by Washington and Moscow. \n     Although the three days of talks did not yield a peace \n     agreement, the summit marked the first talks between Israel \n     and Syria.\n       In February 1993 I again traveled to the region. In Israel, \n     I met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister \n     Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and \n     Defense Minister Moshe Arens. I was encouraged on this trip \n     when Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara told me that the \n     presence of United Nations forces on the Golan Heights would \n     be accommodated by Damascus without objection. My hope for \n     Israeli-Syrian agreement was further bolstered by Egyptian \n     President Hosni Mubarak's reaffirmation of the importance of \n     continuing the bilateral dialogue between Israel and Syria \n     for broader regional peace.\n       It was not until my sixth visit to Syria, in December 1993, \n     that Asad said his country was ready for a comprehensive \n     peace treaty with Israel. My interest in promoting a \n     comprehensive peace treaty between Israel and Syria was the \n     motivation for each of my trips to Syria.\n       In 1994, I joined Senator Richard Shelby in introducing an \n     amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill to \n     condition aid to the PLO on Chairman Arafat's taking concrete \n     steps to curtail terrorism and amending the PLO charter to \n     eliminate the provisions which called for the destruction of \n     Israel. The amendment was adopted by the Congress.\n       During my August 1995 visit to Israel, Senator Hank Brown \n     and I met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, former Prime \n     Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and \n     President Ezer Weitzman. Prime Minister Rabin said that \n     Israel stood ready to negotiate with Syria, but that the \n     Syrians wanted the U.S. to remain involved as a third party \n     mediator. During this visit I also met with PLO Chairman \n     Yasser Arafat. As I noted in my trip report:\n       ``Senator Brown and I challenged Chairman Arafat on why he \n     made speeches condemning terrorism in English and not in \n     Arabic. He said his English was not good and made the \n     contention that he had, in fact, made the speeches in Arabic. \n     He continued to make speeches which poison the atmosphere in \n     which both parties seek a peaceful resolution to the \n     conflict. . . . But it seems to me, Mr. President, that \n     Chairman Arafat could do a great deal more than he is doing \n     at the present time to restrain terrorism. I believe that the \n     U.S. Congress, certainly the executive branch but also the \n     Congress, must be alert on this very, very important issue.''\n       I returned to the region in January 1996 and met with Prime \n     Minister Shimon Peres, Likud leader Netanyahu, and PLO \n     Chairman Arafat. I pressed Chairman Arafat on changing \n     the PLO's Charter, and he promised to do so within two \n     months of reelection later that year. When I again met \n     with Chairman Arafat in August 1996, he had yet to make \n     good on his word.\n       When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office \n     following the 1996 elections, he made a public announcement \n     that he would hold Syria responsible for the Hezbollah's \n     attacks in northern Israel. Syria followed by realigning its \n     troops as if to prepare for conflict, drastically raising the \n     threat of direct conflict between Syria's four-million-man \n     army and Israel's smaller but more sophisticated combat \n     force. I was in Jerusalem at the time, and on August 27, 1996 \n     met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who asked me to \n     carry a message to President Hafiz al-Asad stating that he \n     was eager to get to the negotiation table with President \n     Asad. The following day, I traveled to Damascus and met with \n     Asad for three and a half hours. As I reported in my floor \n     statement following the trip:\n       ``I conveyed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's message \n     that Israel had only peaceful intentions toward Syria, that \n     both sides should move immediately to reduce military \n     tensions, and that Mr. Netanyahu wanted to reopen direct \n     negotiations between Israel and Syria.''\n     Upon returning to the United States, I met Walid al-\n     Mouallem--then Syrian Ambassador to the United States and now \n     Syria's Foreign Minister--who said that his government viewed \n     my August round of talks between Prime Minister Benjamin \n     Netanyahu and President Asad as having been helpful in \n     deescalating the dangerous situation. As I reported in a \n     floor statement:\n\n       ``Ambassador al-Mouallem told me that his government viewed \n     my August round of talks between Prime Minister Netanyahu and \n     President Asad as having been helpful in deescalating the \n     dangerous tensions. . .and the Ambassador encouraged me to \n     return to the region for another round of meetings\n\n[[Page S10854]]\n\n     aimed at helping the parties find a basis to reopen their \n     negotiations.''\n       At the encouragement of Ambassador Walid al-Mouallem and \n     Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I returned to the region \n     three months later, in November 1996. During my November 20 \n     meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told me \n     that:\n       ``[T]ensions with Syria [have] been reduced since the \n     August/September time period and that he wants to continue to \n     deescalate the saber rattling. He asked me to convey this and \n     specifically that Israel has no aggressive intent against \n     Syria.''\n     As I further noted in my trip report, Netanyahu also asked me \n     to tell Asad:\n       ``[T]hat [Netanyahu] wishes to [reopen peace talks] as soon \n     as possible and that he is ready, willing, and able to be \n     personally involved in such talks.''\n       I flew to Damascus following my meeting with Prime Minister \n     Benjamin Netanyahu to convey the message to Asad. As I later \n     said on the Senate floor:\n       ``President Asad did generally seem to share Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu's desire to continue to ease and avoid military \n     tensions which could lead to unintended hostilities. Asad \n     received this portion of Prime Minister Netanyahu's message \n     positively and reiterated his own return message to the same \n     effect.''\n     As I further noted in my Senate speech:\n       ``I came away from this round of meetings convinced that \n     the logjam might be broken, but only with direct action by \n     the President of the United States.''\n       I returned to the region in December 1997, and as I said \n     before the Senate, I came away from meetings with Prime \n     Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Asad with the \n     conviction that:`\n       ``Activist intervention by the President could well bring \n     the Israeli-Syrian tract to a conclusion. As to the \n     Palestinian-Israeli tract, it is much more complicated. But, \n     here again I have urged the President to bring Mr. Netanyahu \n     and Mr. Arafat into the same room, at the same time, to \n     hear their complaints and to try to bring a resolution to \n     these very serious problems.''\n       In December 1998, I traveled with President Clinton to the \n     Middle East to encourage the advancement of the Israeli-\n     Palestinian peace process in the wake of the accords reached \n     in October of 1998 at Wye Plantation. As I noted following \n     the trip:\n       ``Although somewhat overshadowed by the pending impeachment \n     process, the President's trip was useful, I believe, in \n     applying pressure to the sides to abide by their commitments \n     toward future progress.''\n       During my August 1999 trip to Israel, I met with Foreign \n     Minister David Levy and Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Prime \n     Minister Barak explained to me that if Israel did not make \n     peace at that time, he was certain that there would be \n     another war in the Middle East. I understood that it was for \n     this reason that he wanted to move forward rapidly with the \n     Wye Accords, despite the political risk.\n       In January 2000, I traveled to Israel and met with Prime \n     Minister Barak and Mr. Dan Meridor, a member of the Knesset \n     and Chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense \n     Committee. Prime Minister Barak and I discussed the recent \n     Syrian-Israeli peace talks. I also joined Major General Uzi \n     Dayan, the Israeli Defense Force Deputy Chief of Staff and \n     cousin of the late Moshe Dayan, in reviewing the Arrow Anti-\n     Missile System, a weapon with a theater ballistic missile \n     defense capability. I understood then that rockets launched \n     by Hezbollah and Hamas pose a major threat to Israel's \n     security. To counter this threat, I have long supported full \n     funding for the Arrow Anti-Missile System, the ``David's \n     Sling'' Weapon System, and the Counter Terrorism Technical \n     Support Working Group. I have helped secure over $1.4 billion \n     for the Arrow Anti-Missile System over the past 19 years.\n       Syrian President Hafez al-Asad died in June 2000. I was the \n     only member of Congress to attend his funeral. It was a 33-\n     hour trip--15 hours over, 3 hours on the ground, and 15 hours \n     back. I made the trip to pay my respects and to meet the new \n     President, Bashar al-Asad. I found my 9 meetings with \n     President Hafez al-Asad between 1988 and his death in 2000 to \n     be fascinating, very informative and educational for me, and, \n     I think, helpful in promoting better relations between Israel \n     and Syria.\n       In December 2000, I introduced a bill to prohibit \n     assistance to the Palestinian Authority unless and until the \n     President certified to Congress that the Palestinian \n     Authority had removed the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel content \n     included in textbooks, used in schools, and on radio and \n     television broadcasts made by publicly funded facilities in \n     the Palestinian Authority-controlled areas of the West Bank \n     and Gaza.\n       In January 2001, I traveled to Israel and met with Prime \n     Minister Barak and Likud leader Ariel Sharon and discussed \n     negotiations with Chairman Arafat. As I recounted on the \n     floor of the Senate:\n       ``Prime Minister Barak stated that the only reason he had \n     not already ended his negotiations with Arafat was to give \n     President Clinton, who had personally invested so much in the \n     negotiations, one last chance to broker peace in the \n     region.''\n       I returned three months later, in April, and met with Prime \n     Minister Ariel Sharon, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, former \n     Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Minister of Defense Binyamin \n     Eliezer. I described the mood and content of my meeting with \n     Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in my subsequent report to the \n     Senate:\n       ``Our meeting was conducted with a backdrop of an \n     escalating conflict. During the previous evening, Israeli \n     planes had bombed a Syrian radar installation in Lebanon in \n     retaliation for the actions of Hezbollah in south Lebanon. I \n     started my conversation with the Prime Minister by noting \n     that the Egyptian Foreign Minister had asked me to talk to \n     Chairman Arafat. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wasted no time \n     in delivering his message. The policy of the Israeli \n     government would be to draw a distinction between the \n     civilian population and terrorists. . . . He stated that he \n     plans to ease the conditions in the territories. . . . \n     Although Sharon did express some willingness to negotiation, \n     it was clear that in his eyes the plan pushed by President \n     Clinton in his waning days in office, is dead.''\n       At the time of my March 2002 trip to Israel, the United \n     States was still reeling from the attacks of September 11, \n     2001. During my visit I met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon \n     and PLO Chairman Arafat. As recorded in my trip report:\n       ``When I saw Chairman Arafat, I conveyed [former US Central \n     Command Commander, General Anthony Zinni's] message that \n     Chairman Arafat ought to make an emphatic, unequivocal \n     statement in Arabic to stop the suicide bombings. Chairman \n     Arafat refused to do that.''\n     I pursued this issue further, and on October 30, 2003, I held \n     a Labor, Health, Human Services and Education Subcommittee \n     hearing titled ``Palestinian Education: Teaching Peace or \n     War?'' in which the subcommittee examined the Palestinian \n     Authority's role in encouraging Palestinian youth to commit \n     suicide bombings.\n       During my March 2002 trip I also traveled to Damascus and \n     met with President Bashar al-Asad. As I told the Senate:\n       ``I commented about President Asad's [2001] speech where he \n     equated Naziism with Zionism. I told him that that not only \n     was unacceptable and problematic for the international Jewish \n     community, but for the international community generally. . . \n     . I said equating Zionism and Naziism is very repugnant, that \n     the principal reason for the Jewish action in Israel was the \n     Holocaust and the incarceration of six million Jews, and that \n     kind of equation is unacceptable.''\n       During my January 2003 trip to the region, Prime Minister \n     Ariel Sharon castigated Syria for harboring terrorist \n     organizations and aiding Hezbollah in Lebanon. I asked Prime \n     Minister Ariel Sharon if he would be willing to enter into \n     peace negotiations with Damascus, brokered by the United \n     States, similar to those which Prime Minister Rabin had \n     participated in in the 1990s. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon \n     acquiesced with the assurances that there would be no \n     preconditions to the talks. Three days later, I passed this \n     message along to President Bashar al-Asad, who responded \n     favorably, saying he was willing to participate in peace \n     talks with Israel. As I noted in The Washington Quarterly:\n       ``He said that he did not think it appropriate to conclude \n     a treaty before Israel and the Palestinian Authority had \n     reached a final settlement but that Syrian-Israeli talks \n     could proceed on a separate track.''\n     During this trip I also met with former Israeli Prime \n     Minister Ehud Barak, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, \n     Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Attorney General \n     Elyakim Rubenstein, and chief Palestinian Authority \n     negotiator Saeb Erekat, to whom I expressed my opinion of the \n     need for the Chairman to step aside, as I thought it \n     unrealistic to rely on Chairman Arafat in the peace process \n     because of the evidence implicating him in terror.\n       On November 8, 2005, as Chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, I held a hearing titled ``Saudi Arabia: Friend or \n     Foe in the War on Terror,'' to examine the role of the Saudis \n     in allowing illicit financing of terrorist groups, including \n     Palestinian terrorist organizations, from within the kingdom \n     and in disseminating hateful anti-American and anti-Israeli \n     propaganda throughout Islamic schools and mosques in the U.S. \n     In June 2005, and again in November 2007, I introduced \n     legislation calling for full Saudi cooperation in the \n     investigation of terrorist incidents and an end to Saudi \n     support for institutions that fund, train, incite, encourage \n     or aid and abet terrorism.\n       In December 2005, I traveled to Israel and met with former \n     Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former Prime Minister Shimon \n     Peres. Peres and I discussed the Palestinian Authority and he \n     said that if Hamas were to win the upcoming elections, it \n     would be a wasted victory because Hamas is a religious based \n     group and has no room for compromise. In an August 2006 visit \n     to Israel I met with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense \n     minister Amir Peretz. Prime Minister Olmert and I discussed \n     Iran, and he emphasized that the international community must \n     realize the threat Iran poses and act to confront it \n     accordingly. As I noted to the Senate following my trip:\n       ``On the question of Hamas, [Prime Minister Olmert] \n     expressed hope that Abu Mazen would exert his authority and \n     garner more control over the territories.''\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\n     Defense Minister Peretz and I discussed the conflict with \n     Hezbollah. I said in my trip report:\n       ``Peretz expressed his view that the International \n     Community must examine the rules of war for the UN mission in \n     southern Lebanon as Hezbollah is not a conventional force.''\n       I concurred, believing that, if there were not a sufficient \n     peacekeeping force on the ground, Hezbollah would have the \n     opportunity to rearm.\n       In December 2006, I traveled to Israel and met with Prime \n     Minister Olmert, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, and former \n     Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A major issue of \n     discussion was President Asad's interest in resuming peace \n     negotiations.\n       During this trip, I traveled to Damascus against explicit \n     objections of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. I \n     considered her objections, but felt that traveling to Syria \n     was necessary in order to keep dialogue open between our \n     nations. I believed that Senators have a role such as the one \n     I was undertaking and the constitutional doctrine of \n     separation of powers gave me ample standing to pursue the \n     course of conduct I thought appropriate. On this occasion, I \n     met extensively for more than an hour with Foreign Minister \n     Walid al-Mouallem and the next day for a little over an hour \n     with President Bashar al-Asad. President Asad said that he \n     was interested in undertaking peace negotiations with Israel. \n     He said he was obviously looking for a return of the Golan, \n     in return for which he would provide assistance on the \n     fragile truce which Israel then had with Hezbollah.\n       I pressed President Bashar al-Asad on the obligations Syria \n     had to abide by U.N. Resolution 1701 not to support \n     Hezbollah, and he said Syria would honor that obligation. I, \n     also, pressed him on allowing the U.S. investigation into the \n     assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri, and again I \n     received his assurances on that subject. It is always \n     difficult to know the validity of such assurances, but I \n     think the dialogue and the conversation and pressing the \n     point is very worthwhile.\n       Following my meeting, I wrote to President al-Asad to \n     reiterate previous requests for assistance in determining the \n     fate of Guy Hever, the Israeli soldier who disappeared from \n     the Golan Heights on August 17, 1997. My efforts proved to no \n     avail.\n       When I later told Prime Minister Olmert about Asad's desire \n     to negotiate, he said Israel would need a ``credible sign'' \n     that Asad is sincere before giving him legitimacy.\n       In March, 2007, I joined 78 of my Senate colleagues in \n     writing to Secretary Rice to express our support for the \n     principles put forward by the Quartet regarding restrictions \n     on aid to the Palestinian Authority. As proposed by the \n     Quartet, for the Palestinian Authority to receive direct aid, \n     it would have to: recognize Israel's right to exist; renounce \n     violence and terror; and accept previous Israeli/Palestinian \n     agreements. In the letter we expressed disappointment that \n     the Mecca agreement between Hamas and Fatah failed to meet \n     these principles.\n       In September 2007, I wrote a letter to Secretary Rice \n     stating:\n       ``The essence is that a strong U.S. effort to resolve the \n     differences between Israel and Syria could have a profound \n     effect on changing Syria's provocative/antagonistic \n     activities with Iran, Lebanon, Hezbollah and Hamas.''\n     In October 2007, I wrote a letter to President Bush urging \n     him to personally participate in the Mideast peace process:\n       ``As you know, I have done considerable work on these \n     issues over the past two decades. . . . I believe that a \n     major U.S. effort to push Israeli-Syrian negotiations could \n     be very productive over the next several months. . . . \n     Minister Barak said that your personal participation in such \n     negotiations at this time could be the causative factor in \n     producing peace in the Mideast.''\n       My most recent visit to the region came in December 2007. \n     In Israel, I met with Prime Minster Olmert, Foreign Minister \n     Livni, Defense Minister Barak, President Peres, and Likud \n     leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Issues discussed included the \n     November 2007 Annapolis Conference, Iran's influence in the \n     region, and what could be gained by engaging Syria to end its \n     support for Hezbollah and Hamas. Regarding the last topic, I \n     said on the Senate floor following my trip:\n       ``But as Prime Minister Olmert commented . . . there are \n     very material advantages which could come if Syria would stop \n     supporting Hamas. It would promote the possibilities of a \n     treaty between Palestinian President Abbas and Israel. If \n     Syria would stop supporting Hezbollah and destabilizing \n     Lebanon, there could be a great advantage. Such a treaty \n     would have the potential of driving a wedge between Syria and \n     Iran which would be of value.''\n       During this trip, I also met with Syrian President Bashar \n     al-Asad and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. I again \n     asked President Asad about the fates of Ron Arad and Guy \n     Hever, and was told, as I had been in the past, that they \n     have no knowledge as to what happened to them. I also asked \n     about captured soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who \n     had been taken by Hezbollah, and Gilad Shalit, who was being \n     held by Hamas. I later met with Gilad Shalit's father in \n     Washington, to whom I reiterated my pledge to do whatever I \n     could to help secure the return of captured Israeli soldiers \n     or, where they had perished, to obtain their remains.\n       A major issue of discussion with President Asad and \n     President Abbas was what could now be done to pursue the \n     conclusions of the Annapolis Conference, at which the Joint \n     Israeli-Palestinian Declaration was issued:\n       ``We express our determination to bring an end to \n     bloodshed, suffering and decades of conflict between our \n     peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, \n     security, justice, dignity, respect and mutual recognition; \n     to propagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront \n     terrorism and incitement, whether committed by Palestinians \n     or Israelis.''\n       In April 2008, I introduced a resolution urging Palestinian \n     Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to officially abrogate the \n     ten articles in the Fatah Constitution that call for Israel's \n     destruction and terrorism against Israel, that oppose any \n     political solution, and that label Zionism as racism. By \n     striking that language from its constitution, Fatah would be \n     setting an example for the Arab world. It would demonstrate \n     that the Palestinian leadership understands the importance of \n     words and perceptions in the peace process.\n       The problem of the institutionalization of inflammatory \n     language in the Middle East extends beyond the Fatah \n     Constitution. The Center for Religious Freedom, formerly \n     affiliated with Freedom House, in a 2006 report entitled \n     ``Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerance,'' stated that \n     despite statements in 2005 by the Saudi Foreign Minister that \n     their educational curricula have been reformed, this is \n     ``simply not the case.'' On the contrary, religious textbooks \n     continue to advocate the destruction of any non-Wahhabi \n     Muslim. Saudi Arabia has established Wahhabism, an extreme \n     form of Islam, as the official state doctrine, and about five \n     million children are instructed each year in Islamic studies \n     using Saudi Ministry of Education textbooks.\n       My intent in bringing the Fatah Constitution into focus now \n     is not to undermine the Presidency of Mahmoud Abbas. Rather, \n     my intent is to ensure that these problems of perception are \n     addressed now so that all parties can take further steps \n     towards peace.\n       As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on October \n     15, 2007 in Ramallah:\n     ``If you're going to have a two-state solution, you have to \n     accept the right of the other party to exist. If you're going \n     to have a two-state solution that is born of negotiation, \n     you're going to have to renounce violence.''\n     The purpose of the Fatah Constitution resolution is to urge \n     President Abbas to take action, not only in words, but with \n     deeds, just as I encouraged Chairman Arafat to do over a \n     decade ago.\n       In addition to securing direct aid for Israel, I have used \n     my position on the Appropriations Committee to urge my \n     colleagues to maintain important Middle East provisions in \n     the appropriations measures, including, but not limited to: \n     the multitude of policy provisions, restrictions, and \n     auditing requirements linked to bilateral assistance to the \n     Palestinians designed to ensure that no portion of the aid is \n     diverted or misused, provisions designed to compel the \n     Palestinian Authority to commit to negotiations with Israel \n     and to fight terror, and provisions to ensure that steps are \n     taken to promote the detection and destruction of smuggling \n     networks and tunnels that lead from Egypt to Gaza.\n       It is also worth recognizing that the relationship between \n     the United States and Israel is built on more than our shared \n     foreign policy objectives and common defensive goals. Our \n     nations have long benefited from strong business and economic \n     alliances in numerous industries. For example, American \n     public and private institutions engaged in the field of \n     renewable energy research and development are increasingly \n     collaborating with their Israeli counterparts, and I have \n     worked to promote such partnerships.\n       Congress has demonstrated its recognition of and support \n     for cooperation between the renewable energy industry sectors \n     within the United States and Israel. A Senate resolution \n     passed by the Senate in April 2008 recognizing the 60th \n     anniversary of the independence of the state of Israel cites \n     Israel as being at the forefront of research and development \n     in the field of renewable energy sources. The Energy \n     Independence and Security Act of 2007 included a provision \n     authorizing funding for grants to Americans and Israelis to \n     encourage collaboration on research, development, and \n     commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency \n     technologies. This program was originally proposed in \n     legislation introduced by Senator Gordon Smith, the United \n     States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act of 2007, which I \n     supported as a cosponsor.\n       During full Senate Appropriations Committee consideration \n     of the fiscal year 2009 Energy and Water Appropriations \n     measure, I worked to secure funding for the newly authorized \n     U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation program. Given the energy \n     crisis in which we find ourselves and the prospect of \n     leveraging Israeli expertise to pursue our renewable energy \n     goals, I introduced an amendment to provide $5 million to \n     fund the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act. Subcommittee \n     Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Domenici agreed to include \n     my amendment in the bill, as reported by the committee. I \n     look forward to working with my colleagues on this important \n     matter as we proceed through the appropriations process.\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\n       This statement summarizes some of my efforts to maintain a \n     strong U.S.-Israel relationship, to strengthen Israel as a \n     key strategic partner, and to promote an Israel-Syria peace \n     treaty. Active participation by the Clinton Administration \n     enabled the parties to come very close to an accord in 1995 \n     and 2000. Israel potentially has much to gain if Lebanon is a \n     strong, independent nation without undue Syrian influence or \n     Hezbollah domination. If Syria stopped supporting Hamas, that \n     entity committed to the destruction of Israel, might be \n     sufficiently weakened to enable the Palestinian Authority to \n     negotiate a Peace Treaty with Israel. A corollary benefit \n     could be to drive a wedge between Syria and Iran.\n       For reasons amplified in my Senate floor statement on June \n     16, 2006 and my article in The Washington Quarterly's Winter \n     2006-2007 issue entitled ``Dialogue with Adversaries,'' I am \n     firmly convinced that aggressive diplomacy holds the key to \n     resolving international disputes, including the Mideast peace \n     process, and should be employed by the new Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10856-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10856-S10858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ATTORNEY GENERAL DESIGNATE ERIC HOLDER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I further sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about the scheduling of the hearing for Attorney General \ndesignate Eric Holder.\n  In looking toward the hearing process, I am looking for a very \nconstructive engagement to determine the qualifications of Mr. Holder. \nThere is no intent on my part or on the part of any of my colleagues on \nthe Republican side of the aisle to engage in partisan sniping. As I \nsay, we intend to be constructive and not destructive. We are looking \nto strengthen the Department of Justice.\n  The position of Attorney General is an extraordinarily important \nposition. We have seen that during the administration of Attorney \nGeneral Alberto Gonzales, stated candidly, the Department was not well \nhandled. That is a candid statement and also a very mild statement.\n  During the course of Attorney General Gonzales' tenure, there were so \nmany situations where the Attorney General molded his views to \naccommodate his appointer, the President of the United States. A great \ndeal that went on in the Department of Justice was partisan and not in \nthe interests of the work of the Department or in the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  We have seen, since 9/11/2001, a vast extension of Executive \nauthority. We found the terrorist surveillance program was initiated by \nthe President without consultation under the tradition of notifying the \nchairman, which I was during the 109th Congress, or the ranking member. \nWe found there was an engagement with the telephone companies to engage \nin electronic surveillance, again without notifying the chairman or \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee and without notifying the \nintelligence committees of both Houses, as mandated by law. Further was \nthe expansion of signing statements all during the tenure of the \nAttorney General.\n  Without going into the issues of politicization, they were rampant \nduring the tenure of Attorney General Gonzales. I refer to an article, \ncoauthored by the current chairman of the committee and myself, which \nappeared not too long ago in Politico, on October 28, 2008, where we \nsaid in part:\n\n       The Attorney General must be someone who deeply appreciates \n     and respects the work and commitment of the thousands of men \n     and women who work in the branches and divisions of the \n     Justice Department, day in and day out, without regard to \n     politics or ideology, doing their best to enforce the law and \n     promote justice.\n\n  With respect to Attorney General designate Holder, there is no doubt \nhe comes to this nomination with an outstanding record, for the most \npart. Not without question but for the most part. He has an excellent \neducational background from Columbia: undergrad and law degree, a trial \nattorney in the Department of Justice, an associate judge of the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia, U.S. attorney, Deputy \nAttorney General, Acting Attorney General--a very distinguished resume, \nwhich I have recited.\n  But there are questions which have to be inquired into fairly, as \nalready noted in the commentaries of the media on the editorial pages. \nThere has been considerable publicity about the pardon of Marc Rich. \nThere was a case involving Mr. Rich, who was a fugitive, who had given \nvery substantial sums of money to entities connected to the President. \nThe regular procedures for a pardon were bypassed. The Department of \nJustice was not consulted. The attorneys in the Southern District of \nNew York, which was handling the Rich case, were opposed to the pardon.\n  From my own days as district attorney of Philadelphia, where I dealt \nwith celebrated cases involving people who were fugitives, who had \nfled, that is about as serious a matter as you could find and hardly \none where there would be an expectation of leniency or pardon to wipe \nout the charge, eliminate the matter, while the defendant was in \nabsentia.\n  There was an extensive report filed on this issue by the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Government Reform, the 107th Congress, \nsecond session. It is available for anyone to read. There are quite a \nnumber of very serious questions involving what happened with Mr. \nHolder and the people involved there.\n  The concern that arises is why Mr. Holder lent the recommendation, \nwhich has been characterized as neutral leaning in favor, in this \ncontext. I come to no conclusions on the matter. I approach this \nmatter, as I try to approach all matters, with an open mind. But in an \nextensive interview with Mr. Holder he has presented his views. I don't \nthink it is useful to get into the specifics as to the precise concerns \nwhich I raised and his precise answers. Let that await a day where we \nhave a hearing and where Mr. Holder is in a position to speak for \nhimself. But by analogy to the Gonzales tenure, I think it is \nimperative we be sure the Attorney General of the United States does \nnot bend his views to accommodate his appointer; that the Attorney \nGeneral does not bend his views in any way which is partisan or \npolitical, to serve any interest other than the interests of justice.\n  As noted in the article cited in Politico, where you have the \nprofessionals in the Department of Justice, they wouldn't even meet \nwith attorneys for Mr. Rich, they thought it was such an open-and-shut \ncase, and were opposed--at least according to information provided. \nThis is all to be brought out at a hearing. But to run counter to the \nviews of the professionals is a major red flag which has to be inquired \ninto and inquired into with some depth.\n  Then we have the situation where Attorney General Reno recused \nherself on the issue of appointing an independent counsel to \ninvestigate alleged--and I emphasize alleged--illegal fundraising by \nVice President Albert Gore out of the White House. There was the \nrelatively notorious incident where the Vice President was at a meeting \nand drank a lot of ice tea and absented himself from certain parts of \nthe meeting where he was not able to--or had a rationale for not \nknowing certain things.\n  I questioned Attorney General Reno in detail about that during \nJudiciary Committee hearings and she said: Well, there just wasn't \nsufficient evidence.\n  She had disregarded a document, a note taken by someone present, \nbecause, as she said, it did not refresh that witness's recollection.\n  I asked her about the doctrine of prior recollection recorded, which \nis a well-known exception to the hearsay rule. She denied knowing about \nit.\n  I note a frown on the face of the Presiding Officer, who is a \ndistinguished district attorney herself. Doubtless we could speak at \nlength about prior recollection recorded. I mention that because of the \ncurious circumstances of what happened there. There we had an assistant \nU.S. attorney named LaBella, who was asked to take on the job of making \na recommendation. According to the information provided to me, he made \na recommendation for an independent counsel and the professionals in \nthe Department asked for an independent counsel, and it was overruled.\n  I am not going to comment about Mr. Holder's role. Let him respond to \nthat and let us take that up in due course. But here again is a \npotential situation where the interests of justice and objectivity were \nnot followed in the highest levels of the Department of Justice when \nMr. Holder was in charge, with the Attorney General, Attorney General \nReno, having recused herself.\n  There are many other matters which warrant inquiry, and I will not \ntake the time to go into them now. They are\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\nreferenced in a letter which eight Republican members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee sent to Attorney General Mukasey, requesting \ninformation from the Department of Justice files.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2008.\n     Hon.

Thank you \n     for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Arlen Specter, Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Sam \n           Brownback, Jon Kyl, Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, Tom A. \n           Coburn.\n\n\n                               guidelines\n\n       (1) This request is continuing in character. and if \n     additional responsive documents come to your attention \n     following the date of production, please provide such \n     documents to the Committee promptly.\n       (2) As used herein, ``document'' means the original (or an \n     additional copy when an original is not available) and each \n     distribution copy of writings or other graphic material, \n     whether inscribed by hand or by mechanical, electronic, \n     photographic or other means, including without limitation \n     correspondence, memoranda, publications, articles, \n     transcripts, diaries, telephone logs, message sheets, \n     records, voice recordings, tapes, film, dictabelts and other \n     data compilations from which information can be obtained. \n     This request seeks production of all documents described, \n     including all drafts and distribution copies, and \n     contemplates production of responsive documents in their \n     entirety, without abbreviation or expurgation.\n       (3) In the event that any requested document has been \n     destroyed or discarded or otherwise disposed of, please \n     identify the document as completely as possible, including \n     without limitation the date, author(s), addressee(s), \n     recipient(s), title, and subject matter, and the reason for \n     disposal of the document and the identity of all persons who \n     authorized disposal of the document.\n       (4) If a claim is made that any requested document will not \n     be produced by reason of a privilege of any kind, describe \n     each such document by date, author(s), addressee(s), \n     recipient(s), title, and subject matter, and set forth the \n     nature of the claimed privilege with respect to each \n     document.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. When hearings were held for Attorney General Ashcroft, \nthey were held from January 16 to January 19 of 2001. At that time, \nthere were 2 days of testimony from Attorney General Ashcroft, and the \ncommittee heard from 23 outside witnesses. May I remind everyone that \nJohn Ashcroft was a well-known person to the committee. He had been in \nthe Senate. He had served on the Judiciary Committee. We knew him very \nwell. But that didn't stop a very full, detailed inquiry. It was not \ndone in a rush.\n  With respect to Mr. Holder's situation, we have in the committee some \n86 boxes of archived committee documents relating to Mr. Holder's \ntenure in the Department of Justice. We expect those materials to \nincrease very substantially when we receive materials from the \nDepartment of Justice and the Clinton Library.\n  Similar document requests were made to the Department of Justice in \nthe Reagan Library during the confirmation of Chief Justice John \nRoberts, and they yielded some 65,000 additional pages of documents.\n  As of the present time, we have not yet received Mr. Holder's \nquestionnaire, his nomination materials, or the FBI background \ninvestigation.\n  I have taken the time to come to the floor to outline, very briefly, \nsome of the issues. They are set out in more detail in the letter which \nis now made a part of the record to Attorney General Mukasey, asking \nfor specific matters regarding Mr. Holder. There are other matters \nwhich are in the media which I think are better left for further \ninvestigation, even before the hearing, before there is any public \ncomment about it. But we are looking at a very major matter.\n  The Department of Justice has enormous responsibilities in the battle \nagainst terrorism and in the protection of civil rights. That is a \nbalance which has to be maintained. There are real questions as to \nwhether it has been maintained since 9/11. Those are matters for \ninquiry.\n  There are very substantial matters to be inquired into on the Justice \nDepartment position on waiver of attorney-client privilege, which \nstarted with the Holder memorandum when he was Deputy Attorney General \nand then went forward to the Thompson memorandum and the McNulty \nmemorandum and so forth. Also, there are major matters of legislation \nnow pending on the subject of reporters' shield, where the Department \nof Justice has taken a view which I believe has to be modified by \nlegislation if we cannot get some accommodation with the Department.\n  That is a very brief statement as to the issues which we are looking \nfor. As I look at this matter, it seems to me\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\nnot realistic or fair to begin hearings before January 26.\n  The week of January 19 is going to be occupied with the inauguration. \nAnd to have adequate time to prepare, it seems to me, that needs to be \ndone. When we had hearings involving Chief Justice Roberts and \nAssociate Justice Alito, consideration was made of the minority point \nof view, and extensive discussions were had, and there was an \naccommodation and agreement reached as to when the hearing was to be \nheld.\n  So we are looking at a serious matter and we have to do it right. It \nis going to take some time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, if anyone sees the quietude that is \nenveloping our Chamber, they can reasonably ask a question about \nwhether we are doing anything, is any work being done, what is taking \nplace. I must tell you that I have to ask the same question.\n  The American people are at a point of great stress. They expect us to \nbe hard at work solving a major problem facing us. I don't see the kind \nof visible stirring that ought to accompany our decisions over whether \nto get this job done. I hope that as we proceed further, we can get \nsome kind of an agreement to at least let the American people know \nwhether we support this idea that we provide some support for ailing \ncompanies that provide a lot of jobs in our society and how we can \npresent economic opportunity that is so important for us.\n  As we work to provide a better future for our country, it is obvious \nthat we face a particularly difficult choice at this moment. An \nessential segment of the American industrial base, the U.S. auto \nindustry, is at a critical juncture. These companies have been \nmismanaged, they have lacked foresight, and they have been out of touch \nwith what consumers wanted. They failed to understand the demand for \nfuel-efficient automobiles with higher gas mileage and lower costs. \nThey failed to provide innovative designs to encourage consumers around \nthe world to buy American. Instead, they stood by like spectators at a \nsporting event while the first-place trophy was snatched away from the \nAmerican people.\n  I came to the Senate from the business community. I was chairman of a \nmajor company in this country, a company that now employs over 40,000 \npeople. One thing I learned is that you must constantly update your \nproduct line if you want to succeed because otherwise someone else will \nand you will lose the opportunity, you will lose the sales, and you \nwill lose your credibility. I find it shocking that the leaders of \nthese giant companies failed to understand this basic rule of business. \nInstead of modernizing, they chose another path. They chose to spend \nmillions of dollars on high-priced lobbyists to visit with us in our \noffices, asking Congress not to push them on fuel efficiency, not to \nurge that they move ahead with more efficient cars. Now they are here \nbegging for our help.\n  Unfortunately, the disaster facing the big three is not an isolated \nproblem. It has implications for every American. If the big three go \nunder, millions of jobs could go with them. In my State alone, New \nJersey, the auto industry employs more than 43,000 people. Thousands of \nmanufacturers, suppliers, dealers, insurance companies, and small \nbusinesses would likely be imperiled if the automakers fall. Our \neconomy could go into further shock absorbing that kind of collapse, \nespecially now with the unemployment rate the highest it has been in 15 \nyears.\n  So now we are being asked to decide whether we help General Motors, \nChrysler, and Ford. If we agree to help them, this legislation has to \nhave guarantees to protect the American taxpayers and for us to get \nthis money back if we put it up at this time. For one thing, this \ncannot be free money. So it is essential that we only provide the big \nthree with loans and lines of credit, not gifts, and that they have a \nclear plan to pay the money back. This relief package must also put \nstrict caps on executive compensation and include an outright ban on \nbig bonuses and golden parachutes for the highest paid managers. What \nis more, companies that receive funding must suspend paying any \ndividends to the shareholders. That is where these companies are. If we \ndon't do something, their equity will be worthless. We have to make \nsure no dividends are paid until the taxpayers are paid back the money \nwe are going to put in. In addition, they have to make a promise to \nfinally work toward greater fuel efficiency.\n  To make sure automakers live up to these obligations--because we \nfound out we cannot rely on their promises--the President should go \nahead and appoint a car czar, someone who is devoting full time and \nattention to the resolution of this great problem. This administrator \nmust work to get the Government repaid while monitoring the companies' \nefforts to make sure they stay on a path to long-term success. That \nmeans the big three must be restructured to assure competitiveness, \nhigher quality, profitability, improved fuel efficiency, and renewed \nmarket leadership.\n  Doing nothing to help the big three could have catastrophic \nconsequences for the job market and for American business leadership. \nHowever, a relief package for the big three automakers is no substitute \nfor other stimulus provisions that our country desperately needs. We \nare in a severe recession, and for every month that this recession \ncontinues, more families fall behind, more small businesses fail, more \nlife savings are lost, and more houses go into foreclosure. We have to \nfind ways to change direction. We need bold strokes to get us out of \nthis crisis. We need to stimulate our economy with infrastructure \ninvestments that will create jobs, increase energy independence, and \nget people to work quickly and efficiently. Transportation investments \ncan give huge returns for the dollar. If we repair our schools and \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure, we can create 2.5 million new \njobs while reversing the declines we are witnessing. I mention these \nthings because by doing them, we employ more people and we can be more \noptimistic as a country about our future.\n  It is my hope that we can work together, all of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats, energetically to meet these grave challenges. I put out a \nplea to ask our colleagues across the aisle to join with us to show the \nAmerican people that we are hard at work, that we do care about what is \nhappening, that we are worried about families being dispossessed from \ntheir homes, that we are worried about children who cannot afford an \neducation, that we are worried about investments that will improve the \nquality of life in our society. I hope they will come around.\n  I saw several of our colleagues on C-SPAN today at a press conference \ntalking about why they didn't see this as something of value. Something \nof value is evident when work is being done, when the public is hearing \na debate about this crisis, when the other side of the aisle isn't just \nbeing stubborn because they don't want to give the Democrats or \nwhomever an advantage. We need to debate whether we can pull these \ncompanies out of the holes they are in, save jobs, and restore \nAmerica's leadership in industry.\n  Many in our country have lost faith as they worry about their ability \nto support themselves and their families. They look to us here in \nWashington to\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\nput aside partisanship and lead the way toward recovery. I hope we can \nget on with that. I hope we can get here to the floor, work as long and \nas hard as we have to, and with urgency, to show once again that we are \nsupporting the interests of the American people.\n\n  It happens that these companies are in an obvious place where \nsomething terrible can happen. But what matters is that we work to do \nsomething that brings value to our country, value to our people. We \nhave to at least consider it. I am not saying we have to pass any \nparticular bill. We want to make sure the things we are concerned about \nare in there. But we have to have activity instead of stubbornness and \nan unwillingness to actively consider solutions to the problems facing \nus.\n  We are a great country, America, with its abundant resources and \nstrong people, willing and eager to do their share.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to recognize \nand pay tribute to my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Chuck Hagel, who \nis retiring from the Senate. When I entered this body nearly 8 years \nago, Senator Hagel welcomed me, and since then we have worked together \non a number of important issues for the good of our great State and our \ncountry. We teamed up to seek Federal assistance to help Nebraskans \nrecover from natural disasters, such as floods, ice storms, and \ndrought; to win congressional approval for naming the new FBI building \nin Omaha after our esteemed late colleague, Senator J. James Exon, and \non numerous other Nebraska projects.\n  Like me, Chuck Hagel grew up in small communities in Nebraska. It is \na special experience to be raised among Nebraskans under the wide open \nskies of the Great Plains. Helping hands are always nearby and \nopportunities seem limitless. From our families, friends, and \nneighbors, we both learned the bedrock values of love, of community, of \nfaith, responsibility to others, and devotion to country. These values \nhave been evident during Senator Hagel's tenure in this body.\n  Also evident has been an important perspective he shared, one only a \nfew Senators know firsthand, about the reality of war, gained as a \ndecorated U.S. Army sergeant on violent battlefields in the Vietnam war \nand later as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Veterans' Administration \nduring the Reagan administration.\n  Here in the Senate, he represented the people of Nebraska and the \nUnited States well as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nBanking Committee, the Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, the \nIntelligence Committee, and the Rules Committee. He will long be \nremembered as one of our most outspoken and candid Members, as a \npatriot, and as one who took seriously his duties. Particularly through \nexpressing his views on foreign policy, he fiercely advocated the \nconstitutional principle that the legislative, executive, and judicial \nbranches of government are equal partners.\n  I take this opportunity to commend him for his honorable service to \nour State and Nation over these many years. And whatever path Chuck \nHagel embarks on next, I wish him and his wife Lilibet, daughter Allyn, \nand son Ziller only the best in their lives. It has been an honor to \nserve with him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I come to the floor to talk a little \nabout the so-called auto bailout bill that is someplace out there \nwandering around. We don't know where.\n  I was in Iowa last week and traveling around and talking with people. \nA couple things kept coming up from time to time. One was the money we \nput into the so-called TARP program, the money we gave to Secretary \nPaulson before we adjourned in October and went home for the campaign, \nthe $700 billion. As we know, they got $350 billion of that, and now \nthere is some talk that they will come back for the other $350 billion \nsometime, probably not this year but early next year.\n  As we look at what happened to that $350 billion, a lot of people are \nquite disturbed, and count me among them. Rather than using the money \nto put out to banks to help extend credit, some of the banks were using \nit to buy other banks and get bigger. Some banks are using this money \nto invest in private equity firms, buy up businesses. One came to my \nattention last week when I was in Iowa--a company I don't need to \nname--a company that had gone into bankruptcy. The owner of the company \nhad wanted to buy it out of bankruptcy for a certain\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\namount. His bank was Bank of America. They wouldn't extend him the \ncredit. So a private equity firm came in and bought the company, and \ntheir bank is Bank of America. So here is a small businessman who \ncouldn't get his own company out of bankruptcy, but a private equity \nfirm could. And they both had the same bank, Bank of America.\n  If this is what is happening with that TARP money, count me out. No \nmore. I voted for that so-called bailout. The more I look at it, the \nmore I wonder if I did the right thing. I wonder where that money is \ngoing. Is it going to help anyone? Quite frankly, at the time I had \nsuggested that an important thing we ought to do is extend the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation ceilings on independent banks from \n$100,000 to 1 million or to 2 million. Then the compromise came in. \nThey extended it from $100,000 to $250,000, which was not much of \nanything except keeping up with inflation from the time the $100,000 \nwas set.\n  My thought was always that these independent banks, quite frankly, do \na much better job of investing your money and my money than those big \ncity banks in New York. They do a better job. They are investing in \nsmall business growth, modernization of companies. To the extent they \nare in mortgages, they are good, solid mortgages, not tightening \nanything out there. So I wanted to make sure that more money would flow \nto independent banks around America that could get credit out to \nsomeone who wants to buy a car or perhaps refinance a house, expand a \nsmall business, invest in new technology. These are the independent \nbanks. This is what they do. But, no, we kept that at $250,000 and put \nall that money into the big banks.\n  Well, I hope we get to address this issue again early next year, \nbecause I wish to see more of this directed to the small, independent \nbanks. It doesn't quite seem as though the money we gave to the big \nbanks is trickling down much. It is sort of staying in New York City, \nplaces such as that. That is where it is staying. It is right there. \nAnd private equity firms are using that money to buy up companies at 10 \ncents on the dollar, companies that they know, when we are through this \nrecession and things start getting better again, are going to be good \ncompanies, have good products. But right now, because of the recession, \nthey are in dire straits. So they are being bought up. Of course, 3 or \n4 or 5 years from now, they are going to be great companies, and people \nbought them at 10 cents on the dollar. Quite frankly, from all \nappearances, it seems that some of this TARP money is going into that. \nWe need more investigation to find out how much.\n  That is a prelude to what I wanted to talk about. I wanted to talk \nabout the auto deal, this auto bill that is going around. I got to \nthinking about our approach earlier on the big bank bailout. We gave \nmoney to the big banks and nothing to the little banks. Not much is \ngoing out to help the consumer. Then I looked at this automobile \nbailout. It started at $25 billion. Then it went to $34 billion. Now I \nhear it is $15 billion and some billions later. The more I read about \nit, they are going to be back next spring for more, and it might take \nas much as $100 billion to get them through this period of time.\n  So what do we do? The first inclination is to take a big bunch of \ntaxpayer money and put it in at the top, as we did last fall with the \nbig banks. So now we are going to give the manufacturers all this \nmoney. I am not certain giving these manufacturers all this money is \ngoing to help them for long. We can give them all the money we want, \nbut if no one is buying their cars, what good does it do? Quite \nfrankly, people aren't buying cars, which is one of the major reasons \nwe are in a recession. If we look at this chart, this is total U.S. \nlight vehicle sales annual rate. You don't need to read all the \nnumbers. What you can see is from November of last year until now, it \nis a steady decline, especially in the last couple of months, a \ntremendous drop in the adjusted annual rate of sales of cars. It has \nbeen coming down, down, until now it is just about dropping off the \nchart.\n  Or we can look at the monthly rate, the big three 2008 sales per \nmonth. You see kind of the same thing. My figures say that sales of the \nbig three auto companies--GM, Ford, and Chrysler--fell from 895,000 in \nJanuary to 363,000 in November. People aren't buying cars. So is the \nanswer to give more money to the manufacturers? I got to thinking about \nthat and thinking about what we had done last fall. I got to thinking, \nwhy don't we take some of this money we are talking about and put it in \nat the bottom rather than putting it in at the top--$34 billion, $25 \nbillion, pick your number.\n  What if we said, rather than giving it to the auto manufacturers, \nlet's say we are going to make a deal. We are going to provide to low-\nincome and modest income Americans something almost like a voucher \nwhere they can go buy a new car. Why don't we give a lot of people in \nAmerica $10,000 and say: Here, go buy a car, put it in at the bottom \nrather than the top? So I am working on legislation which I will be \nintroducing shortly which will do that. Basically it says, if you have \nan adjusted gross income of $40,000 for a household, $25,000 for an \nindividual, and if you have a car that is over 10 years old which you \nhave had registered in your name, titled in your name before now, then \nyou can go to an automobile dealer anywhere in the country, buy a new \ncar, and you will get $10,000 from the Government towards buying that \ncar. So if you bought a car for $15,000, a new car, $10,000 of it is \npaid for by the taxpayers of this country. Now think about this.\n  Also in my bill I am stipulating that to do this, you have to have a \ncar that is older than 10 years, the new car you buy has to get at \nleast 5 miles per gallon more than your old car, and the new car has to \nget at least 25 miles per gallon adjusted; that is your average fuel \nmileage. Look at this: 2008 vehicles sold by the big three that get 25 \nmiles per gallon. Seventeen percent get more than 25 miles per gallon; \n83 percent get less than 25 miles per gallon. I am interested in these \ncars in here: those getting more than 25 miles per gallon. I am \ninterested in the low-income and modest income Americans who can't even \nafford to buy a new car. I am interested in helping the automobile \ncompanies.\n  You tell me: Is it better to take all of our taxpayer money and put \nit in at the top, or how about getting rid of that inventory out there \nof all these new cars that no one is buying? We need to build the \nmarket for cars, putting more people to work at the big three and all \nof the parts manufacturers and all of the others that get jobs when \ncars are sold. Think about the benefits of this. Let's say you are a \nlow-income person and you are going to work and you have an old jalopy \nyou are driving and it breaks down all the time. This happens every day \nin America.\n  You cannot afford a new car, so can you keep repairing your old one, \nfixing it up, patching it up? It is putting out all kinds of bad \nemissions. It is getting low mileage. You want to get it off the road, \nbut you cannot afford to buy a new car. You cannot afford it. But we \nwould like to get those old cars off the road. We would like to have \npeople have a new car that is more fuel efficient.\n  How do we do it? Well, this is one way of doing it. And look at it \nthis way: In terms of what we might see here, for example, as shown on \nthis chart, right now a six-cylinder Chevy Malibu gets 20 miles per \ngallon, but the four-cylinder gets 26 miles per gallon. So it is 30 \npercent more--30 percent more. So people could buy a Chevy Malibu under \nthis proposal. Those that can use the program will select the more \nefficient motor and will have lower fuel bills year after year. And, we \nwill have lower pollution and we will need to import less oil.\n  Now, there is one other piece of this proposal: that if you do \npartake of this program, you need three things. You need to show your \n1040 about what your adjusted gross income is and you need an old car \nthat is at least 10 years old and you need to buy a car that gets at \nleast 5 miles more per gallon than your old car and gets a minimum of \n25 miles per gallon. It needs to be from one of the big three and made \nin America. If you do that, you get $10,000 towards that new car.\n  There is one other stipulation. That old car you have? You have to \nturn it in to the dealer. The Government takes possession and the \nGovernment destroys it, smashes it up, destroys it, chops it up, sells \nit for scrap, so we get millions of these old cars off the road.\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\nThey will not be put back into the used car market.\n  Low-income Americans can get a new car, and it helps the auto \nindustry. Isn't that what we want, a demand pull? We have a demand \npull, and they start selling all these cars they have in inventory they \ncannot sell right now.\n  My bill would stipulate this program could run from enactment through \nall of next year and end on December 31 of next year. So if we are \ngoing to be throwing $100 billion at the automobile companies, or $55 \nbillion--no one knows--why don't we take those billions of dollars and \ngive it to consumers, low-income consumers, to buy a new car that is \nmore fuel efficient, has better emissions controls?\n  It seems to me that is what I call percolate up economics--percolate \nup--not trickle down economics. But no one is talking about this. Why \nshouldn't we be talking about it? Think about all the elderly people in \nthis country who are retired who are driving old cars, but they cannot \nafford a new one. So they are stuck driving an old car they have put a \nlot of money into, to repair this and repair that, paying more for \ngasoline.\n  Well, here is a chance for an elderly person, a couple on a fixed \nincome, to get a new car. Think about it. You can buy a new car. I do \nnot know what a Chevy Malibu car costs. But you can buy a new car for \nabout $15,000, $16,000, and $10,000 of it will be paid for by the \nGovernment. That is not a bad deal.\n  Quite frankly, more credit would be available for that purpose. Well, \nyou can understand that. If I am going to buy a car for $15,000, and \n$10,000 of it is going to be paid for by the Government, and I only \nhave to finance $5,000, you can get all kinds of credit for that \nbecause the car's asset is going to be worth more than that. It is \ngoing to be worth a lot more as you go down in years. So credit will be \navailable easily for something such as that.\n  So, again, this bailout plan the Bush administration and \ncongressional leaders--I have not been involved in that--this plan they \nare drafting fails to answer these two very big questions. In the midst \nof a severe recession, how do we boost demand for new cars? And, \nsecondly, how do we give consumers compelling incentives to purchase \nfuel-efficient cars, especially at a time right now when gas prices are \nplummeting? We know they are going to come back, but right now they are \nplummeting.\n  So, again, I will be introducing the Selling Fuel-Efficient Cars Act \nof 2008--it might be 2009, by the time we get back in January. That is \nmy proposal. Do not put it in at the top. No, do not give it to the big \nboys. Let's let the consumers--low-income and modest income Americans--\nbuy millions--millions--of new cars made in America, made here. Get rid \nof all that inventory. I tell you what, I think you would see that the \nautomobile companies could probably get lines of credit if something \nsuch as that happened. Then they could get back into the market without \nrelying upon the taxpayers anymore.\n  So I guess I would sum it up by saying this: Go to your average \ntaxpayer out there and say: Look, we are probably going to do something \nto save the automobile industry. Now, the taxpayer may say: I don't \nwant to do anything to save them. Well, OK, fine. That is a legitimate \npoint. But let's say that is not your choice. Your choice is: We are \ngoing to put money into the automobile industry. How would you like it \ndone? Would you like it done by taking your tax money and putting it in \nat the top--there will be some restrictions on it; they have to do \ncertain things such as that--putting it in at the top, or would you \nrather have your money go out so the little guy, the little woman, the \nlittle poor people, the retired people can buy a new car, have a little \nmore of an asset, get the old clunkers off the road, have more fuel-\nefficient cars, with less bad emissions, and we will destroy all those \nold cars they turn in? We will destroy them, chop them up.\n  You take that to any average taxpayer out there, and I will bet you \nmy bottom dollar, if given that choice, if those are their two \nchoices--put it in at the top or put it in at the bottom for \nconsumers--they will pick the second choice. They will want to put it \nin for consumers, not just give it to the big boys.\n  So I do not know why no one is talking about this. We should talk \nabout it. We should talk about it more. I do not know. The bill they \nbring up may not be amendable. That is what I hear. But we ought to \noffer this. We ought to have the chance of saying: We can have a \ndifferent approach to bailing out the automobile companies than just \nputting it in at the top.\n  I believe the plan I am proposing will work. It will be better for \nAmerica. It will help a lot of low-income people and elderly people in \nour country to have a new car and we will get millions of old clunkers \noff the road and we will destroy them and we will have a better system \nfor our consumers.\n  So for those who say we have to help the automobile companies, I say, \nOK, but is there only one way or is there another way? Well, I think \nthere is another way, and I think the proposal I have laid out is the \nway we ought to go.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10861-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                            Gordon H.

Although trained as a warfighter, Captain Yllescas knew \nthe importance of connecting with the local populations and was known \nto sit down with local leaders for tea and discussions of democracy.\n  After he was severely injured by an improvised explosive device, \nCaptain\n\n[[Page S10862]]\n\nYllescas was strong enough to survive a lengthy medical evacuation \nwhich eventually brought him to the National Naval Medical Center in \nBethesda, MD. With Dena and other family members at his side, Captain \nYllescas underwent almost daily surgeries in the hope of recovery. Dena \nYllescas chronicled his hospitalization on an Internet blog which drew \ntens of thousands of readers. Friends, relatives and total strangers \nall followed Captain Yllescas's progress and prayed for his recovery. \nPresident George W. Bush made a special trip to the medical center and \nawarded Captain Yllescas the Purple Heart in a brief ceremony on \nNovember 10.\n  Captain Yllescas knew the dangers he faced and the risks he took. He \nalso knew the importance of the work he did in the Army on behalf of \nhis fellow Americans. He risked and ultimately sacrificed his own life \nso that people a world away could have the chance to enjoy the freedoms \nhe had found in America.\n  Captain Yllescas is survived by his wife, Dena, and daughters Julia, \nage 7, and Eva, 10 months; parents, Barbara Yllescas of Lincoln and \nOtto Yllescas of Guatemala; a brother, Christopher of Columbia, MO; and \ntwo sisters, Jennifer Winterbauer of Lincoln and Natalie Yllescas of \nGuatemala.\n  The life and service of Captain Yllescas represents an example we can \nall look up to and seek to emulate. He served his country honorably and \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in furtherance of a much larger goal. \nCaptain Yllescas made the most of his short life, and the greatest \ntragedy is that now it is impossible to know what more this promising \nyoung man might have accomplished. I join all Nebraskans in mourning \nthe loss of Captain Yllescas and in offering my deepest condolences to \nhis family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10862-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GULF WAR ILLNESS RESEARCH FUNDING\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto review the findings of the congressionally mandated Research \nAdvisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses. This report, which \nwas released a few weeks ago, confirms what many veterans of the Gulf \nWar, lawmakers, physicians, and researchers have long suspected that \nthe mysterious illnesses suffered by one in four gulf war veterans are \nreal, and are a result of their exposure to neurotoxic chemicals.\n  It was not long after the successful conclusion of the gulf war that \nmany of our soldiers returned home with multiple persistent symptoms \nincluding headaches, memory loss, gastrointestinal problems, and \nwidespread pain. The symptoms were real, yet the cause and effective \ntreatment have remained frustratingly elusive. As a leading member of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I pushed hard for oversight \nhearings and continued research efforts.\n  Finally, 17 years after the end of that conflict, this report \nconfirms that veterans' neurotoxin and pesticide exposure during the \ngulf war has been consistently found to be causally associated with \ngulf war illness. Unfortunately, this report also concludes that few \nveterans have recovered from their exposure, and treatments remain \nineffective. While it is important that the cause of this illness has \nbeen established, it is unacceptable for our veterans to continue to \nsuffer from these wounds of war.\n  In light of the findings of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf \nWar Veterans' Illnesses, there must be a continued investment in gulf \nwar illness research. It is estimated that 175,000 to 210,000 gulf war \nveterans are suffering from the effects of neurotoxin exposure directly \nrelated to their time spent in the Gulf. Once again, hundreds of \nthousands of soldiers find themselves back in the area as part of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Therefore, it is vital that we do all that we \ncan to adequately fund gulf war research.\n  We also need to learn the lesson of the value of candor and research. \nDOD and VA must be more open with Congress about the concerns facing \nour troops, from neurotoxin and pesticide exposures in the gulf war to \nthe troubling issue of suicide, mental health issues, and traumatic \nbrain injury, TBI, in the current conflict. We must address all the \nwounds of war, both visible and invisible, for our veterans who have \nserved so bravely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10862-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10862-S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GENERIC MEDICINES\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention a recent article in the respected Journal of \nAmerican Medicine on generic medicines. The article comes at a critical \ntime as we begin to tackle the important issue of health care reform.\n  There is no doubt that health care reform must include offering \nsolutions that reduce skyrocketing health care costs. One solution to \nreducing costs is to increase access to generic medicines, which offer \nsavings of up to 80 percent over brand drug costs.\n  The new JAMA article provides specific evidence on the benefits of \ngeneric medicines. The analysis, which included U.S. scientists \nreviewing more than 20 years of research on generic versus brand name \ndrugs, found that there is no clinical evidence showing that brand name \ncardiovascular drugs were superior to their generic versions. Moreover, \nthe lead author of the report noted that generics can lead to better \noutcomes because they cost less, which means patients can afford to \ntake them and stay on them.\n  As our economy continues to struggle, Americans across the country \nare looking for ways to make ends meet. We hear too often about older \nAmericans rationing their medicines and even mothers watering down \ninfant formula to make it last longer, not knowing of the dangerous \nhealth impact this can have. A recent survey conducted by BearingPoint, \nInc., and Zogby found that an alarming number of consumers admitted \nthat they would consider denying themselves or their children health \ncare to save money during this difficult economic time.\n  As we consider the critical and interrelated issues regarding the \neconomic crisis and reform of national health care, the new JAMA study \nsupports every effort we can make now to increase the use of generic \nmedicines. We should remove the numerous barriers to getting generic \nmedicines to consumers sooner rather than later, and we must prevent \nthe creation of new barriers that will impede greater use of generics. \nWe also should consider how to create a workable pathway for \nbiogenerics, a pathway that actually gets these safe and affordable \nlifesaving medicines to patients in a timely manner.\n  Generic medicines save consumers and State and Federal governments \nbillions of dollars annually. At the same time, generic medicines are \nFDA approved, guaranteeing their safety and effectiveness.\n  When the new Congress tackles the important health care initiatives \nthat lie ahead, the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs must \nremain a top priority. As the medical evidence concludes, Congress can \nhave confidence in the fact that increasing access to generic medicines \nwill provide high-quality care at significant cost savings for \nconsumers and the government.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article to which I referred \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10863]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.008\n\n\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.009\n\n\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.010\n\n\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.011\n\n\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.012\n\n\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE08.013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10876-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO ILYSE SCHUMAN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, it is one of the great traditions of the \nSenate, when we pass legislation that will change the direction of the \nNation and our economy, that we pause for a moment after final passage \nto acknowledge the efforts of those members of our staffs who worked so \nhard behind the scenes to help us bring the matter to the floor for a \nvote.\n  We all have great staffs, people who are committed to the future of \nour country and to making a difference that will last for generations \nto come. Although that is true, I have always said that my team ranks \nwith the best. In fact, if there were an Olympic event for staffs, I \nhave no doubt my team would win the gold medal.\n  Because of the role they play in our work, they have a tendency to \nget noticed by the groups and organizations that are involved in the \nissues that come before the House and the Senate. The working \nrelationship they develop with our staffs often leads to increased \nopportunities and sends some of our best workers off the Hill and into \nthe private sector.\n  When that happens, I like to believe we are not losing a staffer; we \nare just expanding our field of influence. Still, when you lose someone \nwho has played such a key role in the day to day work of our offices \nand the Senate, it is a great loss to the team as a whole.\n  I thought about that when I learned of Ilyse Schuman's plans to leave \nthe committee and take a leadership position with the Medical Imaging \nand Technology Alliance. Although I was sorry to hear the news, I was \npleased to know that she would be working for such a well respected and \neffective organization. It will be another great opportunity for her \nand I know she will make the most of it.\n  I can say that with certainty because that is the kind of person \nIlyse Schuman is--thoughtful, reflective and committed to the future of \nour country and our health care system. Her interest in the problems we \nface as a nation and her ability to work with staffs on both sides of \nthe aisle to find solutions that work and make sense was one of the \nprincipal reasons why we hired her several years ago.\n  I remember standing on the Senate floor earlier this year, when we \npassed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. This \ngroundbreaking legislation will unlock a door that will allow people to \nget the kind of genetic testing they need to give them an advance \nwarning about something that might happen to their health down the road \nif they don't take the steps today to prevent or at least weaken its \neffects. The legislation we passed that day will ensure the results of \nour tests will be used for our benefit, and will not be allowed to be \nused against us in our employment or our insurance coverage.\n  That bill had been a key part of the committee's legislative agenda \nfor 6 years. That was just about the time when we hired Ilyse Schuman. \nIn my remarks on the bill's final passage, I said that I had often \nheard it said that it usually takes 6 years to get an important idea \nthrough the Senate. I said I wasn't sure I believed it, until I \nrealized that she had been working on the bill for 6 years and that \nfact seemed to prove the idea has some merit.\n  I should have known that if it were possible to get the job done, \nIlyse would have been a part of it because she has a history of \nexcellence and making the impossible possible. She graduated cum laude \nfrom Tufts University and then earned her J.D. from the Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center--with honors. More recently, she was named a John \nStennis Congressional Staff Fellow for the 109th Congress.\n  She had been working as the senior counsel at a firm in Chicago when \nsomeone we interviewed suggested we talk to her about a position on the \ncommittee. She hadn't given much thought to government service, but the \ntime must have been right because we were very pleased when she decided \nto pack her bags and come to Washington to begin this chapter in her \nlife.\n  Now, as it comes to a close, Ilyse has a lot to look back on with a \ngreat deal of pride and personal satisfaction. Among the legislation \nshe helped to shepherd through the legislative process, in addition to \nthe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, was the Food and Drug \nAmendments Act, Health Information Technology legislation, FDA Drug \nSafety Reform, the Pension Protection Act, Head Start, Patient Safety, \nthe Workforce Investment Act, and many more. In addition, she has \nplayed a vital leadership role on the Committee and served as more than \nits staff director, she has been more of a coach who helped the whole \nteam to work together and function as a more efficient unit. She is \ngoing to be very difficult to replace. In fact, she is one of those \npeople who can't be replaced. We will find someone with special talents \nand abilities to take over the responsibilities of our new staff \nleader, but she will be missed and remembered with great appreciation \nfor her outstanding efforts and her winning personality and attitude.\n  Ilyse was once asked about her position on the committee and how much \nit meant to her to have a chance to do something that would last, \nsomething that would make life better for us all. She said it meant a \nlot to her to be a part of the work on ``the issues that are most \npersonal to everyone's lives.'' She saw it as ``an opportunity to have \na huge impact on the quality of life across the country.''\n  Ilyse knew that to have the impact she hoped to achieve, she would \nneed to forge good working relationships with staffs on both sides of \nthe aisle. Fortunately, it was one of her strong suits. Ilyse knows how \nto disagree without being disagreeable. That was important because, at \nthe end of the day, when she went home after a long day's work, she \nleft with the respect of her colleagues in every office she worked \nwith, a respect that was mutual and will prove to be lasting.\n  Now Ilyse is leaving to take on another exciting adventure in her \nlife. Diana and I will miss seeing her every day because she has become \npart of our extended family. We wish her the best of luck in this and \nin all of her future endeavors. In the months to come, I know we can \ncontinue to look to her for her leadership, direction and guidance on \nour efforts to make our Nation's health care system better, more \neffective, more efficient and more responsive for all Americans. It is \na heartfelt goal Ilyse is determined to achieve and I know she will \ncontinue to be a part of that effort in the years to come. Knowing \nIlyse and the operation of the Senate, I would say that we will be \nseeing the results of her efforts in just about 6 years.\n  I won't say goodbye, Ilyse. I know I will be hearing more from you \nand about you in the months and years to come. So I will just say keep \nin touch and we'll all look forward to seeing you around this special \ncampus on the Hill, I hope, for a long, long time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10876-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10876-S10878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This in response to your request for stories from Idaho \n     citizens about the impact of rising gas prices on our lives. \n     We are fortunate in that, though the increased prices are a \n     drain, they do not put us in financial jeopardy. However, we \n     are taking steps to decrease our use of gasoline. We both \n     have bicycles and have started using them to run some of our \n     errands, visit friends and, on occasion, travel to and from \n     work. We consolidate errands to avoid multiple trips. When \n     driving I avoid quick stops and starts and\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\n     get off the gas when on a down slope. If I use a drive up and \n     will have to wait, I turn off the engine. We never let our \n     vehicles idle in cold weather to warm up. This is a waste \n     that is endemic in Idaho.\n       As regards for suggestions for ways the government can \n     help, I agree with supporting alternative energy sources; \n     however, I do not see how nuclear energy will offset gasoline \n     use. My understanding is that part of our problem is lack of \n     sufficient numbers or modern refineries. With the oil \n     companies enjoying record profits, they should be dealing \n     with this issue. It does not make sense to me for the \n     taxpayer to foot the bill for this. More can be done to \n     support development of non-food sources of ethanol, e.g. \n     switch grass and other non-food plants; and waste products \n     from wood products industries and crop waste such as corn and \n     other grain stalks. Support is needed for development of \n     better public transportation such as buses and light rail. \n     Use of roundabouts instead of signals or stop signs at \n     intersections will also consume less fuel and produce less \n     pollution. I am not sure how you provide incentives to people \n     for conserving energy in their driving practices but anything \n     that can educate people about how to conserve would probably \n     be useful. One positive about the high cost of gasoline is \n     that people are finally thinking about how they can conserve. \n     Gas has been so cheap that we have been very careless in our \n     usage and neither the populace nor the government has had \n     much incentive to conserve through driving practices, design \n     of vehicles or development and use of public transportation. \n     I love the convenience of my car but I think all of us are \n     going to have to look at some lifestyle changes if we want to \n     decrease our dependence on foreign oil.\n       Thank you for soliciting input from your constituents.\n     Faye, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Energy costs have taken it is toll in our household. Both \n     my husband and I have gotten second jobs part time just to \n     make ends meet. If it were just the hike in energy costs we \n     would have to say to ourselves grin and bear it. But \n     everything across the board has increased.\n       Soaring food prices: What was an average of $70 per week \n     has now increased to $140-$150 per week. And it is increasing \n     each week. Standard monthly bills have increased by at least \n     $3 per month. It might not seem much of an increase but there \n     again, across-the-board monthly increases add up over the \n     months.\n       We have definitely changed our life styles. No dining out. \n     We drive only when we have to. And when we do have to go out, \n     we make sure we do everything we have to do in one trip. We \n     make sure lights are turned off when not in use, and we \n     refrain from using the air conditioner. Laundry day is now \n     only twice a week. We try to BBQ as much as possible so we \n     can save by not using our gas range.\n       We have never seen things as bad as they are today. We do \n     not except any hands-outs from our government, but there are \n     millions of people who are suffering right now and were \n     afraid millions more to follow.\n       Where is the government in all of this? Why cannot \n     government solve these problems? We Americans pay taxes, but \n     it would seem our tax money is being mismanaged. It is plain \n     to see this government does not have its peoples' best \n     interest at heart. Congress does not have their priorities \n     straight. Energy and the economy should come first! Without \n     middle-class Americans, where will the government be? Sad as \n     it is, middle-class America is fading!\n       Government (Congress) needs to stop discussing the problems \n     and start taking action now. Wind power, nuclear power, with \n     all the hi-tech advantage this nation holds, they cannot find \n     a way? Stop playing the blame games and work together to \n     solve these and many other problems.\n     The Marshalls, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are a small family living what we consider to be a \n     decent life in a rural Idaho community. The increasing gas \n     prices have affected the costs of other things, such as \n     groceries, to increase in price as well. In an effort to keep \n     the added costs from impacting our standard of living too \n     much we have taken a few steps, such as:\n       Attending church closer to home.\n       Limiting shopping trips to a bare minimum.\n       Watering lawns less, so that it will grow less, requiring \n     less mowing.\n       Driving a 40 mpg car, when we'd rather run something more \n     comfortable and safer.\n       Passing on taking trips to see family; our nearest family \n     members are 350 miles away.\n       Buying things locally, as opposed to shopping at places \n     like Costco since the cost of a trip to Costco down by Boise \n     is very costly.\n       Buying a whole beef, as opposed to supermarket cuts, saving \n     a couple of dollars per pound, depending upon the cut.\n       Buying items in bulk, including flour, detergents, etc.\n       Baking our own brownies, cookies, rolls, and breads. The \n     cost of grain products has gone very high, and bakery \n     products have increased substantially.\n       Making sourdough waffles and pancakes to save on the cost \n     of pancake flour.\n       Making our own ice cream.\n       Making our own fruit rollups.\n       Foregoing physicians visits as much as absolutely possible, \n     passing on new eyeglasses.\n       Taking Benadryl as opposed to prescription allergy meds, \n     even though the Benadryl makes us drowsy and does not work as \n     well--the cost is much lower.\n       Making our own pastas.\n       Making homemade salads as opposed to buying deli salads.\n       Doing our own haircuts, hair coloring, and perms at home, \n     using home products, instead of going to the salon or barber \n     shop.\n       Quit dining out, all meals can come from home--this \n     includes packing lunches.\n       Mowing our lawn ourselves, instead of hiring a neighborhood \n     boy to do it for us.\n       Giving up ``date night'', and movies, both in theater and \n     rental movies.\n       Staying home more.\n       Changing our son to a less expensive day care.\n       If things get worse we will have to look at other things, \n     such as:\n       Growing a garden, and canning/freezing fruits and veggies.\n       Putting in several fruit trees.\n       Buying a whole pork, instead of retail cuts.\n       Fishing to put in freezer for future meals.\n       Raising chickens, both for eggs and meat.\n       Sewing some of our own clothing items.\n       Walking to work--a round trip including daycare is about \n     4.5 mile.\n       These higher costs have us very concerned; something must \n     be done to bring things back into balance.\n       If many other people adopt habits like we have, and are \n     considering, there will be a ripple through effect of job \n     loss. We are spending less in the grocery store, less from \n     the butcher, less with diners, delis, movie rental places, \n     theaters, the bakery, barber shop and beauty shop, just to \n     mention a few. We are also buying fewer ready to eat or cook \n     with products, and are making our foods from scratch.\n       If we start actually growing and raising our own foods the \n     effects will ripple through the economy as well--especially \n     if lots of other people feel the need to do the same.\n       We are not living in ``pioneer'' times, but we may have to \n     live like we are if prices continue to spiral out of control. \n     Going into debt just to cover daily living expenses is simply \n     not an option.\n       Please encourage your fellow members of Congress to require \n     the development of domestic oil.\n       Furthermore, please press a mandate on the production of \n     hydrogen fueled vehicles, with the availability of fueling \n     sources mandated as well.

The only thing that is \n     not rising fast is, unfortunately, our wages. I would like to \n     see our leadership make a real effort to raise wages to a \n     livable level. A livable wage in Idaho is like $10 something \n     per hour, higher in counties like Ada and Blaine.\n       Unfortunately, I believe your policy solutions are sadly \n     misguided. Domestic drilling will not significantly reduce \n     prices for the consumer. Nuclear energy is among the most \n     expensive ways to produce energy. It relies on taxpayer \n     dollars to make it economically viable. And both are terrible \n     for the environment. I hope you take the time to reassess \n     these policies.\n     Doug.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I live very frugally. Due to his brain \n     injury, we have to wait incredible lumps of time for Social \n     Security Disability appeal. He and I are in agreement that \n     the ``energy crisis'' is a social agenda of the green \n     movement that has been in place for decades.\n       With that said, we are in favor of nuclear energy that is a \n     proven benefit and drilling for our domestic oil. Often the \n     legislators and others opposed to such drilling say it would \n     be too long to build refineries to find relief. I believe \n     that the American people would be patient with the time it \n     takes to build them and be willing to suffer the gas prices \n     knowing we had hope to sustain our own oil provisions and not \n     be dependent on foreign oil.\n     Yvonne and Mark, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for inviting our comments on this problem. My \n     wife and I retired in 2003 with a financial plan that made a \n     lot of sense: we sold our home and bought a motor home, which \n     we used for two years to see some of these great United \n     States. Then we lived in it in Emmett while building our \n     retirement home here. We cleaned up the motor home to sell \n     it, which was an integral part of our plan because the \n     payments on it were $1200 per month.\n       You probably guessed the rest of the story. We have a large \n     mortgage on our new house\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\n     and our investments have performed less well than we might \n     have hoped. But the biggest problem we have is that in a year \n     and a half we have not had a single offer on our motor home. \n     Friends tell us we will not be able to sell it. We took it to \n     Bretz RV in Missoula, MT, one of the leading sellers of RVs \n     including consignment sales. That was last August. We have \n     dropped the price below what we owe on it and still cannot \n     get any offers. The price of diesel is what is causing the \n     market for motor homes to dry up. In short, our retirement \n     cash flow is in trouble due to fuel prices, not to mention \n     our costs have skyrocketed.\n       We are thoroughly disillusioned by our government's refusal \n     to tell the environmentalists to go pound sand and let our \n     oil companies develop the enormous oil and natural gas \n     reserves we have, while competitor nations drill for our \n     right off our shores. The ``pristine parkland'' in ANWR is a \n     hoax--we have seen pictures of the small area where drilling \n     rights were sought. We need nuclear power plants to be built \n     as quickly as possible, oil refineries as quickly as \n     possible, and the development of those resources.\n       Yes, alternative energy sources are a good thing, and we \n     need eventually to phase out the gasoline auto, but this \n     takes time. The government is responsible for our \n     predicament, in our opinion, and needs to start putting the \n     needs of America ahead of politics.\n     Tim and Peggy, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for giving us an opportunity to share our story \n     with you. We are most definitely feeling the effects of the \n     ever-increasing costs of fuel. We are a family of six. We own \n     three cars and have four drivers. Our college-age daughter \n     chose a summer job that was close to home just so she can \n     save on gas money. We have been discussing how we will make \n     ends meet with the rising fuel costs. We have decided to pull \n     our youngest children (ages 11 and 13) out of piano lessons. \n     They were in their 3rd and 5th year respectively. Our \n     daughter, Katie, may have to give up flute lessons. Katie has \n     been volunteering at St. Luke's Hospital for the past two \n     years. She was hoping to volunteer there through her senior \n     year of high school, but it may soon cost too much to get her \n     there and back. Our son is volunteering at the Garden City \n     Library. He is enjoying it, but we are uncertain how long he \n     will be able to participate once again because the amount it \n     costs us to get him there. We are a family that believes in \n     volunteering and giving of our time and resources--but there \n     is only so much we can do. We have recently switched to a \n     doctor in Eagle just so we would not have to travel into \n     downtown Boise. We evaluate every time we plan to go \n     somewhere--can we really afford the gas? We have even denied \n     our kids the opportunity to go to mid-week youth group at \n     church because it is in Southeast Boise--too far to drive. We \n     feel badly for the other families/organizations our decisions \n     will affect--two moms who give piano/flute lessons from their \n     homes, the volunteer office at St. Luke's, the library, etc. \n     We do not have the luxury of buying newer more fuel-efficient \n     cars; we must do with what we have.\n       We are extremely frustrated with Congress over its \n     inability to do anything constructive to solve the problem, \n     which for the most part they are responsible for causing. We \n     support drilling for our own oil both offshore and in ANWR. \n     We support building more refineries. We also fully support \n     the expansion of our nuclear energy facilities, mining of \n     coal and oil shale in addition to renewable forms of energy \n     such as wind and solar. More hearings and investigations on \n     ``Big Oil'' and speculators is a waste of time along with \n     taxing ``windfall profits''. Pleases urge your peers to do \n     something constructive to solve the problem.\n       Thanks again for this opportunity.\n     Kelly and Kristi, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work at the INL but commute 45 minutes both ways to work; \n     my husband also works in Idaho Falls. However, we work at \n     different times--my work begins at 7:00 and off at 4:30. He \n     starts at 10 and off at 6--so we both drive. At the present \n     time, we are considering selling our home of 35 years and \n     moving closer to Idaho Falls. We are spending over $110 a \n     week with the two cars making the trip to Idaho Falls five \n     times a week. I have started a car pool with a few employees \n     that will help some, but the fact is--it hurts. For the first \n     time in many years, we are finding ourselves in financial \n     distress.\n       We do not want to sell the house, we have raised our kids \n     there--we love it. And, we do not want to sell it at this \n     time when the market is such that we will not get from it \n     what it is worth.\n       There has to be a better way. I hope you can find it. Good \n     luck.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       We should not lean on foreign oil providers to lower their \n     prices when we have enough oil under American soil to last \n     for hundreds of years. The so-called environmentalists have \n     caused this massive problem which has the possibility to sink \n     America.\n       I like the scene of oil rigs on the horizon, it is a \n     beautiful landscape. I do not believe the so-called \n     environmentalists care one whit about our environment, they \n     are out to see America die, and they are well on their way to \n     accomplishing their goal.\n       A word to the wise.\n     Curt, Wilder.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a country, we had plenty of time to both prepare for and \n     possibly prevent the situation we are in. However, we cannot \n     change the past and now we are going to march into a new and \n     different world. I wonder whether we will be smarter this \n     time.\n       Frankly, I see the silver lining in the increased cost of \n     energy. We are going to have to incentivize the discovery and \n     use of new, sustainable forms of energy. Maybe we'll think \n     long term instead of searching for the short term fixes.\n       We will get a chance to pay more attention to our local \n     communities rather than driving away for fun or shipping \n     produce (and water!) from the other side of the planet. We \n     will get a glimpse of how a large part of the rest of the \n     world lives. We'll start appreciating and caring for what we \n     have rather than strive for ever increasing heights of \n     consumption. We'll ride bikes, fix sidewalks, meet neighbors \n     and save our energy use for when using energy is really \n     necessary. Maybe we'll even revisit one of the most taboo of \n     subjects--whether we should curb population growth. (Just \n     think--\\1/100\\th the population means 100 times the \n     resources.)\n       So, there you have it. The energy ``crisis'' is of our own \n     making. We had our chances, but maybe now we'll pay \n     attention. The question is whether the transition to a world \n     of scarcity will be peaceful or turbulent. In times of \n     stress, those with the most resources are often the least \n     affected, yet they often control positions of leadership. By \n     the way . . . if you thought an energy shortage was a big \n     thing, wait till the water crisis hits. It is going to be a \n     lot worse.\n     George, Idaho Falls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10878-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10878-S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALBERT CORCOS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues the remarkable record of humanitarian \nwork and numerous accomplishments of Albert Corcos, one of the truly \ngreat humanitarian leaders of our time\n  He is now 98 and lives in Concarneau, France, with his loving wife \nCamille. He recently completed his memoir spanning his incredible \ncareer, during which he was awarded the Legion of Honor in France and a \ndistinguished Royal Award from Thailand.\n  I first became acquainted with Mr. Corcos's humanitarian activities \nwhen I was serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nImmigration and Refugees in the 1970s. In fact, Mr. Corcos had begun \nhis extraordinary career a generation earlier, by coordinating the \ninternational effort in 1945 to resettle millions of displaced persons \nand refugees uprooted by World War II. He was a young man of immense \nenergy and compassion and had been persuaded to use those talents to \nwork with the new United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation \nAdministration to help refugees and displaced persons in Europe. He had \nactually had an even earlier role, performing the hazardous duty of a \nyoung courier for the French resistance during the war.\n  The good work that best exemplifies Mr. Corcos's compassionate \nconcern for the disadvantaged was his indispensible role in coming to \nthe aid of the Indochinese refugees. After an already very full career \nwith the International Organization for Migration and its predecessors \nworking to resettle the displaced, he blazed a unique trail in \ndeveloping and implementing the initial response to one of the great \nhumanitarian crises of the time--the international response to the \nexodus of 1.5 million Indochinese refugees in the 1970s.\n  As Indochinese refugees flowed into neighboring countries in \nSoutheast Asia, in 1975, it was a monumental challenge to find \nopportunities for their resettlement in the United States and other \nWestern nations and to provide the logistical support to make it \npossible. It was vital to move the refugees out of the region rapidly, \nin order to keep the doors open in the first asylum countries of the \nregion. The goal was to prevent the land borders from being closed, \nwhich would have forced refugees to take to the sea in desperation and \ncost thousands of lives.\n  Mr. Corcos postponed his retirement and put together and oversaw the \nsystem for processing and transporting refugees to the United States \nand other countries for resettlement. The challenges were \nextraordinary. The refugees were strewn across dozens of camps from \nnorthern Thailand to Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and the \nPhilippines. Each refugee had to be documented, fingerprinted, \nphotographed, given medical examinations and issued transit papers. The \nrefugees\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nthen had to be booked on flights to resettlement countries, even as air \ncommerce shrank in Southeast Asia after 1975. The creativity, courage, \nand perseverance of Mr. Corcos and his team in making this process run \nsmoothly was amazing and won him well deserved international praise.\n  Mr. Corcos came out of retirement again in 1979 to deal with a second \nsurge of Indochinese refugees. This time, the numbers were even more \nenormous, but he was skillfully able to replicate the process of \nearlier years on a much larger regional basis.\n  Mr. Corcos is a true humanitarian and made a vast difference in the \nlives of countless refugees fleeing from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in \nthe 1970s. He is a legend among those who created and benefitted from \nthe Indochinese Refugee Program, and his legacy will forever be \nremembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL LISA LEONARD AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL RANDY JOHNSON\n\n   Mr. BOND. Madam President, we all know it would be \nimpossible to do our jobs without the assistance of many dedicated \nprofessionals staffing the legislative liaison offices for all branches \nof the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Today, I pay tribute to COL Lisa Leonard and LTC Randy Johnson who \njoined the National Guard Bureau's Office of Legislative Liaison as the \nArmy and Air Liaison Officers and together collectively served 12 years \nand are now, unfortunately for us, retiring at the same time.\n  Colonel Leonard and Lieutenant Colonel Johnson have served \ncompetently and well at a pivotal time in the history of the National \nGuard. Now, more than ever, America relies on the National Guard both \nat home and abroad. Since 9/11 more than 200,000 Guard troops have left \ntheir homes, their jobs, and their families to participate in the \nglobal war on terror. The National Guard has provided as much as half \nof the combat force and 40 percent of the total force in Iraq. Guard \ntroops are also called upon to respond to natural disasters at home \nlike Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Understanding these dual missions is a \njob in itself.\n  During Lisa and Randy's tenure, the National Guard has also had to \nweather a controversial base realignment and closure, BRAC, round and \nseveral other major legislative battles concerning relative troop \nstrength, equipment levels and the ability of the Guard to participate \nin major Pentagon decisions.\n  Lisa's and Randy's contributions to the Senate began with their \nnatural ability to establish personal relationships with staff while \ntelling the story of the National Guard. They earned the respect of \nMembers and staff on both sides of the aisle with their expertise, \nstrong work ethic, and dedication to the job.\n  These are truly the unsung heroes of the legislative process, \nfaithfully providing information, expertise, and analysis on behalf of \nthe National Guard on myriad national security and homeland security \nissues.\n  We wish them both well in their well-earned retirement from Active \nDuty and from this assignment. They will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10879-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THOMAS W. RICHARDSON\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, Mr. Thomas W. Richardson of the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers will soon retire with over 37 years of \nexceptional service to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He is member \nof the Senior Executive Service and is the Director of Corps' Engineer \nResearch and Development Center Coastal Hydraulic Laboratory. His \naccomplishments and dedication to the Corps of Engineers' laboratory \ncommunity and the Army are exceptional and will have a significant and \nlong lasting positive impact on this Nation.\n  Following 3 years of service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, Mr. Richardson began his Army civilian career in 1974 as \na research hydraulic engineer at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways \nExperiment Station, in Vicksburg, MS. Through the 1970s and early 1980s \nhe was a principal investigator for research studies on dredging \nsystems for beach nourishment for offshore sources and an assistant \ninvestigator on a research study to develop new systems for bypassing \nsand past tidal inlets. During this time he designed and constructed \nthe world's first portable, land-based hydraulic sand bypassing system, \nwhich was delivered to the Corps of Engineers North Central Division as \nan operational plant. A systematic approach became available to address \na major national concern with both economic and strategic aspects; that \nof bypassing sand to preserve beaches and to maintain harbor channels.\n  In 1983, Mr. Richardson became chief of the coastal structures and \nevaluation branch, Coastal Engineering Research Center where he \nsupervised 16 researchers specializing in functional design and \nperformance of coastal structures, dredging and sand bypassing systems, \ngeomorphic evaluation, and empirical design methods for coastal \nprojects. From branch chief he quickly moved up to division chief in \n1985 and served in that capacity for 14 years, first as chief of the \nEngineering Development Division and then as the Chief of the Coastal \nSediments and Engineering Division. He directed numerous comprehensive \nresearch and development investigations, and studies of coastal \nprocesses, sediment transport, shoreline change modeling, beach fill \ndesign methods, prototype systems design and development, and \nfunctional design of coastal projects. Notably, he developed general \ntechnical approaches and R programs that produced the extraordinarily \nsuccessful and patented CORE-LOC concrete armor unit and the Scanning \nHydrographic Operational Airborne LIDAR Survey--SHOALS--system.\n  Mr. Richardson assumed the duties of acting assistant lab director in \nJanuary 2000. In June of that same year, he was elevated to acting \ndirector, CHL. Mr. Richardson joined the Senior Executive Service in \nMarch 2002 upon becoming director of the CHL.\n  Under the leadership of Mr. Richardson, the Coastal and Hydraulics \nLaboratory directly supported the Army transformation, civil works \nstrategic plan, global war on terrorism operations, and high priority \ncivil works operations. In addition, CHL addressed critical levee \nissues for the Department of Homeland Security by developing a unique \nsystem to rapidly repair breaches in levees caused by natural phenomena \nor terrorist attack.\n  Throughout his career, Tom Richardson has demonstrated a profound \ncommitment to the Army, the Corps of Engineers, and the Nation. He is a \nconsummate professional whose performance in over 37 years of service \nhas personified those traits of competency and integrity that our \nNation has come to expect of its senior civilian leaders. I \ncongratulate Mr. Richardson on his distinguished service to the U.S. \nArmy and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10879-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10879-S10880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING RYNE DOUGHERTY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

He suffered a fatal brain \nhemorrhage while playing football, the sport about which he was so \npassionate. Although he was only 16 years old, Ryne made a tremendous \nimpact on his teammates, friends, and community. He was a caring and \nloving young man who displayed a special kindness and a deep commitment \nto his friends and family. An honor student and linebacker on the \nMontclair High School Junior Varsity football team, Ryne also found \ntime to fix computers to benefit underprivileged families. Ryne was \nadmired by all who knew him--over 1,000 mourners gathered together to \nremember him and comfort each other.\n  Ryne worked toward his goals with steadfast determination, eager to \nsucceed. His football coach said that Ryne never sought glory or \npraise; he came to the field every day prepared to work his hardest out \nof respect for his teammates and love for the game. Family and friends \nsaid that Ryne always wanted to talk about football. He was always \nready with the latest NFL statistics and greatly enjoyed playing \nfootball video games with his friends in his spare time. To honor Ryne, \nthe New York Giants held a moment of silence during their game on \nOctober 19, a fitting tribute for a young fan.\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\n  Ryne was a mentor and an inspiration to his teammates. Many friends \nsought to follow his example: succeeding in school and working \ndiligently on the field all while keeping a smile on his face. During \nRyne's funeral, Rev. Gerald Whitaker asked the mourners to imagine that \nRyne had made a game-saving tackle to end a big game against their \nrival high school. The crowd responded with a thunderous ovation, a \nfitting way to honor Ryne.\n  Finally, I would like express my sympathy to Ryne's family. I hope \nthat they will be comforted by their many positive memories and by the \noutpouring of support from the Montclair community. His family decided \nto donate Ryne's organs, yet another way that Ryne has touched the \nlives of others. I am proud to honor him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10880-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING NEWLAND NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, as we approach the holiday season, \nI wish to recognize a small business from my home State of Maine that \nhas made its mark by its commitment to giving back to the local \ncommunity. NewLand Nursery and Landscaping of Ellsworth has been \nproviding Hancock County with quality landscaping services and floral \narrangements for almost two decades, while simultaneously maintaining \nits status as an involved member of the greater Ellsworth area.\n  Beginning its landscape design operations in 1985 with a mere $600, a \npickup truck, and some tools, NewLand has continually expanded its \nservices to become a well-known name for its gorgeous flowers, \nversatile garden products, and impressive landscaping business. A \nreputable source for gardening knowledge, customers in Downeast Maine \nhave relied on NewLand for creative ways to enrich their home gardens \nor fashion a welcoming landscape at their business.\n  NewLand has designed some of Maine's most recognizable landscapes, \nfrom Bangor to Calais. Many locals and tourists alike will recognize \nNewLand's exquisite work at the Jordan Pond House in Acadia National \nPark, where the firm designed the tea garden, plantings, and other \naspects. Additionally, NewLand has developed landscapes at the \nMansfield baseball field in Bangor, the University of Maine's Hutchison \nCenter in Belfast, and St. John's Church in Bangor.\n  NewLand has received several awards over the course of its history \nfor the inventiveness and attractiveness of its work. It won the \nPeople's Choice Award five times at the Bangor Garden Show, from 1991 \nto 1994 and again in 1999. And in 2006, NewLand was recognized by \nGovernor Baldacci, the Maine Commission for Community Service, and the \nMaine Volunteer Connection with the Small Business Volunteerism Award, \ncommending the company for its culture of encouraging volunteering \namong its employees and its generosity in assisting others throughout \nHancock County. NewLand Nursery and Landscaping is a member of numerous \ncommunity and statewide organizations, including the Ellsworth Area \nChamber of Commerce and the Maine State Florists' and Growers' \nAssociation.\n  Steve Elliot, the owner of NewLand, has certainly led by example when \nit comes to community service. Mr. Elliot most recently served as \npresident of the Rotary Club of Ellsworth and was actively involved in \norganizing engaging Rotary meetings and service events. In fact, this \ncoming Saturday, Mr. Elliot will join his fellow Rotarians for the \nthird annual Gifting Experience. Members of the local club will take 23 \n8- and 9-year-olds shopping in downtown Ellsworth to buy gifts for \ntheir family members. They will then go to Maine Coast Memorial \nHospital, where the children will wrap presents. At the conclusion of \nthe day, Mr. Elliot dressed as Santa Claus will give each participant a \ngift.\n  No stranger to community involvement, Mr. Elliot also hosts a free \nannual fall children's festival at NewLand, where kids can enjoy \nhayrides and participate in bowling with pumpkins, as well as an Easter \nEgg Hunt each spring. He has additionally donated his time as a coach \nfor the Blue Hill Athletic Department. Several years ago, NewLand also \nhosted the unveiling of the ``Fishing for Friends'' effort, a \nfundraiser for Faith in Action Community Connection, a volunteer group \nthat assists the disabled and elderly in Hancock County.\n  The holiday season is a time to appreciate what we have and discover \nways we can give to others.

A bill to reauthorize the Crime-Free Rural States Grants \nprogram; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Crime-\nFree Rural States Reauthorization Act, a bill designed to help rural \ncommunities deal with a growing drug and crime problems made worse by \nthe devastating recession we now face.\n  This week the Senate is focused on passing a bill to authorize \nbillions of dollars to bail out the automobile industry. Congress has \nalready passed legislation providing for hundreds of billions of \ndollars to rescue the financial industry. These are difficult pieces of \nlegislation, but we are trying to protect countless jobs and the \neconomy as a whole. These efforts have done little, though, to help the \nmillions of people in rural America, who have been hit as hard as \nanyone by the devastating effects of this recession, but will see few \nbenefits from financial and corporate bailouts.\n  We must help rural communities, and they especially need our help as \nthey try to pull together to combat the worsening drug and crime \nproblems that threaten the safety and well-being of too many in our \nsmall cities and towns and, most particularly, our young people. The \nCrime-Free Rural States Reauthorization Act will provide just this kind \nof help.\n  I pushed for the original Crime-Free Rural States grant program. It \nwas first authorized in 2002 and funded in 2003. Like too many valuable \nprograms to help local law enforcement and crime prevention, it was \nallowed to lapse under the Bush administration. The program provides \ngrants for rural states to come up with a plan to help communities \nconfront drug and crime problems and to offer training and assistance \nfor local prevention programs and law enforcement. This program can \nhelp cash-strapped communities with assistance they desperately need.\n  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee traveled to St. Albans, VT, \nto hear from the people of that resilient community about the \npersistent problem of drug-related crime in rural America, and about \nthe innovative steps they are taking to combat that problem. The \nintroduction of this bill is a small first step to apply the lessons \nlearned in that hearing and in previous hearings in Vermont and \nelsewhere.\n  Drug-related crime is not just a big-city issue. As we heard in St. \nAlbans last week and at a hearing in Rutland earlier this year, drugs \nand related crime are a growing problem in rural communities in Vermont \nand across the country. Fortunately, resourceful communities like St. \nAlbans and Rutland are coming together to find innovative, community-\nbased solutions to these complex problems.\n  Of course, law enforcement continues to be an important component in \nour efforts to combat the scourge of drugs. There continues to be an \nurgent need for the Federal Government to support\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\nstate and local law enforcement. What more and more cities and towns \nare finding is that the best solutions involve all segments of the \ncommunity coming together with law enforcement to find meaningful, \ncommunity-based approaches. Solving these problems as they arise is \nessential, but preventing them is even better, and less expensive.\n  Unfortunately, for the last eight years, throughout the country, \nstate and local law enforcement agencies have been stretched thin as \nthey shoulder both traditional crime-fighting duties and new homeland \nsecurity demands. They have faced continuous cuts in federal funding \nduring the Bush years, and time and time again, our state and local law \nenforcement officers have been unable to fill vacancies and get the \nequipment they need.\n  This trend is unacceptable. I intend to work with the new \nadministration to reverse it. Eric Holder, whom President-Elect Obama \nhas designated to be our next Attorney General, focused on the \nimportance of state and local law enforcement when he was introduced to \nthe nation last Monday. He was a local U.S. Attorney and understands \nthe critical role of state and local law enforcement, our first \nresponders. We need to restore the COPS and Byrne grant programs to \nhelp support local law enforcement, and I hope we will do a better job \nwhen it comes to rural communities and rural states. That is why I am \nintroducing this bill today to bring back the Crime-Free Rural States \ngrant program.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have always advocated vigorous enforcement \nand punishment of those who commit serious crimes. But I also know that \npunishment alone will not solve the problems of drugs and violence in \nour communities. Police chiefs from Vermont and across the country have \ntold me that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem.\n  Combating drug use and crime requires attention to enforcement, \nprevention and treatment. The best way to prevent crime is often to \nprovide young people with opportunities and constructive things to do, \nso they stay away from drugs and crime altogether. And if young people \ndo get involved with drugs, treatment in many cases can work to help \nthem to turn their lives around. Good prevention and treatment programs \nhave been shown again and again to reduce crime, but regrettably, the \nBush administration has consistently sought to reduce funding for these \nimportant programs. It is time to move in a new direction.\n  I will work in the next Congress to advance legislation that will \ngive state and local law enforcement the support it needs, that will \nhelp our cities and towns to implement the kinds of innovative and \nproven community-based solutions needed to reduce crime. The \nlegislation I introduce today is a modest beginning, addressing the \nurgent and unmet need to support our rural communities as they struggle \nto combat drugs and crime.\n  By funding planning, training, and technical assistance, Crime-Free \nRural States grants provide an anchor for our rural communities as they \nwork to address the devastating problems of crime and drugs. It is a \nfirst step for us to help our small cities and towns weather the \nworsening conditions of these difficult times and begin to move in a \nbetter direction.\n  I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crime-Free Rural States \n     Reauthorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF CRIME-FREE RURAL STATES GRANTS.\n\n       Section 2989 of Part GG of Title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3797y-4) is \n     amended by striking ``2003, 2004 and 2005'' and inserting \n     ``2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 3728. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to waive \nnon-Federal share requirements for certain transportation programs and \nactivities through September 30, 2009; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Sanders, to introduce a bill that will help States \nstruggling with meeting non-Federal match requirements for federal \ntransportation funding under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and \nEfficient Transportation Equity Act, SAFETEA. Representative Peter \nWelch from Vermont introduced identical legislation in the House today \nas well.\n  Our States are struggling with enormous budget deficits due to the \ncurrent economic crisis. As a result, nearly every one of our States \nhas been forced to make drastic cuts to their transportation budgets. \nOn top of that, state and local governments around the country report \nthey do not have the necessary funding in their budgets to match any \nnew Federal transportation money possibly forthcoming in an economic \nstimulus package. The inability of our states to improve roads and \nbridges, support public transit agencies facing record demand, and \nupgrade rail lines puts a strain on our already sagging economy.\n  Waiving the non-Federal match requirements for all highway, transit, \nand rail projects contained in SAFETEA would allow cash-strapped states \nto implement high priority transportation projects immediately--at no \nadditional cost to the Federal Government. Since State and local \ntransportation officials have ready-to-go projects that simply cannot \nmove forward without untying the strings of the required match, our \nlegislation would waive the non-Federal matching requirements of \nSAFETEA through September 30, 2009.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a good look at our bill and support \nthis important legislation that will stimulate needed transportation \ninfrastructure investments all across the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 3730. A bill to expand, train, and support all sectors of the \nhealth care workforce to care for the growing population of older \nindividuals in the United States; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Retooling the \nHealth Care Workforce for an Aging America Act, a bill that will \naddress the impending and severe shortage of health care workers who \nare adequately trained and prepared to care for older Americans. The \nunfortunate fact of the matter is that while our country is aging \nrapidly, the number of health care workers devoted to caring for older \nAmericans is experiencing a shortage--one that will only grow more \ndesperate as the need for these caregivers skyrockets.\n  We face many challenges. We know that few nursing programs require \ncoursework in geriatrics and that in medical schools, comprehensive \ngeriatric training is a rarity. Currently, only 1 percent of all \nphysicians are certified geriatricians, even as the population of older \npeople is on track to double by 2030, and less than 1 percent of all \nnurses are certified gerontological nurses. Absent any change, by 2020, \nthe supply of nurses in the United States will fall 29 percent below \nprojected requirements, resulting in a severe shortage of nursing \nexpertise relative to the demand for care of frail older adults.\n  Ensuring that health care workers are properly trained in the \nprovision of care to our seniors is vital. For the direct care \nworkforce, which includes home health aides and personal care \nattendants, we know that Federal and State training requirements vary \nenormously, despite the fact that studies show that more training is \ncorrelated with better staff recruitment and retention. We also know \nthat family caregivers want enhanced education and training to develop \nthe necessary skills to provide the best possible care for an ailing \nfamily member. There are more than 44 million people providing care for \na family member or friend nationwide. These caregivers frequently do \nthe same work as a professional caregiver, but they do so voluntarily \nand with little or no training. To their loved one, they are the \ndoctor, the nurse, the assistant, the therapist, and oftentimes the \nsole source of emotional and financial support.\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\n  Fortunately, knowing what we need to change is half the battle. The \nbill I introduce today will expand, train, and support the workforce \nthat is dedicated to providing care for the older members of our \npopulation, incorporating the major recommendations for improving the \nskills and preparedness of the health care workforce put forth in the \nInstitute of Medicine report, ``Retooling for an Aging America: \nBuilding the Healthcare Workforce.''\n  By the year 2020, it is estimated that the number of older adults in \nneed of care will increase by one-third. The United States will not be \nable to meet the approaching demand for health care and long-term care \nwithout a workforce that is prepared for the job. Bolstering the health \ncare workforce will be an integral part of national health care reform, \nand I look forward to working with Finance and HELP Committee leaders \non incorporating this legislation into their policy proposals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S.J.

Res. 728\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate a young person's social, \n     emotional, and cognitive development;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for those \n     serving as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 4,200 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in solid mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas, in spite of the progress made to increase \n     mentoring, the Nation has a serious ``mentoring gap'', with \n     nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2009 as National \n     Mentoring Month will help call attention to the critical role \n     mentors play in helping young people realize their potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most significantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and encourage more people to \n     become mentors and help close the mentoring gap in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2009 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors and encourages more adults and \n     students to volunteer as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Mentoring Month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of, and volunteer \n     involvement with, youth mentoring.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Kennedy and \nothers to submit S. Res. 728, which designates January 2009 as National \nMentoring Month. Mentoring a child is a uniquely rewarding experience \nfor both the mentor and the child. Research continues to support that \nbuilding these positive relationships helps keep children off of drugs, \nin school and off the streets, and out of trouble.\n  This month, I brought the Senate Judiciary Committee to St. Albans, \nVT, for a field hearing about ``Community-Based Solutions to Drug-\nRelated Crime in Rural America.'' Community leaders and law enforcement \nofficials testified about their efforts to address crime. They are on \nthe front lines fighting crime each and every day. I have always said \nthat solving these problems as they arise is essential, but preventing \nthem is even better. One solution that Vermont's businesses, schools, \ncollege students, and retired people have continued to recognize is \nthat mentoring connects our community to our children.\n  Vermont's mentoring programs stretch the length of our great State, \nfrom the Northeast Kingdom to Bennington. Whether it is the Boys and \nGirls Clubs offering healthy alternatives for young people, or \norganizations such as DREAM, which connects college students and \nchildren living in subsidized housing developments, or any of the \nseveral mentoring programs in the State, these organizations and the \ndedicated people who operate and participate in them deserve our \nspecial thanks. I applaud all the work mentoring programs are doing to \nhelp our Nation's children become productive, law-abiding teenagers and \ncontributing adults. Recognizing those efforts during National \nMentoring Month is just one way we give our thanks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10884-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 729--EXPRESSING THE OPPOSITION OF THE SENATE TO A \n PROPOSED REGULATION BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, NOW UNDER \nREVIEW IN THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET, THAT WOULD UNDERCUT AIR \n   QUALITY PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT \n   AMENDMENTS OF 1977 FOR NATIONAL PARKS, NATIONAL WILDERNESS AREAS, \n               NATIONAL MONUMENTS, AND NATIONAL SEASHORES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Collins, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. \nTester) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 729\n\n       Whereas, in 1977, under part C of title I of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7470 et seq.), the prevention of significant \n     deterioration (PSD) program was established ``to preserve, \n     protect, and enhance the air quality in national parks, \n     national wilderness areas, national monuments, national \n     seashores, and other areas of special national or regional \n     natural, recreational, scenic, or historic value'', which \n     areas are known as class I areas;\n       Whereas Congress sought to protect air quality in class I \n     areas through, among other things, the establishment of \n     strict limits on additional amounts of air pollution, known \n     as increments, allowed in class I areas over baseline \n     conditions;\n       Whereas Congress required protection of air quality not \n     just from long-term pollution increases, but also from short-\n     term fluctuations and spikes, and Congress therefore created \n     and required both annual and short-term increments;\n       Whereas, on June 6, 2007, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) proposed a rule under the PSD program that would \n     replace the congressionally-established short-term pollution \n     increments with less protective annual average emission \n     rates;\n       Whereas, according to the National Park Service Comments on \n     EPA's Proposed Rule Regarding PSD Increment Modeling \n     Procedures Clarification/Modification (ER No.: DEC-06/0006), \n     ``the protection of short term PSD increments cannot be \n     assured using annual average emission rates'', and the \n     proposed rule ``ignores . . . reality'';\n       Whereas EPA's proposed rule would make multiple additional \n     changes to the PSD program that conflict with Congress's \n     statutory scheme, set forth in section 160 of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7470), ``to preserve, protect, and enhance the \n     air quality in national parks, national wilderness areas, \n     national monuments, national seashores, and other areas of \n     special national or regional natural, recreational, scenic, \n     or historic value'';\n       Whereas during EPA's initial review of the PSD proposal in \n     2007, each of EPA's 10 regional offices expressed grave \n     concerns that the changes to the PSD program proposed by EPA \n     would undermine protection of air quality in class I areas;\n       Whereas EPA submitted a proposed PSD rule to the Office of \n     Management and Budget in October 2008 that did not \n     incorporate the concerns expressed by the National Park \n     Service and EPA regional offices;\n       Whereas half of EPA's 10 regional administrators formally \n     dissented from the draft final rule now under review in the \n     Office of Management and Budget, and 4 other EPA regional \n     administrators criticized the draft final rule in writing; \n     and\n       Whereas the National Park Service and all 10 EPA regional \n     offices have uniformly concluded that EPA's proposed changes \n     to the PSD program would make it easier for large pollution \n     sources to locate closer to national parks, national \n     wilderness areas, national monuments, and national seashores, \n     leading to more harmful air pollution in these areas: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that air pollution levels in class I areas \n     can vary significantly over the course of a year, a month, or \n     even a day, and that short-term pollution spikes are capable \n     of endangering visitors, wildlife, and scenic values in \n     national parks, national wilderness areas, national \n     monuments, national seashores, and other class I areas;\n       (2) affirms that the PSD program is intended to preserve, \n     protect, and enhance air quality in class I areas not just \n     over the long term, but also over the shorter time periods \n     delineated in the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       (3) finds that EPA has proposed multiple changes to the PSD \n     program that would conflict with Congress's statutory scheme \n     to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality in national \n     parks, national wilderness areas, national monuments, \n     national seashores, and other areas of special natural, \n     recreational, scenic, or historic value; and\n       (4) expresses its opposition to EPA's proposed rule \n     entitled ``Prevention of Significant Deterioration New Source \n     Review: Refinement of Increment Modeling Procedures'' (72 \n     Fed.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7311, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 7311) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 2008 through 2011 for the Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Reauthorization Act of 2000, to enhance measures \n     to combat trafficking in persons, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am glad the Senate today passed the \nWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act, a bill that \nwill strengthen our efforts to stop the abhorrent practice of human \ntrafficking in the United States and around the world. I congratulate \nSenators Biden and Brownback, Congressman Berman, and the many others \nwho worked hard on this important legislation. I commend Senate and \nHouse leaders on this bill for putting aside significant differences to \nreach consensus on this important issue. I was pleased to support this \nbill as it moved through the Judiciary Committee this summer, and I am \nheartened that it will soon become law.\n  This bill enhances protections to the victims of these terrible \ncrimes and provides new laws against the immoral practice of recruiting \nchildren to be soldiers. Human trafficking is a modern-day form of \nslavery, involving victims who are forced, defrauded or coerced into \nsexual or labor exploitation. These practices continue to victimize \nhundreds of thousands around the world, mostly women and children, and \nwe must continue to make the laws banning human trafficking more \neffective and meaningful.\n  The coerced and often violent subjugation and exploitation of women, \ngirls, and children continues to plague many regions of the world. As \nnews reports continue to reveal, women and girls from many nations are \nsold as slaves and forced to engage in the sex industry. Children are \nrecruited, and sometimes even drugged, to become soldiers in war-torn \nregions of the world, and poor destitute immigrant workers are often \nduped or coerced to work in intolerable conditions that amount to \nforced labor. Even in the United States, we are not immune to the \nscourge of human trafficking, as evidenced by recent reports of Haitian \nchildren being brought to the United States as servants, who are then \nbeaten and abused into servitude. Progress has been made to address \nthese horrific problems, but we must continue to do more. This bill \ndoes.\n  I want to thank Senator Biden for introducing this bill in the \nSenate. I commend him for working with all the Federal agencies and \nconstituent interests to address new issues that continue to come up in \nthe fight against human trafficking. This bill will provide more \nprotection to victims, particularly child victims of human trafficking, \nand will give prosecutors new tools to gain cooperation from witnesses \nand informants who can provide vital testimony in human trafficking \nprosecutions. This bill also contains tools to combat the equally \nabhorrent practice of recruiting or using child soldiers. I \nparticularly appreciate Senator Biden's work to remove language that \nwould have resulted in unintended mandatory minimum penalties in the \nbill.\n  We must rededicate our efforts to the prevention of human \ntrafficking, the protection of its victims, and prosecution of those \nwho would commit these heinous offenses. Nowhere on earth should it be \nacceptable to deceive, abuse, and force a person into a life of \nenslavement. To deny a person their right to freedom is an affront to \nthe ideals of this Nation. Passage of this legislation is a first step \ntoward correcting this terrible problem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for supporting \nthe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct of 2008.\n  This trafficking bill includes a provision I authored over 8 years \nago--the Unaccompanied Alien Minor Act--to ensure that unaccompanied \nchildren receive humane and appropriate treatment while in the custody \nof the U.S. Government.\n  Today Congress took an important step to protecting unaccompanied \nalien children, the most vulnerable immigrants.\n  I believe we have a special obligation to ensure that these children \nare treated humanely and fairly. Unfortunately, without this \nlegislation, there would be no procedure to make sure that happens.\n  Currently, when a child is apprehended by immigration authorities, \nthat child usually knows nothing about U.S. courts or immigration \npolicies and frequently does not speak English. As a result, many are \nsent to detention facilities--often with adults or hardened criminals \nwith no idea that they might be eligible for foster care or immigration \nrelief.\n  This bill is necessary because every year, more than 7,000 \nundocumented and unaccompanied children are apprehended in the United \nStates or at our borders. This bill deals with how these thousands of \nchildren will be treated while awaiting a final decision on their \nimmigration status in this country.\n  Today Congress took the first step to ensure that unaccompanied \nminors in temporary Federal custody are treated as children and not as \ncriminals.\n  I first became involved in this issue when I saw the treatment of a \n15-year-old Chinese girl, who fled persecution in her country and had \nspent 9 months in a juvenile jail. She came to her asylum hearing \nshackled and in prison clothing. As she told her story to an \nimmigration judge, she could not wipe away her tears because her hands \nwere chained to her waist.\n  This bill seeks to protect children like this girl, who have escaped \ntraumatic situations such as armed conflict, sweatshop labor, human \ntrafficking, forced prostitution, and other life-threatening \ncircumstances.\n  These children have seen their family members threatened, tortured \nand even murdered. Many have been targets of attacks themselves.\n  Indeed, it is through their resilience and indomitable spirit that \nthey have found themselves in our country. And they need our help.\n  Yet, our Nation's response over the several years has been \nunacceptable. According to a report issued by Amnesty International in \nJune of 2004, unaccompanied children have too often languished in an \nunregulated immigration system.\n  According to Amnesty International, investigators identified \nsituations where children were strip-searched or kept in solitary \nconfinement. Others were victims of extreme brutality or refugees from \nwar zones and rather than being placed in appropriate facilities, they \nwere thrown in juvenile jails.\n  Most children reported that they had not received weekly visits from \nofficials specializing in juvenile care.\n  In addition, 83 percent of these facilities reported that they \nroutinely restrained the children with handcuffs or leg irons when they \nare transported.\n  One attorney told the story of a 7-year-old boy who had been forced \nto appear before a judge in handcuffs.\n  The majority of these children have been forced to struggle through \nan immigration system designed for adults.\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\n  Today, Congress will pass the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection \nAct to remedy this by requiring that children who pose no danger to \nthemselves or others be placed in the least restrictive setting \npossible; requiring the Office of Refugee Resettlement to do a \nsuitability assessment before placing the child with any agency or \nperson; and prohibiting placing children, who have committed no crimes, \nin a prison with hardened criminals.\n  This legislation also requires, whenever possible, family \nreunification or other appropriate placement in the best interest of \nthe unaccompanied alien children. For example, the Office of Refugee \nResettlement must do a home study before placing a child into a home or \nfoster care.\n  The bill also provides for pro bono legal representation for \nunaccompanied alien children in their immigration matters, where \npossible, at no expense to the Government. And finally, the bill \nrequires training for Department of Homeland Security personnel and \nothers who come into contact with unaccompanied children.\n  I would also like to be clear about what this bill would not do.\n  This legislation does not expand the current immigration rights of \nany child. Instead, it presumes that children will be placed in removal \nproceedings--unless they qualify for immigration benefits under current \nlaw.\n  It does not remove the jurisdiction and responsibility for \nadjudicating immigration status from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity or the Executive Office for Immigration Review, where such \njurisdiction and responsibilities currently reside.\n  It does not interfere with the custodial rights of a parent or \nguardian in situations where a parent or guardian seeks to establish \ncustody.\n  Like the Trafficking bill, these provisions have received broad \nbipartisan support. Among the endorsers of this legislation are \norganizations representing mental health and child welfare \nprofessionals, as well as legal, human rights, immigration and \nreligious organizations. It is a moderate, reasonable bill that by and \nlarge addresses issues of a child's care and custody, and not issues of \nsubstantive immigration relief.\n  I thank my House and Senate colleagues for passing this important \nbill. I also specifically thank Senators Biden, Brownback, Kennedy, and \nLeahy, as well as Representatives Berman, Lofgren, and Conyers for \ntheir hard work and leadership in securing the passage of this bill.\n  I urge the President to sign this important legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 7311) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/10/senate-section/article/S10887-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 11, 2008\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
