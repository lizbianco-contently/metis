The time from \n11 a.m. until 12 noon today is reserved for tributes to former \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, commemorating the centennial of his birth. \nThis afternoon, we expect to resume consideration of the House message \nwith respect to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The \nspeaking order during the time reserved for LBJ tributes will alternate \nbetween the majority and the minority.\n  As a reminder, cloture was filed last night on amendment No. 4803 \nrelated to domestic funding. Under rule XXII, the filing deadline for \nsecond-degree amendments is 1 hour prior to the cloture vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, we have second readings. But before getting to that, \nwe also are trying to work out a time agreement, even today. Under the \nrule, the budget cannot be brought up until tomorrow afternoon at about \n4 o'clock. But we can, by unanimous consent, move it to today. If we \ncan work something out with the Republicans today, we will do that.\n  Last night, Senator Conrad said he was going to confer with Senator \nJudd Gregg, the ranking member of that committee, to see if there is a \nway we can move to that and shorten the hours. Statutorily, it is a 10-\nhour time limit. If we start on that tomorrow, the 10 hours would run \ninto the next day.\n  We know Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens are not going to be here \nFriday. They are going to Senator Inouye's wedding. Senator Inouye is \ngetting married. Senator Stevens is his best man. So we need to try to \nfinish that before Friday morning.\n  In addition to that, we have the veto override on the farm bill we \nneed to complete. Now, on that there is no time limit. People can talk \nhowever long they want. I would hope we would not have to spend a lot \nof time on that bill. That bill has been debated about as much as \nanything needs to be debated. It had 81 votes when it left this \nChamber. We would hope everyone would recognize we need to dispose of \nthis as quickly as possible. I hope we can get those two matters going.\n  I have also made a suggestion to the Republican leader--I spoke to \nthe floor staff last night, together with my floor staff--and there \nwill be a decision made by the majority and the Republicans, through \nSenator McConnell and me, today to see if we can arrive at some way to \nproceed reasonably to this emergency supplemental.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4559-7", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4559-S4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 3036 AND S. 3044\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, let me say to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, we would be happy to work out a process by which we \ncould have the debate on the budget today. We would even be prepared to \nhave the vote on the budget today, but I understand that is \nproblematic.\n  Mr. REID. I think we could probably do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, that is something we could probably work toward, \nyes.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the budget, we have our differences in \nthe Senate, but there are a few ideas that have wide bipartisan \nagreement. One is we need to rein in Federal spending, and another is \nwe need to do our part to ensure that middle-class families keep more \nof the money they earn.\n  But the Democrats' latest budget shows we have a very different view \nof what these ideas mean. Our friends on the other side said they \nwanted to raise taxes on the rich and keep taxes low for working \nfamilies. But this budget would provide for the average family a tax \nhike of $2,300 on people earning as little as $31,000 a year and \ncouples making $63,000 a year. For a little perspective, first year \nschoolteachers in my hometown earn $35,982, and I do not think they \nconsider themselves rich.\n  With rising gas prices and economic concerns, middle-class families \nare tightening their belts. Yet this budget would take more money out \nof the paychecks of these families to fill the Government's coffers. At \na time when all Americans are watching their spending, shouldn't \nWashington be doing the same?\n  Not according to this budget, which does nothing to address \nentitlement spending and sets a new record--a new record--for \nnonemergency spending, topping the $1 trillion mark for the first time \nin American history. That is not a record I think we should be \nwelcoming.\n  So I am a little confused as to why this budget is at odds with the \nDemocrats' promise of keeping taxes low for working families and \nputting a stop to wasteful Washington spending.\n  It seems to me, if Congress was serious about letting Americans keep \nmore of the money they earn, we would make tax relief permanent. If we \nwere serious about reining in spending, we would pass a budget that \ncalls for responsible growth. Instead, we are on the verge of passing a \nbudget that goes in the opposite direction, contains the largest tax \nhike in U.S. history, and sets a new record for spending.\n  American families cannot afford this budget, American job creators \ncannot afford this budget, and our economy cannot afford this budget. I \nurge all of our colleagues to protect the American family's budget by \nvoting against this budget when we have an opportunity to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4560-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about two items \nthat are in the supplemental that has come from the House of \nRepresentatives. I find it difficult to speak about either one, but \nparticularly the first one, without turning and looking behind me to \nsee the great champion of the Senate, Senator Ted Kennedy, leading this \ndebate and discussion.\n  The first item I want to talk about is how we help middle-class \nfamilies, working families who have lost their jobs, to be able to keep \ntheir home, their dignity, and put food on the table while they look \nfor that next job.\n  No one has been a greater champion--no one--in this body or anywhere \nin the country for working men and women, for folks who are working \nhard every day to meet the American dream, than our own Senator Ted \nKennedy.\n  So as I speak today, I want to send my wishes, as my colleagues \nhave--all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and every part \nof this building and this city--to say to Ted that we miss you and we \nneed you back and we are sending our love and our prayers to you and \nVicki and the entire family because we need you. While we are very \nsaddened about the news, we know--as you have championed and had such \ngreat courage in fighting for those who have needed a voice, who have \nneeded a champion in the Senate--we know you will fight with the same \nvigor, and we will be right there with you to do everything we can to \nmake sure you are back leading us, leading the charge.\n  I have stood on this floor many times with the great leader, the \ngreat Senator from Massachusetts, to talk about what is happening to \nfamilies all across America. I represent a State with the highest \nunemployment rate in the country. Those in Michigan who are seeing \ntheir unemployment benefits expire, who are valiantly looking for work \nevery day, have been looking to us to help them extend that insurance \nbenefit until they can find a job.\n  We know there are 7.7 million people looking for work right now and \ncompeting for about 4 million jobs. So I am proud of the fact that our \ncaucus, the Democratic caucus, has placed creating jobs at the top of \nthe list of the budget resolution we will be discussing and voting on \nthis week.\n  But in the meantime we have to do everything we can to support those \nfamilies. In the supplemental that has come over from the House, I am \nvery pleased they have included a greatly needed extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits because the reality is we have lost, \nsince January, 260,000 good-paying American jobs, 260,000 middle-class \njobs--the jobs that pay the mortgage, put food on the table, send the \nkids to college, buy clothing, pay for gas--which continues to grow \noutrageously higher every day.\n  Part of our responsibility is to make sure those families receive the \ninsurance benefits they need while they pick up their lives, move in a \nnew direction, find work, so they can continue to have the American \ndream.\n  Some of those families have members who are in Iraq or Afghanistan or \naround the world serving us right now. Unfortunately, we have too many \nfamilies where one person--while we are grateful--is serving us in our \narmed services and the other breadwinner in the family has, in fact, \nlost their job. So there is a direct relationship between what we are \ndoing to support the unemployed to be able to continue to look for work \nand to be able to care for their families in the meantime and what we \nare doing on this supplemental.\n\n  Mr. President, there is another incredibly important piece of \nsupporting our troops that is in this legislation coming over from the \nHouse of Representatives. Again, I hear the voice of Senator Kennedy \nchampioning this as well in terms of making sure we are doing \neverything possible for our troops, both when they are in harm's\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\nway and when they are coming home, putting on a veterans cap and \ncontinuing to live their lives in America.\n  I am very proud to have cosponsored the 21st century GI bill. Senator \nWebb has been our champion. This is bipartisan legislation. Today's \nveterans deserve the same opportunities and thanks that have been given \nto earlier generations.\n  This bipartisan bill has overwhelming support in both the Senate and \nin the House. Veterans service organizations and millions of veterans \nand Active servicemembers have raised their voices in support of this \nlegislation.\n  I don't understand how anyone could fully support our troops by fully \nfunding the needs of our troops and then oppose the GI bill. Full \nfunding for our troops really does include the GI bill. That is what \nthis is all about: making sure we are keeping our promises. The men and \nwomen who sign up, who are overseas now, who are in harm's way, who \nhave lost limbs, who come home with post-traumatic stress syndrome, \nthose who are willing to put their lives on the line for us expect us \nto keep our promises.\n  I am proud of the fact that our Senate Democratic majority made fully \nfunding veterans health care a top priority when we came into the \nmajority last year. We kept that promise. This is the first year since \nthis war started that we have met the numbers the veterans \norganizations say are needed to be able to provide health care. This is \nthe second piece we are committed to achieving and making sure we have \na 21st century GI bill fit for the brave women and men who are serving \nus today.\n  Last week, as chair of our Steering and Outreach Committee, I was \nable to join 23 other members of our caucus, all of our leadership on \nthe majority side, and we met with 21 members from veterans service \norganizations who were unanimous in supporting not only the GI bill \nthat is included here, that has come from the House, that we so \nstrongly support, but in saying this should not be a partisan issue, \nthis should not be a political issue, this is the right thing to do. It \nis the right thing to do. It needs to be done for the right reasons. We \nowe it to our veterans to pass this. It is a critical part of what is \nin front of us. It is essential we make sure that when we leave here, \nwe can hold our heads high and say we have provided full funding for \nour troops by funding the GI bill and including it in this legislation.\n  This bill will pay for qualified veterans to attend any public \nuniversity in the Nation. If a veteran chooses to attend a private \nschool, the bill would also allow that to happen. It would pay tuition \nup to the amount of the most expensive public school in the State, so \nevery choice would be available for our veterans. Under the bill, \nprivate contributions would be matched by the Federal Government. There \nwould be sufficient funding for desperately needed books. The costs go \nup every year. I can attest to that, having put two children through \ncollege and seen the incredible expense for books alone, as well as \nliving expenses. Those things would be covered as well. We need to do \nthis because when our veterans get a good college education, all of \nsociety benefits. Their family benefits, the community benefits, the \ncountry benefits.\n  Providing a college education for veterans is very important for our \neconomy. World War II provided a great example of how the GI bill made \nit possible for our greatest generation to get an education, find good \njobs, buy a home, contribute to the American economy, and raise their \nfamilies.\n  I can speak to that directly. My father was in World War II. He was \nin the Navy. He came home as a veteran. Because of the GI bill, he was \nable to get an education, to be a small business owner, to raise a \nfamily--which I was very proud to be a part of--to send his kids to \ncollege, and to make sure we had what we needed to be able to live our \nAmerican dream. It was the GI bill after World War II that gave my dad \na chance. And through him and through that commitment to my father and \nto our family, it gave me a chance to be here today as well.\n  Today's veterans have served our country with the same honor and the \nsame courage as those in World War II. They deserve the same benefits. \nThey deserve the same opportunities, the same chance to shape their \nfutures, the future of their communities, and the future of the \nAmerican economy.\n  I also support this bill because it treats our Active-Duty Guard and \nReserve Forces the same way through their wartime service. This is \nespecially important now, as we know, as the Guard and Reserve take on \na greater and greater share of the combat tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It is no less important that Guard and Reserve members \noften return home to communities that don't have the same resources as \nthe Active-Duty servicemembers have on base. So making sure our Guard \nand Reserve can attend college, can get an education, the skills they \nneed to be successful, will help ease their transition into civilian \nlife.\n  I stand with those who are supporting our brave men and women in the \narmed services and those who have served in the global war on terror. \nThis bill is long overdue and should be enacted right now. That is what \n21 veterans service organizations have said to us, and millions of \nveterans across the country. We have a duty to give our veterans what \nthey deserve. They have offered the greatest sacrifice and should be \ngiven a chance for a solid education in these competitive times to \nbecome successful after their military service is done.\n  So, like the rest of the supplemental, this is full funding for our \ntroops. It is full funding for our troops. We need to make sure they \nhave what they need, not just on the battlefield but when they return \nhome. We have kept the promise on health care, and our Senate \nDemocratic majority is committed to continue to do that every year.\n  We have also been committed and are very pleased that the House sent \nto us a GI bill that we have been working on with leaders in our \ncaucus, including Senator Webb and certainly our leader, Senator Reid, \nand many others, to make sure we keep the rest of the promise. We need \na modern GI bill that fits what is happening for our veterans around \nthe world, to make sure Guard and Reserve are treated with the same \ndignity and have the same opportunities as our Active-Duty personnel.\n  As we debate this supplemental, I sincerely hope we will not leave \nthis Chamber without making sure that full funding for our troops \nincludes the passage of this greatly needed GI bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two important \ndomestic priorities that are funded in the Senate's emergency \nsupplemental. Those two priorities are the Secure Rural Schools and \nJAG/Byrne funding. These programs are critically important to Montana \nand rural America. I hope my colleagues continue to support them.\n  Last year, a 1-year extension of the Secure Rural School and Self-\nDetermination Act was included in the emergency supplemental, giving \nmuch relief to rural counties.\n  We also narrowly lost the opportunity to pass a 5-year \nreauthorization during the debate on last year's energy bill. But now, \ntoday, we have the same opportunity to provide temporary relief while \nwe work to provide the longer term funding solutions that our counties \nand schools deserve.\n  Why is this so important? Because county payments assist 600 rural \ncounties and 4,400 schools in 42 States.\n  A majority of the counties in my State of Montana receive benefits \nfrom this program. Without an extension, these communities will suffer, \nand schoolteachers and county workers will be laid off.\n  Less money for rural schools means less opportunity for our rural \nstudents, lower teacher pay, bigger classroom size, fewer activities, \nand students who start to fall behind. Rural America's students deserve \nthe same opportunities as their urban counterparts, and this program \nhelps them to keep pace.\n  Fewer dollars for the counties mean higher local property taxes, \npoorer\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\nroads, and local public work projects that do not get done. Overall, \nrural economies will suffer in a big way.\n  In the West, we are rich in public lands. One-third of Montana is in \npublic ownership. Much of it is timberland. It only makes sense that \nthe Federal owners help support local services.\n  These counties are, by nature, rural, and Secure Rural Schools \nfunding makes up a large portion of their local budget. Without this \nextension, local communities will not be able to make ends meet. For \nthese reasons, I hope the funding for Secure Rural Schools remains in \nthe supplemental.\n  I also express my appreciation for the work of Senators Wyden, \nBaucus, and others who have fought so hard to fund this program over \nthe years. Rural America needs this support to continue.\n  Another issue I want to draw attention to is the JAG/Byrne funding \nused by America's drug task forces. These justice assistance grants \nhelp local law enforcement agencies fight drug dealers and \nmanufacturers across this country.\n  There is $490 million in the supplemental to restore funding to this \ncritical program that will bring the amount of last year's level up to \n$660 million.\n  Montana has seven drug task forces, which cover three-quarters of \nMontana's 56 counties. In 2007, Montana's Drugbusters received almost \n$1.3 million. This year, Montana is set to receive only $473,000. That \nis a loss of $817,000 in 1 year. The folks on the ground have told me \nthey are going to have massive cutbacks in programs and in \nsurveillance. In fact, 27 of the 49 agents statewide would be laid off. \nThree of the seven drug task forces would have to close their doors \naltogether.\n  Montana is the fourth largest State, geographically. It is too big \nand expansive for us to think we can keep a handle on drug traffickers \nwith such limited resources. What would happen? More drugs would remain \nin our communities, more weapons in the hands of criminals, more \ncrimes, and more children would be exposed to danger because they would \nbe continually exposed to volatile situations, criminal behavior, and \ndrugs. We do not want to go backward.\n  As a result of the efforts of Montana's Drugbusters, there has been a \nsignificant decrease in the number of meth labs. For instance, in 2002, \nthere were over 120 labs. In 2006, thanks to the Montana Drugbusters, \nthere were less than 10 labs in the State of Montana. This is great \nwork and this work must continue.\n  Without the restoration of this funding, our efforts to limit drugs \nin Montana and throughout the country will be devastated. Our \nchildren's exposure to drugs and crime will be increased, and our \nfamilies will be torn apart. Montana cannot afford it. No State can. \nAmericans deserve better.\n  I know many of my colleagues share in my strong support for JAG/Byrne \nfunding and county payments. I appreciate their help in developing and \ncontinuing these programs. I hope this supplemental, in the end, \nincludes these important programs and that the President signs the \nsupplemental into law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4562-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4562-S4564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPROVAL RATING OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week we reached a milestone in \nCongress, because on Monday it was the 500th day since our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle took control of both the Senate and House \nfollowing the 2006 election. In those 500 days, we have seen \ncongressional approval rating, according to Rasmussen Surveys, drop to \n13 percent of the respondents who believe that Congress has performed \nin a good or excellent fashion. I believe one reason why we have seen \nthis drop in Congress's public approval rating is because we have \nfailed to address some of the biggest concerns that confront the \nAmerican people.\n  Here is a chart. Four of the concerns are depicted here. The first \nnumber I mention here is the 96 days that Congress--specifically the \nHouse of Representatives--has failed to act to modernize the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, of course, is the law that allows our intelligence community to \nlisten to telephone conversations between foreign terrorists to learn \nof attacks being planned, so as to not only detect them but also to \ndeter them and defeat our enemies. Why Congress would fail to act to \nreauthorize this important piece of legislation for 96 days, I think, \ncan only cause us to scratch our heads and wonder what could possibly \njustify that effective blinding of our intelligence community to new \nthreats and the kinds of threats that could make us safer, if detected, \ndeterred, and defeated, and could make us safer here at home and make \nour troops safer in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  At the same time, we have been waiting 547 days for Congress to take \nup and pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. This is important to our \nNation and it is important to my State. Last year alone, Texas sold \n$2.3 billion worth of goods and produce to Colombia, a large nation in \nSouth America. Because of tariffs that are currently imposed on those \ngoods that are sold from Texas to Colombia, or from the United States \nto Colombia, it actually discriminates against my small business man \nand woman, against the manufacturer, against the producer of farm \ngoods; whereas, Colombian goods coming into the United States because \nof another agreement have no similar tariff or financial \ndiscrimination.\n  If the Speaker of the House would take up the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement, we could restore a level playing field and create more jobs \nin the United States because we would be creating more goods here in \nAmerica to sell in Colombia.\n  Free trade is something that, amazingly, this Congress seems more and \nmore afraid of, when, in fact, I think it is one of the ways out of our \ncurrent economic doldrums. If we continue to create new markets for our \ngoods and services across the world, that creates jobs at home. If \nthere is anything like a stimulus package Congress could pass, free-\ntrade agreements, such as the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, is one of \nthem.\n  It is more important than that because Colombia, of course, is one of \nour very best allies in Latin America, sitting right next door to Hugo \nChavez in Venezuela, someone who is not our friend and has declared us \nhis enemy.\n  I have to think that Raul Castro and Fidel Castro in Cuba and Hugo \nChavez in Venezuela are sort of chuckling to themselves, seeing how \nAmerica is treating one of our very best allies in Latin America. In \nfact, it is President Uribe in Colombia who has been heroic in his \nfight against the narcoterrorists, known as the FARC, who recently, we \nfound out, were not only in cahoots with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez but \nplanning a lot of no good--buying arms, buying military materiel from \nRussia and other places right in our backyard, in Latin America. Why we \nwould stiff-arm President Uribe in Colombia, one of our very best \nallies in Latin America, when it is in our self-interest to create more \nmarkets to sell American goods and services, frankly, is beyond me.\n  The next number is 692 days. This is how long some judicial nominees, \nnominated by President Bush, have been waiting for Senate confirmation.\n  We know the majority leader pledged to confirm at least three circuit \ncourt nominees before the Memorial Day break. We only have 2 more days \nleft to go. Obviously, we are not going to meet that pledged goal. So \n692 days with nominees waiting for a vote with no real end in sight. It \nis clear what is happening. It is an attempt to drag this out until the \nelection is nigh upon us and then the majority leader can say: We can't \nget any more judges confirmed because we are going to have to wait for \nthe Presidential election to see who will fill those vacancies. But to \nwait 692 days without even giving these nominees simply the courtesy of \na hearing or an up-or-down vote is inexcusable. There is just no reason \nfor it.\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\n  The last number on this chart is 758 days. That is the period of time \nsince Nancy Pelosi, now the Speaker of the House, pledged to come up \nwith a commonsense plan to reduce the price of gasoline. Mr. President, \n758 days later, the price of gasoline is going through the roof, with \nno end in sight, and the price of oil, which makes up 70 percent of the \ncost of gasoline, is going through the roof, with no end in sight.\n  We have on this side of the aisle offered what I believe to be a very \nconstructive plan to produce more American energy and rely less on \nimported energy from other parts of the world, and that was rebuffed by \nthe majority. I am left to wonder, if the majority refuses to take \nadvantage of American natural resources and reduce our dependency on \nimported oil from our enemies at the price of $3.75 a gallon, I wonder \nif they would reconsider when the price hits $4.75 a gallon or $5.75 a \ngallon? At what price will we finally wake up in Congress and recognize \nthat the moratorium we passed some 30 years ago which banned the \nexploration for oil and gas on our Outer Continental Shelf, when oil \nwas $7 a barrel and now is $127 a barrel, when will we reconsider that \npolicy and decide it is in our national interest--our national security \ninterest and our economic interest--to depend more on what God gave us \nin America, our natural resources, which can be developed in a way that \nis consistent with a good environment and in a way that is responsible?\n  It is irresponsible to simply ignore reality or to imagine that we in \nCongress can suspend the economic laws of supply and demand. As we have \nseen oil consumption worldwide go to about 85 million barrels a day, we \nknow that countries such as China and India, with growing economies, \nare using more and more of that oil. So we are competing for a fixed \nsupply of oil, and the law of supply and demand says: If you have a \nfixed supply but increasing demand, the price is going to continue to \ngo up. But somehow Congress feels as if we can ignore that law or we \ncan defy that law. We can no more defy the law of supply and demand \nthan we can the law of gravity. I think the American people understand \nthat, and I think they are bewildered, as I am, why Congress continues \nto defy this basic law of economics.\n  The bill that will be before the Senate today is a very important \npiece of legislation which bears further witness to why Congress is \nheld in such low regard by the American people. It is because this bill \nwhich was designed to be an emergency supplemental appropriations to \nhelp fund our troops in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq has become a \npolitical football and a lot of unrelated projects have been added to \nthis bill, which has caused the President to threaten to veto it, which \nthe majority understands will simply slow down the process of getting \nthese necessary funds, getting this necessary equipment that these \nfunds would pay for, to our troops in harm's way.\n  Twenty-five days from now--Deputy Secretary Gordon England said that \nabsent additional congressional action, ``the Army will run out of \nmilitary personnel funds by mid-June and operation and maintenance \nfunds by early July.'' In 25 days, unless Congress acts, the military \nwill run out of personnel funds--that means money used to pay the \nmilitary their paychecks each month--and will run out of operation and \nmaintenance funds by early July.\n  I believe it is absolutely inexcusable that as we approach Memorial \nDay, the men and women of our military are left to wonder whether we \nwill meet our obligation to make sure there is enough money available \nto pay their paychecks so their families can be provided for after \nJune. While we all have talked about supporting our troops--and that is \nvery important--how much more basic a way is there to support our \ntroops than to make sure they are paid the money they are entitled to \non a timely basis and not left to wonder whether Congress will meet \nthat simple obligation? Talk is one thing; action, which would send a \ndifferent message altogether, is another.\n  It is indisputable that these men and women in our U.S. military have \nmade tremendous sacrifices for all of us. They have given not only \ntheir precious time, some have even given their lives to protect our \nway of life. Many of them have spent months, if not years, away from \ntheir families, missed birthdays, missed births, all in fulfillment of \nthis noble duty to help keep the oppressed free and to protect our \nnational security. Now they are left to scratch their heads and wonder \nwhat is going on again in Washington and whether politics is \ninterfering with Congress's willingness to simply do its duty while \nthey discharge their duties abroad.\n\n  This critical funding includes not only vital pay and allowances but \nalso the tools our troops need to ensure they have safe passage through \nneighborhoods they patrol in Afghanistan and Iraq. I am referring to, \nin part, the Commander's Emergency Response Program, or the CERP. When \nI was in Baghdad and other places in Iraq in January, the commanding \nofficers said that these are some of the most useful funds we have made \navailable to them. Secretary Gates has called it ``the single most \neffective program to enable commanders to address local populations' \nneeds. . . .'' These CERP funds will come to a standstill. Unless \nCongress acts on a timely basis without loading down this bill with a \nlot of pet projects and pork, it will come to a standstill. Why would \nwe want to hamstring our commanders in the field in working with local \npopulations to try to win their hearts and minds? As Secretary Gates \npointed out, CERP is the key in the effort to get potential insurgents \nin Iraq and Afghanistan off the streets and into jobs.\n  Colleagues on both sides of the aisle have long acknowledged the \nimportance of CERP funding. However, despite this acknowledgment, \nCongress has provided less than a third of what has been requested, and \nnow providing those funds at all is left in some doubt. According to \nthe Department of Defense, unless we provide the remaining $1.2 billion \nin CERP funds, the program will grind to a halt. What more important \nthing could we be doing in Iraq than trying to win the hearts and minds \nof former insurgents and get them deployed so that they lay down their \nguns and their bombs and engage in not only the political process but \nin the economic revitalization of that war-torn country. We all agree \nthe Iraqis need to take more responsibility for rebuilding their \ncountry, and that is what these CERP funds are designed to ensure. Why \nin the world would we slow them down or fail to see that they are \ndelivered?\n  Beyond CERP funds and troop paychecks, the lack of funding begins to \nalso impact other areas. We will see furloughs of civilian employees of \nthe Department of Defense if Congress does not act promptly. \nUnfortunately, this includes staff members at facilities such as child \ndevelopment centers which many of our troops depend on for daycare for \ntheir young ones. It would detrimentally impact services provided to \ntroops and their families at military installations across America and \naround the world.\n  It is sad to note this is not the first time Congress has put our \ntroops in this position. Once again, while our troops are waiting for \ncritical funding, needed not only for their own well-being but for the \ncompletion of their mission, some of my colleagues will try to use this \nsupplemental funding bill to advance pet projects or to resurrect a \ntired agenda. Once again, we have seen there will be an attempt to \nforce yet another vote on the precipitous withdrawal of our troops from \nIraq; that is, based on a political timetable handed down here in \nWashington rather than conditions on the ground which will lead to the \nlikelihood of stability and ultimate success. Despite the countless \ndebates we have had on this issue and despite the clear and \nundisputable evidence of both military and political progress in Iraq, \nmy colleagues will again refuse to pass a clean supplemental bill to \nsupport our troops. This debate, of which we know the outcome, will do \nnothing but delay those funds going to our troops.\n  It is becoming increasingly evident that American troops and our \nIraqi allies are making great progress in areas that were formerly \nlabeled as hopeless. In the New York Times today, there is a story on \nthe front page about how Sadr City, which was basically a no-man's \nzone, has now been stabilized by Iraqi troops themselves. Violence is \ndown, and communities are fighting back against extremism. Life is \nslowly returning to normal. Refugees who previously fled that country \nare returning\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\nhome. What better could we hope for than to see these sorts of \ndevelopments? Of course, this is thanks in large part to the sacrifices \nof our military and our military families.\n  We also need to acknowledge the great strides being made by the Iraqi \nGovernment. By reasonable estimates, the Iraqis have now met 12 of the \n18 benchmarks Congress set for them, and they have begun to fight \nagainst extremism and senseless violence without regard to affiliation \nor sectarian identification.\n  The recent initiative that Prime Minister Maliki undertook in Basra \nis a good example of taking the initiative, of doing what we had hoped \nfor, and that is taking the training that America and our coalition \npartners have provided and using that training to fight for \nthemselves. The more the Iraqis stand and fight for themselves, the \nmore American and coalition troops can stand down and ultimately come \nhome.\n\n  I think it is important to point out to the American people that what \nwas supposed to be an emergency supplemental appropriations bill is not \nlimited to war-related measures, and this is designed to slow down this \nimportant piece of legislation. We know that not only are other pet \nprojects and unrelated spending measures included, there are $10 \nmillion in unrelated emergency spending measures that perhaps might be \njustified in some other context, but we need to have this bill passed \ncleanly so we can get the money to the troops and so we can debate the \nmerits of these various other programs at a later time. We should not \nuse this bill for controversial policy measures.\n  Our troops, as well as the American people, deserve more open debate \nabout complex issues--and here are four of them we need to act on--but \nwe should not use this bill to try to get provisions passed without \neither adequate debate or adequate scrutiny. Things that could not be \npassed in the light of day should not be passed on this vehicle, this \nmust-pass vehicle. The men and women who have made tremendous \nsacrifices to serve our country deserve more than to have to be asked \nto carry on their backs the political agendas of a few of their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Despite the looming shortfalls for military paychecks, the Senate \ndoes not seem all that concerned. Despite warnings by the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense that Congress must act before the Memorial Day \nrecess, the majority leader recently told people it was no big deal if \nCongress did not. I respectfully beg to differ. Failing to supply a \npaycheck to our brave soldiers is an incredibly big deal. Playing \npolitics at a time when our soldiers are being left to wonder whether \nthey will be able to pay for their food bill, their gasoline bill, \ntheir health care or other items while Congress engages in this sort of \ngamesmanship is simply inexcusable.\n  So I think we could improve congressional approval ratings above the \n13 percent who think we are doing a good or excellent job if we would \nsimply act on this list of items which has been waiting, some for as \nmany as 758 days, without a response from the Congress and if we would \nsimply quit using something such as an emergency funding bill for our \ntroops in harm's way in order to pass other unrelated pet projects or \nto try to impose other political agendas. I think if we acted \nresponsibly, in a bipartisan way, to try to solve some of these \nproblems, the American people would respond favorably. That would be \ngood for them, that would be good for the country, and that would be \ngood for the Senate and the Congress, generally.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, in about 20 minutes, I know we are \ngoing to turn pay tribute to Lyndon Baines Johnson. This is LBJ Day in \nthe Capitol, and there are many speeches that will be made, there are \nmany celebrations, there is a huge reunion of the LBJ family and his \nformer staff people and supporters and Cabinet officers, and I am going \nto speak in that designated hour. But right now, in morning business, I \nwould like to speak about another great Senator. I wish to speak about \nmy colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  We all know we got a shock yesterday; that Senator Kennedy has been \ndiagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor, and he has just been released \nfrom the hospital. We are all so grateful he has been able to go to the \ncomfort of his own home with his family as they are deciding how the \ntreatment will go forward. But I wish to take a moment to talk about \nsomething we have been working on together.\n  If I could think of one word for Senator Ted Kennedy, it would be \n``fighter.'' He is a fighter for the causes in which he believes. In \nhis 46 years as a Senator, he has fought on behalf of the American \npeople, waging so many battles to advance the causes of justice, \nopportunity, and peace. Now, he is set to wage the greatest fight of \nhis life, and in that fight he has the support and prayers of all his \ncolleagues and all the American people.\n  Senator Kennedy's startling diagnosis comes the week after he and I \nannounced our commitment to renew the war on cancer. For the last \nseveral months, Senator Kennedy and I have been working on a bill to \nevaluate our progress on cancer research and treatment, address our \nshortcomings, and renew our commitment to eradicating this disease. \nThere is no other person I would rather be working with on this \ninitiative--now more than ever.\n\n  Senator Kennedy's diagnosis is such a poignant reminder that the \nbattle has not been won. On May 8, the committee he chairs--the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--held a hearing to \ndiscuss the Kennedy-Hutchison bill. Advocates and survivors of cancer \nsuch as Lance Armstrong and Elizabeth Edwards spoke about the need for \nprogress and reform in all areas of cancer research and treatment. In \nthe 37 years since the national declaration of the war on cancer, the \nage-adjusted mortality rate for cancer is still very high. When it is \ncompared to the mortality rates of other chronic diseases, it is \nextraordinarily high. While there have been substantial achievements \nsince the crusade began, we are far from winning this war. Let's look \nat the statistics.\n  Today, one out of two men and one out of three women will develop \ncancer in their lifetime. In my home State of Texas, approximately \n96,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer and 35,000 are \nexpected to die of cancer in 2008 alone. The NIH, the National \nInstitutes of Health, estimates the overall cost of cancer to our \nNation in 2007 was $219 billion.\n  These grim statistics should not belie the wealth of knowledge we \nhave gained over the years, but it is time for legislation to address \nthe shortcomings in the structure of cancer research and treatment. \nSenator Kennedy and I are leading the effort to renew our war on \ncancer. We want to continue our search for cures, more effective \ntreatments, and better preventive measures. The cancer community must \nembrace a coordinated assault against this disease. We must start \nlooking at more cooperative efforts that focus on the big picture. The \nbill Senator Kennedy and I will introduce is targeted at the following: \nremoving barriers currently hindering our progress in cancer research \nand treatment; improving access to early detection measures and cancer \ncare; reducing disparities in cancer treatment; increasing enrollment \nin clinical trials--this is a very important part that I think is one \nof the keys we are missing; and encouraging additional opportunities \nfor cancer research and more cooperative cancer research.\n  Our bill will encourage the movement of medications and treatment \nfrom the laboratory to the bedside more quickly. It is time we started \nsharing more information. There is great research being done at many of \nour institutions--some in my home State of Texas and some in his home \nState of Massachusetts are the very best; in Maryland at Johns Hopkins; \nin Minnesota. We have wonderful research institutions. But we are not \nsharing the information enough. We need to\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\nmake sure this is a wholesale war and we are all in the same army, that \nwe are marching in the same direction, and that we are coordinated in \ndoing that.\n  As Senator Kennedy wages his own personal war on this dreaded \ndisease, he will also be leading America's war on cancer with the \nKennedy-Hutchison bill that we will introduce in the Senate. So many \ntimes Senator Kennedy has been the voice for the American people. He \nwill truly be the voice for this bill to renew the war on cancer at \nthis very difficult time in his life.\n  I know he is going to be standing on this floor, he is going to be \nnegotiating this bill, he is going to be relentless in making sure it \ngoes through with bipartisan support. We will work with the President--\nhe will work with this President--because I have seen how he has worked \nwith President Bush to further public education.\n  Senator Kennedy and I are going to renew the war on cancer with a new \nvigor and we are going to do it together, and he is going to pass this \nlegislation. I know he will be by my side in his fight and in his fight \nfor the American people. We are going to support him at this time in \nevery possible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I intend to speak about Senator \nKennedy at a later time in more depth. Certainly there have been a lot \nof Senators who have said a quiet little prayer for the complete \nrecovery of Senator Kennedy that would include other colleagues, some \nof whom we do not even know about. Certainly we know about the \nrecurrence of the cancer in the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. \nWe certainly know of the physical health challenges the President pro \ntempore, Senator Byrd, is going through. Since this is a Senate family, \nperhaps the world at large doesn't understand that political \ndifferences, just as in a real family, can keep people separated. But \nwhen there is a time of need and healing, the family comes together. \nThat is certainly the case in what we feel about Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Specter, Senator Byrd. But I will be speaking about that later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4565-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, when Lyndon Johnson was Senator \nand majority leader, he had observed that during the Korean war, often \nthe Soviet Union held the high ground because their MiGs could fly \nhigher than our planes. Certainly as majority leader he went through \nthe shocks that the entire Nation experienced when the Soviets \nsurprised us by the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik. We knew \nthen that the Soviet Union had the high ground. At that point the \nNation came together, realizing we had a serious problem because we had \nan adversary that was dedicated to the elimination of the United States \nof America and that for our defense interests we clearly had to start \ndoing something about it.\n  There is the whole story of that extraordinary time of the late 1950s \nwhen America came together, when we finally had to reach out to a group \nof German scientists. We were fortunate, at the end of World War II, to \nget to Peenumunde, Germany, before the Soviets did, in order to get \nmost of those German rocket scientists, led by Werner von Braun. \nUltimately that was the team to which we turned to produce the rocket \nthat could get our first satellite--Explorer was its name--in orbit. \nBut that was after we were shocked.\n  This Senate, this Congress, under the leadership of Lyndon Johnson, \nsaid we have to organize ourselves in a way that we can take this on. \nThat was the birth of NASA, 50 years ago this year. NASA was the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. Now that acronym has \nbecome the noun; everybody knows it as NASA. It was the organization \nthat was given the task after that majority leader put that through \nthis Chamber and through the Congress, to have it signed into law by \nPresident Eisenhower, with all the ingredients in the law that would \ngive us this Federal agency that could take on this daunting task.\n  Along comes the election of 1960 and Lyndon Johnson doesn't get the \nnomination but, because the nominee is smart enough to realize he has \nto bring together the party in a tough election, Lyndon Johnson is his \nVice President. So they get into their first year in office and the \nSoviets surprise us again and they take the high ground when they \nlaunch Yuri Gagarin into one orbit.\n  Mind you, we didn't even have a rocket at that point that we could \nput a human on the top of that could get us to orbit. We were still \noperating off of that Army Redstone rocket that von Braun had \nsuccessfully put up to put the first satellite in orbit, but it only \nhad enough throw-weight, or power, to take that Mercury capsule with \none human in it and put it into suborbit.\n  I remember when I was a young Congressman back in the 1980s, one day \nTip O'Neill, the Speaker, saw me on the floor and he said: Bill, come \nhere. He knew I had just flown in space. He wanted to tell me a story. \nAs a young Boston Congressman, Tip O'Neill was down at the White \nHouse--the John Kennedy-Lyndon Johnson White House--and he said: I had \nnever seen the President so nervous that day. He was pacing back and \nforth. He was just like a cat on a hot tin roof.\n  He asked one of the aides what is going on, and he realized that \nKennedy knew that we were just about to launch Alan Shepherd, only in \nsuborbit--and this is a few weeks after Gagarin has already taken the \nhigh ground. Of course it was then a second suborbit with Grissom, and \nit was 10 months later that America had John Glenn climbing into that \nMercury capsule on top of an Atlas rocket that had a 20 percent chance \nof failure. Of course we know the rest of the story.\n  Interestingly, what happened in between that time when the Soviets \nhad taken the high ground with Gagarin up, before we could get Glenn up \nfor three orbits, the President made the decision--and it was a bold, \nnew vision--and said we are going to the Moon and back within 9 years. \nBut then he turned to his Vice President to implement it. Therein lay \nthe idea and the secret to one of the most successful governmental and \ntechnological achievements in the history of humankind with the White \nHouse, specifically the Vice President, directing the way, giving \ncomplete carte blanche to their newly selected Director of NASA, Jim \nWebb, to go forth and do this magnificent technological achievement.\n  Of course we had to scramble. Even after we had John Glenn up, the \nSoviets still held the high ground. They did the first rendezvous in \nspace. But then we started to catch up and of course America knows this \nwonderful success story in which we were able to go to the Moon and \nreturn safely, a feat that has not been accomplished by any others.\n  I come back to why I am standing on this floor today. America has had \nthat success because of the then Vice President of the United States, \nLyndon Johnson, who then became President and pushed that program on \nthrough to extraordinary success.\n  It is fitting that the space center that trains those astronauts is \nnamed the Lyndon Baines Johnson Space Center.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time between \nnow and noon is set aside for remarks regarding President Johnson; is \nthat right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the summer of 1908, a man named Sam Ealy \nJohnson, Sr., rode through the Texas hill country, announcing to \nwhomever happened to pass by, ``A United States Senator was born this \nmorning!''\n  The name of his grandson--Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  I am pleased today to mark the beginning of the celebration for the \n100th birthday of that boy from Texas who would not only be Senator, \nbut Senate majority leader, Vice-President, and President of the United \nStates.\n  There is a tradition on the floor of the Senate of which our \ncolleagues but few Americans are aware.\n  If you open any of the desks in the Senate Chamber, you will find \ncarved the names of each Senator who was assigned the desk in years \npast.\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n  Among the names carved in my desk is Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  America and the world know Lyndon Johnson as the President with a \nsteady hand that guided our country through a deeply troubled era--and \nwas the guiding hand in creating the Great Society.\n  But those of us in the Senate--and his family and dear friends who \njoin us here today--know that it was this Senate Chamber--this Capitol \nBuilding--that was his home.\n  Born in the Hill Country of Texas, Lyndon Baines Johnson came to the \nSenate in 1948 after prevailing in one of the closest Senate contests \nin American history.\n  As my colleagues well know, most rookie Senators arrive in Washington \nresigned to spending a few years getting to know the rules and \ntraditions of this body--biding their time and gaining seniority.\n  Not Lyndon Johnson. His rise to power was laser-fast.\n  He was appointed to the powerful Armed Services Committee within his \nfirst 2 years, and was elected assistant democratic leader--or majority \nwhip--in 1951.\n  No Senator ever rose to the leadership of the Senate faster.\n  But Lyndon Johnson had good timing as well as talent as his allies.\n  In the 1952 election, Dwight Eisenhower was elected in a landslide, \nsweeping Republicans into power in both the House and Senate.\n  Among the defeated Democrats was Majority Leader Ernest McFarland of \nArizona.\n  With just 4 years tenure, 4 years in the U.S. Senate, Lyndon Johnson \nbecame the Democratic leader of the Senate.\n  At the time, the positions of majority and minority leader took a \nbackseat to the powerful committee chairmanships.\n  Lyndon Johnson had a different vision, and it is no exaggeration to \nsay that he singlehandedly made the job of leader what it is today.\n  After establishing himself as the legislative and political leader of \nthe Senate Democrats, Johnson was uniquely well-positioned in 1954, \nwhen Democrats regained the majority and he became majority leader.\n  What followed is the stuff of legend.\n  Based upon his philosophy that ``The only real power available to the \nleader is the power of persuasion,'' Lyndon Baines Johnson used that \npower to the fullest.\n  In just 1 day in 1956, Lyndon Johnson's Senate confirmed two \nappointments and passed 90 bills a record that may stand for all time.\n  The quantity of Johnson's Senate work was impressive, but so was the \nquality.\n  As an exhibit at the LBJ library says:\n\n       By working to find common ground uniting liberals and \n     conservatives alike, LBJ's Senate passed legislation to \n     increase the minimum wage, extend social security benefits, \n     increase public housing construction, create an interstate \n     highway system, create a national space agency and enact the \n     first civil rights legislation since 1875. The majority \n     leader's inspiration was the prophet Isaiah, who preached \n     ``Come now, and let us reason together,'' a philosophy--and a \n     result--that unquestionably and dramatically improved the \n     lives of all Americans.\n\n  On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome members of Lyndon Johnson's \nfamily, his former staff, and friends of the Johnson family to the U.S. \nSenate to mark his 100th birthday and honor his life.\n  This celebration is tinged with sadness that his beloved wife Lady \nBird passed away last year and is not with us today.\n  As President, Lyndon Johnson once said--``This nation, this \ngeneration, in this hour has man's first chance to build a Great \nSociety, a place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of \nman's labor.''\n  Lyndon Baines Johnson's pursuit of a Great Society is a legacy that \nchanged America forever and will last as long as our Republic stands.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to speak on \nthe life and legacy of Lyndon Baines Johnson. He served his country as \na teacher, naval officer, Congressman, Senator, Vice President, and \nfinally President of the United States. In every stop along the way of \nhis storied career, he blazed new boundaries of the possible in \nAmerican politics.\n  When Lyndon Johnson first came to this body in January 1949, he was \nteased by his fellow Senators with the nickname ``Landslide Lyndon,'' \ndue to his victory in the Texas senatorial primary election by just 87 \nvotes. Within a few years he had taken the fastest path to being \nelected a floor leader in Senate history.\n  Johnson went on to serve as both minority leader and majority leader \nduring the 8 years of the Eisenhower administration, and shaped \nlegislation dealing with the Cold War, agriculture, labor and civil \nrights.\n  Lyndon Johnson showed the same compassion and courtesy to the Texas \nrancher or the destitute living in America's deepest pockets of poverty \nas he did to the powerful and the mighty. In fact, through his \ngenerosity of spirit, he made a friend out of one special Pakistani \ncamel-cart driver.\n  Some of my colleagues who are old enough may remember that in 1961, \nas Vice President, Johnson toured the country of Pakistan and at one \npoint stopped to meet an illiterate camel-cart driver named Bashir \nAhmad.\n  Still displaying his Texan manners half a world away, the Vice \nPresident told the man, ``You all come to Washington and see us \nsometime.'' Imagine his surprise when Bashir Ahmad decided to take him \nup on his request.\n  But the quick-thinking Johnson turned his unexpected guest's visit \ninto a boon for American-Pakistani relations. He met Ahmad personally \nat the airport, to see the man at the end of his first-ever jet plane \nride.\n  Johnson treated his guest to a barbecue at the LBJ ranch in Texas, \nenabled him to step onto the floor of this U.S. Senate, and arranged \nfor his visit to the Lincoln Memorial.\n  He even brought together the camel-cart driver and the former U.S. \nPresident, Harry Truman, who was so taken with Ahmad's eloquence that \nhe referred to the Pakistani visitor as ``His Excellency.''\n  The final Johnson touch came just as Bashir Ahmad was about to board \nhis plane for the ride home back to Pakistan. He opened a telegram from \nthe Vice President which read: ``Since your return to Pakistan takes \nyou so close to Mecca, arrangements have been made . . . for you to \nvisit there.''\n  This was just one example of many of the canny Texan's consummate \npolitical skills.\n  Now just like Bashir Ahmad, I had the honor of being in Lyndon \nJohnson's presence once, and for a very momentous occasion. In August \n1965, I came here, to our Nation's Capitol, to visit Senator John \nSherman Cooper.\n  In 1964, after receiving my undergraduate degree from the University \nof Louisville, I worked as an intern for Senator Cooper and watched up \nclose as he applied his wisdom and experience to the issues that \ngripped Kentucky and the Nation in the 1960s.\n  After completing my first year in law school, I came back to \nWashington to visit the Senator who had become my mentor and friend.\n  I was waiting to see Senator Cooper in his outer office when suddenly \nhe emerged and motioned for me to follow him. We walked together from \nhis office in Russell 125 to the Capitol Rotunda, where I saw more \npeople, and more security, than I had ever seen before.\n  Then Senator Cooper told me what was happening: President Johnson was \nabout to sign the Voting Rights Act, an act that was the culmination of \nLyndon Johnson's years of effort in support of civil rights that had \nbegun when he still served in the Senate.\n  Soon enough, the President emerged. Every good biography of President \nJohnson describes him as a larger- than-life man, with an imposing \nphysical presence. Let me testify right now, from personal experience, \nthat they are correct.\n  President Johnson seemed to tower a head taller than anyone else in \nthe room. He was a commanding figure that immediately filled the \nRotunda.\n  A journalist once described a typical Lyndon Johnson entrance as \n``the Western movie barging into the room''--it's hard to put it better \nthan that.\n  I was overwhelmed to witness such a moment in history. As he was \nabout to sign the legislation that he would later point to as his \ngreatest accomplishment, President Johnson said, ``Today is a triumph \nfor freedom as huge as any\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\nvictory that has ever been won on any battlefield.''\n  Although I am sure that if my good friend Phil Gramm, the former \nSenator from LBJ's own Lone Star State, were here, he would add one \nmore honor that ranked above all the rest: Lyndon Baines Johnson, \nTexan.\n  Today this U.S. Senate recognizes the legacy of Lyndon Baines Johnson \nand his many achievements. I join with my colleagues today in asking \nall Americans to celebrate the Lyndon B. Johnson Centennial.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the opening pages of his acclaimed \nbiography, ``Master of the Senate,'' Robert Caro describes Lyndon \nJohnson in his prime, as majority leader. He recalls how LBJ would come \nbarreling through those swinging double doors in the Democratic \ncloakroom and stride out onto this floor--all 6-feet 4-inches of him--\nlooking for that last vote he needed to carry his cause. He was, Caro \nsaid, like a force of nature.\n  As the Democratic whip, I have the privilege of occupying an office \nin this building that LBJ used when he was majority leader of the \nSenate. This afternoon, I had the privilege of meeting in that office \nwith a longtime assistant of LBJ's, Ashton Gonella.\n  Mrs. Gonella regaled my staff and about how the office was arranged \nthen, and what it was like to work for Lyndon Johnson.\n  She said that her desk was located in an outer office, just outside \nLBJ's office. At 5 o'clock each evening is when the real negotiating \nbegan, she said.\n  Part of her job was to spot a Senator as he walked down the hall, \nheaded for an appointment with LBJ, and have that Senator's favorite \ndrink mixed and ready for him by the time he reached her desk. The \nSenator would then walk in to see the majority leader and together, \nthey would see if they couldn't find some way to reach an honorable \ncompromise on the issue at hand.\n  Those were different days in the Senate. If you come to my office \ntoday, the strongest drink you are likely to be offered is a cup of \ncoffee or a soda.\n  I tell that story about LBJ partly to illustrate a point: When it \ncomes to negotiating compromises and finding that lost vote needed to \npass a bill, few Senators in the history of this institution have ever \ncome close to Lyndon Johnson.\n  Stiff drinks were only one of the many means he employed.\n  There is a famous series of photographs taken by a New York Times \nphotographer. It shows LBJ as majority leader, trying to persuade \nSenator Theodore Francis Green of Rhode Island to see things LBJ's way. \nThe photos depict what journalists used to call ``the full Johnson \ntreatment.''\n  That experience was probably best described by the journalists Bob \nNovak and Rowland Evans in their book, ``Lyndon Johnson: The Exercise \nof Power.'' As they put it:\n\n       The Treatment could last 10 minutes or four hours . . . Its \n     tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, \n     scorn, tears, complaint, the hint of threat. It was all of \n     these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its \n     velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction . \n     . . He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his \n     target . . . his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows \n     rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, \n     statistics. Mimicry, humor and the genius of analogy made the \n     Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the \n     target stunned and helpless.\n\n  Almost always, the ``treatment'' succeeded.\n  He was a master of political power and persuasion. He knew how to \naccumulate power. More importantly, he knew how to use his political \npower to make government work. He believed that one of the purposes of \ngovernment was to try to make America better and more just.\n  When he was 21 years old, Lyndon Johnson had an experience that had a \nprofound and lasting effect on him. He was studying at Southwest Texas \nState Teachers College and he took a year off to teach poor Latino \nchildren in the little town of Cotulla, TX, near the Mexican border.\n  Nearly 40 years later, President Johnson spoke of those children and \nthe impact they had on him. Proposing the Voting Rights Act to a joint \nsession of Congress, then-President Johnson said, ``Somehow, you never \nforget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the \nhopeful face of a young child.''\n  He added:\n\n       I never thought then, in 1928, that I would be standing \n     here in 1965. It never even occurred to me in my fondest \n     dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and \n     daughters of those students and to help people like them all \n     over this country. But now I have that chance--and I'll let \n     you in on a secret--I mean to use it.\n\n  When he was told that his support for the Voting Rights Act might \ncause problems for his Administration, LBJ reportedly replied: Well, \nwhat the heck's the presidency for? Only he used a different word than \n``heck.''\n  As a Senator and as President, Lyndon Baines Johnson used what power \nhe had to help give our Nation some of the most important legislation \nof the second-half of the 20th century--including the Civil Rights Act \nof 1957--the first civil rights bill in nearly a century--the landmark \nCivil Rights Act of 1965, the Voting Rights Act, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, the Fair Housing Act--the list goes on and on.\n  He was not perfect, by any means. But he helped move America forward \nin many important ways.\n  Another phrase that Lyndon Johnson used often was a passage from the \nBook of Isaiah. It has been a favorite passage of his father's. ``Come, \nlet us reason together.''\n  He believed that in a democracy, people could usually find an \nhonorable compromise if they would just talk to each other and ``reason \ntogether.''\n  In this year of the centennial of his birth, our Nation would be well \nserved if we would all take that lesson to heart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one of the \nmost significant Presidents of the 20th century, Lyndon Baines Johnson. \nOf course, I am especially proud that he is a Texan, my home State, and \nwas the first President to be elected from Texas.\n  This is the 100th anniversary year of the birth of President Johnson. \nWe all know, during his 6 years as President, he was a passionate \nadvocate for equal rights and expanded opportunities for all Americans.\n  I did not know President Johnson personally because I was a freshman \nmember, very new member of the Texas legislature, when he died in 1973.\n  But the gracious family, Lady Bird Johnson, that ever wonderful \nhospitable wife whom we all loved, wanted to make sure all the \nlegislators in Texas were invited to his funeral. So I was able to \nattend at the Texas ranch, which of course was a beautiful tribute to \nhis life in the place he loved the most.\n  Though I did not know him, I will certainly say that since I came to \nthe Senate, I have heard story after story after story about his \nservice in this body. The book about his life, called ``Master of the \nSenate,'' is considered required reading for all of us here.\n  Because, in fact, he was a master of this Senate. He did things as \nmajority leader that had never been done before. I have been privileged \nto know his wonderful wife Lady Bird Johnson, who is one of our most \nloved First Ladies in the history of our country.\n  Lady Bird died last year, as was mentioned before. She, in her own \nlight, left a legacy. He worked with her on many of the things she did. \nThe beautification efforts Lady Bird contributed to our country are a \npart of the overall LBJ legacy. Of course, Head Start, which is one of \nthe major accomplishments of the LBJ administration, giving every child \nthat head start before they enter the first grade so there would be a \nmore level playing field, was also a Lady Bird Johnson initiative.\n  They worked together to make sure the children of our country had \nthat opportunity. I wish to talk a little bit more about that in a few \nminutes. But I do wish to mention two of the people I now consider \namong my real friends, Linda and Luci.\n  Linda and I went to the University of Texas together. We became \nfriends there. She is a wonderful person. I have become friends with \nLuci as I have worked for the LBJ Library.\n  I will never forget, as long as I live, that I was in Austin and was \npromoting giving blood for one of the disasters,\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\nand they needed more blood at the blood bank. I heard on the radio that \nLuci Johnson had gone to give blood after she heard I was there and \npromoting the giving of blood. That is the kind of person she is.\n  She and Linda truly carry on the legacy of their mother, Lady Bird \nwho was a gracious, thoughtful, wonderful person.\n  Linda and Luci take after their mother, and, of course, the President \nwhom we all appreciated so much for the leadership he gave. They had a \nwonderful partnership, where they filled in for what the other did not \nhave.\n  Lyndon Johnson was born in Stonewall, TX, in 1908. After graduating \nfrom high school and spending a year as an elevator operator, he began \nhis career in the field of education.\n  In 1927, he borrowed $75 and started attending Southwest Texas State \nTeachers College in San Marcos, which today is Texas State University. \nAfter graduating in 1930, he devoted a year to teaching Hispanic \nchildren at the Welhausen School in Cotulla, which is 90 miles south of \nSan Antonio.\n  Decades later, when he was in the White House, President Johnson \nreminisced:\n\n  I shall never forget the faces of the boys and girls in that little \nWelhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing \nand knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of \nthose children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that \nI made up his mind, that this Nation could never rest while the door to \nknowledge remained closed to any American.\n\n  Lyndon Johnson never did rest. After serving as a teacher and \nprincipal in 1935, he was appointed head of the Texas National Youth \nAdministration. Then 2 years later, he ran for, and won, a seat in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently reelected to the \nHouse in every election until 1948 when he was elected to the Senate. \nHe later went on the ticket with President John Kennedy. It was on \nNovember 22, 1963, that fateful day that none of us will ever forget, \nthat Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States. \nDuring his Presidency, Lyndon Johnson moved aggressively to confront \nthe problems that plagued America, especially the extraordinary \nchallenge that had vexed our country since its very beginning, the \nchallenge of racism.\n  In 1964, Lyndon Johnson used his formidable legislative skills, honed \nfrom his days right here in this Chamber as majority leader, to pass \nthe Civil Rights Act. Then, in 1965, he pushed Congress to pass the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  The Civil Rights Act was the culmination of a decade-long civil \nrights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But in a real sense, \nit was the fulfillment of a two-century struggle to give life to the \nwords in our Declaration of Independence, ``that all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable \nrights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.''\n  During his term in office, President Johnson also embarked on a war \non poverty, creating government programs such as food stamps, the Job \nCorps, the Community Action Program, and Vista, among others. The war \non poverty was a part of a larger initiative that President Johnson \ncalled the Great Society. One of the most important aspects of the \nGreat Society was improving American education. President Johnson \nbelieved that every American needed a solid public education to turn \nthe aspirations of the Great Society into reality. In his words:\n\n  We must open the doors of opportunity, but we must also equip our \npeople to walk through those doors.\n\n  From 1963 to 1969, President Johnson signed over 60 education bills, \nincluding a pair of landmark achievements: the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and the Higher Education Act. He also launched Project \nHead Start. In a very real sense, he was America's first education \nPresident.\n  As President, Lyndon Johnson opened the doors of opportunity for \nmillions of Americans, but he would be the first to acknowledge that we \nstill have a long way to go. As a former teacher, he knew how important \neducation was to the competitiveness of our country. Because of his \nachievements in the field of education, I worked with all of my \ncolleagues to pass a bill last year naming the Department of Education \nheadquarters after President Johnson. This is the only building in the \nDistrict of Columbia that bears the name of our 36th President. While \nattending the naming ceremony last year, I couldn't help but think of \nLyndon and Lady Bird Johnson looking down on us and smiling with pride.\n  I want to also mention something that my colleague, Senator Bill \nNelson, mentioned because another of his legacies, of course, is NASA. \nWe all remember when President Kennedy renewed our space initiative, \nbut it was President Johnson who took that initiative--the wonderful \nwords we all remember of President Kennedy, that we would put a man on \nthe Moon--and implemented that vision and made sure that we had the \nwherewithal to do it. We needed the money. We needed to encourage \nscientists to propel us into space and put us eventually on the Moon. \nIt was President Johnson, and we now have the Johnson Space Center near \nHouston, Texas, where we still remember the words: Houston, the Eagle \nhas landed. When we did land on the Moon, it was the first words back \nto the Johnson Space Center that people heard Neil Armstrong say on \nthat wonderful day.\n  As a Texan and an American, I am certainly proud of the achievements \nof President Lyndon Johnson. In his farewell speech, President Johnson \nsaid:\n\n  I hope it may be said, a hundred years from now, that by working \ntogether we helped make our country more just, more just for all its \npeople, as well as to ensure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for \nall of our posterity.\n\n  It has been almost 40 years since that speech and 100 years since his \nbirth. Looking back, I think we can safely say that our country is more \njust, and it is more prosperous, thanks in part to the leadership of \nPresident Johnson.\n  On this LBJ day in our Nation's Capital, let's remember a man who \nhelped our country reach the promise of her founding document and gave \nus a vision of a better America that even now is worthy of our \ncommitment. I am a cosponsor of the resolution honoring President \nJohnson's service and his positive legacy for our country.\n  I am pleased to note that in the gallery we have the President's \nfamily, and we have the President's extended family. He always \nconsidered the Members of his Cabinet, the members of his staff, his \nextended family. We have the people who are carrying on his legacy, the \npeople who run the LBJ library and the LBJ school, which is such an \nimportant part of my alma mater, the University of Texas. It is such a \nwonderful place for students to come and learn about his era in office, \npublic service. We are in the process of expanding and renovating the \nlibrary, making sure the library stays the wonderful edifice that it \nis, with all of the wonderful artifacts in it. There will be a plaza \ncalled the Lady Bird Johnson Plaza that will also celebrate the \nbeautification she gave to our country right there on the campus of the \nUniversity of Texas. The people who are keeping that legacy alive are \nalso with us today. The LBJ ranch that he loved so much, where he and \nMrs. Johnson are buried, is also now a park. It is a State park and a \nnational park where people can come and have the freedom to roam. They \nwill be able to walk on trails. They will be able to see a great part \nof the State that I love so much and he loved so much. The fact that we \nare preserving that as a park will be one more way to show the love \nthat he and Lady Bird Johnson had for our country.\n  This is a great day for us in the Capitol. I am proud to be a part of \nthe resolution honoring this wonderful family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today to \nhonor one of Texas' most famous leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson. \nThis year will mark the 100th anniversary of his birth, and the LBJ \nFoundation has chosen this week to honor his service to America in \nWashington, DC.\n  Texas has a rich history of men and women--often from humble \nbeginnings--who work to accomplish great things. Lyndon Johnson was no \nexception. Johnson was born near Stonewall,\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nTX, nearly 100 years ago, to Texas legislator and poor farmer Samuel \nJohnson, Jr., and Rebekah Baines.\n  Johnson was a natural public servant. In his early days he studied at \nthen Southwest Texas University's teaching college. One of his first \nteaching jobs was at a small school in Cotulla Texas for Mexican-\nAmerican children. His work with those students would forever shape his \ndedication to those in need.\n  ``[They] had so little and needed so much,'' he once remarked. ``I \nwas determined to spark something inside them, to fill their souls with \nambition and interest and belief in the future.'' This eagerness to \nhelp others would be a noble and defining characteristic of Lyndon B. \nJohnson.\n  While he spent time teaching at several schools across Texas, it was \nnot long before Lyndon Johnson took his first foray into public \npolitics.\n  Johnson quickly worked his way through the Texas State Legislature \nand into the U.S. House of Representatives, and eventually into the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The seat he took, I should note, is the same seat once held by \nanother very famous Texan, Sam Houston. That same seat now carries a \nlong and honored lineage, and it is my privilege to now serve in this \nesteemed seat.\n  Early on, Senator Johnson made a name for himself as a man of action, \nwho would work across the aisle to pass important legislation, and who \nheld an incredible power of persuasion. He quickly became majority \nwhip, and eventually majority leader of the Senate.\n  I know that one of his greatest accomplishments in the U.S. Senate \nwas the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957--a landmark bill to \nhelp ensure the right of all people to vote. Of course, Johnson's \nlegacy as a staunch defender of civil rights would not end there.\n  Of course, Lyndon Johnson's presidency would come in the wake of \nnational tragedy. Despite the conditions under which he took office, \nPresident Johnson helped console a nation in mourning, and ensure that \nAmerica would recover--both physically and emotionally.\n  President Johnson continued the same fervent defense of Civil Rights \nin America that he had begun early in his life. He helped enact the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, and the famous Voting Rights Act.\n  At the same time, Johnson worked tirelessly to ensure a better \neducation for all American children, and was a key proponent of NASA \nand the space race.\n  Despite the turbulent times under which he served this country, \nPresident Johnson did his best to unite our country and promote a \nfreer, more equal society. He will long be remembered for his great \nadvances for the sciences, education, and civil rights--to name just a \nfew accomplishments.\n  It is my pleasure to stand today and honor President Johnson for his \nservice, not only to Texas, but to our Nation as a whole. In his \nservice to our country he never forgot the many Texas values with which \nhe was raised, and as such he and his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, became \niconic figures in Texas History.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this year we celebrate the centennial of \nthe birth of a man who dedicated his life to the proposition that all \nof us are created equal. A legislator, a president of the Senate, a \nPresident of the United States: Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  It wasn't just that Lyndon Johnson was one of the first Presidents to \ncare deeply about the well-being of people of color. It was that he was \nuniquely capable of turning that desire to help into results.\n  It is almost impossible to overstate the impact of the legislation he \npushed through Congress, impossible to overstate how much better off we \nare as a nation thanks to his heroic efforts to guarantee civil rights \nvoting rights and educational opportunity for all.\n  Whatever else people will note about Johnson's life, whatever \ndisagreements anyone had with him, whatever brush historians will use \nto paint him, there is no one who can convincingly cast doubt on his \nvery real devotion to the interests of the less fortunate.\n  In 1928, Johnson took time off from teacher's college to teach at a \nsmall school for young Mexican Americans in Cotulla, TX. Right before \nhe signed the Higher Education Act in 1965, Johnson thought back on his \ntime in the classroom.\n  He said:\n\n       I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in \n     that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet \n     the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was \n     closed to practically every one of those children because \n     they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my \n     mind that this nation could never rest while the door to \n     knowledge remained closed to any American.\n\n  I was 11-years old when he spoke those words. Seven years later, when \nit was time for a Latino kid from a working-class family to go to \ncollege, I could do it, because of educational assistance from the \nfederal government, assistance Johnson had championed.\n  Because of him, I could go on to law school. Because of him, I felt \nthat no door in public service could legitimately be closed to me. It \nis a powerful truth, and it is very clear: I would not be standing here \ntoday if it weren't for Lyndon Johnson.\n  If he were still standing here today himself, still a U.S. Senator, \nit is hard to believe there would be an atmosphere of \nhyperpartisanship. It is hard to believe that he would allow compassion \nto lose out to suspicion in guiding the business of our Nation.\n  If only he could be with us today, each time we are on the verge of a \ncrucial vote that will test our conscience, if only all Senators could \nsee Johnson's figure towering over them, feel his hand on their lapel, \nhear his voice in their ear, pushing the legislative process toward a \njust conclusion.\n  So as we remember his life this year, there is no better time to \nrededicate ourselves to the greatest of the principles for which he \nlived.\n  There is no better time to make sure that when we sit in the \npresiding chair, we swing the gavel for justice; that when we speak, we \nraise our voices for equality; that when we vote, we vote for \ncompassion for fellow human beings regardless of the color of their \nskin, the language that they speak, or the country in which they were \nborn.\n  Even in his absence, let us remember his conscience. Let us allow his \nmemory to shame the shadows of bigotry out of this Chamber. And let us \nfill our hearts with his spirit, so in our Nation, the spirit of \nprogress will endure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in 1960, when I was a young Member of the \nUnited States House of Representatives, I had the high privilege and \nthe great honor of seconding the nomination of Lyndon Baines Johnson \nfor President of the United States at the Democratic National \nConvention in Los Angeles. But, as we all know, Senator John F. Kennedy \nwas nominated. However, before the convention adjourned, Senator \nJohnson was selected as Senator Kennedy's running mate. In November of \nthat year, the Kennedy-Johnson team prevailed by a very close margin. \nBut in 1963, the tragedy of Dallas brought this winning combination to \nan abrupt and sad halt.\n  Lyndon Johnson succeeded President Kennedy, but it was sadly clear to \nall of Lyndon Johnson's friends that this was not the way he wanted to \nbecome President. Nonetheless, Lyndon Johnson assumed the awesome \nresponsibilities of the Presidency and carried forward the unfinished \nwork of President Kennedy.\n  A year after the assassination, Lyndon Johnson guided the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 into becoming our Nation's landmark law on civil \nrights. It was a great step forward in the rights of men and women. It \nwas also a great step forward for our Nation. But Lyndon Johnson did \nnot stop. In 1965, he secured passage of the Voting Rights Act, opening \npolling places to all African Americans in the South. Two years later, \nhe nominated the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court. \nHis nominee, Thurgood Marshall, became recognized as one of the High \nCourt's finest Justices. In fact, it was Lyndon Johnson who, during the \n11-year period from 1957 to 1968, was behind the first five civil \nrights laws in our history, either as author or chief architect or \nprimary sponsor.\n  For a southerner like Lyndon Johnson, taking such a leading role on \ncivil rights took a special sort of courage. Yet he knew he was doing \nthe right thing. He transformed the Emancipation Proclamation of more \nthan 100\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\nyears ago into becoming a reality. Civil rights was one of the building \nblocks that President Johnson envisioned for the Great Society of \nAmerica. His Great Society Program, which the Congress embraced, \nprovided greater support for education, especially of poor children. \nFrom 1963 to 1968, Congress followed his lead and enacted more than 40 \nmajor laws to foster education. He also supported the arts and \nhumanities by establishing the national endowments.\n  His Great Society declared war on poverty. He aided millions of older \nAmericans with passage of the 1965 Medicare amendment through the \nSocial Security Act. He also championed older Americans with the \npassage of legislation in 1967 against age discrimination in the \nworkplace.\n  As President, Lyndon Johnson also worked for peace and the survival \nof mankind. In 1967, he secured the ban on atomic weapons in space, and \nthis is the universal law at the moment. The following year, the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed, and it still stands. \nUnfortunately, Lyndon Johnson did not seek reelection in 1968 because \nof the war in Vietnam. But his legacy of leadership in both the Senate \nand the White House continues to this day.\n  The man from Texas will always loom large in the history of the \nUnited States. For me, it was a most special privilege and a great \nhonor to have known and worked with Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I first came to the Senate in 1967 as a \nyoung aide to Senator Howard Baker and was here during the last two \nyears of the Johnson Presidency. So, I heard firsthand stories about \nLyndon Johnson, the Senator, and his larger-than-life, in-your-face \npersonality with other Senators. I felt, in the elections of 1966 and \n1968--which were my first in politics--how his support for civil rights \nlegislation had made him a controversial President. I felt, also, at my \nage, the agony of the war in Vietnam. And I watched, with surprise, on \ntelevision in 1968 when he said he would not run for another term in \nthe Presidency.\n  Now, today, 40 years later, I see him as I think most Americans \nclearly see him: as one of our most consequential Presidents and public \nfigures.\n  Every January or February, my youngest son and I go to Cotulla, TX. \nSenator Hutchison spoke of Cotulla, TX as the place where Lyndon \nJohnson taught in the elementary grades. I never cease to go to \nCotulla, TX without thinking of what a remarkable comment it is upon \nour country to think that a graduate of San Marcos State could go to \nCotulla, TX, and be teaching in an elementary school, and then 13 years \nlater be in the Senate and on his way to being the Minority leader, the \nMajority leader, the Vice President, and then President of the United \nStates.\n  There are many examples of how in our country anything is possible. I \nknow of no better example than the life of Lyndon Johnson.\n  Others will say more about President Johnson and his contribution to \nthe Senate and to our country, but today I want to say a few words \nabout his family. My contemporaries were the Johnson children, Luci and \nLynda, and especially Lynda and Chuck Robb. Chuck was Governor of \nVirginia when I was Governor of Tennessee. We have known each other \nwell since that time.\n  I saw their daughter, Jennifer, this morning, and I can remember when \nshe had our youngest son Will in a headlock one time at a Governors \nConference. I can remember learning, either from Lynda or perhaps it \nwas from Luci, lessons about how children--and the Presiding Officer \nwill appreciate this, especially since his father was a distinguished \nGovernor of Pennsylvania--about how to grow up in a family where your \nparents are public officials, as Senators or Governors or even \nPresidents, in their case.\n  One of the Johnson girls told me she did not like very much going to \npolitical events--our children were much the same--until one day their \nfather, President Johnson, said: Let me make a suggestion to you. I \nwant you to find one interesting thing about three people at the event \nyou go to, and then come back to me afterwards and tell me what you \nfound out. Lynda told me that changed the way she thought about going \nto those events. It gave her a way to go to them and make them more \ninteresting. I told all of our children that, and they did it as well. \nIt was good advice for children of parents in public life.\n  But in speaking of the family, I want to especially speak of Mrs. \nJohnson, Lady Bird, and her contribution to preserving the natural \nbeauty of America.\n  Mrs. Johnson convened the first White House Conference on Natural \nBeauty, saying:\n\n       Surely a civilization that can send a man to the moon can \n     also find ways to maintain a clean and pleasant earth.\n\n  She became the de facto leader of the scenic conservation movement. \nShe raised our consciousness about the natural world in our lives. It \nis fair to say she is probably the most influential conservationist in \nAmerica since Teddy Roosevelt.\n  When I visit my wife's home in the State of Texas in the spring, \nthere are bluebonnets everywhere. Texans are immensely proud of those \nflowers. In Austin--and Luci Baines reminded me today it is still going \nstronger than ever--is the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.\n  Many States copied Texas' idea of planting wildflowers in the \ninterstate medians. Lady Bird and Lyndon passed the Highway \nBeautification Act to free us from highway billboard blight and rampant \nugliness.\n  With her encouragement, President Johnson also persuaded Congress to \npass the Wilderness Act, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, and \nthe Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. She became the first woman to serve on \nthe National Geographic Society's board of trustees.\n  President Johnson used to joke about how he would turn around and \nthere would be Laurence Rockefeller and Lady Bird in the East Room of \nthe White House cooking up some new conservation agenda for him to pass \nin the Congress.\n  Her legacy of natural beauty is secure, but because she is now gone, \nAmerica's legacy of natural beauty is not so secure. We seem to have \nforgotten how much natural beauty is an essential part of our national \ncharacter. Someone once said: Egypt has its Pyramids, Italy its Art, \nand our country the Great American Outdoors. Or, to put it less \ngrandly, when I am at home in Tennessee, I see the streets named Scenic \nDrive and Blue Bird Lane, and I read the real estate ads describing the \nbeautiful mountain views. And, if you ask Tennesseans why they live in \nTennessee, even the most grizzled will say: Because there is not a more \nbeautiful place in the world.\n  Many Americans feel that way about our hometowns. After Lady Bird, \nthere have come a number of stronger and more outstanding environmental \norganizations devoted to clean air, clean water, and climate change, \nand more recently, other conservation causes. But most of them seem to \nhave diminished interest in scenic beauty.\n  There was recently on the Senate floor an effort that nearly \nsucceeded to gut Lady Bird's Highway Beautification Act. It would have \nallowed hundreds of illegal billboards to become legal. There has been \nalmost no organized outcry about the profusion of thousands of cell \ntowers along the same interstates and in the same communities that Lady \nBird sought to protect from junkyards and billboards. These cell towers \nhave replaced almost every available scenic view in America with a tall \ntower, usually ugly, always with blinking lights. And, most of it is \nunnecessary because they could have been co-located, or be smaller, or \nthey could have been put below the ridge tops, or even camouflaged. And \nwe still could have had access to our cell phones and our blackberries. \nThe National Park Service even erected a cell tower in clear view of \nOld Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.\n\n  In our enthusiasm to deal with climate change, we are spending \nbillions of dollars to encourage Americans to erect thousands of giant \nwind turbines that are twice as tall as football stadiums and can be \nseen for 20 miles, without thinking to pass legislation that would keep \nthem away from our most scenic views, beaches, and mountaintops.\n  If Ansel Adams were alive today, he would probably be distraught \nbecause\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nhe would have fewer and fewer beautiful places in America at which to \naim his camera.\n  Lady Bird left America a legacy that honors an essential aspect of \nthe American character, one that today is, unfortunately, too often \nignored. If it continues to be ignored, it will never be undone. It is \nalmost impossible to unclutter a highway or renew a view scape once \nthat has been obliterated by ugliness.\n  So, I would hope that one result of this commemoration of Lyndon \nJohnson's birthday would be to encourage someone among us--or more \namong us--to revive in us Lady Bird's passion for the natural beauty of \nAmerica, to encourage once again the planting of wildflowers, to \npreserve the view scapes, and to remind American communities of how \nsatisfying it can be to live in one of the most beautiful places in the \nworld.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Lyndon Johnson has always been a personal \nhero to me. Every time I find myself in Austin, TX, I make a visit to \nthe LBJ Library. Only for me, it is not a trip, it is more of a \npilgrimage. I have been to that library so many times I think I could \nconduct a blindfolded tour by now.\n  I was just there a couple months ago. My favorite place in that \nlibrary, of course, is the Great Society Room, with the plaques on the \nwall listing the incredible array of legislation and programs that \nLyndon Johnson passed into law. You go down it and you read them all: \nthe Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Job Corps, VISTA, Upward \nBound, the Food Stamp Program, legal services for the poor, the \nCommunity Action Program, Community Health Centers, Head Start, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, the Higher Education Act, \nMedicare, Medicaid, the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, \npublic broadcasting, the National Mass Transportation Act, the \nCigarette Labeling Act, the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act--Mr. \nPresident, it takes your breath away when you look at what this one \nperson, with a Congress, was able to accomplish.\n  So, Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the \n``failure'' of the Great Society. Yes, the ``failure'' of the Great \nSociety. At least that is what I have been hearing ever since I first \nstarted running for office in 1972 and 1974, coming to the House, and \nthen to the Senate. All those years I have heard from most of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle and the conservatives what a \ngreat ``failure'' the Great Society was. In fact, this supposed \n``failure'' has become an article of faith among conservatives.\n  As President Reagan said on May 9, 1983:\n\n       The great expansion of government programs that took place \n     under the aegis of the Great Society coincided with an end to \n     economic progress for America's poor people.\n\n  So I thought I would come to the floor today to discuss the \n``failures'' of the Great Society. Well, I wonder where to start. But I \nsuppose a good place to start is with the great Civil Rights Act of \n1964.\n  Think about it. Prior to that act, African Americans faced brazen \ndiscrimination and segregation--the American version of apartheid. In \nmany parts of our country, African Americans could not eat in the same \nrestaurants or at the same lunch counters as Whites. They could not use \nthe same bathrooms, the same swimming pools, the same water fountains, \nthe same motels, the same hotels. They literally were consigned, as we \nknow, to the back of the bus.\n  Well, because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Lyndon Johnson's \nchampionship of it, those Jim Crow laws and practices were ended in the \nUnited States of America. It became illegal to discriminate based on \nrace, color, religion, gender, or national origin. Now we take it for \ngranted that people of color, different nationalities, different \nreligions are seen in our parks and playgrounds, our libraries, our \nswimming pools, our sports arenas, our motels and hotels, but it was \nnot so long ago that this was not so. Hardly a ``failure.''\n  Another ``failure'' of the Great Society, of course, the Medicare \nProgram. Let's take a look at that. At the bill signing ceremony on \nJuly 30, 1965, President Johnson enrolled former President Harry Truman \nas the first Medicare beneficiary and presented him with the first \nMedicare card.\n  We always talk about life after age 65 as the ``golden years.'' For \nmany, prior to Medicare, life at 65 used to be the ``nightmare \nyears''--with tens of millions of Americans unable to even afford basic \nmedical care, condemned to living out their senior years in the misery \nof untreated or poorly treated illnesses or diseases.\n  Here, Mr. President, I want to get personal. See, my father, Patrick \nHarkin, was 54 years old when I was born. My father had an eighth grade \neducation. Most of it he spent as a coal miner. Now, most people don't \nthink there are coal mines outside of Pennsylvania or West Virginia, \nbut Iowa at one time was the second largest coal-producing State in the \nNation. Young kids who didn't go to school went to the coal mines. So \nmy father worked for the greater part of more than 20 years in the coal \nmines. Later on in life, he suffered what they called then the miner's \ncough, which we now know is black lung disease.\n\n  My mother died when I was 10. My father was just about 65, and he had \npaid enough in, in the 1940s, to qualify for Social Security. So he had \nSocial Security. He had three kids under the age of 18 and no money. He \nlived in this little two-bedroom house out in the middle of smalltown \nIowa. But we had Social Security that kept us together. But I can \nremember it was like clockwork: Every year, every winter, my father \nwould get sick. He had this miner's cough, and usually in the winter it \nwould get worse and he would come down with pneumonia or something like \nthat. Since we didn't have a car, one of my cousins or someone--and my \nfather did not want to go to the hospital because we didn't have any \nmoney. He wouldn't see a doctor because we didn't have money. So one of \nmy cousins or somebody would come over, and he would finally get so \nsick he couldn't stand it, and they would rush him to Mercy Hospital in \nDes Moines. Thank God for the sisters of mercy at Mercy Hospital. They \nwould nurse him back to health, get him OK, send him back home. This \nhappened like clockwork every winter. My father was always bothered by \nit. He was proud. He didn't like to accept charity. Heck, if left to \nhis own devices, he probably would have died a long time before then \nbecause he just wouldn't have accepted that kind of medical care.\n  I can remember coming home on leave from the Navy for Christmas 1965. \nNow, I hadn't been paying too much attention--I was just trying to keep \nalive, so I wasn't paying too much attention to legislation and things \nsuch as that. I didn't mark the passage of the Medicare bill. I didn't \nknow it even happened. As I said, I was just in the military doing my \nthing. But I can remember coming home on that Christmas break and \nseeing my dad, and he showed me his Medicare card. Now he could get \nmedical care. He could go to the doctor. He could go and get taken care \nof before he got so sick he had to go to the hospital every time. You \ncan't imagine what this was like for him. You see, he felt he had \nearned this through a lifetime of hard work, working for our country, \nraising a family. This was not charity. He had earned this. It was part \nof his Social Security.\n  So when someone tells me about Medicare, part of the ``failures'' of \na great society--hardly a ``failure.'' I wonder why there aren't more \npeople out here rushing to introduce bills to repeal it if it is such a \ngreat ``failure.'' It has saved so many people in our country, such as \nmy father, who lived out the remainder of his years in a little bit \nbetter health because of Medicare. So it is very personal with me.\n  Another ``failure'' of the Great Society was the Higher Education \nAct. In 1965, it was rare for young people from disadvantaged and low-\nincome backgrounds to go to college. The only way I got there is I had \nan NROTC scholarship because of the Navy. That was the only way I was \nable to go to college. So President Johnson passed the Higher Education \nAct, creating work-study programs, loans with reduced interest rates, \nscholarships, opening the door to college for tens of millions of \nAmericans to have access to the American dream--again, hardly a \n``failure''.\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\n  In August 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Food Stamp Act. \nPrior to that act, hunger was shockingly widespread in America, \nespecially in Appalachia and rural parts of our country and in our \ninner cities. Thanks to the Food Stamp Program, hunger in America is \nrare. Tens of millions of Americans--more than half of them children--\nare ensured a basic nutritional minimum thanks to this program. The \nfarm bill we just passed, with the Presiding Officer's help in getting \nit passed, expanded the Food Stamp Program. It took out some of the \nbarriers to access, so families in America can get more access for \ntheir families and their kids.\n  In the State of the Union Address in 1988, President Reagan said that \nthe Great Society ``declared war on poverty and poverty won.'' He said \nthis in the State of the Union Address. It is another Reagan myth. Look \nat the facts. Look at the data. From 1963 until 1970, during the impact \nof the Great Society programs, the number of Americans living below the \npoverty line dropped from 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent. The poverty \nrate for African Americans fell from 55 percent to 27 percent. The \npoverty rate among the elderly fell by two-thirds. This is an amazing \nsuccess.\n  What is unfortunate is that the poverty rate has not fallen \nsignificantly since 1970. Our progress has been stalled. Indeed, in the \nlast few years, the gap between the rich and the poor in this country \nhas grown dramatically. So we need a new generation of American leaders \ncommitted to reducing the gap. We need a new generation of leaders with \nLyndon Johnson's passion and commitment to fighting poverty and hunger \nand homelessness and inequality and discrimination.\n  Any fairminded observer would say that LBJ's Great Society was far \nfrom a ``failure;'' it was a monumental success. The Great Society \nprograms defined the modern United States of America as a \ncompassionate, inclusive society, a genuine opportunistic society where \neveryone can contribute their talents and abilities. The Great Society \nis very much the living legacy of our 36th President. We see the Great \nSociety today in cleaner air and water, young people from poor \nbackgrounds going to college, seniors and poor people having access to \ndecent medical care, and people of color exercising their right to vote \nand live in the neighborhood of their choice. We see the Great Society \nin Head Start, quality public schools, vocational education, college \ngrants and loans--all those rungs on the ladder that people need to \nachieve the American dream, even those from humble, hardscrabble \nbackgrounds, such as Lyndon Johnson himself or this Senator from Iowa.\n  Americans have a tendency to take for granted the achievements of the \nGreat Society. But just imagine an America without Medicare, without \nthe Civil Rights Act, without the Voting Rights Act, without title I of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, without Head Start, without \ncommunity health centers, without vocational education. I could go on \nand on. It would truly be a greatly diminished America, a less secure \nAmerica, a less just America. And without the great companionship of \nLady Bird Johnson, it would be a less beautiful America.\n  I know the Johnson family is here today, including Linda Bird, Lucy \nBaines, and their families, and many close friends and colleagues of \nPresident Johnson and members of his administration. I thank them for \nkeeping the LBJ legacy alive and not letting it become invisible.\n  Before I close, let me quote from a small part of a speech that was \ngiven by Joseph Califano just this Monday at a luncheon here in \nWashington commemorating the legacy of Lyndon Johnson. Obviously we all \nremember Joe Califano being Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare. Listen to what he said:\n\n       Of even greater danger to our Nation, by making the \n     presidency of Lyndon Johnson invisible, we lose key lessons \n     for our democracy--courage counts and government can work--\n     and it can work to the benefit of the least among us in ways \n     that enhance the well-being of all of us.\n\n  I can think of no sentence that sums up the legacy of Lyndon Baines \nJohnson better than that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full speech of \nJoseph Califano printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as every truly great leader in our \nNation's history, Lyndon Johnson brought us a giant step closer to \nachieving our highest ideals. He fought passionately for social and \neconomic justice for all Americans. He fought to put the American dream \nwithin reach of every citizen. That is the legacy we salute today. That \nis truly the success--and not the ``failure''--of the Great Society.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          Seeing Is Believing:\n\n                 The Enduring Legacy of Lyndon Johnson\n\n       (Keynote Address by Joseph A. Califano, Jr., May 19, 2008)\n\n       For many in this room, Lyndon Johnson's Centennial is a \n     time for personal memories. We remember how LBJ drove \n     himself--and many of us--to use every second of his \n     presidency. We remember his five a.m. wake-up calls asking \n     about a front page story in the New York Times--the edition \n     that had not yet been delivered to our home; his insatiable \n     appetite for a program to cure every ill he saw; his \n     insistence that every call from a member of Congress be \n     returned on the day it was received--even if it meant running \n     the member down in a barroom, bathroom or bedroom; his \n     insistence that hearings begin one day after we sent a bill \n     to Congress; his pressure to get more seniors enrolled in \n     Medicare, more blacks registered to vote, more schools \n     desegregated, more kids signed up for Head Start, more \n     Mexican-Americans taking college scholarships or loans; more \n     billboards torn down faster--for the country, and for Lady \n     Bird.\n       And we remember his signature admonition: ``Do it now. Not \n     next week. Not tomorrow. Not later today. Now.''\n       We who served him saw that Lyndon Johnson could be brave \n     and brutal, compassionate and cruel, incredibly intelligent \n     and infuriatingly stubborn. We came to know his shrewd and \n     uncanny instinct for the jugular of both allies and \n     adversaries. We learned he could be altruistic and petty, \n     caring and crude, generous and petulant, bluntly honest and \n     calculatingly devious--all within the same few minutes. We \n     saw his determination to succeed run over or around whoever \n     or whatever got in his way.\n       As allies and enemies alike slumped in exhaustion, we saw \n     how LBJ's relentless zeal produced second, third and fourth \n     bursts of energy--to mount a massive social revolution that \n     gave new hope to the disadvantaged. As he did so, he often \n     created a record that Machiavelli might not only recognize, \n     but also envy. To him, the enormous popularity of his \n     unprecedented landslide victory, and every event during his \n     presidency--triumphant or tragic--were opportunities to give \n     the most vulnerable among us a fair shot of the nation's \n     abundant blessings.\n       We saw these things. But somehow the world beyond--and even \n     the people of his own party--seem not to see.\n       Throughout this year, and last week in endorsing Barack \n     Obama, John Edwards made reducing poverty a centerpiece of \n     his presidential campaign. Yet he never mentioned Lyndon \n     Johnson, the first--and only--President ever to declare war \n     on poverty and sharply reduce it.\n       A few weeks ago in his eloquent victory speech in Raleigh, \n     North Carolina, Barack Obama followed a familiar pattern of \n     omission. In recounting the achievements of previous \n     Democratic presidents, he mentioned the pantheon of FDR, \n     Harry Truman, JFK--but not LBJ. Not Lyndon Johnson--not the \n     man who would be proudest of Barack Obama's candidacy and \n     what it says about America, the president uniquely \n     responsible for the laws that gave this man (and millions of \n     others) the opportunity to develop and display his talents \n     and gave this nation the opportunity to benefit from them.\n       Earlier in the campaign, when Hillary Clinton publicly \n     noted that ``it took a President'' to translate Martin Luther \n     King's moral protests into public laws, she broke the taboo \n     and mentioned President Johnson. The New York Times promptly \n     rebuked her in an editorial for daring to speak that name--\n     and instantly things went back to normal: Lyndon Johnson was \n     put back in his place as the invisible President of the \n     twentieth century.\n       The reason, of course, goes back to Vietnam. The tragedy of \n     Vietnam has created a dark cloud obscuring the full picture \n     of Lyndon Johnson's presidency.\n       Without downplaying in any way the tragedy of the Vietnam \n     war, I am convinced that to make Lyndon Johnson the invisible \n     President--particularly for Democrats to indulge such amnesia \n     as politically correct--is unfair not so much to him, but to \n     our nation and its future.\n       Why? Because if we make Lyndon Johnson's whole presidency \n     invisible--if we are unable or unwilling to speak his name--\n     we become less able to talk about the lasting achievements of \n     this nation's progressive tradition--a tradition that spans \n     both parties over the last century. If we are unable or \n     unwilling to see this President, we break the chain of \n     history and deny our people an understanding of the \n     remarkable resilience of\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\n     progressive tradition from Theodore Roosevelt, through \n     Woodrow Wilson. Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Harry Truman's \n     Fair Deal and John Kennedy's New Frontier, to Lyndon \n     Johnson's Great Society.\n       Of even greater danger to our nation, by making the \n     presidency of Lyndon Johnson invisible, we lose key lessons \n     for our democracy: courage counts and government can work--\n     and it can work to the benefit of the least among us in ways \n     that enhance the well-being of all of us. Think about this: \n     Americans under 40 have seen in Washington only governments \n     that were anti-government, corrupt, mired in scandal, inept, \n     gridlocked, driven by polls, favored the rich and powerful, \n     or tied in knots by Lilliputian lobbyists and partisan \n     bickering.\n       Talk to many Americans today about Washington and they're \n     likely to say: it doesn't work; it doesn't care; it doesn't \n     understand my problems; the special interests control it. \n     Tell an American that Washington can work, it can help them, \n     and they react like doubting Thomas: I won't believe it till \n     I see it.\n       That's the political reality of our skeptical times: seeing \n     is believing.\n       So as we begin our observance of this centennial in this \n     critical political year, here is the question: Do we want to \n     rekindle support for progressive ideas, for a modem \n     progressive movement? If so, if we hope to restore belief in \n     a government that serves and lifts up the many as well as the \n     few, if we want to make government work again, then we must \n     see our history more clearly and tell it more completely. We \n     must see the full vision and achievement of Lyndon Johnson's \n     presidency, the domestic revolution that he not only \n     conceived, but carried out. Failure to do so not only \n     distorts our past, it short changes our future. For there is \n     a connection between seeing and believing--and also between \n     seeing and achieving.\n       We live in an era of political micro-achievement. In recent \n     years, it is considered an accomplishment when a President \n     persuades Congress to pass one bill, or a few, over an entire \n     administration: one welfare reform; one No Child Left Behind. \n     Partisan attacks and political ambition choke our airways, \n     not reports of legislation passed or problems solved.\n       What a contrast. In those tumultuous Great Society years, \n     the President submitted, and Congress enacted, more than one \n     hundred major proposals in each of the 89th and 90th \n     Congresses. In those years of do-it-now optimism, \n     presidential speeches were about distributing prosperity more \n     fairly, reshaping the balance between the consumer and big \n     business, rebuilding entire cities, eliminating poverty, \n     hunger and discrimination in our nation. And when the \n     speeches ended, action followed, problems were \n     tackled, ameliorated and solved. This nation did reduce \n     poverty. We did broaden opportunity for college and jobs. \n     We did outlaw segregation and discrimination in housing. \n     We did guarantee the right to vote to all. We did improve \n     health and prosperity for older Americans. We did put the \n     environment on the national agenda.\n       When Lyndon Johnson took office, only eight percent of \n     Americans held college degrees; by the end of 2006, twenty-\n     eight percent had completed college. His Higher Education \n     legislation with its scholarships, grants and work-study \n     programs opened college to any American with the necessary \n     brains and ambition, however empty the family purse. Since \n     1965 the federal government has provided more than 360 \n     billion dollars to provide 166 million grants, loans and work \n     study awards to college students. Today six out of ten \n     college students receive federal financial aid under Great \n     Society programs and their progeny.\n       Below the college level, LBJ passed the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act, for the first time committing the \n     federal government to help local schools. By last year, that \n     program had infused 552 billion dollars into elementary and \n     high schools. He anticipated the needs of Hispanics and other \n     immigrants with bilingual education, which today serves four \n     million children in some 40 languages. His special education \n     law has helped millions of children with learning \n     disabilities.\n       Then there is Head Start, To date, more than 24 million \n     pre-schoolers have been through Head Start programs in nearly \n     every city and county in the nation. Head Start today serves \n     one million children a year.\n       If LBJ had not established the federal government's \n     responsibility to finance this educational surge, would we \n     have the trained human resources today to function in a \n     fiercely competitive global economy? Would we have developed \n     the technology that leads the world's computing and \n     communications revolution?\n       Seeing is believing.\n       In 1964, most elderly Americans had no health insurance. \n     Few retirement plans provided any such coverage. The poor had \n     little access to medical treatment until they were in \n     critical condition, Only wealthier Americans could get the \n     finest care, and then only by traveling to a few big cities \n     like Boston or New York.\n       Consider the changes Johnson wrought. Since 1965, some 112 \n     million Americans have been covered by Medicare; in 2006, 43 \n     million were enrolled. In 1967, Medicaid served 10 million \n     poor citizens; in 2006, it served 63 million people. The \n     program is widely regarded as the key factor in reducing \n     infant mortality by seventy-five percent--from 26 deaths for \n     each 1,000 live births when Johnson took office to less than \n     seven per 1,000 live births in 2004.\n       The Heart, Cancer and Stroke legislation has provided funds \n     to create centers of medical excellence in just about every \n     major city--from Seattle to Houston, Miami to Cleveland, \n     Atlanta to Minneapolis. To staff these centers, the Health \n     Professions Educational Assistance Act provided resources to \n     double the number of doctors graduating from medical schools \n     and increase the pool of specialists, researchers, nurses and \n     paramedics.\n       Without these programs and Great Society investments in the \n     National Institutes of Health, would our nation be the \n     world's leader in medical research? In pharmaceutical \n     invention? In creation of surgical procedures and medical \n     machinery to diagnose our diseases, breathe for us, clean our \n     blood, transplant our organs, scan our brains? In the \n     discovery of ingenious prosthetic devices that enable so many \n     of our severely wounded soldiers to function independently?\n       Seeing is believing.\n       Closely related to LBJ's Great Society health programs were \n     his initiatives to reduce malnutrition and hunger. Today, the \n     Food Stamp program helps feed some 27 million men, women and \n     children in 12 million households. The School Breakfast \n     program has served more than 30 billion breakfasts to needy \n     children.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       It is not too much to say that Lyndon Johnson's programs \n     created a stunning recasting of America's demographic \n     profile. When President Johnson took office, life expectancy \n     was 66.6 years for men and 73.1 years for women. Forty years \n     later, by 2004, life expectancy had stretched to 75 years for \n     men and 80 years for women. The jump was most dramatic among \n     poor citizens--suggesting that better nutrition and access to \n     health care have played an even larger role than medical \n     advances.\n       For almost half a century, the nation's immigration laws \n     established restrictive and discriminatory quotas that \n     favored blond and blue-eyed Western Europeans. With the \n     Immigration Reform Act of 1965, LBJ scrapped that quota \n     system and put substance behind the Statue of Liberty's \n     welcoming words, ``Give me your tired your poor, your huddled \n     masses yearning to breathe free.'' This Great Society \n     legislation refreshed our nation with the revitalizing \n     energies of immigrants from southern and Eastern Europe, \n     south of the border, Asia and Africa, converting America into \n     the most multi-cultural nation in the history of the world \n     and uniquely positioning our population for the Twenty-First \n     century world of new economic powers. In the year before \n     Immigration reform was passed, only 2,600 immigrants were \n     admitted from Africa, less than 25,000 from Asia and 105,000 \n     from Central and South America. With the lifting of the \n     quotas, in 2006, 110,000 immigrants were admitted from \n     Africa, more than 400,000 from Asia and 525,000 from Central \n     and South America. I can't see LBJ eating at an Ethiopian or \n     Sushi restaurant, but I can see him tapping into the \n     intellectual acumen, diversity and energy of this new wave of \n     immigrants.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       Lyndon Johnson put civil rights and social justice squarely \n     before the nation as a moral issue. Recalling his year as a \n     teacher of poor Mexican children in Cotulla, Texas, he once \n     told Congress, ``It never even occurred to me in my fondest \n     dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and \n     daughters of those students and to help people like them all \n     over this country. But now I do have that chance--and I'll \n     let you in on a secret--I mean to use it.''\n       And use it he did. He used it to make Washington confront \n     the needs of the nation as no president before or since has. \n     With the 1964 Civil Rights Act Johnson tore down, all at \n     once, the ``Whites only'' signs and social system that \n     featured segregated hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, \n     toilets and water fountains, and rampant job discrimination.\n       The following year he proposed the Voting Rights Act. When \n     it passed in the summer of 1965, Martin Luther King told \n     Johnson, ``You have created a second emancipation.'' The \n     President replied, ``The real hero is the American Negro.''\n       How I wish that Lyndon Johnson were alive today to see what \n     his laws have wrought--especially the Voting Rights Act that \n     he considered the most precious gem among the Great Society \n     jewels.\n       In 1964 there were 79 black elected officials in the South \n     and 300 in the entire nation. By 2001 (the latest information \n     available) there were some 10,000 elected black officials \n     across the nation, more than 6,000 of them in the South. In \n     1965 there were five black members of the House; today \n     there are 42 and the black member of the Senate is headed \n     for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       But LBJ knew that laws were not enough. Thus was born the \n     concept of affirmative action. Johnson's conviction that it \n     is essential as a matter of social justice to provide the \n     tutoring, the extra help, even the preference if necessary, \n     to those who had suffered generations of discrimination in \n     order to give them a fair chance to share in the American \n     dream.\n       LBJ set the pace personally. He appointed the first black \n     Supreme Court Justice (Thurgood Marshall), the first black \n     cabinet officer (Robert Weaver) and the first black member of \n     the Federal Reserve Board (Andrew Britmmer). He knew that if \n     executives\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\n     and institutions across the private sector saw qualified \n     blacks succeeding in positions of high responsibility, \n     barriers across America would fall--because for them, he \n     knew, seeing was believing.\n       Less known, and largely ignored, was Johnson's similar \n     campaign to place women in top government positions. The \n     tapes reveal him hectoring cabinet officers to place women in \n     top jobs. He created what one feminist researcher called in \n     her book, Women, Work and National Policy, ``An affirmative \n     action reporting system for women, surely the first of its \n     kind . . . in the White House. . . .'' LBJ proposed and \n     signed legislation to provide, for the first time, equal \n     opportunity in promotions for women in the Armed Forces. \n     Signing the bill in 1967, Johnson noted, ``The bill does not \n     create any female generals or female admirals--but it does \n     make that possible. There is no reason why we should not \n     someday have a female chief of staff or even a female \n     Commander in Chief.''\n       LBJ had his heart in his War on Poverty. Though he found \n     the opposition too strong to pass an income maintenance law, \n     he took advantage of the biggest ATM around: Social Security. \n     He proposed, and Congress enacted, whopping increases in the \n     minimum benefit. That change alone lifted 2.5 million \n     Americans 65 and over above the poverty line. Today, Social \n     Security keeps some thirteen million senior citizens above \n     the poverty line. Many scholars look at Social Security and \n     that increase. Medicare and the coverage of nursing home care \n     under Medicaid (which funds care for more than 64 percent of \n     nursing home residents) as the most significant social \n     programs of the Twentieth Century.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       Johnson's relationship with his pet project--the Office of \n     Economic Opportunity--was that of a proud father often \n     irritated by an obstreperous child- For years conservatives \n     have ranted about the OEO programs. Yet Johnson's War on \n     Poverty was founded on the most conservative principle: put \n     the power in the local community, not in Washington; give \n     people at the grassroots the ability to walk off the public \n     dole.\n       Today, as we celebrate LBJ's 100th anniversary some forty \n     years after he left office, eleven of the twelve programs \n     that OEO launched are alive, well and funded at an annual \n     rate exceeding eleven billion dollars. Head Stan, Job Corps, \n     Community Health Centers, Foster Grandparents. Upward Bound \n     (now part of the Trio Program in the Department of \n     Education), Green Thumb (now Senior Community Service \n     Employment), Indian Opportunities (now in the Labor \n     Department), and Migrant Opportunities (now Seasonal Worker \n     Training and Migrant Education) are all helping people stand \n     on their own two feet.\n       Community Action (now the Community Service Block Grant \n     program), VISTA Volunteers and Legal Services are putting \n     power in the hands of individuals--down at the grassroots. \n     The grassroots that these programs fertilize just don't \n     produce the manicured laws that conservatives prefer. Of all \n     the Great Society programs started in the Office of Economic \n     Opportunity, only the Neighborhood Youth Corps has been \n     abandoned--in 1974, after enrolling more than 5 million \n     individuals.\n       Ronald Reagan quipped that Lyndon Johnson declared war on \n     poverty and poverty won. He was wrong. When LBJ took office, \n     22.2 percent of Americans were living in poverty. When he \n     left five years later, only 13 percent were living below the \n     poverty line--the greatest one-time reduction in poverty in \n     our nation's history.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       Since Lyndon Johnson left the White House, no president has \n     been able to effect any significant reductions in poverty. In \n     2006 the poverty level stood at 12.3 percent. Hillary Clinton \n     in her presidential campaign has promised to create a cabinet \n     level poverty czar in her administration. In the \n     administration of Lyndon Baines Johnson, the President was \n     the poverty czar.\n       Theodore Roosevelt launched the modern environmental \n     movement by setting aside public lands and national parks and \n     giving voice to conservation leaders like Gifford Pinchot. If \n     Teddy Roosevelt launched the movement, Lyndon Johnson drove \n     it forward more than any later President--and in the process, \n     in 1965, he introduced an entirely new concept of \n     conservation:\n       ``We must not only protect the countryside and save it from \n     destruction;'' he said, ``we must restore what has been \n     destroyed and salvage the beauty and charm of our cities. Our \n     conservation must be not just the classic conservation of \n     protection and development, but a creative conservation of \n     restoration and innovation.''\n       That new environmental commandment spelled out the first \n     inconvenient truth: that those who reap the rewards of modem \n     technology must also pay the price of their industrial \n     pollution. It inspired a legion of Great Society laws: the \n     Clean Air, Water Quality and Clean Water Restoration Acts and \n     Amendments, the 1965 Solid Waste Disposal Act, the 1965 Motor \n     Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act, the 1968 Aircraft Noise \n     Abatement Act. It also provided the rationale for later laws \n     creating the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Superfund.\n       Johnson created 35 National Parks, 32 within easy driving \n     distance of large cities. The 1968 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act \n     today protects 165 river segments in 38 states and Puerto \n     Rico. The 1968 National Trail System Act has established more \n     than 1,000 recreation, scenic and historic trails covering \n     close to 55,000 miles. No wonder National Geographic calls \n     Lyndon Johnson ``our greatest conservation president.''\n       Seeing is believing.\n       These were major areas of concentration for Lyndon \n     Johnson's Great Society, but there were many others. Indeed, \n     looking back, the sweep of this President's achievements is \n     breathtaking.\n       Those of us who worked with Lyndon Johnson would hardly \n     consider him a patron of the arts. I can't even remember him \n     sitting through more than ten or fifteen minutes of a movie \n     in the White House theatre, much less listening to an \n     operatic aria or classical symphony.\n       Yet the historian Irving Bernstein. in his book on The \n     Presidency of Lyndon Johnson, titles a chapter. ``Lyndon \n     Johnson, Patron of the Arts.'' Think about it. What would \n     cultural life in America be like without the Kennedy Center \n     for the Performing Arts, where each year two million visitors \n     view performances that millions more watch on television, or \n     without the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden that \n     attracts 750,000 visitors annually? Both are Great Society \n     initiatives.\n       The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities are \n     fulfilling a dream Johnson expressed when he asked Congress \n     to establish them and, for the first time, to provide federal \n     financial support for the Arts to increase ``the access of \n     our people to the works of our artists, and [recognize] the \n     arts as part of the pursuit of American greatness.''\n       LBJ used to say that he wanted fine theater and music \n     available throughout the nation and not just on Broadway and \n     at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In awarding more than \n     130,000 grants totaling more than four billion dollars since \n     1965, the Endowment for the Arts has spawned art councils in \n     all 50 states and more than 1,400 professional theater \n     companies, 120 opera companies, 600 dance companies and 1,800 \n     professional orchestras. Since 1965, the Endowment for the \n     Humanities has awarded 65,000 fellowships and grants totaling \n     more than four billion dollars.\n       Johnson established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \n     to create public television and public radio which have given \n     the nation countless hours of fine arts, superb in-depth news \n     coverage, and programs like ``Sesame Street'' and \n     ``Masterpiece Theater.'' Now some say there is no need for \n     public radio and television, with so many cable channels and \n     radio stations. But as often as you surf with your TV remote \n     or twist your radio dial, you are not likely to find the kind \n     of quality broadcasting that marks the more than 350 public \n     television and nearly 700 public radio stations that the \n     Corporation for Public Broadcasting supports today. They, as \n     well as the rest of the media, have been helped by the \n     Freedom of Information Act, the Great Society's contribution \n     to greater transparency in government.\n       Seeing is believing. So is listening.\n       For urban America, LBJ drove through Congress the Urban \n     Mass Transit Act, which gave San Franciscans BART, \n     Washingtonians Metro, Atlantans MARTA, and cities across \n     America thousands of buses and modernized transit systems. \n     His 1968 Housing Act, creation of Ginnie Mae, privatization \n     of Fannie Mae and establishment of the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development have helped some 75 million families \n     gain access to affordable housing.\n       In the progressive tradition in which Theodore Roosevelt \n     and Franklin Roosevelt confronted huge financial and \n     corporate enterprises, Johnson faced a nationalization of \n     commercial power that had the potential to disadvantage the \n     individual American consumer. Super-corporations were shoving \n     aside the corner grocer, local banker, independent drug store \n     and family farmer. Automobiles were complex and dangerous, \n     manufactured by giant corporations with deep pockets to \n     protect themselves. Banks had the most sophisticated \n     accountants and lawyers to draft their loan agreements. \n     Sellers of everyday products--soaps, produce, meats, \n     appliances, clothing, cereal and canned and frozen foods--\n     packaged their products with the help of the shrewdest \n     marketers and designers. The individual was outflanked at \n     every position.\n       Seeing that mismatch, Johnson pushed through Congress a \n     bevy of laws to level the playing filed for consumers: Auto \n     and highway safety for the motorist a Department of \n     Transportation and National Transportation Safety Board; \n     truth in packaging for the housewife; truth in lending for \n     the homebuyer, small businessman and individual borrower; \n     wholesome meat and wholesome poultry laws to enhance food \n     safety; the Flammable Fabrics Act to reduce the incendiary \n     characteristics of clothing and blankets. He created the \n     Product Safety Commission to assure that toys and other \n     products would be safe for users. When he got over his \n     annoyance that it took him five minutes to find me in the \n     emergency room of George Washington University Hospital, with \n     my three year old son Joe who had swallowed a bottle of \n     aspirin, he proposed the Child Safety Act which is why we all \n     have such difficulty opening up medicine bottles.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       By the numbers the legacy of Lyndon Johnson is monumental. \n     It exceeds in domestic impact even the New Deal of his idol \n     Franklin Roosevelt. It sets him at the cutting edge of the \n     nation's progressive tradition. But there is also an \n     important story behind these programs that speaks to the \n     future--that offers the lessons of what it takes\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\n     to be an effective President. What lessons does this \n     President have for our nation and his successors, especially \n     those who value the progressive tradition?\n       First, Lyndon Johnson was a genuine, true believing \n     revolutionary.\n       His Texas constituency and the tactical constraints of his \n     earlier offices reined him in before he became President. But \n     his experiences--teaching poor Mexican American children in \n     Corolla, Texas, working as Texas director of Roosevelt's \n     National Youth Administration, witnessing the indignities \n     that his black cook, Zephyr Wright, and her husband Gene \n     Williams, suffered during his senate years when they drove \n     from Washington to Texas through the segregated south--fueled \n     his revolutionary spirit.\n       He saw racial justice as a moral issue. He refused to \n     accept pockets of poverty in the richest nation in history. \n     He saw a nation so hell bent on industrial growth and \n     amassing wealth that greed threatened to destroy its natural \n     resources. He saw cities deteriorating and municipal \n     political machines unresponsive to the early migration of \n     Hispanics and the masses of blacks moving north. To him \n     government was neither a bad man to be tarred and feathered \n     nor a bag man to collect campaign contributions. To him \n     government was not a bystander, hoping wealth and opportunity \n     might trickle down to the least among us. To LBJ, government \n     was a mighty wrench to open the fountain of opportunity so \n     that everyone could bathe in the shower of our nation's \n     blessings. He wanted his government to provide the poor with \n     the kind of education, health and social support that most of \n     us get from our parents.\n       Second, Lyndon Johnson was perpetually impatient, \n     relentlessly restless, always in a hurry.\n       Andrew Marvell's words could have been written for him: \n     ``But at my back I always hear/Time's winged chariot, \n     hurrying near.'' Lyndon Johnson saw himself in a desperate \n     race against time as he fought to remedy the damage slavery \n     and generations of prejudice had inflicted on black \n     Americans. Why? Because he feared that, once black Americans \n     sensed the prospect of a better life, the discrimination they \n     had once accepted as inevitable would become intolerable; \n     they would erupt--and, subvert their own cause. ``Hell,'' he \n     said to me during some of those eruptions, ``Sometimes when I \n     think of what they've been through, I don't blame them.''\n       He saw himself in a race against time as he sized up \n     Congress, political reality and attitudes of affluent \n     Americans. LBJ knew that he must use--now!--the sympathy \n     generated by John Kennedy's assassination and the huge margin \n     of his own election victory in 1964. He knew that his \n     political capital--no matter how gigantic in the early days \n     of his presidency--was a dwindling asset.\n       Third, Lyndon Johnson was a man of extraordinary courage.\n       For me the greatest price our nation pays for our \n     collective blindness is this: By rendering LBJ invisible we \n     lose sight, for the future, of how much a truly courageous \n     political leader can accomplish.\n       Sure, LBJ had the politician's hunger to be loved. But, \n     more than that, he had the courage to fall on his sword if \n     that's what it took to move the nation forward. He did just \n     that when, in an extraordinary act of abnegation, he withdrew \n     from the political arena to calm the roiling seas of strife \n     and end the war in Vietnam.\n       To me no greater example of Presidential political courage \n     exists than Lyndon Johnson's commitment in the area of civil \n     rights. He fought for racial equality even when it hurt him \n     and clobbered his party in the South.\n       After signing the Civil Rights Act in 1964, Johnson was \n     defeated in five southern states, four of them states that \n     Democrats had not lost for 80 years.\n       Still he kept on. In 1965 he drove the Voting Rights Act \n     through Congress. In 1966, he proposed the Fair Housing Act \n     to end discrimination in housing. His proposal prompted the \n     most vitriolic mail we received at the White House, and \n     Congress refused to act on the bill that year.\n       In the November 1966 mid-term elections, the Democrats lost \n     a whopping forty-seven seats in the House and three in the \n     Senate. Border and southern state governors met with the \n     President at his ranch in December. In a nasty assault on his \n     civil rights policies, they demanded that he withdraw his \n     fair housing proposal and curb his efforts to desegregate \n     schools.\n       Undeterred, in 1968, he drove the Fair Housing Act through \n     the senate--tragically it took Dr. King's assassination to \n     give Johnson the leverage he needed to convince the House to \n     pass it.\n       You have to see political courage like that to believe it. \n     I was fortunate to see it close up. I want our people and \n     future leaders to be able to see it.\n       Fourth, Lyndon Johnson knew how to use power.\n       Johnson married his revolutionary zeal, impatience and \n     courage to a phenomenal sense of how to use power \n     skillfully--to exploit a mandate, to corral votes, to reach \n     across the aisle in order to move this nation, its people and \n     the Congress forward.\n       Lyndon Johnson felt entitled to every lever, to help from \n     every person, every branch of government, every business, \n     labor and religious leader. After all. as he often reminded \n     us, he was the only President we had. He had no inhibitions \n     in reaching out for advice, ideas, talent, power, support. He \n     often saw traditions of separation of powers. or an \n     independent press, or a profit-minded corporate executive, as \n     obstacles, to be put aside in deference to the greater \n     national interest as he defined it. He was brilliantly \n     opportunistic, calling upon the nation and the Congress in \n     the wake of even the most horrific tragedies--the \n     assassinations of John Kennedy and Martin Luther King--to \n     bring a new measure of social justice to all Americans.\n       He knew how to harness the power of the protestors and the \n     media to tap into the inherent fairness of the American \n     people. He asked Martin Luther King in January 1965 to help \n     with the Voting Rights Act by ``getting your leaders and you \n     yourself . . . . to find the worst condition [of voting \n     discrimination] that you run into in Alabama . . . . and get \n     it on radio, get it on television, get it on--in the pulpits, \n     get it in the meetings, get it every place you can . . . . \n     and then that will help us on what we are going to shove \n     through in the end.'' He loved King's choice of Selma, \n     Alabama. He knew, as he told Dr. King, that when the American \n     people saw the unfairness of the voting practices there, they \n     would come around to supporting his bill. And they did.\n       He offers a defining lesson in the importance of mustering \n     bipartisan support. These Great Society proposals were \n     cutting edge, controversial initiatives and LBJ assiduously \n     courted Republican members of congress to support them. His \n     instructions to us on the White House staff were to accord \n     Senate Republican minority leader Everett Dirksen and House \n     minority leader Gerald Ford the same courtesies we extended \n     to Senate Majority leader Mike Mansfield and House Speaker \n     John McCormack. It was not only that he needed Republican \n     votes to pass bills like the civil rights, health, education \n     and consumer laws: he saw bipartisan support as an essential \n     foundation on which to build lasting commitment among the \n     American people. He knew that the endurance of his \n     legislative achievements, and their enthusiastic \n     acceptance by state and local governments, powerful \n     private interests and individual citizens across the \n     nation, required such bipartisan support.\n       He didn't accomplish all he wanted. He called ``the welfare \n     system in America outmoded and in need of major change'' and \n     pressed Congress to create ``a work incentive program, \n     incentives for earning, day care for children, child and \n     maternal health and family planning services.''\n       He saw the threat posed by the spread of guns and proposed \n     national registration of all gulls and national licensing of \n     all gun owners. Congress rejected his proposals. But he did \n     convince Capitol Hill to close the loophole of mail order \n     guns, prohibit sales to minors, and end the import of \n     Saturday night specials.\n       He tried, unsuccessfully, to get expand Medicare to cover \n     pre-natal care and children through age six, and used to say, \n     ``If we can get that, future presidents and Congresses can \n     close the gap between six and sixty-five.''\n       He spotted the ``for sale'' signs of political corruption \n     going up in the nation's capital and called for public \n     financing of campaigns.\n       Our nation and its leaders pay a heavy price when such a \n     towering figure--among the most towering political figures of \n     American history--becomes at the same time America's \n     invisible president. In this year, when for the first time in \n     our history a black American is a leading candidate for the \n     Presidency, when so many domestic issues dominating the \n     campaign--access to health care, persistent poverty amidst \n     such plenty, affordable higher education, effective public \n     schools, environmental protection--are issues LBJ put on the \n     national government's agenda, it is time to see the full \n     measure of this President. Too many lessons of his presidency \n     have been ignored because the Democratic party, the academic \n     elite, political analysts and the mainstream media have made \n     him the invisible president.\n       In this troubled time, when political pollsters and \n     consultants parse the positions of candidates for public \n     office, Johnson's exceptional courage on civil rights should \n     be a shining example for a new generation of political \n     leaders. His recognition of the significance of bipartisan \n     support for controversial--but needed--domestic initiatives, \n     and his ability to muster such support, should be studied by \n     politicians and citizens who seek to change the world. His \n     unique ability to make Washington work. to nourish and \n     maintain partnerships between the Executive and the Congress, \n     the public and private sectors, and to focus the people on \n     critical needs like racial justice and eliminating poverty \n     demonstrate ``Yes, we can!'' to skeptical citizens who have \n     never seen Washington get it done.\n       It's time to take off the Vietnam blinders and let our eyes \n     look at and learn from the domestic dimension of this \n     presidency. Let everyone think what they will about Vietnam. \n     But let us--especially Democrats--also recognize the reality \n     of this revolutionary's remarkable achievements.\n       It is encouraging to me that some of Johnson's severest \n     anti-war critics have begun the call for recognition of the \n     greatness of his presidency.\n       Listen to the words of George McGovern who ran for \n     president in 1972 on an anti-war platform and maintains that \n     ``The Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations were all \n     wrong on Vietnam:''\n       ``It would be a historic tragedy if [LBJ's] outstanding \n     domestic record remained forever obscured by his involvement \n     in a war he did not begin and did not know how to\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\n     stop.. . . . Johnson did more than any other president to \n     advance civil rights, education and housing, to name just \n     three of his concerns. . . . ''\n       `` The late John Kenneth Galbraith, another leading critic \n     of the Vietnam War, has called for ``historical \n     reconsideration'' of the Johnson presidency:\n       ``In the New Deal ethnic equality was only on the public \n     conscience; in the Kennedy presidency it was strongly urged \n     by Martin Luther King and many others. . . . It was with \n     Lyndon Johnson, however, that citizenship for all Americans \n     in all its aspects became a reality. . . . On civil rights \n     and on poverty, the two truly urgent issues of the time, we \n     had with Johnson the greatest changes of our time. . . . The \n     initiatives of Lyndon Johnson on civil rights, voting rights \n     and on economic and social deprivation. . . . must no longer \n     be enshrouded by that [Vietnam] war.''\n       And listen to Robert Caro, LBJ's most meticulous and \n     demanding biographer:\n       ``In the twentieth century, with its eighteen American \n     presidents, Lyndon Johnson was the greatest champion that \n     black Americans and Mexican Americans, and indeed all \n     Americans of color, had in the White House, the greatest \n     champion they had in all the halls of government. With the \n     single exception of Lincoln, he was the greatest champion \n     with a white skin that they had in the history of the \n     Republic. He was . . . the lawmaker for the poor and the \n     downtrodden and the oppressed . . . . the President who wrote \n     mercy and justice into the statute books by which America was \n     governed.''\n       Historian David McCullough has said that the threshold test \n     of greatness in a president is whether he is willing to risk \n     his presidency for what he believes. LBJ passes that test \n     with flying colors. It's time for all of us to give his \n     presidency the high marks it deserves.\n       Lyndon Johnson died 36 years ago in 1972. But his legacy \n     endures. It endures in the children in Head Start programs in \n     hamlets across our nation, in the expanded opportunities for \n     millions of blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. It \n     endures in the scholarships and loans that enable the poorest \n     students to attend the finest universities. His legacy \n     endures in the health care for the poor and the elderly that \n     are woven into the fabric of American life. It endures in the \n     public radio stations millions of drivers listen to as they \n     drive to and from work. It endures in the cleaner air we \n     breathe, in the local theatres and symphonies supported by \n     the National Endowments, in the safer cars we drive and safer \n     toys our children play with.\n       Seeing is believing.\n       That legacy also endures--let us remember--in the \n     unfinished business of our nation's long progressive movement \n     that he pressed so impatiently for us to finish. LBJ knew \n     that movement could be stalled, but he knew that it must \n     never be stopped.\n       So, over these few days, as we look back and celebrate this \n     centennial, let us also look forward and let us inspire \n     others to see clearly and fully.\n       Because seeing is not only believing; seeing has everything \n     to do with achieving.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Seeing Is Believing: The Enduring Legacy of LBJ\n\n\n With these acts President Johnson and Congress wrote a record of hope \n                      and opportunity for America\n\n     1963\n       College Facilities, Clean Air, Vocational Education, Indian \n     Vocational Training, Manpower Training.\n     1964\n       Inter-American Development Bank, Kennedy Cultural Center, \n     Tax Reduction, Farm Program, Pesticide Controls, \n     International Development Association, Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, Water Resources Research.\n       War on Poverty, Criminal Justice, Truth-in-Securities, Food \n     Stamps, Housing Act, Wilderness Areas, Nurse Training, \n     Library Services.\n     1965\n       Medicare, Medicaid, Elementary and Secondary Education, \n     Higher Education, Bilingual Education, Departent of Housing \n     and Urban Development, Housing Act, Voting Rights.\n       Immigration Reform Law, Older Americans, Heart, Cancer, \n     Stroke Program, Law Enforcement Assistance, Drug Controls, \n     Mental Health Facilities, Health Professions, Medical \n     Libraries.\n       Vocational Rehabilitation, Anti-Poverty Program, Arts and \n     Humanities Foundation, Aid to Appalachia, Highway Beauty, \n     Clean Air, Water Pollution Control, High Speed Transit.\n       Manpower Training, Child Health, Community Health Services, \n     Water Resources Council, Water Desalting, Juvenile \n     Delinquency Control, Arms Control, Affirmative Action.\n     1966\n       Child Nutrition, Department of Transportaton, Truth in \n     Packaging, Model Cities, Rent Supplements, Teahers Corp, \n     Asian Development Bank, Clean Rivers.\n       Food for Freedom, Child Safety, Narcotics Rehabilitation, \n     Traffic Safety, Highway Safety, Mine Safety, International \n     Education, Bail Reform.\n       Auto Safety, Tire Safety, New GI Bill, Minimum Wage \n     Increase, Urban Mass Transit, Civil Procedure Reform, Fish-\n     Wildlife Preservation, Water for Peace.\n       Anti-Inflation Program, Scientific Knowledge Exchange, \n     Protection for Savings, Freedom of Information, Hirshhorn \n     Museum.\n     1967\n       Education Professions, Education Act, Air Pollution \n     Control, Partnership for Health, Social Security Increases, \n     Age Discrimination, Wholesome Meat, Flammable Fabrics.\n       Urban Reserch, Public Broadcasting, Outer Space Treaty, \n     Modern D.C.

The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see the arrival of my seatmate, a great \nfriend, Robert C. Byrd, and with permission, I would like to speak for \nabout 2 minutes, if that is all right. I know he has some important \nwords.\n  Before he leaves the floor, I wish to commend my colleague from Iowa, \nTom Harkin. Tom and I arrived in the Congress together 34 years ago in \nJanuary of 1973. I have listened to him give eloquent speeches but none \nbetter than the one he just gave regarding Lyndon Johnson--not only the \nimportance of the man but the importance of his work and what a better \ncountry we are today. We are not that more perfect union yet, but we \nare getting there. One major step in that direction was created by \nLyndon Johnson and a guy by the name of Tom Harkin who has carried on \nthat tradition as well. So he would be very proud of you. I thank the \nSenator from Iowa for his remarks this morning.\n  I have some brief thoughts before deferring to my seatmate and dear \nfriend, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.\n  Let me just say to all, we often reflect on the impact this \ninstitution has had on the United States, on our beloved country. But \non this day, I think we cannot help but consider the impact certain \nAmericans have had on this institution and on our great Republic. At \nthis moment, we reflect not on legislative accomplishments, which are \nHerculean, as Senator Harkin has identified--appropriately so, and with \ngreat eloquence--or even how that might have changed the fabric of our \ncountry--it certainly did--but, rather, on the strength of character \nrequired by those who made such achievements possible.\n  I wish to join my colleagues and others here today reflecting upon \nand paying tribute to one of this great institution's most revered \nfigures on this centennial anniversary of his birth: the former Senate \nmajority leader, the 35th President of this body and the 36th President \nof the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  Emerson wrote that:\n\n       None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or \n     commanding except when he listens to this whisper, which is \n     heard by him alone.\n\n  If that is true, then when the whisper traveled through the winds \nsweeping across the Pedernales River in the plains of central Texas, \nLyndon Johnson must have been listening carefully, indeed.\n  I think we all believe that a society such as ours should aspire to \ngreatness, aspire to that more perfect union our forefathers \nenvisioned. But Lyndon Johnson understood something else of what was \nrequired of leaders to get us there: the importance of building \nalliances, however unorthodox; the ability to find agreement, even with \nthose whom we most disagree with; and perhaps most importantly, Lyndon \nBaines Johnson recognized that this institution could achieve the most \nremarkable of things if its Members were willing to do the kind of work \nthat more often than not was decidedly unremarkable.\n  It was his Herculean skills in the legislative arena, of course, \nhoned on this very floor and in these Halls, that proved such a \ncomplement to the wonderful rhetorical flourishes of those\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nwho identified the great goals we must achieve. But armed with his \nskills--his maneuvering, his understanding of his fellow Members, of \nwhat they could tolerate, what they could agree with, how far they \ncould move--Lyndon Johnson was able, in his very hands, to mold the \nsuccessful results of which Tom Harkin spoke so eloquently. In the \nabsence of that ability, a lot of these achievements would have been \nnothing more than rhetorical flourishes. It took the brilliance of a \nlegislator--not unlike the skills of the gentleman who sits next to me \nhere this morning, Robert C. Byrd--to be able to fashion and create the \nvery legislative achievements we talk about. Indeed, it is often said \nthat it took the hardscrabble southerner from Texas to broker a Civil \nRights Act. I don't know of anyone who would disagree with that or with \nthe long litany of legislative achievements Tom Harkin has identified. \nBut I think it does in a sense a disservice to just identify what was \nperhaps Lyndon Johnson's greatest skill, and that was moving a \npolitical body reluctant to change, as most political bodies are.\n  To be sure, I would be remiss if I were not to mention my father's \nrelationship with Lyndon Johnson as well. I sit at the desk my father \noccupied in this body for the more than 10 years he served here. But \nthat relationship went back a lot longer than their years here. My \nfather, as a young law school graduate at the outset of the New Deal, \nbecame the first State Director of the National Youth Administration in \n1933, and Lyndon Johnson was a young man beginning his career in Texas \npolitics and was running a similar program in that State.\n  Their relationship started in the 1930s and blossomed during their \nyears in public service in this very institution. I am sort of a \ncreature of this place, in many ways, having grown up here. I was a \nmere child of 8 when my father came to Congress in 1952, and then to \nthe Senate in 1959, with my seat-mate, Senator Byrd. I sat in the \nfamily gallery in 1959 and watched him take the oath of office. Three \nyears later, I sat on the floor, dressed like these young men and \nwomen, as a Senate page and watched Lyndon Johnson maneuver through \nthis building. In those days, there were no television cameras or \nmicrophones that can carry your voice through the halls of this room \nand beyond. I would watch Lyndon Johnson at this table in front of me \nhere. Members would gather around because you could not hear everything \nhe said--intentionally, I might add, as he was careful that not \neverything he said was necessarily heard by everyone about the schedule \nof the Senate, or he may have been talking about achievements that were \nmade. I was here for some of the all-night sessions when the civil \nrights debates were going on. I developed friendships, which I still \nhold today, with the other young pages I worked with in those early \ndays.\n  Lyndon Johnson and my father and Lady Bird and my mother had a great \nrelationship. I have shared with Lynda, Luci, and their families that I \nremember vividly Mrs. Johnson being at our home. My mother and she \nwould meet with Mercedes Douglas, Justice Douglas's wife, to practice \nSpanish together. They had a great relationship over the years. I \nremember vividly, as well, President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson \nhosting a surprise wedding anniversary party for my parents at a \nrestaurant here in Washington one evening, as they celebrated their \n35th wedding anniversary. So there are family ties that run long and \ndeep.\n  I remember in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson very graciously invited my \nfather and Hubert Humphrey to come to the White House on the eve of the \nVice Presidential nomination in Atlantic City. There was no doubt that \nHumphrey would be the choice, but it was the gracious act of a \nPresident to recognize a friendship he had with this young man from \nConnecticut, going back to the 1930s, that he invited him to be part of \nthat raising the expectation that he might be chosen as a Vice \nPresidential running mate for Lyndon Johnson. My father seconded \nJohnson's nomination in 1960 when I was a page, as well, and watching \nhistory unfold.\n  So it is with great joy that I come to the floor this morning to \ncelebrate a remarkable life that made a huge difference. When students \nask us--as they oftentimes do--``can any one person make a difference \nin the life of other people?'' you need look no further than the \ninitials LBJ. It is a story of how one individual, as Tom Harkin said, \nborn in the hardscrabble territory of central Texas, grew up and served \nin this body, managed this institution, produced the results he did, \nand became President of a country that allowed us to achieve the great \nachievements of the 1960s.\n  We are all beneficiaries of Lyndon Johnson's legacy. It is highly \nappropriate, not only today, this week, or in the year of this \ncentennial anniversary, and with great frequency, to remind the young \npeople sitting here today as pages that these great achievements didn't \nhappen miraculously. They weren't given out with a gracious heart of \nthose who fought. They were won in hard-fought battles that produced \nthese results. Our generation, your generation, will have to fight \nhard, too, to make sure we are going to achieve good things and learn \nthe lessons of Lyndon Johnson--how hard he fought to make a difference \nin his country and in the world in which we live.\n  I am honored to be joining those who today celebrate the life, \ncelebrate an achievement our country benefited from, and as long as we \nsurvive as a republic, the legacy of Lyndon Baines Johnson. It is a \ngreat moment that we ought to remember and cherish for years and years \nto come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate marks the 100th anniversary \nof the birth of Lyndon Baines Johnson. The Senate has changed much, in \na sense; in another sense, it has changed little since the days when \nSenator and Majority Leader Johnson strode through these halls and \npresided over this great body.\n  I was fortunate to serve with Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson. I \nwas fortunate to serve with President Lyndon B. Johnson. And although \nmost Americans remember Lyndon B. Johnson in his role as President of \nthe United States, it is as majority leader and Senator that I \nespecially recall Lyndon B. Johnson.\n  As I noted upon his death in 1973:\n\n       In his heart, [he] was a man of the Senate. He had a deep \n     and abiding faith in this body, and its place in the past and \n     the future history of this Republic.\n\n  It is, therefore, most fitting on the centennial of Lyndon Johnson's \nbirth that he be remembered here in this Senate that he loved.\n  Lyndon Baines Johnson was the majority leader when I came to the \nSenate in 1959, and from my first day in the Senate, and for the next 2 \nyears, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson was a mentor and friend, \nas well as a leader, to me. At that time, my colleagues, the Senate had \na long tradition that a newcomer to the Senate would not be assigned to \nthe more important Senate committees. Yet--hear this, my colleagues--\nMajority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson placed me on the Appropriations \nCommittee, even though there were several other more senior Members who \ncoveted a position on that prestigious committee. The rest, as they \nsay, is history, still in the making, because I, Robert C. Byrd, am \nstill on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Whenever I went to Lyndon B. Johnson with problems concerning my \nState of West Virginia, in every instance Majority Leader Johnson was \nconsiderate and, in every instance, Majority Leader Johnson tried to be \nhelpful to me. I acknowledged that support and leadership, not only to \nme but to the Senate, the Democratic Party, and to our Nation, in an \naddress that I titled ``The Role of the Majority Leader in the \nSenate,'' given at the end of my first year in the Senate. I pointed \nout that Senator Johnson was ``the cohesive, the centrifugal force by \nwhich the majority is held together.''\n  When he became Vice President of the United States, I again paid \ntribute to my former colleague and mentor, declaring that his \n``political leadership in the Senate [was] a guide and an inspiration \nto all of us.''\n  Amidst tragedy, on November 22, 1963, Lyndon Johnson became President \nof these United States. His administration achieved many \naccomplishments, especially in the areas of civil rights and social \npolicy.\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\n  I believe, however, in the observation I made at the time of Lyndon \nB. Johnson's death:\n\n       The years Lyndon Johnson spent in the Senate might well \n     have been the happiest and the most satisfying of his life.\n\n  Lyndon B. Johnson will long be remembered here 100, even 200, years \nand more after his birth, for his leadership, his sagacity, his wit, \nfor the sheer enjoyment he derived from working in the Senate, and his \nobvious love for this body and the great Nation it serves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is an opportunity for me to speak about \nthe supplemental appropriations bill, but I would be remiss if I did \nnot recognize the extraordinary life and service of President Lyndon \nBaines Johnson.\n  I can remember graphically, as a high school student at La Salle \nAcademy in Providence, RI, going down to, at that time recently named, \nKennedy Plaza in Providence to see President Johnson in a motorcade on \nhis way to Brown University to deliver a major policy address with, at \nthat time, the senior Senator John O. Pastore. They were both \ncelebrating tremendous legislative accomplishments in education, health \ncare, and civil rights, none of which would have been wrought except by \nthe vision and work of Lyndon Johnson.\n  We are commemorating an extraordinary President, an extraordinary \ngentleman, someone truly larger than life whose contribution and whose \ninfluence is with us today. In fact, many days on this Senate floor, I \nthink our tact is to live up to his ideals and his accomplishments and \nto make them fresh again in both the heart and spirit of America. I \nhope on our best days we do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4578-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4578-S4585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to focus my remaining remarks on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill which is pending before the Senate. We \npassed a supplemental appropriations bill out of the Appropriations \nCommittee, which I serve on, last week. This bill contains $168.9 \nbillion for funding operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is the \namount the President requested. But importantly, this bill also \nincludes significant contributions to the domestic economy of this \ncountry, to the needs here at home, not just overseas.\n  It includes funds for LIHEAP. At a time when oil is topping $130 a \nbarrel, the drain on low-income Americans and seniors particularly, \nsimply to pay heating prices, and in the Southwest and South of our \ncountry, cooling prices this summer are extraordinary. It is a burden. \nIt is a huge burden. We have incorporated some funds for that \nsituation.\n  We also have moneys for unemployment insurance, not only necessary to \nsustain families in a time of economic crisis but also one of the most \neffective stimulus devices. The money from unemployment insurance goes \nquickly from the recipient to the local market, to all the needs of a \nfamily struggling in this economy to get by. It is a tremendous way to \nstimulate our economy. So it has both individual benefits and economic \nbenefits for the country as a whole.\n  I must also point out that included in these domestic provisions is \nextraordinary legislation by Senator Webb, my colleague from Virginia, \nthe enhanced GI bill of rights. Senator Webb has done an extraordinary \njob, and it is not surprising. He approaches this not only as a very \nastute legislator but as a combat marine veteran of Vietnam. He has \nborne the burden of battle. He understands now, in the famous words of \nPresident Lincoln, that it is our responsibility to take care of those \nwho have borne the burden of battle.\n  This responsibility is, I think, one of the most paramount we face, \nand his legislation goes right to the concerns of so many returning \nveterans: How will I get back to education? How will I fund my \neducation? How will I be similar to my predecessors, the generation of \nmy father--when so many had the opportunity to go to college, and then \nnot only did they contribute to their own family's well-being, they \nhelped build an economic powerhouse we have seen in America since World \nWar II.\n  This is a program, again, which I think is extraordinarily important. \nI commend Senator Webb for his vision, for his persistence, and for his \npassion. I hope we include it in the final version of the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  As I mentioned before, we are putting funds in for LIHEAP. I offered \nan amendment to include $1 billion. It is so necessary. In places such \nas California, there are 1.7 million households behind in their utility \nbills. That is up 100,000 from last year, and last year was a difficult \nyear for many. There are 650,000 households in Pennsylvania that are \nreceiving shutoff warnings, a huge number of families who are facing \nthe end of their utility service. In a very uncertain economy, it is \ndifficult to reestablish that relationship going forward unless we help \nthem.\n  We have seen a 162-percent increase in energy costs since 2000. It is \nextraordinary. There is no paycheck for working Americans that has gone \nup 162 percent, but their energy bills have. We have seen heating oil \nprices in the last year increase 35 percent. So this is something that \nis absolutely critical, just as unemployment insurance, just as so many \naspects of this legislation.\n  There are also included provisions not requested by the President. \nThere is some assistance for the global food crisis and for the \nterrible natural disasters in Myanmar and China.\n  We also include, as another aspect of the legislation, something that \nis absolutely, I believe, critical, and that is conditions on our \npolicy with respect to Iraq, particularly. This Congress has, over my \nstrenuous efforts otherwise, essentially given the President a blank \ncheck. He demands money, and he has been given money but without \nconditions. I think it is the responsibility of this Congress to impose \nreasonable conditions on the funding, to not only govern our operations \nbut also to make it clear to the Iraqi Government that they are \nultimately responsible for their own safety, their own future, their \nown stability, the future of the Iraqi nation and the Iraqi people. It \nis not something we can do for them. We have rendered extraordinary \nassistance to them, but the task is truly theirs, and they must seize \nthat task.\n\n  These conditions, I think, are terribly important. One would, for \nexample, ensure the readiness of our troops, who are being stretched to \nthe limit, ensure they are ready when they are deployed. That is \nsomething I hope no one is arguing with.\n  Another provision directs the Government to negotiate cost sharing \nfor fuel and troop training with the Iraqis. The Iraqi Government has \naccumulated upward of $10 billion or more because of the surging oil \nprices. Very little, if any, of those funds is being devoted to their \nown people or to the joint effort we have undertaken with them to \nstabilize the country. It is only fair that they should begin to pay \ntheir fair share, particularly since they are sitting on a significant \namount of money resulting from high energy prices. That money should be \ndevoted to stabilizing their country and helping their people, much \nmore so than they are doing today.\n  Then there is another provision which is something Senator Levin and \nI have been stressing for many months now, and that is to begin a \ntransition of the missions our military forces and diplomatic forces \nare performing in Iraq, particularly our military forces, instead of an \nopen-ended mission, and we have seen this mission from the President's \nstandpoint change dramatically.\n  As you will recall, the first mission was to find and destroy the \nweapons of mass destruction, a very difficult mission, since there were \nno weapons of mass destruction. Then there was the mission of creating \na democratic oasis in the Persian Gulf, a very grandiose mission, more \nor less, and that mission, I think, has been discounted dramatically \nover the last several months by the President's own rhetoric. He has \ntalked now about simply creating a country that will sustain itself and \nnot threaten its neighbors.\n  We have to focus not on these globalized missions which are more\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\ndogmatic and ideological, but on things the military should be doing \nfor our protection in the context of redeploying forces out of Iraq. \nThose missions are, in my view, force protection--we have to ensure our \nforces are fully protected--counterterrorism, because we cannot \nsurrender that mission anywhere in the world; we have to be able to \nseek out and destroy those terrorist cells that are plotting and \nplanning against the United States and our allies; and third is to \ntrain the Iraqi security forces because we do have to provide a force \nthat will stay behind, a force that will help stabilize that country.\n  The essence of the Levin-Reed amendment has been to move from the \nopen-ended missions of today to these discrete missions and, in so \ndoing, begin a deliberate, consistent disengagement of our forces and a \nreduction of our forces in Iraq. That is a policy that will, I think, \nwork, and it is a policy that eventually, ultimately must be followed.\n  I think the reluctance of the administration to entertain any \nconditions whatsoever over the last several years has undermined, in \nthe long run, our ability to influence the Government of Iraq and also \nto reassure the American public we are not into an open-ended, \nunlimited commitment, stretching years and decades and beyond, that our \nmission is discrete, that our mission in terms of military presence is \ncoming down and will not reverse itself, and that we are doing all we \ncan in that context to save lives in Iraq.\n  On 9/11, this country was struck by terrorists. The United States, \nthis Senate, the Congress, the administration rallied together with \nunanimity and with purpose. We authorized and supported an attack \nagainst Afghanistan because that is where the perpetrators were lodged, \nthat is where al-Qaida was headquartered. They were collaborating with \nthe Taliban government. They were given safe haven there. The planning \nfor so much of what went on, on that fateful day, originated from \nAfghanistan. That is where bin Laden, that is where the leadership of \nal-Qaida was. We struck there, and I must say in an extraordinarily \nsuccessful operation--and credit and criticism must be given, and there \nis great credit in terms of the leadership of the administration, our \nmilitary forces conducting a very sophisticated operation, an operation \nthat used our advantages with precision weapons, used very effectively \nour special forces, and used collaborative efforts with forces on the \nground in Afghanistan and also the collaboration and support, in many \nrespects, of the international community. But rather than consolidating \nour gains after that successful operation and pursuing al-Qaida in \nPakistan, where the leadership fled, the administration turned \nimmediately, almost immediately, to Iraq. And not out of any, I think, \nstrategic need, but out of a dogmatic political, ideological need.\n\n  They thought Iraq would be a relatively easy target. They were \nspeaking in those days, informally at least, about a very short \noperation, and that almost immediately Iraq would blossom as a source \nof democratic inspiration and market economics in that region. We know \nthe history has not been that cheerful. And that diversion to Iraq, I \nbelieve, was a deeply flawed strategy. It was an attack on a country \nthat did not represent an immediate threat to the United States, a \npoint I made on the floor of this Senate as I opposed the resolution of \n2002 to conduct those operations.\n  Because we were pursuing not a strategic necessity but an ideological \nobsession, it was not a mission that was well advised or well planned \nfor. There was more hope than planning involved, more ideology than \npractical commonsense application of force to a threatening situation \nin the world. One of the unfortunate ironies of this is that as we have \nbeen obsessed and committed in Iraq, al-Qaida has reconstituted itself \nas an incredible force once again. The whole purpose of our attack in \nAfghanistan, the whole thrust of our efforts immediately after 9/11, \nwas to decisively and, we hoped, irrevocably destroy al-Qaida. Al-Qaida \nis back. While we have been engaged in this hugely expensive mission--\nexpensive not only in terms of resources but in terms of the lives of \nour soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, and also the wear and tear \non our military forces--al-Qaida has been quietly rebuilding.\n  The other thing that has happened unwittingly is that Iran has become \na much more credible threat to stability in the region; has become even \nmore influential and powerful. In some respects, this is a direct \nresult of our engagement in Iraq.\n  Also in that time period, we stood by as the North Koreans overthrew \nthe agreed framework, seized the plutonium that was in the reactors \naround Yongbyan and took it away. Now we are trying desperately to put \ntogether another agreement with the North Koreans, but after years in \nwhich they not only tested longer range missiles but also detonated a \nnuclear device. They crossed a threshold that had never been crossed \nbefore, they detonated a nuclear device, and our reaction was, I think \nnecessarily perhaps because of our engagement in Iraq, one of seeking, \nperhaps too late now, a diplomatic approach. But if you go back to \n2000, we had a framework in place that looks very much like the \nframework they are working out today. We had the plutonium secured, \nNorth Korea had not tested a nuclear device, and there were hopes that \nwith further active negotiations we could make additional progress. \nThat, I think, too, is a cost of our engagement in Iraq.\n  It has also greatly diminished our standing in the international \ncommunity. This is not just a nice thing to have. An essential \nattribute of national power is the respect, the esteem, the \ncooperation, the good wishes, the goodwill, and the political and \ndiplomatic support of other nations, because in this world most of the \ngreat challenges cannot be met alone. That was contrary, I think, to \nthe unilateralism that abounded in this administration; that if in fact \nwe are going to do something significant, longstanding and sustainable, \nit requires a multinational approach and the foundation of that \napproach is the goodwill and good wishes of the people of the world. \nThis administration has squandered much of that.\n  It also is contributing, and we can debate how much, to this \nfaltering economy. Oil today is $130 a barrel. Some of that is \nattributable to the instability in the gulf region; the fact that Iraq \nhas not been producing the same volume of oil consistently over the \nlast several years that it did before the operation. This geopolitical \nuncertainty has contributed significantly to the price of oil and it is \nalso, I think, contributing to the overall economic issue we are \naddressing here today, a very critical issue in the United States.\n  Another aspect of this policy is that we have stretched our military, \nour land forces, to the brink, if you will. They have seen significant \ndeployments consistently time and time again and the toll is adding up \non our military forces. We are now left, and the next administration is \nleft, and this Congress and the American people, with dealing with the \nconsequences of this flawed strategy. I believe we have to begin to \nrecognize and realistically assess the political and military situation \nin Iraq. We have to begin to develop and implement achievable missions \nfor our U.S. forces there and their civilian counterparts, and then we \nmust turn our attention to restoring our economic prosperity and \ngrowth, and rebuilding our military, which has been significantly \nstretched and stressed by this operation.\n  We have to also reorganize our civilian resources to deal with the \nongoing threats in the world. That is something this administration has \nyet to do effectively--to develop a complementary power of our State \nDepartment officials, our agriculture officials, and all those people \nwho must be part of this approach to a kind of warfare that is, in many \ncases, less about firepower and more about reaching people with \neconomic progress and educational reform, and water systems. Those are \nmore potent weapons sometimes than any precision-guided missile we \nmight deploy.\n  I think our first step in all of this is passing this supplemental \nappropriations bill, with conditioned funding for our forces, with \nreasonable conditions about the mission and the responsibilities the \nIraqi Government should have, and also once again beginning to invest \nin the American people, investing in keeping them warm in the winter \nthrough LIHEAP and keeping them cool through LIHEAP in the summertime; \ngiving them a chance, if they lose\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\ntheir job, to at least keep looking for some support with extended \nunemployment benefits, and so many other things we have included in \nthis. I think that is critical.\n\n  Now, I mentioned before I have felt since 2002 that the strategy of \nthe administration toward Iraq was flawed significantly. It was, I \nthink, a product of a dogma. No one can I think dispute the power of \ndemocracy, and it is a power that is not exclusive to our culture. It \nis a human demand, the ability to live with a sense of personal \nintegrity and personal freedom. But I think the administration didn't \nrealize you need the institutional capacity to have a democratic \ngovernment, and this capacity is not automatic nor is it built up in a \nmatter of weeks or months. We have seen in Iraq, and in so many other \nplaces, that democratic elections do not necessarily lead to democratic \npolitical forces controlling a country; that you need to build \ncarefully over, I would suggest, many years the institutional capacity \nso that elections lead to true democracy, not simply legitimizing those \npeople who are antidemocratic.\n  I think this has been one of the tremendous flaws of the President's \nconcept of the mission. As a result, we started off with, obviously, I \nthink, an ill-conceived mission of eliminating weapons of mass \ndestruction in a country in which it turned out there were no weapons \nof mass destruction. People forget that the United Nations put \ninspectors on the ground, and that it was this administration who \nhastened their departure, rather than using these inspectors over time \nto establish whether there were weapons or whether there were no \nweapons, or at least to do it in a way in which subsequent military \naction would be legitimized by either noncooperation of the Iraqis or \nthe fact that the questions couldn't be established or answered. But \nthey quickly rushed to a military option, and I think that option has \nhad unfortunate consequences for the United States.\n  One of the principal consequences, and I mentioned this in my \nintroductory comments, is the fact that al-Qaida, the existential \nthreat to this country, as evidenced by 9/11, has in fact reconstituted \nitself, not only in the border regions of Afghanistan, to a degree, but \nmuch more particularly in Pakistan, in the federally administered \ntribal areas. These are poor tribal areas ill governed by the \nGovernment of Pakistan. In fact, there are provisions in their organic \nlaws which limit their real access to these areas. It has a population \nof 3 million people, and in that 3 million people al-Qaida, bin Laden, \nand al Zawahiri have found sanctuary and a safe haven, that continues \ntoday.\n  In a sobering report released last month by the Government \nAccountability Office, they stated:\n\n       The United States has not met its national security goals \n     to destroy terrorist threats and close the safe havens in \n     Pakistan's FATA.\n\n  And this is 7 years after 9/11.\n\n       Since 2002, the U.S. has provided Pakistan with $10.5 \n     billion in military, economic, and developmental aid. Half of \n     it has gone to the military. But despite these actions--\n     despite this extraordinary amount of money--GAO found broad \n     agreement, as documented in the National Intelligence \n     Estimate, State and embassy documents, as well as defense \n     officials in Pakistan, that al-Qaida had regenerated its \n     ability to attack the United States and had succeeded in \n     establishing a safe haven in Pakistan's FATA.\n\n  Now, I thought the point of our national strategy after 9/11 was to \ndestroy al-Qaida and to eliminate any possibility of a safe haven \nanywhere in the world. And according to these documents, our embassy, \nour Defense officials, our national intelligence agency, al-Qaida has \nreestablished itself and has found safe haven. I would suggest that is, \nI think, a stunning indictment of the strategy of this administration \nover the last several years; again, I think an unfortunate consequence \nof the obsession that they have chosen to pursue in Iraq.\n  An even more disturbing finding of GAO is:\n\n       No comprehensive plan comprised of diplomatic, economic, \n     intelligence and military efforts for meeting U.S. National \n     security goals in the FATA has been developed.\n\n  The one thing that seems to be consistent about the administration is \nthey do not do much planning. There was no plan for Iraq and, according \nto the GAO, there is no plan for Pakistan and the federally \nadministered tribal areas there.\n  A key part of the plan that must be developed in Pakistan is economic \ndevelopment. Because what I have witnessed, in the several times I have \nbeen to Pakistan, is that this is not strictly, as so many of these \nconflicts are, a military action. It requires providing economic \nsupport, it requires giving people a sense that their fate should be \nlinked to their legitimate government, and that government should be \npursuing goals which are not strictly sectarian. That government should \nbe a government relatively open and democratic, and that the appeal of \nthe extremist is weakened if people have that sense of confidence in \ntheir government, confidence in their future. That is not a military \nissue essentially; that is an issue of economic development, of \nsupporting legitimate institutions of the state, be it Pakistan or \nelsewhere.\n  That has been recognized by, I think, many experts. But the senior \nU.S. Embassy officials in Pakistan admit there has been overreliance on \nthe Pakistani military to achieve U.S. national security objectives; \nthat we have not developed a complementary approach of a comprehensive \nstrategy which includes economic, political, and social development \nalso.\n  As a result, in March, the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, Michael Hayden, described al-Qaida's safe haven as a ``clear \nand present danger to the United States.'' The chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, ADM Michael Mullen, has stated:\n\n       If I were going to pick the next attack to hit the United \n     States, it would come out of the FATA.\n\n  Now, let us be clear. It is not out of Iraq, it is not out of Mosul, \nor Basra, or Baghdad, it is out of the FATA. That is the view of the \nchief uniformed officer of the United States. The 2008 Director of \nNational Intelligence annual threat assessment, which represents the \ncombined judgments of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, has concluded \nthat:\n\n       The resurgence of the FATA now poses a preeminent threat to \n     the United States national security.\n\n  The problems of the FATA are being highlighted by deteriorating \nconditions in Afghanistan.\n  What we have seen from the initial success in Afghanistan has been a \nsteady, at times rapid, deterioration of conditions there. It is \nevident that our efforts in Afghanistan are being undermined by what is \nhappening in Pakistan. Not only have we taken our eye off the major \nthreat, al-Qaida, and allowed it to reconstitute, we are in danger of \nseeing the progress we have made in Afghanistan slip away.\n  In 2003, the Taliban, the former government, and their followers, who \nhave continued to try to assert their will in Afghanistan, were \noperating squad size units. Now we have reports they are operating in \nbattalion size units of almost 400 people, showing the climate has \nchanged radically. Suicide bombers have attacked at rates that were not \nobserved in Afghanistan until relatively recently, but as you have no \ndoubt surmised, it is something that has been imported through \nterrorist networks into Afghanistan.\n  Afghanistan's index of corruption is among the highest in the world. \nYou have a state that has marginal capacity to govern well and wisely. \nAgain, this is after many years of our involvement, our engagement. \nAlso, there was a sense that, initially at least, before Iraq, \nAfghanistan was the major test of our ability, not only to defeat al-\nQaida but also to create or help create, in collaboration with the \nAfghanis, a stable government. That test is in danger of failing \nmiserably.\n  Afghanistan now provides 93 percent of the world's opium. One of the \ngreat additional ironies, now it is one of the major suppliers of \ndrugs, and it is doing so while we maintain our military and diplomatic \npresence there.\n  We have a NATO contingent there, but frankly NATO has not been able \nto fulfill all of its obligations, putting more pressure on our \nmilitary alliance forces. I think we have to urge NATO to be more \nhelpful. Hopefully, they will. But, as a result, we have sent \nadditional forces in there, about 4,300 troops. We are prepared to send \nmore. This is adding additional stress and strain on our military \nforces.\n  As I look, we are seeing a situation in which the principal objective \nin response to 9/11, the principal place where our enemies were, has \nnow been relegated to the third page of the\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\npaper, as the headlines are dominated by Iraq. I think we have a \nsituation where we have literally taken our eye off the major \nexistential threat.\n  We have another consequence of our operations in Iraq, and that is we \nhave empowered Iran. Iran is heavily involved in Iraq. Its objectives \nare questionable. They have an interest in maintaining strategic depth \nby keeping the regime in Baghdad as one that is friendly to them, not \nhostile as the Baathists were. Also, they have many colleagues in the \nIraqi Shia movement. Some of these individuals actually fought with the \nIranians against the Iraqis in the 1980s in the Iraq-Iran war.\n  Iraq is materially assisting all the major Shia parties. They have \nnot limited themselves to one party or one particular group. As we all \nknow, in March of this year, President Ahmadinejad visited Iraq for 2 \ndays. The present government in Iraq, Prime Minister Maliki and all, \nrolled out the red carpet--literally. He arrived in a motorcade and ran \naround Baghdad in a sport coat. When any of our colleagues go or when \nany of our major administrative officials go, it is surreptitiously, it \nis guarded, and it is in a flak jacket. So there is something going on \nthere with respect to this Government of Iraq and Ahmadinejad and his \nwarm welcome. I think it graphically shows the influence they have in \nthat country.\n  We are finding a steady supply of IEDs which our military authorities \ntrace to Iran, or at least their technology. Iran is heavily engaged in \nfunding social organizations and building a model they have used \nelsewhere--Hezbolla in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian Authority--\nwhere they are able to not only help them organize the military force \nbut help them carry out social functions, helping people, helping \nwidows, providing relief. That is very powerful when you have a \ndysfunctional government and that is the case in Iraq.\n  We also know, on another track, the Iranians are attempting to \ndevelop a nuclear fuel cycle. The IAEA, the International Atomic Energy \nAdministration, has been spending decades trying to track the \ndevelopmental work of the Iranian Government. In 2006 there were \ndocuments found of possible nuclear dimension to their program in Iran. \nThis is of great consequence to us. There is a legitimate concern that \nif the Iranian Government were able to develop a nuclear fuel cycle and \ncould produce nuclear material, they would not be able to resist the \ntemptation to develop a nuclear device. That would be of significant \nconsequence in the region and in the world.\n  All that is happening in the context of our energies and our \nattention being overwhelmingly devoted to Iraq. There is a connection \nbetween the growing geopolitical clout of Iran in the region and our \nsituation within Iraq. In the long run, I think we might look back and \ndiscover that one of the real costs of Iraq was the emergence of a much \nmore difficult, much more threatening, much more powerful Iran.\n  As I mentioned earlier, while we have been focused so strenuously on \nIraq, North Korea has broken out of the Agreed Framework. They have \nexpelled international inspectors. They have withdrawn from the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. They restarted their nuclear installation at \nYongbyon. It is estimated that up to 50 kilograms of separated \nplutonium, enough for at least six nuclear weapons, have been taken by \nthe North Koreans and dispersed somewhere in the country.\n\n  On October 9, 2006, the North Koreans conducted a nuclear test--\ncrossed a red line they had never done before, detonated a nuclear \ndevice. Fortunately, over the last several months the administration \nhas reinstituted serious negotiations with the North Koreans. Under the \nable leadership of Ambassador Christopher Hill, they have begun to \nidentify and work with the North Koreans to identify where the \nplutonium might be, where there are other nuclear materials, nuclear \ntechnologies, and they are beginning to walk back where we were, \nironically, in the year 2000 and provide some sense of a diplomatic \nsolution to a very pressing problem.\n  But I would argue this would be a very different situation if we were \nnot so decisively involved and engaged in Iraq.\n  I mentioned also, in the course of these last several years, our \ninvolvement in Iraq has hurt us in terms of the world's opinion. That \nis not just a nice thing to have, it is an essential thing to have. In \nlate 2001, 52 percent of Turkish citizens and 75 percent of our British \nallies viewed the United States favorably. Now that favorable view has \ndropped to 9 percent in Turkey and 51 percent in Great Britain--one of \nour longest and most significant allies, Great Britain, and Turkey, one \nof the most significant members of NATO and also a Muslim country. We \nhave seen our public approval drop precipitously.\n  In a poll conducted by the BBC just last month, 47 percent of \ncitizens in 25 countries said the United States is playing a mainly \nnegative role in the world. That type of public opinion will not \ninspire political leaders around the world to help us very much. In \nfact, to do so they have to consciously operate against their own \npublic opinion. That is a difficult challenge anywhere.\n  Last month, Zogby and the University of Maryland surveyed citizens of \nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, and the UAE and found 83 \npercent had an unfavorable view of the United States. These countries \nare moderate Arab countries, so to speak, whose support in this effort \nin Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere is necessary. Their unfavorable \nview of the United States is alarming.\n  One of the keys we know of prevailing in this struggle is to \nchallenge and rally the forces of moderation and democracy through the \nArab world, of getting the people of the Arab world to understand that \nwe are trying to assist them. That is not working, unfortunately.\n  Then, as I mentioned, we have the economic consequences of the war. \nIn December 31, 2002, the New York Times reported:\n\n       The administration's top budget official estimated today \n     that the cost of a war with Iraq could be in the range of $50 \n     billion to $60 billion, a figure that is well below earlier \n     estimates from White House officials--\n\n  Then OMB Director--\n\n     Mitch Daniels would not provide specific costs for either a \n     long or a short military campaign against Saddam Hussein. But \n     he said the administration was budgeting for both, and \n     earlier estimates of $100 billion to $200 billion in Iraq war \n     costs by Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's former chief \n     economic adviser, were too high.\n\n  To date we have approved $526 billion for operations in Iraq--far in \nexcess of any of the estimates of the administration. That spending is \naffecting what we can do to help our own citizens, what we can do to \nplay a positive role in the world--not in a military sense but in a \ndiplomatic and international sense, helping in so many different areas.\n  Now, to gain some perspective on the $500-plus billion that we have \ncommitted to Iraq, what we could have used it for, this amount accrued \nplus the amount in the supplemental we are considering would have been \nsufficient to provide health insurance coverage to all the 45 million \nuninsured Americans for the timeframe 2003 to 2008. That is taken from \nthe Joint Economic Committee. That would be a significant benefit to \nthe people of America, but that is a benefit foregone. I have pointed \nout all this money to date has been deficit spending. This is not \nsomething we have paid for. One of the complaints we often hear around \nhere is that it is irresponsible to spend money without somehow \noffsetting it. That line of thought does not persist with the \nadministration when it comes to funding this war in Iraq.\n  We have also piled up huge contingency costs as we go forward. The \ndirect costs are significant, but the indirect costs and the future \ncosts are also important to note. We have to repair and replace the \nmilitary equipment that is being used. We have spent money to increase \nrecruitment and retention, and we have to do that for many years. We \nhave had economic disruptions caused by deployment of the National \nGuard and Reserve troops who have to leave their jobs to go into the \nmilitary.\n  According to a November 2007 report compiled by the Joint Economic \nCommittee, the impact of the war on the U.S. economy to date is $1.3 \ntrillion or $16,500 for every American family of four. So the costs, \nboth direct and indirect, have been staggering.\n  Those costs continue. One of the critical costs we are going to face \nis the cost going forward of helping our veterans. I was very pleased \nlast year to\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\nact as the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military \nConstruction and Veterans' Affairs while Senator Johnson recovered, and \nnow I am equally pleased to know that he is chairing that subcommittee \nand doing a remarkable job. But we were able to pass a significant \nincrease in spending for our veterans.\n  But the real challenge for us is will we do that 5 years from now? 7 \nyears from now? 8 years from now? 20 years from now, when these \nveterans still need the help but time has passed? I hope we will. That \nwould be a test--and if I am here, I hope I will be able to remind \npeople that the test is each year not 1 year or 2 years.\n  As Professor Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, pointed out, this cost, when \nyou aggregate it all, is in the trillions of dollars going forward, \nlooking at the consequential costs today, looking at the direct \nspending.\n  That is taking its toll on the economy of this country.\n  Another place where the toll is being taken is on our Army and Marine \nCorps, particularly; our military in general, but particularly our Army \nand Marine Corps.\n  I recall, as so many of us do, years ago, August 3, 2000, to be \nprecise when Governor Bush stated: Our military is low on parts, pay \nand morale. If called upon by the Commander in Chief today, two entire \ndivisions of the Army will have to report ``Not ready for duty, sir.''.\n  Well, Army readiness is worse today than it was in 2000, and if that \nis the metric to measure the success of the Commander in Chief, I would \nargue that that metric has failed. If we look at readiness today, while \nwe have a situation which our brigade combat teams that are deployed or \nare preparing to deploy are considered ready, the Army has only one \nready brigade combat team in reserve for any other contingency in the \nworld. Strategically our flexibility has been constrained almost to the \nvanishing point. That is a consequence of Iraq.\n  On February 26, the Army Chief of Staff, General Casey, said before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n       The cumulative effects of the last 6 plus years at war have \n     left our Army out of balance, consumed by the current fight \n     and unable to do the things we know we need to do properly, \n     sustain our all-volunteer force, and restore our flexibility \n     for an uncertain future.\n\n  He added:\n\n       We are consuming readiness as fast as we build it.\n\n  I would ask, rhetorically, I wonder if General Casey had to report \nhow many divisions are not ready today, it would probably be more than \ntwo, if you aggregated all of the brigades, that for reasons of \ntraining, equipping, and personnel are not at 100 percent.\n  On April 8, General Cody, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on readiness:\n\n       I have been doing this for 6 years. As you know I was at G-\n     3 of the Army and vice chief now for almost 4 years. And I \n     have never seen our lack of strategic depth where it is \n     today.\n\n  We have 162,400 troops serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. There are \n33,000 troops in Afghanistan serving in the ISAF and Operation Enduring \nFreedom. Since 2002, 1.6 million troops have served in either Iraq or \nAfghanistan, and many of them are multiple tours. Of those on active \nduty, 336,000 have 1 tour; 108,000 have had 2 tours; and 30,000 have \nhad 3 or more tours.\n  This is a pace that cannot be sustained. It is a pace that is taking \na tremendous toll on our troops and their families, and it is a toll \nagain that cannot be indefinitely sustained.\n  For our reservists, we have had many of those who have had at least 1 \ntour, 97,000; 9,000 have had 2 or more tours; and the notices that went \nout this week to mobilize and alert roughly 42,000 troops include \nsignificant Reserve and National Guard deployments, brigade combat \nteams in the National Guard that will go again. I suspect for many of \nthem it will be at least their second tour and perhaps for some their \nthird. So we have had tremendous turbulence in terms of deployment of \nour land forces. Our military personnel are dedicated. They are doing a \nsuperb job. But they cannot keep up this pace. That is one aspect of \nit, personnel.\n  The other aspect is equipment. We have fought tirelessly here in this \nCongress to give our forces the equipment they need. I can recall \nreturning in 2003 from Iraq, seeing my National Guard military police \npeople in Baghdad being told that they did not have armored humvees and \nthey needed them because they were in the middle of a fight in \nFallujah.\n  I contacted the military authorities. I came to the floor of the \nSenate, proposed we increase the funding for armored humvees, and that \nwas an initiative that started with my colleagues here in the Senate \nand the House, reluctantly agreed to, I think, from my perspective, by \nthe administration. It took us many months to begin to get sufficient \narmored vehicles into Iraq.\n  Similarly we are now on a second and third generation with MRAP, the \nmine resistant vehicles. That too was a result of many efforts here in \nthe Congress to get that equipment out to our troops.\n  I believe, I hope, they have everything they need, the latest \ntechnology. That is something that is absolutely essential. But all of \nthis equipment is being used and overused. Roughly 30 percent of the \nMarine Corps' ground equipment and half of the Army's ground equipment \nis in Iraq and Afghanistan, again leaving very little back here in the \nUnited States, relatively speaking, for the training and the \ncontingency operations that might take place here in a natural disaster \nor some other major contingency.\n  It is a harsh, hard environment. The operational tempo is wearing out \nthis equipment. I recall being out in Anbar Province getting ready to \ngo on a Marine helicopter. They were briefing us routinely, claiming \nthat the engines on these helicopters were operating way beyond where \nthey would normally operate. They assured me it was safe to get on the \nhelicopter. But one wondered, as you got on: Would this rate of \noperational use, if the stress and the strains eventually, would it \nresult in malfunctions for our troops, our forces, our marines in the \nfield.\n  So we expect, the Army expects, to need $12 to $13 billion per year \nto reset the forces. The Marine Corps estimates it will need $15.6 \nbillion for reset over the next several years when the operations begin \nto wind down. The Army National Guard has little more than half of its \nrequired equipment and they will need $22 billion for the next 5 years \nto build the equipment up to 75 percent of authorized levels. So we \nhave a tremendous impact on our Army because of our operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and principally Iraq.\n\n  The other aspect of readiness is training. Because the time back home \nof Army forces has been reduced effectively to 12 months, they cannot \ndo the same type and the same level of training they had been doing \nprevious to Iraq. In fact, if you talked to most troops, they come back \nfrom Iraq, and then they start training, not for the range of missions \nour military force has to be prepared for but for their next deployment \ninto either Iraq or Afghanistan. In that time they have to squeeze in \ntime with their family, they have to squeeze in the administrative \ndetails that are part and parcel of being in home base.\n  Their training is being pressured. Some of the equipment they need to \ntrain is not there. It is already overseas and it remains over there. \nThere is this increasing concern that the only mission they are \ntraining for is counterinsurgency and urban combat, because Iraq \ndominates so much of the time, attention, and resources in the Army.\n  Another aspect of readiness is recruiting, and this high operational \ntempo has led the Army in some cases to miss their recruiting goals. \nRecently, they have been achieving those goals, but it is not without \nlowering standards, it is not without huge incentives or significant \nincentives. It is something that over the course of the next several \nmonths and years will show increasing strain and stress on the military \nforce, their ability to recruit, their ability to retain.\n  In 2005 the Army missed its active-duty recruiting targets by 8 \npercent. That was the first time they had ever missed recruiting \ntargets since 1999, and by a margin not seen since 1979, in the early \nyears of the volunteer Army. Since 2006 the Army has met its yearly \nrecruiting goals, but only by taking some extraordinary measures. In \n2007, more than 20 percent of the new Army recruits needed waivers; 57 \npercent for\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nconduct, 36 percent for medical reasons, and 7 percent for substance \nabuse. There was a time prior to Iraq when the Army prided itself on \napproving very few waivers and was trying to drive the standards up, \nnot lower the standards. Thus far in fiscal year 2008, only 82 percent \nof the recruits have high school diplomas. The longstanding goal of the \nArmy is at least 90 percent. The maximum age for new recruits has been \nraised from 35 to 42. Now, all of these soldiers are doing their job. \nBut we have to ensure, as we were doing before Iraq, that to the \ngreatest extent possible we increase the quality of our forces. All of \nthese reductions in standards will come with some cost as the Army \ncontinues to go forward.\n  There is another similar picture with respect to retention. The \nnumber of officers the Army needs grew by 8,000 as we increased the \nsize of the Army, with 58 percent of this group in captains and majors. \nAs the Army grows, they have to retain more and more of these captains \nand majors. While the overall officer loss rate for fiscal year 2007 \nequaled the 10-year average of 8.5 percent, this loss rate must drop to \n5 percent in order to maintain this increased size of the Army at these \ncritical positions of captains and majors.\n  What is happening is that the tempo of operations, the limited time \nwith family, the cycling in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, is causing \nthese very talented officers, captains, majors, senior noncommissioned \nofficers, to decide that they, for personal reasons, have to leave the \nservice. And this is depriving the military, not only today, but for \nmany years, of the talent and the skill they need, which is a great \nfactor in our military forces. We have got sophisticated equipment, but \nif we do not have the high quality officers, senior noncommissioned \nofficers, in all of our services, then we will not be as effective as \nwe must be. The cost over the long term is a loss of many talented \nyoung men and women who otherwise would be committed to a career in the \nmilitary.\n  We are taking efforts to retain these people with bonuses. But more \nand more what I am hearing is that the financial incentives, the other \nincentives, are not compensating for the time away from home, for the \ntreadmill in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the toll will mount \ndespite these incentives.\n  There is another aspect too of what is happening, and that is \nsomething that has become the signature injury of these operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan, that is, the increasing number of mental health \nissues arising within our forces. Post-deployment health reassessments \nwhich are administered to servicemembers 90 to 120 days after returning \nfrom deployment indicate that 38 percent of soldiers and 31 percent of \nmarines report psychological symptoms. The figure in the National Guard \nis 49 percent.\n  Of the 1.6 million military personnel who have served in Iraq or \nAfghanistan, almost 800,000 who have left active service are now \neligible for VA benefits, VA care. Of these almost 800,000 veterans, \nroughly 300,000, or 37 percent, have obtained VA health care since \n2001. Of this roughly 300,000, 40 percent, have been diagnosed with a \nmental disorder.\n  That is a staggering total, a consequence of the stress, the strain, \nthe types of combat situations, the types of weapons deployed against \nthem. But that is a staggering figure. If that number is projected \nthroughout all of those who have served, that is a huge number of \nactive personnel and veterans who are suffering some type of mental \nconsequence of their service in Iraq.\n  In January, Dr. William Winkenwerder, the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Health Affairs, announced the Army's suicide rate in Iraq \nhas been about a third higher than past rates for troops during \npeacetime, another very significant and very sobering statistic.\n  Anonymous postdeployment surveys show that 20 percent of married \nsoldiers plan to separate or divorce in 2006, another consequence of \nthis operational tempo.\n  The incidence of alcohol-related instances has substantially \nincreased over the last several years. The VA has identified that one \nin four homeless persons are veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThis is again another sobering statistic and a result of the operations \nthat are being conducted and the requirements to deal effectively and \nprincipally with those veterans who are returning and those active-duty \npersonnel who are returning.\n  We have encountered huge costs because of the failed strategy and \nincompetent execution of this operation in Iraq by the administration. \nWe have seen over the last several months a surge that was promoted as \ngiving the Iraqi Government the ability to reconcile itself, but that \nreconciliation has not yet been achieved.\n  We have seen, as I pointed out, that in Iraq today, probably the most \ninfluential country, certainly challenging us, is not a democratic \ncountry, but Iran, not a country that is committed as we are to the \nsame democratic principles.\n  The Maliki government is a Shia government. It is operated in \ncollaboration with the Kurds who have their own aspirations for \nautonomy.\n  The odd-group-out still remains the Sunni population. We have seen \nover the last several weeks operations in the south in Basra that \nstarted off inauspiciously and ended quickly with the help of Iran. We \nhave seen operations now directed against the Sadr's militiamen in Sadr \nCity, the JAM, the Mahdi army. This is rapidly becoming a fight not \nagainst international terrorism but a fight for power within Iraq among \nvarious factions and sectarian groups. We are being thrown into it day \nby day.\n  It also raises serious questions about, frankly, what we have done in \nthe last several years to prepare for this day, to prepare not only the \nmilitary forces in Iraq but the political institutions of Iraq to deal \neffectively and peacefully, we hope, with their citizens and to help \ndevelop a stable country that can stand on its own.\n  We are in a situation also where we have--and I think this was a \ncalculated risk, one that was taken and is working, but the question \nis, How long it will work?--recognized Sunni militias. They are called \nthe Sons of Iraq or Concerned Local Citizens. These groups are standing \nby at the moment watching as the Maliki government tries to assert its \nauthority over JAM and some of the Shia extremist groups. But their \nfuture direction is uncertain. We are paying them. We have lobbied \nheavily that the Government of Iraq assume this responsibility. But \nthere is a real question whether the Maliki government will ever truly \nrecognize the 91,000 Sunni militiamen who are organized in the country, \nand there is the real potential that without this integration, this is \nanother source of not only friction but of significant conflict in \nIraq.\n  There are numerous scenarios that could play out. One scenario is, if \nMaliki is successful to a degree in disrupting the Shia militias and \nthe JAM, he might decide it is now time to take care of the CLCs, the \nSons of Iraq. This could prompt significant fighting. The other \npossibility is that the Sunni militias, the Sons of Iraq, the CLC, \ndecide the moment is right for them to reassert themselves as a much \nmore powerful force in the political life of Iraq. None of this is \ncertain. But with each passing day, we are further away from weapons of \nmass destruction and international terrorism and al-Qaida. We are \ncloser and closer to a struggle between contending Iraqi forces for the \npower to run their country. That is a struggle they must resolve. We \ncannot. It is a struggle that indicates, again, that our course must be \nto change our policy, to assist legitimate forces to train to go after \nwhatever remnants of terrorism exist in the country and any place else \nin the world, and to at all times protect our forces.\n  Embedded in the supplemental is that policy decision which I hope we \nmake positively. If we can begin our redeployment, successfully and \nwithout deviation, from Iraq, then we can begin to focus on what to me \nare much more critical and central issues--al-Qaida elements in \nPakistan, the stability of the Government of Pakistan, renewed support \nfor the Government in Afghanistan, and the successful effort to not \nonly defeat the remnants of the Taliban but to do what we have not been \nable to yet, which is to create political institutions that will \noutlast us, that will be committed to a fair view of democracy and a \nfair view of the treatment of their own people. The economic \ninfrastructure to support such a\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\ngovernment, not through opium but through legitimate commercial \ntransaction, that, too, is a difficult task. And then, too, I think we \ncan focus and must focus our attention on Iran, dealing with their \nnuclear aspirations and also recognizing that ultimately our success in \nthe region of the Persian Gulf depends upon diplomatic efforts \ninvolving all countries in a positive way.\n  This is a tall order. It is a consequence of a misinformed strategy \nand failed implementation. I hope we can begin with this supplemental \nto change course, to move forward. I urge my colleagues to consider \nthis supplemental, consider the fact that we have to change direction \nin Iraq and redirect resources here in the United States. I hope in \nthat spirit we can pass this supplemental and move forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today with the hope that this \nChamber will soon find consensus in our efforts to find a new course \nand a new direction in Iraq.\n  I am more convinced than ever that we must change our mission in Iraq \nfrom one of combat to one of support. We must place the responsibility \nfor Iraq's future and for the security of its citizens in the hands of \nthe Government of the Iraqi people. Until we change our mission and we \ntake our military out of their streets, Iraqi politicians will not take \nthe necessary, courageous, and final steps toward a political \nreconciliation that can achieve a lasting peace for Iraq and for the \nregion.\n  Our military is performing admirably in difficult circumstances. They \nhave been tasked with calming streets that are wrought with sectarian \nconflict, with unraveling thousand-year-old webs of Sunni, Kurd, and \nShia rivalries, with understanding the mixture of motives behind car \nbombings, suicide bombings, roadside bombings, and mass executions. \nThey have been told that if they do this and slow the downward spiral \nof civil war, the Shiite-dominated Government will press for national \nreconciliation and a more stable, secure future for Iraq.\n  Our troops have done their job. The Iraqi Government has not done its \npart. The Maliki government in Iraq has failed to capitalize on the \nopportunities for success our soldiers have provided, and the \nadministration has failed to implement a political or a diplomatic \nstrategy that is worthy of their sacrifice on the battlefield.\n  ``There is no military solution . . . to the insurgency [in] Iraq.'' \nThat is a quote from General Petraeus. It is a quote General Petraeus \nmade to the world and to Members of this body many months ago. He was \nright then, and he is right today.\n  I believe the overwhelming majority of Senators have the same goals \nwith respect to our future policy in Iraq. In my view, we share four \nkey principles and ambitions.\n  First and foremost, every Senator in this Chamber wants a stable Iraq \nthat can protect its citizens without dependence on American combat \ntroops. Regardless of one's position on the merits or demerits of the \ninvasion, we must now help Iraq stand as a sovereign nation. We must \nroot out the terror cells that have set up shop since the invasion. And \nwe must guard against a failed state. We must also find a way to help \nthe 2 million Iraqis who fled across the border to Jordan, to Syria, \nand to Iran, as well as the nearly 2 million internally displaced \npersons who have fled the violence of their neighborhoods. It is the \nlargest refugee crisis in the world today.\n  Second, we generally agree that our military mission in Iraq must \ntransition at some point from one of combat to one of support. We must \nhave the ultimate goal of bringing our troops home. We may disagree \nabout the number or the timing of troop drawdowns, but we all know we \ncannot sustain 15 to 20 brigade combat teams in Iraq indefinitely. It \nwill take courage and conviction to shift our mission and to bring our \ntroops home, but if Iraq is truly to stand on its own, we must take the \ndecisive action so we can begin that transition.\n  The third point on which I believe we can, by and large, agree is \nthat this war has been poorly managed. The administration made a series \nof disastrous mistakes and gross miscalculations after the invasion. \nFailing to plan for a postwar Iraq, disbanding the Iraqi Army, purging \nBaathist technocrats from the Government, staffing the Coalition \nProvisional Authority with neophytes, sending our troops into harm's \nway without body armor or armored vehicles--these blunders have cost \nAmerica dearly. They have eroded this administration's credibility, and \nthey have cost us in lives and treasure.\n  Fourth, I believe there is a widely shared view in this Chamber that \nthe United States should focus its military and diplomatic efforts on \nthe most pressing threats to national security. Senators on both sides \nof the aisle agree that our top national security priorities should be \nto capture the men who were behind the attacks of September 11, to \nbreak up the terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, \nand to confront the nuclear threats that we see, especially from Iran.\n  Sustaining 140,000 troops in Iraq limits our ability to prosecute the \nwar on terror where terrorist training camps are actually located. Our \ntop intelligence analysts have concluded that al-Qaida has regrouped--\nhas regrouped stronger than ever--on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. \nWhile it is true that al-Qaida in Iraq is a franchise, al-Qaida's main \nheadquarters are elsewhere and not in Iraq.\n  Furthermore, prolonged commitments in Iraq limit our strategic \nflexibility should we need to respond to threats elsewhere around the \nworld. We must evaluate whether putting all of our eggs in one basket \nin Iraq is the best strategy to protect America against threats and \nfuture attacks.\n  On these four points, I believe we should be able to find consensus \nin this Chamber. Our goal of stability in Iraq, our desire to start \nbringing our troops home, our shared frustration with the management of \nthis war, and our concern that escalation in Iraq is weakening our \ndefenses against terrorist threats and nuclear proliferation--these \nfour points of agreement lead to the conclusion that we must find a new \nway forward in Iraq.\n  The wise heads of the Iraq Study Group laid the groundwork many \nmonths ago for a comprehensive strategy on how we would move forward in \nIraq. We commissioned out of this Congress our finest and most \nexperienced foreign policy experts, led by former Secretary of State \nJames Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, to provide us an \nobjective and bipartisan set of recommendations on how we should \nproceed forward in this intractable war. I have reviewed this report \nmultiple times, the report of the Iraq Study Group. That report was \nreleased at the end of 2006. It is a small book, but it contains great \nwisdom of our top diplomats, military commanders, and statesmen from \naround our country and, indeed, around the world.\n  The report of the Iraq Study Group laid out a political, diplomatic, \nand military strategy for how we create the conditions to end this \nwar. Its core military recommendation is simple: It is time to \ntransition our troops from a mission of combat to a mission of \ntraining, equipping, advising, and support of the Iraq military. Iraq \nmust take responsibility for its own security, and it must be forced to \ntake the political steps necessary toward that reconciliation.\n\n  Unlike the President's policy, the Iraq Study Group's prescriptions \ncouple a military strategy with a robust and effective diplomatic and \npolitical strategy. The group recommended making our economic and \nmilitary support contingent upon the Iraq Government devising and \nachieving specific benchmarks. While the Iraqis have made some progress \nin achieving these benchmarks, much remains to be done, and most of \nthese benchmarks have not been met.\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\n  Finally, the report makes it very clear we need a diplomatic \noffensive to help change the equation in the Middle East. Under this \ndiplomatic push, we would reach out to potential partners in the \nregion, engaging those partners in the region as we strive to have a \nstake in creating long-lasting peace and stability in Iraq.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes now speaking about the Iraq war \nprovisions in the supplemental which is later on in the day formally \nbefore the Senate. The bill before us contains many of the propositions \nthat would change our Iraq policy in ways that are consistent with the \nIraq Study Group's core recommendations. First and foremost, the bill \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that our troops' mission should \nchange from combat operations to counterterrorism, training and \nsupporting Iraqi forces, and force protection. It would set a \nreasonable goal--not a deadline, a reasonable goal--of June 2009 to \ncomplete this transition. This goal is some 15 months past the date of \nMarch of 2008, which the Iraq Study Group originally proposed as its \ntarget date for the completion of this transition.\n  This bill would require the Iraq Government to stand up to its own \nresponsibilities in important ways. It would be required to match any \nfunds we spend for training of Iraqi security forces or for \nreconstruction. This legislation would ensure that the U.S. military \npays the same price at the pump as Iraqi civilians are paying today, by \nrequiring the Iraq Government to provide the same kind of support for \nthe fuel costs we are using to protect Iraq today. We are spending $12 \nbillion of America's taxpayer dollars each month in Iraq. We are \nspending $12 billion of American taxpayer dollars each month in Iraq. \nAfter more than 5 years of this war, in my view, it is time for the \nIraq Government to share this financial burden.\n  We also need to recognize that this administration's policies have \nstretched our military to the breaking point. Our troops are away from \ntheir families too long, they do not get enough time to train, and \nreadiness is suffering. Under this legislation, the President would \nhave to certify that troops are fully trained and equipped before they \nare deployed to Iraq. It would place a time limit on combat deployments \nand ensure that our troops have sufficient dwell time between tours.\n  Finally, the bill would ban permanent U.S. bases on Iraqi soil and \nrequire that any mutual defense agreements with Iraq must be approved \nby this Congress and by this Senate.\n  It is not enough to simply endorse a set of military tactics and hope \nfor the best, which is what the President of the United States has \ndone. The solution in Iraq, our military commanders tell us, is one \nwhich is not a military solution but one which combines all those \nelements that were set forth in the Iraq Study Group.\n  Henry Kissinger once said America needs to rid itself of ``the \nillusion that there are military answers to our security, and that \npolicy ends where strategy begins.''\n  We would be wise to heed Kissinger's advice in this age of turmoil. \nThere are no easy answers in Iraq, no easy exits, no certainty of \nsuccess. To stay on the President's path of more of the same is simply \nto embrace a policy that is not working--the same dogmatic leadership \nthat led us into war, the same dogmatic leadership that failed to make \na postinvasion plan, the same dogmatic leadership that chases the hope \nof a mission accomplished without regard to learning the lessons of the \nfailures of the past.\n  To charge a new path--to build a political, diplomatic, and military \nstrategy in Iraq--is to embrace the role of a statesman. For it is a \nstatesman, Kissinger used to say, who takes responsibility for all the \nfavorable results if everything goes as planned but also for all the \nundesirable results if they do not.\n  To serve as statesmen is our role. This is our role as Senators.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes speaking \nabout the farm bill. We will be considering an override of the \nPresident's veto hopefully later on this afternoon.\n  As I understand, a few hours ago, the President went ahead and vetoed \nthis bill which we worked on so hard in this Chamber for the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years, under the great leadership of Senator Harkin, Senator \nChambliss, Senator Baucus, and Senator Grassley, along with Senator \nConrad and so many of my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee as \nwell as the Senate Finance Committee. Hopefully, we can override the \nPresident's veto quickly because what is at stake is the security of \nAmerica in so many different ways.\n  From what my colleagues tell me, this is the best farm bill we have \nwritten in the Congress in the last several decades. For me, there are \nsignificant portions of this bill which open whole new opportunities \nfor America, and I wish to spend a few minutes talking about what I \nthink some of those opportunities are.\n  First and foremost, we need to remind the Nation this is a bill about \nfeeding the hungry. It is a bill about nutrition. Nearly 70 percent of \nthe money under this legislation will go to feed the most vulnerable \npeople in America, including providing healthy food--fruits and \nvegetables--for the young people of America. For my State alone, what \nthis will mean--I come from a small State of some 5 million people--is \nthat about $45 million a year in fruits and vegetables will go to help \nour young kids who are in school so they can learn healthy eating \nhabits and so they can be in an environment where they can truly learn. \nSo nutrition is a very big part of this legislation. It is why hunger \nadvocates, the faith community, schools, and so many others have been \nbeating the drum so loudly for us to get this bill completed.\n  Second is rural development. Rural development is a huge issue for \nmuch of this country. Today across America there are some 1,700 \ncounties, and more than half the counties of America are designated as \nrural. About 800 of those counties lost population in the last few \nyears. It is part of the America that is withering on the vine. Many of \nthe provisions of this farm bill, including rural development sections \nof this farm bill, will help this part of America, which seems to be \nleft out, to be put into a position of being second class. This farm \nbill invests heavily in rural America through the rural development \nprograms that are included in this legislation.\n  Third is conservation. Through the leadership of Senator Harkin and \nhis vision for what we do with conservation, the $3 billion-plus that \nis added for conservation in this farm bill will help us make sure the \nconservation ethic we have pursued in this country is something we can \npreserve for a long time to come.\n  Fourth, title IX of this farm bill is the energy title. In that title \nof the farm bill, we continue a policy which has been a bipartisan \npolicy of this Congress to try to get rid of our dependence on foreign \noil and to try to harness the power of the wind, the power of \ncellulosic ethanol, the power of hydroelectricity, the power of \ngeothermal, and so many other renewable energy resources. Rural America \nstands ready to grasp the reins of responsibility and opportunity to \nhelp us achieve energy independence in a real way. So the energy \nsection of this bill is a very important part of it, and so many people \nhave been a part of this and have worked on this legislation.\n  Finally, I would say this is work which has involved the \nadministration now for 2\\1/2\\ years. It baffles me that this President \nwould turn his back on the people of America by vetoing this\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\nfarm bill, knowing his administration has been helping us craft this \nbill. The excuse I have heard, which has been out there in public, is \nthis farm bill raises taxes. This farm bill doesn't raise any taxes at \nall. Unlike the fiscal recklessness we have seen over the last 7 years \nwith this administration, what we have done is we have paid for this \nbill. This bill is 100 percent paid for, and it is paid for without a \ntax increase. It is paid for with the reforms we have included in this \nfarm bill.\n  So I am hopeful when this legislation does get over here to the floor \nfor the consideration of the override of the President's veto, we will \nhave a near acclamation of a vote against the President's veto of the \nfarm bill.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we debate the supplemental, I want to \nspeak about the importance of extending unemployment insurance to our \neconomy and to so many of our fellow Americans.\n  I know if Senator Kennedy were on the Senate floor today, he would be \nleading this effort, lending his powerful voice, as he always does, \nwith fervor and passion on behalf of those in this Nation who are in \nneed. I certainly hope and pray that he will be with us once again \nlending his voice to this and so many other critical issues.\n  Mr. President, we know there are Americans in need. These are \ndifficult economic times, not just for Americans on the bottom of the \neconomic ladder but for Americans from all walks of life.\n  In the past year alone, as this chart indicates, losses in the stock \nmarket and in home values have totaled $2.7 trillion each--that is \ntrillion with a ``t.'' Foreclosures have risen 130 percent since 2006. \nSome 20,000 families lose their homes every week. This combination of a \ncredit and housing crisis isn't just affecting Wall Street or \nhomeowners, but it is reaching throughout our economy and putting a \nstrain on businesses, large and small, from factories to restaurants.\n  Under the pressure of this economic squeeze, the economy has lost \n260,000 jobs in the last 4 months alone. Beyond just the loss of the \njobs, what is hurting those who have lost a job is the time it is \ntaking to find a new job. These are not individuals who are just \nsitting back and waiting for someone to offer them a job. These are \npeople who are actively engaged in the labor market and looking for \ngainful employment, looking for the dignity of a job.\n  This chart shows us the average length of unemployment has risen to \nalmost 17 weeks--longer than at any time Congress has extended benefits \nin the past 30 years. In my State of New Jersey, each week some 3,000 \nmore unemployed workers are exhausting their benefits. It is not that \nthey are sitting back at home. They are engaged in the market looking \nfor jobs--many times even outside of their field, simply to be \ngainfully employed.\n  While we certainly hope some of the recent efforts we have performed \nin the Congress to stimulate our economy will be successful, there are \nstill troubling signs. Long-term unemployment is higher now than before \nthe last recession. Mr. President, 17.8 percent of people unemployed \nfind themselves searching for a job for over 27 weeks. That is a 58-\npercent increase since the year 2001. Statistics show those who are \nunemployed are going to have a very difficult time finding a job, as \nthere are 7.6 million unemployed Americans competing for only 3.8 \nmillion jobs. That is two workers for every job.\n  Some are struggling more than others. Veterans and minorities have \nbeen disproportionately burdened by our struggling labor market. Young \nmale veterans who answered the call to protect our Nation after \nSeptember 11, 2001, are now faced with an 11.2-percent unemployment \nrate--well over twice the national average. A total of 21,588 newly \ndischarged veterans are now unemployed and collecting unemployment \ninsurance.\n  It seems to me the last thing these brave men and women who risked \ntheir lives dodging bullets and IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan should \nhave to worry about is finding a job when they come home. And when they \ncannot, it seems to me the last thing they should have to worry about \nis not having any income to sustain themselves and their families. Now \nthey are standing in an unemployment line, and pretty soon they will \nnot be able to do that either.\n  Minorities are also being hit especially hard by our current economic \nconditions. For Hispanics, unemployment has grown to 6.9 percent. For \nAfrican Americans, unemployment has grown 8.6 percent. Both are well \nbeyond the national average. We cannot ignore the fact that the \nsubprime crisis has also disproportionately affected some communities \nmore than others. Unfortunately, for many of these hard-working \nAmericans, their hope of obtaining and continuing to keep the American \ndream has instead become a personal nightmare.\n  These statistics are not just numbers. The 260,000 jobs lost this \nyear, the 7.6 million Americans who are unemployed, the 21,000 veterans \ncollecting unemployment--this is not just economic data. Behind each \nnumber is a story and an American worker who is struggling.\n  Let's take a moment to imagine what it would be like to be one of \nthese workers. All of the Members of the Senate are gainfully employed. \nBut try to put yourself in the shoes of one of these American workers. \nImagine you have two kids, you have a mortgage to pay, and you just \nlost your job. That alone is a scenario that could lead any family into \nhard times. If you are also facing foreclosure because of a bad \nsubprime mortgage that has reset to a higher rate, or if losing your \njob meant losing your health care insurance that provided coverage for \nyour children, imagine how powerless you would feel. Imagine the \nuncertainty of not being able to find a job, not being able to pay for \nyour child's college education for the next semester, not being able to \nkeep the home in which your children grew up. Imagine what that must be \nlike.\n  Mr. President, there are hundreds of thousands of Americans facing \nthese very dire circumstances, who know all too well, unfortunately, \nwhat it feels like. It is up to us to lend them a helping hand during \ntheir darkest days. That is what the extension of unemployment benefits \nin the supplemental will accomplish.\n  On top of that, we also know extending unemployment is one of the \nmost effective ways to help the economy. For every dollar the \nGovernment provides in unemployment insurance, $1.64 goes right into \nour economy.\n  While I, along with many of my colleagues, believed this should have \nbeen part of the stimulus we had earlier, I am pleased we have another \nchance.\n  Today, as unemployment and the cost of living continue to rise, it is \neven more imperative to act now and do what is right. Mr. President, \n1.4 million workers have been actively looking for a job for more than \n6 months--half a year of their life actively looking for a job. As it \nis becoming harder to find a job, more families are running out of \ntheir unemployment benefits. Thirty-six percent of workers exhaust \ntheir benefits before finding a job, and many expect that number to \nincrease. In March of this year, 45 percent of New Jerseyans receiving \nunemployment insurance exhausted their benefits before finding a new \njob.\n  We have a chance to fairly and reasonably address the challenges that \nlong-term unemployment are creating for many fellow Americans. \nExtending unemployment insurance will help those who are hit hardest \nand give the economy a much needed shot in the arm.\n  We have this opportunity to act, and act now. I cannot understand \nwhen those who try every day, get up and go\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nout into the market to try to find a job--when we have twice the number \nof Americans as there are jobs competing for employment--why we are \nsaying to veterans who have come back and others who are standing on an \nunemployment line that soon that will be cut off as well. It is \nunconscionable.\n  We have an opportunity to change that in this supplemental. I hope \nour colleagues who enjoy the benefits of gainful employment will give \nthe American workers the helping hand they need and stimulate our \neconomy by supporting the extension of the unemployment insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about two \nimportant components of the domestic supplemental bill which, in my \nview, must be passed whenever we end up considering that legislation, \nand that is the new GI educational bill and the billion dollars in the \nbill for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program.\n  As an early cosponsor of the post-9/11 Veterans Educational \nAssistance Act, I am here today to ask my colleagues not only to pass \nthis legislation but pass it with big numbers so if President Bush \ndecides to veto it, we will have the votes--and he knows we will have \nthe votes--to override that veto.\n  The soldiers who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have paid a very \nheavy toll. In Iraq alone, over 4,000 have died, over 30,000 have been \ninjured, and tens of thousands more have come home with post-traumatic \nstress disorder and traumatic brain injury.\n  In my State of Vermont, middle-aged dads and moms have left their \nfamilies, they have left their kids, they have left their jobs, and \nthey have joined their fellow members of the National Guard and Reserve \nin a kind of war they never dreamed they would be fighting. But they \nwent to war and they did their jobs, and they did their jobs well and \nwithout complaint. They gave as much as they could give for their \ncountry, and now it is our turn to give back, not only for them but for \nthe well-being of our entire economy.\n  The original GI bill was an appropriate way for a grateful nation to \nsay thank you for the service and sacrifice of those who wore our \ncountry's uniform. That bill was not only a way to express our \nappreciation to the greatest generation, but it enabled millions of \nAmericans to get a college education, and by doing that, it helped \nreshape the American economy, it created immense wealth, and allowed \nmillions of Americans to enter the middle class.\n  There are, in fact, those who believe that the GI bill was one of the \nmajor reasons for the strong economic spurt this country enjoyed from \nthe end of World War II to the early 1970s.\n  Unfortunately, as many returning soldiers understand, today's GI \neducational benefits do not match up with what the World War II \nveterans received and do not come close today to covering the cost of a \ncollege education. That is why it is so important that we update these \nbenefits by passing the new GI bill, both for our Active-Duty soldiers \nand for the National Guard and Reserve.\n  As a nation, we must understand that caring for our servicemembers is \npart of the cost of going to war. If we are going to go to war, we \ncannot forget about the men and women who put their lives on the line \nand returned from that war.\n  There are some who say this bill is too generous for our \nservicemembers, that we cannot afford to provide these benefits. I \ndisagree. If we can spend $12 billion every single month paying for the \ncost of the war in Iraq, we surely can spend the equivalent of 4 months \nof that war to pay for the cost of the educational benefits for these \nmen and women for a 10-year period.\n  The new GI bill will cover the highest in-State undergraduate tuition \nat a public college or university where the veteran is enrolled, plus a \nliving stipend, and would be based on how long the veteran served in \nactive duty. This money could also be applied to law school, medical \nschool, or approved programs of study.\n  This is an extremely important piece of legislation. I congratulate \nSenator Webb for offering it. And now it is our job to pass it.\n  There is another component of the domestic supplemental that also \nmust be passed, and that is the $1 billion in additional funding for \nLIHEAP that was included in the supplemental appropriations bill \nthrough the adoption of an amendment by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland. I thank Senator Reed for offering that amendment and for \ngetting it passed in the Appropriations Committee by a bipartisan vote \nof 20 to 9, which included 5 Republicans.\n  Furthermore, I have been active on that issue by authoring a letter, \nwhich was cosigned by 20 of my colleagues, including 4 Republicans, who \nalso understand the absolute imperative for increasing funding for \nLIHEAP.\n  Two years ago, under the leadership of Senator Snowe and many other \nSenators, LIHEAP funding was increased by $1 billion above the \nappropriated level because it was well understood that at that time, we \nfaced a home heating emergency. I strongly agreed with that assessment. \nBut if we faced a home heating emergency a year ago, we face a much \nmore severe home heating emergency today, and that is because the price \nof heating oil and propane are escalating off the roof. They are much \nhigher today than they were several years ago. It is absolutely \nimperative that we significantly increase funding for LIHEAP if we are \nnot to see the purchasing power of this program eviscerated.\n  While $1 billion is a good step forward, the truth is, we are going \nto need a lot more than that to keep pace and level fund in terms of \nreal dollars what the American people are receiving from LIHEAP.\n  Two years ago, as you know, the price of heating oil was less than \n$2.50 a gallon. Today it is about $4.50 a gallon. What I can tell you \nis that last winter in the State of Vermont, there were families unable \nto heat their homes. Families with children became sick because the \ntemperature in those homes was too low. That was last winter. Certainly \nif that was the case last winter, it will only be worse next winter.\n  Let us be very clear that the LIHEAP program addresses not only \nfamilies who are worried about keeping warm in the wintertime, it also \naddresses the very serious problem of families, especially older \npeople, who, when the weather gets 100-plus degrees, will be too warm \nin the summertime.\n  It also addresses the issue of more and more Americans having their \nelectricity disconnected. According to the National Energy Assistance \nDirectors Association, which represents the State directors of LIHEAP, \na recordbreaking 15.6 million American families, or nearly 15 percent \nof all households, are at least 30 days late in paying their utility \nbills. Several States have laws on the books that impose a moratorium \non cutting off essential utility services in the winter. However, these \nutility shutoff moratoriums expire during the spring. Without \nadditional LIHEAP funding, senior citizens on fixed income, low-income \nfamilies with children, and persons with disabilities from all across \nthis country are in danger of having their essential utility services \nshut off this spring. This is going on in California, Iowa, \nMassachusetts--all over this country. Rapidly rising energy costs are \nthe major reason so many Americans are late in paying their energy \nbills. It is extremely important, therefore, that additional LIHEAP \nfunding be included in the supplemental to address these urgent needs.\n  I hope very much when we get around to addressing the domestic \nsupplemental bill that, A, we absolutely pass this legislation with \nstrong numbers for our veterans to give them the educational \nopportunities they need and our country needs and, B, let us not forget \nthat with the cost of gas and oil soaring, millions of Americans will \ngo cold next winter. There are people who will suffer this summer \nunless we pass an expanded LIHEAP program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I begin on the budget conference \nreport, I wish to say publicly how the entire Senate family is thinking \nabout Senator Kennedy and Vicki and the family, how much we miss him, \nhis presence on the floor, how much we miss his presence at our caucus, \nand how much all of us are fervently hoping for his full and quick \nrecovery.\n  If there is anybody who can beat this, it is Ted Kennedy. He is a \nlion. Rarely have I ever met somebody of such force of will, somebody \nwho is so totally dedicated to serving the people whom he represents, \nsomeone who cares so deeply about America's democracy, about this \ninstitution.\n  On both sides of the aisle, I have had many Senators say to me: Ted \nKennedy is simply the most productive Senator among us. Nobody turns \nout more work, more quality work than he does. Whether you agree with \nhis legislative positions or disagree, you have to admire the \nincredible energy and devotion that he brings to the job, the respect \nhe has for this institution, and his determination to advance causes in \nwhich he believes.\n  My family has been close to the Kennedy family for many years. When \nJohn Kennedy's advance people came to North Dakota or Robert's advance \npeople or Ted Kennedy's, they always stayed with my family. So I have \nalways felt a very close association with the Kennedy family.\n  Anybody who looks back on his extraordinary service here, virtually \nunparalleled in the history of the Senate, has to have profound respect \nfor Ted Kennedy, for his work, his values, his deep and abiding love of \nthis country, and of the institution of the Congress, and his respect \nfor the Presidency of the United States.\n  I want Senator Kennedy to know that all of us here are pulling for \nhim. I want Vicki to know that we stand ready to do whatever we can to \nlighten her burden and the burden of the rest of the family.\n  I deeply admire Senator Kennedy. Also, what a light he is in this \nChamber. He uplifts the rest of us. I have seen many times, when others \nwere stricken in this Chamber, the first person to call was Ted \nKennedy, always eager to help when somebody faced a tragedy.\n  We are thinking about Ted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am so grateful to the Senator. I wish to \nassociate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota and tell him I don't know anybody in the Senate who feels \nmore deeply about Senator Kennedy than I do. We have been adversaries \nfor 32 years. We have also been partners.\n  I have watched what their family has given to America. I love his \nsisters. I love the in-laws. I know he raised the children, and they \nare good kids. I have great faith in Ted Kennedy as a person who will \nfight back with the faith and prayers of all of us in the Senate and \nmillions of others across the country. I believe Ted will be able to \ncome back, and he will come back, and I believe he will be able to whip \nthis problem. I am going to exert all the faith and prayers I possibly \ncan to help him do it.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator, whenever any of us \nencountered great difficulty, he was always the first to call.\n  We have worked together on so many pieces of legislation, landmark \nlegislation, that I wish to personally compliment him for being willing \nto cross the aisle in so many ways and to work out difficulties. One of \nthe last things we worked on was the bio bill. That is a very complex, \ndifficult bill, and we worked along with Senator Enzi, who is a \nwonderful companion of Senator Kennedy on the HELP Committee. We worked \nwith Senator Clinton, who added a great deal to the work on that bill. \nSenator Schumer was a great asset on that bill. These are people for \nwhom I have great respect.\n  Let me say to Ted and Vicki that our prayers and our faith are with \nboth of them and their children and the rest of the extended family, \nand we will do everything in our power to support Senator Kennedy in \nthis time of difficulty. I personally believe that if we have enough \nfaith and pray hard enough and with the great clinical help he will \nhave, Senator Kennedy will return and continue to do the job he \nbelieves in. I know he appreciates everybody who has spoken out for \nhim, who has expressed concern, who has expressed anguish, as I do \nhere, about his present situation. I know he is facing this with a \ngreat sense of humor, which is one of the most endearing qualities Ted \nKennedy has, among many endearing qualities.\n  He carries so much weight on the Democrat side and, of course, for \nthose of us who work with him on the Republican side, a lot of weight \nwith us as well. So I want him to know we all love him, appreciate him, \nand appreciate the leadership he has provided through the years and the \nquality of the person he is.\n  If the distinguished Senator would allow me to address another topic, \nI would be very grateful.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these new sets of remarks \nbe placed in the Record at an appropriate place.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will have more to say about Senator Kennedy later, but I \nwanted to make those few remarks here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4588-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4588-S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMBATING CHILD EXPLOITATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the exploitation of children is a plague. \nIt is a war with many fronts, and we must be engaged in them all. I \nwish to review some of the ways we are fighting this good fight and \nencourage my colleagues to be as relentless in protecting children as \nare those in the world who exploit them.\n  Just 2 days ago, the Supreme Court upheld our most recent attempt to \ncombat the spread of child pornography. In a 7-to-2 decision--an \noverwhelming vote by the Supreme Court, by the way--the Court held that \nthe PROTECT Act is consistent with the first amendment. I introduced \nthe PROTECT Act in January 2003. It passed this body unanimously in \nFebruary, passed the House without objection in March, and was signed \ninto law in April. The PROTECT Act prohibits the pandering or \nsolicitation of child pornography.\n  Child pornography is perhaps the most egregious form of exploitation. \nIt not only victimizes and brutalizes children directly but makes a \npermanent record of that abuse that may never be erased. Child \npornography is not protected by the first amendment, which means its \npossession and sale can be banned.\n  In 2002, the Supreme Court struck down the Child Pornography \nPrevention Act, a bill I introduced in the 104th Congress. So we went \nback to the drawing board. If the objective is important--and I do not \nbelieve any objective is more important than protecting children from \nexploitation--then we must not take no for an answer. We must not let \nspeed bumps,\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\nroadblocks, or potholes, or Supreme Court decisions stop us.\n  The PROTECT Act was the result. We studied the Supreme Court's \ndecision and used its guidance to craft a bill that would prohibit the \noffer to distribute or the request to receive child pornography. When \nit upheld the PROTECT Act this week, the Court said that the speech \nthis law targets is what literally introduces this destructive material \ninto the distribution network. Now the PROTECT Act can be deployed in \nour ongoing, never-ending fight to protect children from exploitation, \nand I am glad it can be deployed.\n  I thank my colleagues for not giving up, for not throwing up your \nhands when the Supreme Court initially said no. I thank you for rolling \nup your sleeves, for joining with me to find some way to protect \nchildren.\n  Let me quote from the closing paragraph of Justice Antonin Scalia's \nopinion this week in United States v. Williams:\n\n       Child pornography harms and debases the most defenseless of \n     our citizens. This court held unconstitutional Congress' \n     previous attempt to meet this new threat, and Congress \n     responded with a carefully crafted attempt to eliminate the \n     First Amendment problems we identified. As far as the \n     provision at issue in this case is concerned, that effort was \n     successful.\n\n  While the 108th Congress passed the PROTECT Act, the 109th Congress \npassed the Adam Walsh Act. The Adam Walsh Act was a comprehensive child \nprotection bill hailed by agencies and organizations throughout this \ncountry for its importance.\n  This legislation enhanced the Web technology available for tracking \nconvicted sex offenders and replaced outdated and inaccurate Web sites \nwith meaningful tools to protect children.\n  Today, there are more than half a million registered sex offenders in \nthe United States. Unfortunately, many of them receive limited \nsentences and roam invisibly through our communities. With too many, we \ndon't know where they are until it is too late. Under this law, \noffenders are now required to report regularly to the authorities in \nperson and let them know when they move or change jobs. If they do not \nwant to follow the rules, they will go back to jail because failure to \nprovide meaningful information is now a felony. In addition, the law \ncreated a searchable national Web site that interacts with State sites. \nCitizens in every State are able to inform themselves about predators \nin their communities with accurate information.\n\n  Unfortunately, many of the enforcement provisions in the Adam Walsh \nAct have not been funded, and I am fully aware of the competing demands \nfor funding but have no doubt that Americans throughout this country \nwould approve of Federal tax dollars being utilized to ensure that \ncriminals who blatantly trade in child pornography are made to pay a \nhigh price for these crimes. I urge my colleagues to show their \ndedication and resolve to fully fund the Adam Walsh Act.\n  In another important development, last night the Senate passed the \nProtect Our Children First Act. I joined Senator Leahy in introducing \nthis legislation last July, and it is now on its way to the President \nto be signed into law. This legislation authorizes continued funding \nfor the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a center we \nhelped to create. The collective expertise of the center has been \ninvaluable in efforts to address child exploitation, and this bill will \nensure their vital work will continue.\n  With all of the tremendous advantages brought about by the Internet, \nit has also provided a means of communication which criminals use to \nadvance their crimes. We are all aware that pedophiles are utilizing \nthe Internet to facilitate distribution of illegal child pornography. \nEveryone agrees this type of crime is the most heinous imaginable, but \nmany think the people who trade these horrendous videos and pictures \nmust set up elaborate technology to facilitate their illegal \nactivities. Unfortunately, this is not true. Many individuals \nthroughout this country utilize peer-to-peer software to share illegal \nchild porn with as much ease as sharing MP3s. Many criminals don't even \nbother trying to hide what they are doing. They utilize graphic words \nand acronyms to describe the horrible pictures and videos which they \nwillingly share with one another. They seem to have no fear of being \ncaught by law enforcement.\n  To illustrate this point, I want to highlight a graphical \nrepresentation of the locations where law enforcement determined child \npornography videos were hosted on computers and shared via peer-to-peer \nsoftware. It is as disturbing as it is eye-opening.\n  This map shows the continental United States and locations where \nchild pornography was electronically traded on May 15, 2008. This is \njust 1 day in the life of this country--6 days ago, as a matter of \nfact. And it is not meant to be all-inclusive; these are the ones we \nknow of. You can imagine how many there must be. Just in the DC area, \nlook at the child pornography electronic trades. And those are the ones \nwe know about.\n  Now, this type of activity has created a market for new child \npornography. In order to move into the higher echelons of this criminal \nactivity, individuals need to offer new material, new graphic pictures \nand videos. Many of these criminals find that the easiest way to get \nnew materials is to make it themselves; thus, a vicious cycle is \ncreated. These monsters, in some sick, sadistic goal of obtaining \nstature, videotape their crimes against children in order to facilitate \ntheir twisted version of moving up the ladder.\n  Congress has done a great deal to address this issue. We have passed \nnumerous statutes in order to ensure those who harm children face the \nmost serious penalties possible.\n  While many local law enforcement agencies are doing a fantastic job \naddressing these crimes, they are often limited by a lack of manpower \nand equipment. One program that has had great success is the Internet \nCrimes Against Children--the ICAC--Task Force Program, which has \nutilized State and local law enforcement agencies to develop an \neffective response to child pornography cases. These ICACs provide \nforensic and investigative activities, training and technical \nassistance, victim services, and community education.\n  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation, which I \ncosponsored with Senator Biden of Delaware, which would take \nsignificant steps in highlighting the Federal Government's strategy to \naddress child exploitation and ensuring that each State has an ICAC.\n  The bill also calls for an annual report from the Attorney General, \nwhich will represent the national strategy for child exploitation, \nprevention, and interdiction. I believe this report will be invaluable \nfor the effective coordination of Government efforts to address this \nproblem.\n  I have no doubts this legislation will be instrumental in combating \nchild exploitation, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill quickly.\n  I also wish to mention another extremely valuable organization that \nis playing a vital role in locating missing children. A Child is \nMissing is a nonprofit organization assisting the police in the first \nhours after a child's disappearance. For over 10 years, this \norganization has provided local law enforcement with technology \notherwise unavailable to them.\n  Here is how the program works. When a child is missing, local law \nenforcement contacts the organization with details of the \ndisappearance, including the child's description, clothes, and last \nknown location. A Child is Missing records a message on behalf of the \npolice agency, and this message is phoned out to the geographical area \nwhere the child was last seen. The organization has the ability to send \nover 1,000 calls in 60 seconds. This message asks for residents to \ncontact the police if they have any information.\n  The effect is instantaneous in that this service opens the eyes of \nthe entire neighborhood in search for the missing child. We all know \nthese first few hours are critical in finding missing children, making \nthis service critical. This is the only program of its kind in the \ncountry, and law enforcement has credited it with over 300 safe \nassisted recoveries. This service is available to law enforcement \nthroughout the country and at no charge to the agencies. It operates 24 \nhours a day, 365 days a year.\n  I have joined Senator Menendez in introducing legislation, S. 2667, \nto ensure that this organization will have the funds to continue to \noffer law enforcement throughout this country this invaluable service. \nI am hopeful this bill receives prompt consideration.\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\n  In conclusion, Congress has many opportunities to advance the worthy \ncause of reducing child exploitation. I call on my colleagues to \ncontinue this noble cause and pledge my continued support to advance \nappropriate legislative endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4590-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Finally, I wish to briefly turn to FISA. This Congress has \nbeen working on FISA modernization for over 400 days with apparently no \nend in sight. Should it take this long? The Constitution of the United \nStates was written in about 115 days. That included travel time on \nhorseback for the Founding Fathers.\n  Congress has had plenty of time to debate this issue. We have to make \nsure we do not create unnecessary obstacles for intelligence analysts \nto track terrorists. As has been said, they can't connect the dots if \nthey can't collect the dots.\n  While negotiations continue, it is important to look at the two bills \nthat have passed the Chambers. Let me paint a picture, a Tale of Two \nBills, if you will. One bill was available for the public to review for \nover 4 months, went through 2 committees, had 2 weeks of floor debate \nincluding votes on 13 amendments, and passed the Chamber with a huge \nbipartisan veto-proof majority.\n  The other bill was available for review for 2 days before receiving a \nvote. It went through no committees, had 1 hour of floor debate, \nallowed no amendments, and failed to receive bipartisan support, while \nbarely passing the Chamber. Any negotiator would say the first bill in \nthis instance would be the basis for negotiation, not the other way \naround. I am sure it is no surprise to anyone that the first one I \ndescribed is the Senate-passed bill.\n  Make no mistake, I will not support any compromise that disregards \nthe extensive work of the Senate in order to facilitate a quick \npolitical fix.\n  I appreciate those who are standing tall on the FISA bill in both \nHouses. I hope we continue to do so because our very country is in \njeopardy if we do not.\n  Also, I wish to personally pay tribute and give my gratitude and \nthanks to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his kindness \nin allowing me to make these remarks out of turn because they are \nimportant remarks. I would feel badly if I didn't get on the floor and \nmake these remarks. It was a very gracious thing for him to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague, Senator Hatch. He is always \ngracious. I also thank him for his words on Senator Kennedy because we \nknow they have shared a close association in the Chamber for many \nyears.\n  I also thank him for his leadership on child pornography. It is \npretty sick, some of the things that go on. It is almost hard to \nbelieve. I saw the slide the Senator from Utah showed about activity on \njust 1 day of this year, earlier this month. It is almost hard to \ncomprehend. We thank him for his leadership there as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his kindness.

Madam President, we are now considering the conference \nreport on the budget. For the knowledge of my colleagues, and \nespecially my colleague, Senator Gregg, I will consume somewhere in the \nrange of 35 minutes. If he has other things to do, we can get that word \nto him so he is not inconvenienced while I make an opening statement.\n  Here is what we are confronting--a very dramatic deterioration in the \nbudget condition of our country. You can see, in 2007, the official \ndeficit was $162 billion; that is down from what had been record \nlevels. We achieved an all-time--not achieved, there is no achievement \nto it--we saw an all-time record deficit in 2004 of $413 billion. That \nbecame the record. The year before was the record up until that point--\n$378 billion in the red. Of course, the real situation is far worse \nbecause this does not disclose how much the debt has been increased.\n  Then we saw some improvement, to 2007, a deficit of $162 billion. But \nnow we are right back at record levels--$410 billion estimated for this \nyear. I believe it is going to be even worse, and 2009 will be about \nthe same level.\n  When I talk about debt, here is what I am talking about. The gross \ndebt of the United States has gone up like a scalded cat under this \nadministration. When this President came into office at the end of the \nfirst year, the debt stood at $5.8 trillion. By the time we are done \nwith the 8 years he will have been responsible for, the debt will have \nincreased to more than $10.4 trillion--a near doubling of the debt of \nthe country. Increasingly, this money is being borrowed from abroad. As \nthis chart shows, it took 42 Presidents--all the Presidents pictured \nhere, 224 years to run up $1 trillion of U.S. debt held abroad. This \nPresident has far more than doubled that amount in just 7 years. There \nare over $1.5 trillion of foreign holdings of U.S. debt run up by this \nPresident in just 7 years. He has taken what 42 Presidents took 224 \nyears to do and he doubled it and then added another 50 percent to \nforeign holdings of U.S. government debt. The result is we owe Japan \nover $600 billion, we owe China almost $500 billion, we owe the United \nKingdom a little over $200 billion, we owe the oil exporters over $150 \nbillion. My goodness, we owe Hong Kong over $60 billion. We now owe \nRussia over $40 billion. That is a sad fiscal record, but that is the \nlegacy of this President's fiscal policy.\n  This tremendous runup in foreign debt means we have spread dollars \nall over the world and are now increasingly dependent on the kindness \nof strangers to finance our debt here. One of the results of that has \nbeen a substantial drop in the value of our currency. If you think \nabout it, the value of a currency is in part a reflection of supply and \ndemand. When you put out a tremendous supply of dollars, guess what \nhappens to the value of the dollar--it goes down. That is what has \nhappened.\n  You can see back in 2002, this is Euros per dollar. It was 1.13 in \nJanuary 2002. Through the end of last month, we were down to .63. The \nvalue of the dollar against the Euro has dropped like a rock. It has \ndropped 44 percent.\n  If anybody is wondering why food prices are going up so rapidly, why \noil prices are going up so rapidly, here is one of the key reasons. \nThose commodities are sold in dollar terms in the world market. When \nthe dollar goes down in value, guess what happens to the value of \ncommodities: there is tremendous upward pressure on their value. That \nis what, in fact, has happened.\n  We have also seen the economic growth of the country stagnate. You \ncan see, if we look at the nine previous business cycles we have \nexperienced since World War II, you can see that economic growth \naveraged 3.4 percent a year during previous business cycle expansions. \nBut, if we look at average annual economic growth since the first \nquarter of 2001, we see it is stagnating at 2.4 percent.\n  Something is happening in this business cycle that is unlike what we \nhave seen in the nine major business cycles we have seen since World \nWar II. We see this recovery is much weaker. We see it in job creation; \nwe see it in business investment.\n  For example, on job creation, if you look at job creation, again \nlooking at\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\nthe nine previous business cycles since World War II, and you look at \nthe months after the business cycle peak and look at job creation--this \ndotted red line is the average of the nine other major business cycles \nsince World War II--that is the dotted red line. Now, this other line \nis the current business cycle. You can see that we are 10.3 million \nprivate sector jobs short of the typical recovery since World War II. \nIn other words, if you take all the previous nine major business \nrecoveries since World War II and you average them, compare them to \nthis business recovery, we are running 10.3 million private-sector jobs \nshort in this recovery.\n  What does that tell us? That tells us something is wrong, something \nis wrong with our economic performance.\n  We don't just see it in job creation. We see it in business \ninvestment. Again, the dotted red line is the average of the nine \nprevious recoveries since World War II. The black line is this \nrecovery. You can see that we are now running 59 percent below the pace \nof business investment at the same point during the nine previous \nrecoveries. Something quite significant is happening in terms of our \nnational economy. Anybody who does not see this and understand it and \nseek to find solutions to it, I think is missing the point. There is \nsomething wrong with the underlying economy that has been affecting us \nsince 2001. It is so atypical, it is so different than the other nine \nrecoveries since World War II.\n  This budget resolution seeks to address some of what we know. It \nseeks to strengthen the economy and create jobs in several different \nways, first, by investing in energy, education, and infrastructure. We \nthink those are priorities to strengthen the economy. It expands health \ncare coverage for our children; it provides tax cuts for the middle \nclass; it restores fiscal responsibility by balancing the budget by the \nfourth and fifth year of this 5-year budget plan.\n  It also seeks to make America safer by supporting our troops, by \nproviding for veterans health care, by rejecting our homeland and \nrejecting the President's cuts in law enforcement, the COPS Program, \nand for our first responders, our emergency personnel, our \nfirefighters, our emergency medical responders.\n  In terms of the tax relief that is in this budget resolution, this \nbudget conference report that has come back from an agreement with the \nHouse of Representatives, we do the following things. We extend middle-\nclass tax relief, specifically: the marriage penalty relief is provided \nfor; the child tax credit is provided for; and an extension of the 10-\npercent bracket.\n  We also provided for alternative minimum tax relief, because we know \nif we did not, the number of people who would be exposed to the \nalternative minimum tax would explode from roughly 4 million now to 26 \nmillion if we failed to take action.\n  We also provided for estate tax reform. Right now we are in this \nbizarre situation where the estate tax goes up to $3.5 million of \nexemption per person in 2009; the estate tax goes away completely in \n2010, there is no estate tax; and then in 2011, it comes back with only \na $1 million exemption. We say that makes no sense at all. We should \nextend the $3.5 million provision per person, $7 million a couple, and \nindex it for inflation.\n  We also provided for energy and education tax cuts to provide \nincentives to develop alternative forms of energy and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. We also provided property tax relief and, of \ncourse, the popular and important tax extenders, things such as the \nwindow energy credit, the solar credit, the research and \nexperimentation credit. All of those are provided for in this budget.\n  We balance the books by the fourth year, $22 billion in the black, or \nin this case in the green, by 2012. By 2013 we maintain balance, all \nthe while we are bringing down the debt as a share of gross domestic \nproduct from 69.3 percent of GDP to 65.6 percent of GDP in 2013. So we \nare bringing down the debt as a share of gross domestic product each \nand every year of this budget resolution. Let me be the first to say, \nthat is not enough. We need to be doing more. I will say in a minute \nhow I think we can and should do more. But this is an important \nbeginning.\n  One of the ways we do it is we restrain spending. Under this budget \nconference report, we bring down spending as a share of GDP each and \nevery year of the 5-year plan from 20.8 percent of GDP down to 19.1 \npercent in 2012 and 2013.\n  The other side will be quick to say, but you are spending more money \nthan the President is. That is true, we are spending somewhat more \nmoney than the President, because we have rejected his cuts to law \nenforcement, to our first responders, and to other things we think are \npriorities of the American people.\n  But when they talk about the difference in spending, they have a \ntendency to dramatically overstate the difference. Here is the \ndifference between our spending line, which is in green, and the \nPresident's spending line. If you are looking at this on television, \nyou probably cannot see any difference. That is because there is almost \nno difference between our spending line and the President's spending \nline.\n  In fact, for this year, the difference in total spending between our \nbudget and the President's budget is 1 percent. That is the difference, \n1 percent. Over the life of this 5-year plan, you can see it is a very \nmodest difference.\n  Let me turn to 2009, because that is the most immediate year covered \nby this budget plan. You can see the Bush budget calls for $3.03 \ntrillion of spending. We call for $3.07 trillion of spending. Again the \nfundamental differences are, we are investing in education, in energy \nto reduce our dependance on foreign oil, and on infrastructure which is \nso critically important to our future economic success.\n  On the revenue side of the equation, we also have somewhat more \nrevenue than the President's plan because we have lower deficits and \nlower debt than the President's plan. Here you can see the difference. \nThe green line is our revenue line; the red line is the President's \nrevenue line. You can see in the first 2 years there is virtually no \ndifference between our revenue lines; they are right on top of each \nother. In 2011 there is a slight difference, and 2012, 2013, as we \nclimb out of deficit and balance the books.\n  But again the differences are quite modest, and here they are over \nthe 5 years. We are calling for $15.6 trillion of revenue, the \nPresident is calling for $15.2 trillion of revenue. That is a \ndifference of 2.9 percent. That is the difference between the revenue \nwe have proposed, which leads to lower deficits and lower debt than the \nPresident's plan.\n  You will hear our friends on the other side say, this represents the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the world. We beg to disagree. \nWe do not think any tax increase is necessary to meet these numbers. If \nsomeone is listening and they heard me say, well, Senator, you said you \nhave got more revenue, although it is only 2.9 percent more revenue, \nthan in the President's plan, but you say you can do that without a tax \nincrease, how is that? How can you do that?\n  Well, here is how I would propose to do it. First, the Internal \nRevenue Service estimates the tax gap, the difference between what is \nowed and what is paid, is $345 billion a year, the difference between \nwhat is owed and what is paid.\n  Now the vast majority of us pay what we owe. But unfortunately there \nare an increasing number of people and companies who do not pay what \nthey owe. That difference is now estimated at $345 billion a year. That \ngoes back to 2001. I personally believe it has grown substantially \nsince then so it would be a higher number. But that is not the only \nplace where there is leakage in the system. I have shown this chart \nmany times on the floor of the Senate. This is a five-story building in \nthe Cayman Islands called Ugland House. This little building down in \nthe Cayman Islands is the home to 12,748 companies. Let me repeat that. \nThis little five-story building down in the Cayman Islands is the home, \nat least they say it is their home, to 12,748 companies. They say they \nare all doing business out of this building.\n\n  Now I have said that is the most efficient building in the world, \nlittle tiny building like that, and it houses 12,000 companies. How can \nany building be that efficient? Well, we know they are not doing \nbusiness there. They are doing monkey business, and the monkey business \nthey are doing is to avoid\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\ntaxes in this country. And how do they do it? Well, they operate \nthrough a series of shell corporations, and they show their profits in \nthe Cayman Islands instead of the United States to avoid taxes here. \nWhy would they do that? Do they not have taxes down in the Cayman \nIslands? No. Is that not convenient? So they do not show their profits \nhere, even though they make their profits here, they show their profits \ndown in the Cayman Islands. That is the kind of scam that is going on. \nIf you doubt it, here is a story that came to us from the Boston Globe \non March 6 of this year:\n\n       Shell companies in the Cayman Islands allow KBR [that is \n     Kellogg, Brown and Root] the nation's top Iraq war \n     contractor, and until last year a subsidiary of Halliburton, \n     has avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal \n     Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through \n     shell companies based in this tropical tax haven.\n       More than 21,000 people working for Kellogg, Brown and Root \n     in Iraq, including about 10,500 Americans, are listed as \n     employees of two companies that exist in a computer file on \n     the fourth floor of a building on a palm-studded boulevard \n     here in the Caribbean. Neither company has an office or phone \n     number in the Cayman Islands, but they claim it is their \n     home.\n\n  This is a scam. That is what is going on here. This is the largest \ndefense contractor in Iraq, and they are engaged in a total scam to \navoid taxes in this country. If this does not make people angry, I do \nnot know what it would take, because what they are doing is they are \nsticking all of the rest of us who are honest with our tax obligations. \nIt does not stop there.\n  Here our own Permanent Committee on Investigations issued this report \nlast year:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year, including $40 to $70 billion from individuals, and \n     another $30 billion from corporations engaging in offshore \n     tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of billions of \n     dollars more.\n\n  So when somebody says: Well, you have got to raise taxes to produce \n2.9 percent more revenue than the President has called for, I say, no, \nyou do not. Let us go after some of this stuff. Let us go after these \noffshore tax havens. Let us go after these abusive tax shelters. Let us \ngo after this tax gap.\n  Now, the other side will say, well, there is nothing you can do about \nit. Well, certainly there is nothing you can do about it if you do not \ntry. You cannot do a thing if you do not try. But if you try, you can \nget this money. Let me say, I know you can, because I used to be the \ntax commissioner for my State. I was the chairman of the Multistate Tax \nCommission. I went after this money. I got hundreds of millions of \ndollars for my little State of North Dakota going after some of these \nscams. The United States could do much more.\n  Here is a picture of a foreign sewer system. This is a sewer system \nthat is in France. Why do I put up a picture of a sewer system in \nEurope when I am talking about the budget of the United States? Well, \nbecause the two have a linkage. What is the linkage? The connection is \nthat we actually have investors in this country buying European sewer \nsystems, not because they are in the sewer business, no, no, no. They \nare buying European sewer systems to reduce their taxes in this \ncountry. How do they do it? It is very simple. They go over, they buy a \nEuropean sewer system, they then show that on their books as a \ndepreciable asset. They depreciate it over a period of years to reduce \ntheir taxes in this country, and then lease the sewer system back to \nthe European city or municipality that built it in the first place.\n  Now, why should we allow that? This is the kind of thing I think we \ncan shut down and easily achieve 2.9 percent more revenue than the \nPresident has proposed. The question comes, well, why haven't you done \nsomething about shutting down these scams already? There is a very \nsimple reason we have not. It is called the President of the United \nStates. Because the President of the United States has repeatedly \nblocked attempts to shut down these scams.\n  Here are a few of the examples. We tried to codify economic \nsubstance, prohibiting transactions with no economic rationale, things \nthat were done solely to avoid taxes. The President threatened a veto.\n  We tried to shut down schemes to lease foreign subway and sewer \nsystems and depreciate the assets in this country. The President \nthreatened a veto.\n  We proposed ending deferral of offshore compensation by hedge fund \nmanagers trying to evade taxes in our country. The President threatened \nto veto it.\n  We proposed expanding broker information reporting so we could close \ndown some of this tax gap. The President threatened a veto.\n  We proposed taxing people who give up their U.S. citizenship in order \nto evade taxes here in America. The President threatened a veto.\n  Now, I have indicated, I have acknowledged, we have 2.9 percent more \nrevenue in our plan than in the President's budget.\n  The other side will say: Biggest tax increase in the history of the \nworld. That is exactly the same speech they gave last year. Now we have \nthe benefit of a record. Because we can look back, we can look at the \nspeeches they gave last year, and we can look at what has actually \nhappened this year. We can see, what did this Democratic Congress do? \nDid they raise taxes? No. In fact, here is precisely what happened: \nThey reduced taxes in the House and the Senate by $194 billion. They \nhad offsetting loophole closers, for a net tax reduction of $187 \nbillion.\n  Anybody who is listening can reality test. Just go to your mailbox. \nHave you gotten a little check from the U.S. Treasury representing a \ntax cut as part of a stimulus package? Millions of Americans have, and \nmillions more will. That is part of this $194 billion of tax reduction \nthat has occurred with Democrats running both Houses, despite claims of \nour colleagues on the other side that we were going to have the biggest \ntax increase ever.\n  We all know some of the things that are happening in this economy. \nOne is that gasoline prices are soaring. I filled up my car last week. \nI have a 1999 Buick. I know people think all Senators have limousines \nand drivers. Not me. I have a 1999 Buick that I drive myself. I filled \nit up last week, $52.19. The price of gasoline has soared.\n  In January of 2001, gas was $1.47 a gallon; in May of 2008, $3.79. We \nare hearing by Memorial Day gas average $4 nationwide. We have \naddressed that in this budget by investing in energy, creating green \njobs, reducing dependence on foreign oil, and strengthening the \neconomy.\n  We have provided for energy tax incentives in this budget. We have \nprovided for $2.8 billion over the President's budget for energy to \nprovide for alternative sources of energy, homegrown sources of energy \nso we are less dependent on foreign oil. We have also created an energy \nreserve fund to invest in clean energy and the environment. But we know \nskyrocketing gas prices are not our only problem.\n  We also know if we look at what is happening to education, we are \nfalling behind our global competition. This is one metric to look at \nthat, the number of engineering degrees in China and the number of \nengineering degrees in this country. The red line is China's \nengineering degrees. You can see they are absolutely soaring. There are \nover 350,000 a year graduating as engineers in China. In this country, \nwe are down here at about 75,000 engineering graduates. Engineering is \ncritical to future economic growth. We know that. So that has to be a \nconcern. Here, China is now graduating 350,000 engineers a year; we are \nin the 75,000 range. That is something we have to pay attention to. \nObviously, I have used one example. There are many others.\n  This budget resolution invests in education to generate economic \ngrowth and jobs, to prepare our workforce to compete in a global \neconomy, to make college more affordable, and to improve student \nachievement. We have provided for education tax incentives to encourage \npeople to go to college. We have provided $5.5 billion over the \nPresident's budget in discretionary funding for education, and we have \ncreated an education reserve fund for school construction and for the \nreauthorization of the higher education legislation.\n  It doesn't stop there. We also have serious infrastructure issues in \nthis country. Here is a picture of the dramatic collapse of the bridge \non 35-W between Minneapolis and St. Paul last year. I am acutely \nfamiliar with this bridge because when my wife was in\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\nmedical school, I went across that bridge many times a week. Can you \nimagine the absolute horror of the people who were on that bridge? Here \nare the cars of people who were on that bridge when it fell out from \nunderneath them. This was at rush hour last year, one of the most \nheavily used bridges in the State of Minnesota.\n  This budget seeks to address infrastructure by providing targeted \ninvestments to repair crumbling roads and bridges, improve mass \ntransit, expand airports and schools. It creates a reserve fund to \nallow for major infrastructure legislation. It provides $2.5 billion \nmore than the President for key discretionary transportation accounts. \nIt fully funds highways, transit, and increases funding for the Airport \nImprovement Program.\n  This budget resolution also deals with other critical national \npriorities, including fully funding the defense requests of the \nPresident. The President has asked for $2.9 trillion over the next 5 \nyears. This budget provides $2.9 trillion. We also provide $3.3 billion \nmore for our veterans health care than the President. The President has \ncalled for $44.9 billion over a 5-year period. We have adopted the \nindependent budget, which is a budget that was put together by the \nveterans organizations to more fairly reflect the needs we see coming \nbecause of veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. We have \nallocated $3.3 billion more than the President for that purpose. We \nthink we owe these veterans the high-quality care they were promised.\n  All of us who have been to our VA hospitals, who have been to Walter \nReed, are acutely aware of the need for more investment in those \nfacilities. We have also provided in this budget, in fiscal year 2009, \n$2.8 billion more than the President's budget for law enforcement and \nfirst responders. Inexplicably, at least to this Senator, the President \nhas called for the complete elimination of the COPS Program. The COPS \nProgram has put 100,000 police officers on the street, over 200 \nofficers on the street in my home State of North Dakota. The President, \nin his budget, didn't just call for cutting that program. He called for \nits total elimination. It makes no sense to me. I just had my house \nhere broken into while I was back home during the break. I have a \nfellow who rents from me in the basement. He came home from work and \nour place had been broken into. The place was totally trashed. Many of \nhis things were stolen. Why we would take police off the street when, \nin jurisdiction after jurisdiction, we are facing heightened criminal \nactivity doesn't make any sense.\n\n  I am getting to the end. I know my colleague has been riveted \nlistening to me talk about these charts. He has only had a chance to \nsee them maybe 12 times. I thank him for his patience.\n  We also have budget enforcement in the budget resolution, \ndiscretionary caps for 2008 and 2009. We maintain a strong pay-go rule \nthat I know my colleague will probably want to comment on. We also have \na point of order against long-term deficit increases, a point of order \nagainst short-term deficit increases. We allow reconciliation for \ndeficit reduction only. I know this is a place where my colleague will \nagree. I am sure he is pleased that we don't have a reconciliation \ninstruction in this conference report for any other purpose, and we \nhave no reconciliation instruction for any purpose.\n  We also have a point of order against mandatory spending on an \nappropriations bill. Again, this is something the Senator will strongly \nsupport because we have seen the games that were beginning to be played \nwhen the appropriators figured out they could start to do that. We \ntried to shut it down or at least to create a budget point of order, \nmaintain a budget point of order to prevent that practice from \nexpanding.\n  The budget conference report also addresses long-term fiscal \nchallenges. I don't want to overstate this because, the truth is, I \ndon't believe an annual budget resolution is the place to deal with the \nlong-term fiscal challenges facing the country. The annual resolutions \ntend to be done on a partisan basis. Our fiscal challenges are so big, \nso deep, my own conviction is this has to be done with a special \nprocess, a special procedure.\n  The Senator, who is the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and I \nhave teamed up to offer our colleagues legislation that would create a \nbipartisan task force that would be responsible for coming up with a \nplan to deal with our long-term challenges, our fiscal challenges, the \nimbalance between spending and revenue, and the overcommitments we have \nmade on the entitlement programs.\n  The proposal we have made is very different from what others have \nmade because our proposal would require a vote in the Congress, not \nanother commission report that sits on a dusty shelf somewhere. That is \nnot going to cut it. We need a plan. We need a plan that is bipartisan. \nWe need a plan that gets a vote. The Senator and I have a plan to do \nthat.\n  While we are getting ready for that process to occur--and I hope it \nwill--we have provided for a comparative effectiveness reserve fund to \ndeal with health care, a health information technology reserve fund--\nthe Rand Corporation has told us we could save $80 billion a year if we \nhad information technology widely deployed in the health area, program \nintegrity initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse in \nMedicare and Social Security, and a long-term deficit point of order to \nguard against legislative initiatives that would increase the long-term \ndeficit.\n  Finally, as I mentioned, Senator Gregg and I have a proposal to \naddress these long-term imbalances, a panel of lawmakers and \nadministration officials with an agenda of everything being on the \ntable, with fast-track consideration, and a requirement that Congress \nmust vote. If the members of this task force, at least a supermajority \nof them, were to agree on a plan, that plan would come to Congress for \nan assured vote and a further assurance that there would be a \nbipartisan outcome because we would require not only a supermajority of \nthe task force to report a plan but a supermajority in Congress to pass \nit as well.\n  Before surrendering the floor, I thank Senator Gregg for his many \ncourtesies and the very constructive way that he has helped run the \nCommittee on the Budget throughout this year. He is a gentleman, a \nperson of honor whose word is gold. I deeply appreciate that. I also \nappreciate very much the professionalism of his staff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, first, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from North Dakota, for his generous comments and \nreciprocate by saying it is a pleasure to work with him. Obviously, we \nhave disagreements or we wouldn't be in different parties. That is the \npurpose of democracy. You have disagreements and reach some conclusion \nthat, hopefully, is constructive for all.\n  The budget, unfortunately, tends to be a uniquely partisan statement \nof a party's political positions. Therefore, it is more difficult to \nreach agreement, especially when the Congress has both Houses of the \nsame party. But that doesn't mean you can't do it in a cordial and, \nhopefully, constructive way, have your disagreements, and make your \npoints.\n  I appreciate that the Senator from North Dakota has always been \ncordial and professional and constructive, as has his staff, to say the \nleast.\n  I don't want to start off with too much hat tipping to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota; I don't want to get carried away. Let me simply say \nthis: It is important that the Congress have a budget. It is uniquely \nthe Congress's responsibility to have a budget. Although the \nPresident's budget gets soundly beaten about the ears here, the \nPresident's budget is not a factor in the sense that it is part of the \ncongressional budget process.\n  The congressional budget is uniquely an entity of the Congress. The \nCongress passes it. It does not go to the President for his signature. \nThe elements of the budget which are most important, such as the \nallocations to the Appropriations Committee, such as reconciliation \ninstructions, are uniquely the purpose of the Congress as a way of \ngiving a blueprint and defining spending and tax revenues within the \nfiscal policy of the Congress.\n  The Congress retains, under the Constitution, the right to the purse \nstrings, and the budget is an element of exercising that right. So \nalthough the\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\nPresident sends up a budget under the Budget Act, that budget rarely, \nif ever, becomes law. I am not aware it has ever become law. It is \nsimply a point for discussion. When you have a Democratic Congress and \na Republican President, it tends to be discussed less other than in \nopposition by the Congress.\n  So this budget is totally the responsibility of the Democratic \nCongress. It is passed by the Democratic membership of the Congress, \nnot by the Republican membership of this Congress, and the President's \ninput is at the margins, to say the least. But it is important there be \na budget. Even though I may strongly disagree with it, I do think it is \nthe responsibility of the Congress to do a budget.\n  Thirdly, as a note of appreciation, I do thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his insistence that reconciliation instructions not be \nincluded in the bill. Reconciliation is an extraordinarily strong \nhammer which is contained within the Budget Act which allows basically \nthe Budget Committee to, hopefully, control the expansion of \nentitlement programs. Unfortunately, last year, it was used to expand \nGovernment, not to control the rate of expansion of Government, and \nthat was a mistake, a serious mistake that undermined, in my opinion, \nthe integrity of the act. I am glad we are not doing it this year, and \nI appreciate the Senator from North Dakota insisting on the Senate \nposition on this issue.\n  To address the budget specifically, this budget, as it is brought \nforward by our colleagues, by the Democratic membership, is a ``back to \nthe future'' budget. You hear Senator Obama say he wants change. Well, \nthis is ``back to the future'' change. It is essentially a restatement \nof things which always happens under a Democratic Congress. It says: \nYes, we can raise taxes and a lot of taxes. It says: Yes, we can \nincrease spending and a lot of new spending. It says: Yes, we can run \nup the debt and a lot of new debt. It says: Yes, we will not address \nentitlements and the fact that entitlement spending is a major threat \nto our fiscal integrity.\n  It is a ``back to the future'' budget. The term ``tax and spend'' \nexists. It may be trite, but it exists because it is accurate. This \nbudget has the largest increase in taxes in the history of the world. \nIt has one of the largest increases in spending. It has a $500 billion \nincrease in entitlement spending, a $200-plus billion increase in \ndiscretionary spending. The debt goes up $2 trillion under this budget. \nAnd it is on the watch of the other party. Those are policies of the \nother party that are being put in place, and they are not good \npolicies. They are not healthy. They are not constructive for the \nAmerican people.\n  The budget, as I outlined, has the largest increase in taxes in the \nhistory of this world, especially this country, and it has an impact on \nworking Americans. You hear a great deal, especially from Senator \nObama, who is the presumptive nominee now of the Democratic Party after \nlast night, that he is going to raise taxes to pay for all his \nprogrammatic activity, but he is only going to raise it from the \nwealthy.\n  Well, this budget does not assume, to begin with, most of the \nproposals by Senator Obama to spend money, but it does assume a tax \nincrease. It assumes a $1.2 trillion tax increase, and that tax \nincrease cannot be paid for only by wealthy Americans. If you take the \ntop tax rate in America, and you raise it back to the top tax rate \nunder the Clinton years, which would be 39.5 percent, every year you \nwill add $25 billion of new revenue to the Federal Government, assuming \npeople do not try to avoid taxes and reduce their tax liability, which \nwealthy people tend to do because they get accountants to show them how \nto do that. Well, that does not come anywhere near covering the \nadditional taxes which are proposed in this budget, the $1.2 trillion--\nthe $25 billion a year.\n  No, it is the families who are going to pay that. Forty-three million \nfamilies in America will be hit under this budget, in the year 2011, \nwith a tax increase of $2,300 or more. Those are working families, by \nthe way. A family of four making $50,000 will have a $2,300 tax \nincrease.\n  Seniors. Eighteen million seniors under this budget, in 2011, will \nsee a $2,200 tax increase. Small businesses--the engine for economic \nactivity, the engine for jobs in this country--27 million small \nbusinesses will see a $4,100 increase. There will be 7.8 million people \nbrought onto the tax rolls who were taken off the tax rolls by \nPresident Bush. These are low-income individuals who no longer have to \npay taxes as a result of the tax policies of the early 1980s. Those tax \npolicies, by the way, worked. They worked. Yet there is tremendous \nopposition around here from the other side of the aisle to continuing \nthose tax policies, as this budget points out.\n  The capital gains--I think we have a capital gains chart in the \nChamber--the capital gains revenues during the last 4 years have jumped \ndramatically--dramatically--as a result of getting a capital gains rate \nwhich Americans feel is fair and are willing to pay. In fact, over $100 \nbillion has been collected in the last 4 years from capital gains--$100 \nbillion--more than was expected to be collected by the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Now, why is that? Why, when we cut the capital gains rate down to 15 \npercent, did we get more revenue? Well, as I have said before on the \nfloor of the Senate, it is called human nature. If you say to somebody: \nWe are going to give you a fair tax rate on your capital gains income, \npeople will do things that generate capital gains. People do not \nnecessarily have to do anything to generate capital gains. If you own a \nstock or you own a home or you own a small business and you feel the \ncapital gains rate is too high, you would not want to sell that stock, \nhome or small business because you would not want to pay all that money \nto the Government. But if the Government sets a fair capital gains \nrate--15 percent--then you say: All right, I will pay that tax in order \nto turn over that stock, in order to sell my business, in order to sell \nmy home. I am willing to take that tax rate.\n  So people go out and they do things which generate economic activity. \nThey generate capital gains. That generates revenue to the Federal \nGovernment. That is what has happened here. We have generated \nsignificant amounts of revenue we did not expect because people were \nwilling to undertake activity which was taxable.\n  It has a second very positive effect, besides getting a lot of \nrevenue in the Federal Government. A low capital gains rate--a \nreasonable capital gains rate--causes people to invest their money more \nproductively. They go out and they take risks. Entrepreneurs take \nrisks. Job creators take risks. Small businesses are started and jobs \nare created as a result of money being invested in a way that generates \nmore jobs. It generates more activity, more entrepreneurship, more \njobs.\n  This bill assumes the capital gains rate will be doubled. This bill \nassumes the rate on dividends may be more than doubled, depending on \nwhat your bracket is. This bill is a massive tax increase on working \nAmericans and seniors. By the way, it is senior citizens who take the \nmost advantage--and that is logical--of capital gains and dividend \nincome. Most seniors have a fixed income. It is a dividend income. It \nusually comes from a pension they are getting or they invested in while \nthey were in their working years or they have a home they sold, so they \nhave a capital gains.\n\n  So the idea in this bill, which is to end the capital gains rate as \nit presently exists and raise it and to end the dividend rate as it \npresently exists and doubling it, that idea is going to \ndisproportionately hit senior citizens. It is not going to raise the \nrevenue that is projected in the bill because people are going to take \ntax-avoidance action.\n  But because of the way CBO scores things--it is static around here; \nthere is no dynamic scoring--they claim this is going to raise all this \nrevenue. It will not. But the fact is, those tax increases will slow \nthis economy and damage working Americans and working families, as was \nshown by the prior chart. That is not fair.\n  Now, my colleague on the other side of the aisle will argue--and he \nargues all the time--that, no, we are not going to have a tax increase, \neven though the tax increase in the bill is the exact amount of money \nthat CBO scores the ending of the capital gains rate and its increase \nand the ending of the dividend rate and its doubling--the exact amount \nof money that generates by CBO scoring.\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\n  So CBO at least is presuming, and the Democratic Party in setting \nforward this budget is taking advantage of, revenues that are expected \nto come from a significant increase in capital gains rates, dividend \nrates, and general rates. But we hear from the other side: Oh, we don't \nhave to do that. We don't have to do that. They try to fudge this issue \nby claiming: We are going to collect this all from the tax gap.\n  As to the tax gap--the Senator from North Dakota probably went on for \n15 minutes showing us buildings here and buildings there and subway \nsystems here and subway systems there. Well, do you know something. We \nhad testimony which totally rejects that. The Commissioner of the IRS \ncame in and said: You couldn't possibly collect the type of dollars \nthat are represented in this bill in tax increases from closing the tax \ngap. You can claim it in theory, but it will not happen in practice. \nThis canard, so to say, has been used for years--years.\n  In 1987, the Senator from North Dakota said: I pound away at the need \nfor a share. He said: That includes the tax gap between what is owed \nand what is paid. He said that in 1987.\n  In 1990, he said: It is both fiscally irresponsible and insulting to \nthe vast majority of honest taxpayers in this country if we fail to tap \nthis revenue from those who have not complied.\n  Then again, last year, he said: If we collect 15 percent of the tax \ngap, it would be over $300 billion, and that alone would come close to \nmeeting the revenue needs under our budget.\n  That was last year's budget, by the way. How much did they collect \nfrom the tax gap? Zero. How much did they collect from the tax gap in \n1987, when he first made this statement? Zero. How much did they \ncollect in 1990, when he made the statement again? Zero. Throughout the \n1990s, through the 2000s, the tax gap is not being closed.\n  In fact, instead of being closed, last year, they cut the funding to \nthe IRS, those elements of the IRS who would most logically be people \nwho would go out and collect extra money if it was owed. So this whole \ntax gap thing is nice rhetoric, but it has no substance, and it is not \ndefensible on its face in light of the numbers in this bill. What is in \nthis bill is the largest increase in taxes in the history of this \ncountry--$1.2 trillion.\n  Now, there is, in addition, the issue of the debt. The Senator from \nthe other side is fond of pointing to the President, saying: He has \nincreased the debt this much, he increased the debt this much. Yes, the \ndebt has gone up significantly. I do not like that. Nobody likes that. \nBut you cannot wash your hands of it when you produced the budget last \nyear that added $200 billion to the debt--well, $400 billion it was \ngoing to add to the debt. I am sorry. I misstated. Over $400 billion \nwill be added to the debt for the first Democratic Congress's budget--\n$400 billion. This budget presumes another $370 billion to that debt.\n  So this wall of debt chart--yes, the President of the United States, \nbecause he put forward budgets that increased the debt, deserves some \nsignificant responsibility here, but so do our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who are producing this budget. There is $2 trillion \nof new debt added to the wall of debt under the Democratic budget.\n  You could reduce that. You could reduce that by not spending so much \nmoney, which gets us to the next point. The spending in this bill goes \nup significantly. We passed the trillion-dollar threshold--$1 trillion \nof discretionary spending--in this bill.\n  Now, I suggested--and I agree it would maybe be a statement more of \nan attempt to make a point than a substantive event, but I suggested we \nset spending limits in this bill which would keep discretionary \nspending under $1 trillion. That would have meant that instead of \nincreasing spending in this bill, as the Democratic proposal does, by \n$24.5 billion next year--which, by the way, is the 1-year number that \ngoes up over 5 years and represents over $200 billion in new \ndiscretionary spending--they would have only been able to increase \nspending by $10 billion and then they would have stayed under the $1 \ntrillion limit. But they couldn't even do that. I mean the desire to go \nout and spend is a genetic effect; it is a genetic existence in the \nDemocratic position. That is why we have different parties. They \nbelieve the Government is better when it is bigger. They believe the \nGovernment is better when it takes your money and spends it. They \nbelieve Government knows how to spend your money better than you do and \ntherefore, when they are in control--which they are and which they have \nbeen--they significantly raise your taxes and they significantly \nincrease spending.\n\n  This budget isn't any different. As I said, it is back to the future. \nIs this change? It is change that takes us back to where we were when \nwe had the last Democratic Congress. Significant increases in spending, \nand the budget doesn't even account for most spending which we know is \ncoming down the pike which has already been signed on to by the \nmajority of this party on the other side of the aisle.\n  For example, we have pending in the wings later today or tomorrow a \nsupplemental that is going to add spending in the area of unemployment \ninsurance of $15 billion, spending in the area of veterans of $54 \nbillion. We have a farm bill coming at us that is a $300 billion bill. \nWe have an AMT fix which this budget claims to pay for, but which we \nknow won't be paid for, of $70 billion. The numbers go up and up and up \nand up, the debt goes up and up and up and up, the spending goes up and \nup and up, and the taxes go up and up and up. There can be no denying \nthat. It is the way it is. I understand there is a difference of \nopinion, but I think it ought to be admitted to by the other side. \nThere shouldn't be an attempt to obfuscate it by claiming we are going \nto get taxes from the Oz somewhere behind the curtain. The tax revenues \nare going to come out of working Americans. It shouldn't be claimed we \nare going to generate a reduction in spending when we are generating an \nincrease in spending, and a fairly significant one. The other side of \nthe aisle holds up this chart and says there is no real difference \nbetween the President's number and our number. ``Ours is a 1 percent \ndifference.'' But 1 percent on $3 trillion is $300 billion. I don't \nknow where they come from, but $300 billion is a huge amount of money--\na huge amount of money.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator yield on the math?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator a 1-percent difference is a 1-\npercent difference, whatever the denominator is. One percent is a very \nsmall amount of money. I think the Senator would acknowledge that 1 \npercent difference is--\n  Mr. GREGG. I reclaim my time then. The point is I don't consider $300 \nbillion a small amount of money. Now, maybe it is a small amount of \nmoney in North Dakota, but I do know that $300 billion would run the \nState of New Hampshire for I think approximately 10 years. Maybe it \nwould only run the State of North Dakota for a couple of years, because \nI know you have big budgets up there, but I think it is a lot of money, \n$300 billion. So that is--\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator yield for one more moment on the \nnumbers? One percent of $3 trillion, I think the Senator would \nacknowledge, is not $300 billion, it is $30 billion?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Madam President, I am happy to reclaim my time. \nThirty billion dollars is a lot of money in New Hampshire. It would run \nthe State for 10 years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But would the Senator acknowledge that the $300 billion \nthat he referenced is simply not accurate.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I wouldn't, because $300 billion is a 5-year number. \nBut I thank the Senator for making it clear that he agrees with the \nfact that $30 billion is a lot of money. Maybe he doesn't agree that \n$30 billion is a lot of money. I think $30 billion is a lot of money.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say--\n  Mr. GREGG. I have the time, Madam President. I have the time.\n  So we are talking about big dollars, real dollars and lots of new \nspending. Under any scenario, we are talking a number which is going to \ndrive large tax increases not only next year but in the outyears for \nworking Americans in this country, and it is not right to do that to \nthem, in my humble opinion--well, in my opinion. It is not necessarily \nhumble. I apologize.\n  There is another point here that needs to be made, which is there is \na claim in this budget that they have put\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\nin some sort of enforcement mechanisms called pay-go. They keep \nreturning to pay-go as an enforcement mechanism. To begin with, they \nhave waived pay-go, adjusted pay-go or manipulated pay-go on at least \n17 different occasions for well over $175 billion in new spending. Pay-\ngo is only used as a vehicle to try to increase taxes. If somebody \nwants to cut your taxes, they will claim pay-go and you have to \nincrease somebody else's taxes to do that. But when it comes to \nspending around here, as we saw with the farm bill that rolled through \nhere, pay-go has no relevance at all. It is adjusted by changing years. \nIt is adjusted by moving numbers around. It is adjusted by, as in the \nSCHIP bill, artificially ending a program when you know the program is \nnot going to end. It is scammed. So there is no credibility to claiming \npay-go is in this bill.\n  Furthermore, real pay-go isn't even in this bill. Real pay-go says \nyou match the year of the spending to the year of the cost, the year it \nis going to be offset against. This bill doesn't do that. The first \nyear of pay-go under this bill--- you can claim you are going to offset \na new spending program in the fifth year under this bill. So you game \nthat system right to the end.\n  Then there is the alleged tax proposal in this bill--the Baucus \namendment, as it is referred to. Well, we went through this exercise \nlast year. The Baucus amendment was brought forward last year and the \nother side of the aisle put out a lot of press releases claiming they \nhad extended the tax cuts within the Baucus amendment which included \nthings such as the childcare tax credit and the spousal marriage \npenalty and I think R tax credit. They did a lot of press on that and \nthere was a great deal of fanfare after they took the vote on the \nbudget that claimed they were going to pass a bill which would \naccomplish these tax cuts, extending them. Where is the bill? Where is \nthe bill? It never passed. There were no extenders passed. The whole \namendment turned out to be a fraud. So they--well, it worked so well \nlast year with the press release, they have done it again this year. \nThey have done it again this year. They have claimed they are going to \npass those extenders, which they didn't do last year, and they may do \nit this year, I don't know. I haven't seen anything yet that implies to \nme they are going to do it. But if they did do it, just to make darn \nsure that it actually never had any serious effect, they put language \nin the bill which basically creates a Rube Goldberg system where they \ntake back the tax deductions if a deficit occurs. Well, they know a \ndeficit is going to occur because they have already put in place \nspending initiatives which exceed the alleged surpluses they have in \nthis bill. Just the veterans benefit we are going to vote on tomorrow \ntheoretically, and which will pass here at some point, is going to \nknock out the alleged surplus. So all of these alleged tax extenders \nwhich theoretically they are going to pass and at least they are going \nto put press releases out on are not going to occur, because they put \nlanguage in this budget which says if there is a deficit, those tax \nextenders are recaptured, and they end. They come to an end.\n  So this budget is obviously, from our point of view--and it is our \npoint of view. It is not their point of view. I don't argue with the \nfact that they believe they have put together a great budget. I mean in \ntheir mind, in the mind of the person who believes we should \ndramatically expand the size of government, dramatically increase taxes \non the American people, this is a heck of a good budget. I don't argue \nwith that. But from our perspective, when we think Americans should \nkeep as much of their tax dollars as we can leave them with, because it \nis their money and they will spend it better, and they are more \nefficient using it than we are--we should keep a low capital gains \nrate; we shouldn't penalize seniors who have dividend income as their \nmain source of income--from our perspective, this budget has the wrong \npriorities because it raises the taxes on capital gains and raises the \ntaxes on dividends significantly.\n\n  In addition, it has the wrong priorities because it expands spending \nsignificantly--$500 billion in new spending and entitlements. Remember: \nProbably the biggest threat we face as a nation--fiscal threat--in \nfact, the biggest threat after, in my opinion, the threat of Islamic \nfundamentalism and the terrorists using a weapon of mass destruction \nagainst us--is the impending economic meltdown of this country as a \nresult of the burden that our generation, the baby boom generation, is \nputting on the next generation through the entitlement accounts. There \nis $66 trillion of unfunded liability, $66 trillion--a huge number. \nNobody knows because it is hard to define what $1 trillion is. But if \nyou take all the taxes paid since the beginning of this Republic--I \nthink you are talking about something like $37 trillion--and if you \ntake all of the net worth of the American people--all their cars, all \ntheir homes, all their stock--and add it together, you come up with \nsomething like $45 trillion.\n  So we have a liability on our books which involves three programs--\nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--that exceeds the net worth of \nthe Nation and exceeds the amount of taxes paid in this Nation since we \nbegan as a nation. That is a huge problem for us. You have to start to \naddress it.\n  One of the good things the President's budget did was suggest a \ncouple of ways to address it. In fact, he sent up a proposal which \nwould take about 20 percent of this problem as it relates to Medicare, \nwhich is the biggest part of the $66 trillion, and would have made \nMedicare 20 percent less insolvent--which is a big number, by the way. \nThat was a big step. The proposals he sent us had no impact on the vast \nmajority of beneficiaries--no impact at all. He suggested that wealthy \nAmericans such as Warren Buffett, for example, qualify for the Part D \npremium under Medicare, under the Medicare drug program, or some other \nextraordinarily wealthy person, should pay a fair share--not all, but \nshould pay a fair share of the cost of the premium of their drug \nprogram. That was a reasonable suggestion. What happened to it? It was \nrejected by the other side of the aisle.\n  The President suggested that we use IT and disclosure of performance \nat different levels that medicine integrates with the patient so people \ncould make more intelligent purchasing decisions, so employers and \ninsurers could make more intelligent decisions but, more importantly, \nMedicare could. What happened to that idea? It was rejected by the \nother side of the aisle.\n  The President suggested we should do something about the runaway cost \nof malpractice, about the trial lawyers essentially running up \nextraordinary costs on health care providers, especially doctors, and \nthat we should do something to limit that. It is a reasonable \nsuggestion rejected by the other side of the aisle.\n  How much entitlement saving is in this bill? Zero. Zero entitlement \nsaving is in this bill. Here we are facing probably the most \nsignificant fiscal issue of our time and we do nothing about it in this \nbudget. In fact, under the present law, we as a Congress are required \nby something called the Medicare drug trigger to adjust Medicare \nspending to bring it down under what is known as a trigger level. It is \na technical point, but Medicare Part D premium isn't supposed to exceed \n45 percent from the general fund. And we have now gotten a directive \nfrom the trustees in the Medicare trust fund to act, and it would cost \nnot a large amount of money in the context of this entire budget--$1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Billion, thank you. Billion. I got into my trillions. It \nwould cost $1.3 billion to correct this. That proposal is nowhere in \nthis budget; nowhere in this budget. It is hard to believe we couldn't \neven do $1.3 billion when we have been directed to do it, when we \npassed the law. It was our law that said we would do this if this \nproblem occurred. Yet the courage isn't there to do even that in the \narea of entitlements, which is truly irresponsible, an act of \nmalfeasance by the Congress. So entitlement spending remains \nunaddressed.\n  Interestingly enough, I heard Senator Obama on the stump a couple of \ndays ago--maybe it was a week ago--talking about how he was never going \nto allow anything to happen to the Social Security recipient or the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is that type of language which \nabsolutely guarantees our children are going to get a bill here that \nthey can't afford, that our generation, the largest in the history of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\ncountry, which will double the number of retirees, is going to \nbasically put a weight on our children and our children's children that \nwill make their lives less enjoyable than ours because they will not be \nable to afford the dollars it costs to support our generation and still \nbe able to buy their homes, send their children to college, and buy \ntheir cars because of the tax burden generated by the entitlement \ncosts.\n\n  So that irresponsibility is permeated in this budget when it does \nnothing on the issue of entitlements. Speaking of Senator Obama, I am \nentertained by the fact that this budget, which will have three-fourths \nof its life under the next President, must assume that the next \nPresident will not be Senator Obama because he has proposed $300 \nbillion of new spending--$300 billion--in the first year of his \nPresidency. He proposed 187 new programs. We can only score 143 of them \nbecause the other ones were not specific enough. But if you score 143 \nof them, they add up to $300 billion of new spending just in the first \nyear.\n  As I said earlier, Senator Obama said he is going to pay for this by \ntaxing the wealthy. That is what he said. But if you look at this \nbudget, they have already spent that money. This budget already assumes \nthe wealthy are going to be taxed. The $1.2 trillion tax increase in \nthe budget assumes the top rate in the 2010, 2011, and 2012 period \njumps back to President Clinton's level of 39.5 percent. So the budget, \nwhich already is projecting deficits in the $400 billion range, already \npresumes inside of it, as it is presented here, a jump in the top \nmarginal rate, which is the rate on the richest Americans. That money \nis already spent. It was spent when the other side of the aisle decided \nto increase entitlement spending by $500 billion under this budget and \nincrease discretionary spending by close to $300 billion under this \nbudget. So where is he going to find the money to pay for his $300 \nbillion of new programs? I don't know. But one thing is pretty obvious: \nWe are going back to the future with enthusiasm. Yes, we can raise \ntaxes and, yes, we can raise spending; that will become the theme not \nonly of this budget but future budgets should we have a Democratic \nPresident and a Democratic Congress.\n  This budget really doesn't do much to address the issues the American \npeople need to have addressed. Those issues involve, No. 1, doing \nsomething on the issue of entitlements; No. 2, maintaining a tax law \nwhich creates productivity, which energizes entrepreneurship and says \nto small business people, go out and create jobs; No. 3, disciplines \nour fiscal house by containing discretionary spending under a trillion \ndollars.\n  Those are not really that dramatic or that heavy a lift to undertake. \nThere is no reason we could not keep spending under a trillion dollars \non the discretionary side, no reason we could not have taken the small \nsteps, like asking wealthy people to pay a bigger part of--or any part \nof--their Part D drug premium. There is no reason this budget could not \nhave contained within it some initiatives which would have controlled \ndiscretionary spending and would have continued to promote the tax \npolicy we have seen for the last 3 years, which has generated a massive \nincrease in revenues for the Federal Government, especially from \ncapital gains.\n  Another course that was chosen--the course that is circular--goes \nback to the way we did things in the past when we had the last \nDemocratic Congress. That course said you have to raise taxes because \nthe American people don't know how to spend their own money, so we have \nto do it for them. It is a course that says the Government should \nalways grow, and grow fast. There is nothing in the Government that \nshould be reduced. It is a course that says we should add to the \nFederal debt at a radical rate. It is a course that says we should \nignore real problems--the biggest problem we have, which is entitlement \nspending.\n  I want to put in one footnote because I think it sort of encapsulates \nthe whole discussion about discretionary spending. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota got up and said we had to keep the COPS Program, which was \na great program, and put cops on the street. There isn't one program \nthat their budget proposes that we eliminate on the discretionary side \nthat I found. Everything either gets increased or is maintained.\n  The COPS Program is uniquely appropriate to be eliminated. Why? Don't \nlisten to me. Listen to President Clinton. He created the COPS Program, \nand he created it with this caveat: This will be a 3-year program.\n  That is what President Clinton said--that when we get to 100,000 \npolice officers on the street as a result of this program, this program \nwill be terminated. That was the program that was proposed. Not only \ndid we get the 100,000 police officers on the street--because I chaired \nthe committee of jurisdiction at that time--we put 110,000 new police \nofficers on the street using Federal funds. Then, following on the \nsuggestion of what the original program was, and following the edict of \nPresident Clinton, we started to phase out that program. It should have \nbeen completely phased out. That was 8 or 9 years ago that we hit what \nthe number was under this Federal program. The program is still here. \nIt is a classic example of how programs work. Once they are in place, \nthe interest groups that support them demand that they stay in place \nforever. Obviously, we all believe police officers do a great job. We \nadmire them, respect them, and they protect us. But this program \nfulfilled its obligation. It did what it said it would do, and it \nworked. It should have been terminated, just like President Clinton \nsuggested.\n  Now, the other side of the aisle, 8 to 9 years after that event, is \nstill claiming this program has to be kept and grown. That is the \ndifference between our parties. We think when somebody puts in a \nprogram that says it will last 3 years, with certain goals, and those \ngoals are met and the 3 years are over, the program should be ended and \nthe American taxpayer should get to keep the money from ending that \nprogram.\n  The other side of the aisle thinks we should continue the program \nforever, grow it, and take money out of the American taxpayers' pockets \nto pay for something on which we have already fulfilled the \nresponsibility. That is the difference. It is a fundamental difference \nbetween our parties. They are in the majority. They have the right to \nwrite a budget however they want it. They have done that. It is a \nbudget that has the world's largest tax increase, has significant \nincreases in spending, significant increases in entitlement spending, \ncrosses the trillion-dollar line on the discretionary side, does \nnothing about containing entitlements, and plays games with enforcement \nmechanisms relative to the budget. We would not have written this \nbudget. That is why we are opposed to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am delighted that our colleague talks \nabout our fiscal record and theirs. He talks about circling back to the \npolicies when the Democrats controlled the White House. He is right \nthat there is a difference. The difference is that when the Democrats \nlast controlled the White House, we had record surpluses, and we were \npaying down the debt. Under the current President, we have record \ndeficits and record debt.\n  I am delighted to talk about the record because here is their record: \nIn each of the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, we had \nachieved a budget surplus, we were paying down the debt, and the CBO \nwas projecting that the budget would remain in surplus for years to \ncome. By the time the Bush administration came into power, we had \nachieved three consecutive years of surplus and were expecting more. \nBut, the Bush administration squandered every dime. By the time this \nPresident is done with his responsibility, they will have run up the \ndebt from $5.8 trillion to over $10 trillion. That is the difference in \nthe record. Under the last Democratic administration, we ran surpluses \nand paid down the debt. Since then, under the Bush administration, the \nNation has been beset by record deficits and record levels of debt. \nThat is a fact.\n  Now, my favorite quote of my colleague on the other side--first, let \nme say I have respect for the ranking member. I have affection for him, \nand we are friends. But we have a big divide when it comes to fiscal \npolicy. I think the policies of this administration have been reckless. \nI think they have dug an enormously deep hole for this country.\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\n  I think the factual record is very clear on the differences between \nour two parties. Under President Clinton, we achieved record surpluses, \nand we were paying down the debt. Under President Bush, the Nation was \nplunged right back into record deficits and debt. That is a fact.\n  But the thing I enjoy most about my colleague's speech is how similar \nit was to the speech he gave last year. This is what he said last year:\n\n       It includes, at a minimum, a $736 billion tax hike on \n     American families and businesses over the next 5 years--the \n     largest in U.S. history.\n\n  The only difference is that now he is saying this budget is the \nlargest tax increase in the history of the world. We can now go back \nand look at the factual record about what our budget did that was put \ninto place last year.\n  Did it increase taxes? Did it increase them by the largest in U.S. \nhistory, as he asserted last year? Well, let's look. Here is the \nrecord--not a speech but the factual record. We had Democrats \ncontrolling the House and the Senate, and the assertion last year by \nthe Senator from the opposite party was that there would be the largest \nincrease in the history of the United States. But what happened? Was \nthere the largest tax increase in the history of the United States? No. \nWas there a tax increase? No. Was there a tax reduction? Yes. Here it \nis: Tax cuts enacted, $194 billion; offsets and closing loopholes, $7 \nbillion; net tax reduction, $187 billion.\n  Now, that is the fact. So much for speeches and for hyperbole. Let's \ndeal with facts.\n  Debt: The President's budget has $83 billion more of debt than the \nbudget we have offered from our side. The Senator questions the Baucus \namendment, which is included in this budget, that extends key middle-\nclass tax cuts. That is included in the conference report. We provide \n$340 billion of tax cuts in this budget.\n  What is he talking about, the biggest tax increase? There is no tax \nincrease in this budget. None. Zero. There are $340 billion of tax \nreductions for the middle class in this country who deserve it.\n  The Senator says: Why haven't they presented a bill, because they had \nthe Baucus middle-class tax cut extension in last year? Why haven't we? \nBecause, as the Senator well knows, those tax cuts are in place until \n2010. We didn't need to take action last year. We don't need to take \naction this year. Those tax cuts are in place now. But in this 5-year \nbudget, we have provided for their extension because we know they run \nout in 2010. But there is absolutely no need to have taken the action \nto extend them last year or this year because they are already in \nplace.\n  Let's deal with facts. The Senator talks about Barack Obama's budget. \nBarack Obama doesn't have a budget. Barack Obama is not the President \nof the United States. He is asserting he has $300 billion of spending \nincreases. I notice he didn't say anything about the McCain budget \nbecause while John McCain is not the President, either, he has proposed \n$3 trillion--not $300 billion but $3 trillion--of additional tax cuts, \nand we already can't pay our bills. We already are borrowing hundreds \nof billions from China and Japan. So apparently the McCain plan is to \nborrow some more money from China and Japan. That is what the party of \nthe other side has become, a party of borrow and spend--they've spent \n$600 billion so far in Iraq with no end in sight, and they've borrowed \nso much that the debt will have increased from $5.8 trillion to $10.4 \ntrillion by the time this President is done.\n  Then there is one other item to which I need to respond, and that is \non the question of the pay-go. The Senator says that pay-go is \nmeaningless. What is it? It requires that if there is new mandatory \nspending or new tax cuts, they must be offset. That is pay-go.\n  The Senator used to support pay-go. This is what he said in 2002:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event. . . . If we do not do this, if we do \n     not put back in place caps and pay-go mechanisms, we will \n     have no budget discipline in this Congress and, as a result, \n     we will dramatically aggravate the deficit which, of course, \n     impacts a lot of important issues, but especially impacts \n     Social Security.\n\n  The Senator was right in 2002, and, in fact, his prediction came true \nbecause his party abandoned pay-go, drove up deficits, drove up debt, \nand we are the worse for it as a nation.\n  If you wonder about pay-go, here is the record. We had strong pay-go \nin effect between 1993 and 2000. The deficit was reduced each and every \nyear between 1993 and 1997 and, by 1998, we actually got into \nsurpluses, as I indicated before, which rose in each year through 2000. \nThen our friends on the other side took charge of the White House. They \nimmediately weakened pay-go, and we plunged right back into deficit. We \nput pay-go back into effect, and we are starting to dig out of the very \ndeep hole they have dug.\n  On the issue of pay-go being waived, pay-go has been raised 16 times; \npay-go has been waived once--once.\n  The Senator says pay-go is not working. I disagree. Excluding the \nalternative minimum tax provisions that were put in place last year to \nprevent the alternative minimum tax from costing 20 million people more \ntaxes, instead of offsetting that, the alternative minimum tax was \nprevented from being expanded without paying for it. If you leave out \nthat one item, the Senate pay-go has a scorecard with a positive \nbalance of over $1.5 billion over 11 years.\n  Every bill sent to the President, other than the alternative minimum \ntax and the stimulus, which, of course, could not be offset if it was \nto have a stimulative effect--that was totally bipartisan, both those \nwere totally bipartisan--every bill sent to the President other than \nthose two has been paid for or more than paid for.\n  Pay-go also has a significant deterrent effect, preventing many \ncostly bills from being offered.\n  With respect to the specifics of my colleague's criticism, I will \nenter into the Record every one of the items he referenced: immigration \nreform, the Energy bill, mental health parity, prescription drug user-\nfee amendments, minimum wage, Water Resources Development Act. Every \none of them is paid for. CHIP reauthorization, the farm bill--he just \ntalked about the farm bill. The farm bill, which we will vote on \nsometime later today or tomorrow to overturn the President's veto, is \ntotally pay-go compliant. It is paid for and without tax increases. \nHigher education, the reconciliation bill, the 2007 supplemental--every \none of them in terms of the bill that actually went to the President is \npaid for.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire calls pay-go ``swiss cheese-go,'' \nI call their budget approach ``easy cheese'' because they have faked \nfiscal responsibility around here long enough, and we are calling them \non it because now we have their record, and their record is record \ndeficits, record debt, record borrowing from abroad. That is their \nfiscal record. It is a fact. It can be checked. They are going to have \na hard time running away from their record as we go into an election \nyear.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague, Senator Murray, is here. How \nmuch time does the Senator wish?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield her 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the chair of the \nBudget Committee. He has done an amazing job putting together a budget \nof which we can all be very proud.\n  For the last 7\\1/2\\ years, the current administration has really \nmismanaged our economy and failed to make the kinds of investments that \nkeep our country strong. We all know American families have really paid \nthe price. We have gone from a budget surplus to a record deficit, our \ninfrastructure is crumbling, and our economy is now nearing a \nrecession, if we are not already there. So as we finalize this year's \nbudget, we have to ensure that we are investing in our future and \naddressing our country's real priorities.\n  It seems that every day the news we hear gets worse about job loss, \nabout skyrocketing gas prices, about the number of families who risk \nlosing their homes in the mortgage crisis. And in the eighth and final \nbudget this President has sent to us, he has really sent us off on a \nfiscally irresponsible path. He has given us a dishonest budget that \nfails to own up to the true cost\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\nof the war, and it will require us to borrow billions of dollars from \nforeign governments to meet our expenses.\n  I want to give a few examples of how out of touch President Bush's \nbudget is.\n  People today are struggling to pay for heat and rent. Yet President \nBush sent us a budget that proposed to cut low-income heating \nassistance and housing and neighborhood revitalization programs, such \nas section 8 and CDBG, right when our constituents are fighting so hard \nto pay their mortgages to make sure they stay in their homes.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are creating thousands of new \nveterans every single year, many of them, as we know, with severe \ninjuries and specialized needs. But President Bush sent us a budget \nthat cut critical programs at the VA, including medical research and \nState extended-care facilities.\n  More than 1 million people are going to lose their jobs this year. \nWhat did President Bush do in his budget proposal? He cut $484 million \nfrom critical workforce training programs.\n  Health care continues to be out of reach for millions of Americans \nwho don't have insurance or, in some cases, don't have access to \ndoctors or nurses. Yet the President sent us a budget that freezes \nMedicare reimbursement levels for our hospitals and hospices, for our \nambulance services, long-term care facilities, and he decimated funding \nfor training programs for our health care professionals.\n  It is past time that this administration joined with the majority in \nCongress and the majority of people in this country to make America's \nfamilies, the working families, our first priority.\n  The budget conference resolution makes responsible choices that will \nhelp get our economy rolling again and invest in our country's real \npriorities. With this budget which will be before the Senate shortly, \nDemocrats are investing in programs that help families meet expenses \nand get ahead, things such as schools and health care and job training. \nOur budget makes up for President Bush's misguided proposals to flat \nline funding for education and rob students of the opportunities they \nneed to get ahead.\n  We are restoring the vital funding the President has slashed from our \nNation's job training programs to help youth and adult and dislocated \nworkers get the skills they need so they can succeed in our global \neconomy.\n  We are investing in health care by adding much needed funding for our \nhealth professions, the National Health Service Corps, our community \nhealth centers, and other programs that help to ensure Americans can \nsee a doctor when they are sick.\n  We are ensuring our communities at home are safe by funding the \nhomeland security grants and restoring cuts to local law enforcement \nprograms.\n  Our budget fully funds the port security grants which the President \nproposed cutting in half. And it restores his dangerous proposal to cut \nalmost $750 million from State homeland security programs and grants. \nThose are programs that help pay for security improvements, training, \nand equipment--all of the items that our first responders need so they \ncan prepare for the worst in our communities at home.\n  Democrats are making critical investments in infrastructure in this \nbudget which will help boost spending and create jobs, while making \nmuch needed repairs to our roads and our bridges. We are also \npreventing a projected shortfall in the highway trust fund so we can \nkeep our commitment to States and communities and ensure that our \nroads, bridges, and highways are safe and up to date.\n  This budget ensures we are not turning our backs on the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation in my home State or the many other States in our \nnuclear complex where workers sacrificed to help make nuclear material \nduring the Cold War. Hanford and other sites like it are still home to \nmillions of gallons of nuclear waste and other dangerous material, and \nthe Federal Government has to live up to its promise to clean them up. \nThe longer we stretch it out, the more the cleanup is going to cost \nover the long run. The budget that will be before us reverses the trend \nof failing to invest, and it is a big step toward getting us back on \nschedule.\n  Finally, in this budget, we are doing the right thing for our \nveterans. The number of veterans is increasing every day, and the list \nof needed repairs and expanded facilities in the VA system is stacking \nup as well. But what does the administration send us? A budget that \nproposes new fees and increased copays that will essentially discourage \nmillions of veterans from even accessing the VA. In his budget, the \nPresident also underfunded VA medical care, VA medical and prosthetic \nresearch, and he cut funding for major and minor construction by nearly \n50 percent.\n  I have made it clear over the last several years that I believe \ndenying access or discouraging veterans from seeking care because of \ntheir income is morally wrong, and I believe it will also make it \nharder in the long run for us to maintain a strong voluntary military. \nDemocrats are making sure that we keep our promise to the men and women \nwho have served us so bravely.\n  I thank our chairman, Senator Conrad, for his leadership and his \ntremendously hard work to get us to this point. I urge all of our \ncolleagues to support this budget. This budget sets priorities and \ngives us critical direction as we begin the appropriations process. The \nAmerican people desperately want us to take the steps that have been \nlaid out in this budget. Our budget creates jobs, it rebuilds our roads \nand our bridges, it cares for our veterans, it invests in education, it \nhelps our families meet their basic needs, and it gets us to surplus by \n2012. After years of this President's unrealistic policies, Democrats \nwith this budget are making sure that working families are again \npriority No. 1.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington, who \nis an extraordinarily able member of the Budget Committee, someone upon \nwho I rely for much of the very hard work of the committee. She is \nsimply outstanding, and I thank her for her leadership and most of all \nfor her friendship.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, be given 30 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for providing time for me.\n  For 6 years, and those would be the years 2001 and 2003 through 2006, \nthe budget resolutions provided the necessary resources that allowed \nthe Finance Committee, the tax-writing committee, usually in a \nbipartisan manner, to realistically address the demands of tax policy. \nI am disappointed to say that this year, like last year, is different.\n  The people spoke in November of 2006, and for this year--and last \nyear--the Democrats are in the majority and in control of the \ncongressional budget process. As ranking Republican on the Finance \nCommittee, a committee I used to chair, like last year, I was not \nconsulted at any point by our distinguished chairman on this budget \nresolution. Unfortunately, after reviewing the resolution conference \nagreement, it is clear it does not realistically address the tax policy \nneeds the Finance Committee is very concerned about and has the \nresponsibility to do something about.\n  I am going to take a look at what the budget means to the American \ntaxpayers in two timeframes, from now until January 20, 2009, and then \nfor the period of time long term. Short term first; long term, the \nperiod of time after the new President is sworn in starting January 20, \n2009.\n  Let's take a look, then, at what this budget says to the American \ntaxpayer near term. For the hard-working American taxpayer, the news is \nnot all bad. I complimented the distinguished chairman for preserving \nthe ``unoffset'' AMT patch for this year in the budget. He had to \nconcede a new point of order to the House, but my guess is there will \nbe 60 votes to waive it when the AMT patch is brought up. The problem \nthat 26 million families face is uncertainty of the action on the AMT \npatch this very year. In other words, right now.\n  I have a chart here I wish to put up. It is the estimated tax \nvoucher, a form that people fill out for making quarterly payments. \nMany of the 26 million families facing the AMT technically should be \nadjusting their withholding\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nupward and filing the 1040-ES form with a check for a portion of the \nAMT they already owe because Congress hasn't acted yet to prevent the \nAMT from expanding to almost 25 million more Americans, which I don't \nthink will happen, because I think we will take care of it in time, but \nwho knows. But right now, those filing quarterly should have made this \npayment, filled this form out, on April 15. That is when the first \nquarter's estimated tax is due, and that is what the tax law says right \nnow.\n  This is all a problem because the House Democratic leadership won't \nsend us an ``unoffset'' AMT patch. Now, let's make it clear what the \nConstitution says, so people don't think I am only blaming the House of \nRepresentatives. The Constitution says tax laws must start in the House \nof Representatives. So why then won't the House Democratic leadership \nsend us an ``unoffset'' AMT patch bill so we can get it to the \nPresident? Here is the problem. The House Blue Dog Democrats will not \nsupport an ``unoffset'' AMT patch bill.\n  Now, why wouldn't the Blue Dogs do that? And I am not accusing them, \nI am stating what their position is. The answer is the Blue Dogs are a \ngrowing presence in the House of Representatives. Most of the seats \nthat shifted from the Republican column to the Democratic column in the \n2006 election are occupied by Blue Dogs.\n  The Democratic-leaning Washington punditry and the Democratic \nleadership have gloated recently about the trifecta that has happened \nbecause of the House special congressional elections this year. By \ntrifecta, I am referring to the three House races that were switched \nfrom Republicans to Democrats this year, not something this Republican \nis proud about. All three of those Members have joined or intend to \njoin the Blue Dog coalition in the other body.\n  Lord knows we have heard a lot of gloating from the other side about \nthese three new so-called conservative Democrats. We have also heard \nfrom a lot of Republicans crying in their favorite beverage about this \noutcome.\n  The Blue Dogs have had a heavy hand in this budget and are the \nleading obstacle to getting the ``unoffset'' AMT patch bill done and to \nthe Senate so we can send it to the House. So if the Blue Dogs are \nrepresenting themselves as strict agents of fiscal responsibility, it \nis a fair question for every one of us to ask about their definition of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Let's take a look at it. I have another chart here. This chart \ncontains a depiction of the most famous Blue Dog. Here he is, the most \nfamous Blue Dog, Huckleberry Hound, showing us the definition of fiscal \nresponsibility from his Blue Dog perspective. Now, here we have \nHuckleberry Hound barking ``fiscal responsibility.'' American taxpayers \nshould beware. Huckleberry Hound's bite happens to be higher taxes. \nWith respect to spending cuts, all we get is a whimper. No spending \ncuts.\n  Maybe I am being too tough on Huckleberry Hound and his Blue Dog \nfriends, but I have yet to see the empowered Blue Dogs propose spending \ncuts for deficit reduction. All I have seen is higher and higher taxes. \nLike their liberal brethren, Blue Dog Democrats only look to the \nAmerican taxpayers to fund new spending. We are seeing it once again on \nthe war supplemental bill. Why couldn't they find a spending cut here \nor there to pay for the popular veterans' benefit package? Why always \ngo to tax increases?\n  The reason I point this out is this group of House Members is holding \nup our ability to pass an AMT patch bill in a form that can pass the \nSenate and in a form that can be signed by the President. The Blue \nDogs' bark of fiscal responsibility is stalling relief for 26 million \nAMT families. The Blue Dogs insist on getting their bite of $62 billion \nin new taxes as a condition to sparing these 26 million families from \nthe AMT.\n  I agree with the Blue Dogs on the importance of \nfiscal responsibility. And as I have stepped up to the plate over the \nyears with plenty of revenue raisers, well, if you have any questions, \nask the people downtown in what we call the K Street crowd who think of \ndefending all these tax loopholes we are trying to close. But the Blue \nDogs whimper when it comes to spending cuts. They only look at the \ntaxpayers for fiscal responsibility. This obsession with raising taxes, \nmost pointedly advanced by Blue Dogs, is a theme that runs through this \nbudget.\n\n  I am going to turn now to the short-term tax legislative agenda and \nexamine how the budget squares with what we need to do.\n  As a farmer, I would like to think we country folks can teach city \nfolks a lesson or two. The first chart I am going to put up here \ninvolves the method a lot of us farmers use to get our water. You will \nsee a well in this chart. You can see it as a long well. There is a \nlittle bit of water way down there at the bottom of the well, but most \nof the well is dry.\n  Now, what we are told by those who drew up the budget is that the \ntax-writing committees will somehow plain find the money. Well, find \nthe money. You have to have some sort of consensus to do that, because \nin the Senate, to get anything done, you have to have some \nbipartisanship. We will find the money, they say, to pay for this time-\nsensitive tax business we have to deal with. Now, these are not just \nabstract things; these are pending matters. They are pieces of \nlegislation on both sides that we say we want to get done before this \nsession ends.\n  The offset well here shows about $58 billion that is known, that is \nidentified, and that is scored revenue raisers that the Senate \nDemocratic caucus supports. I used this chart several months ago trying \nto make similar points. I have updated it to assume that the farm bill \nwill become law, and I think that is going to happen within 48 hours.\n  As a rule of thumb, the Finance Committee tax staff, in a bipartisan \nway, has developed about $1 billion per month in new offsets. That \nfigure of $1 billion per month is in line with our historical average, \nthe success we have had of gleaning money by closing loopholes. How \nreliable is that average, and can we count on it?\n  As a farmer, I know something about the predictability of rainwater. \nYou hope you will get rain and that will give you a decent level of \nwell water. As a former chairman and now ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, I know something about revenue raisers. I have been there \nand done that. When I was chairman, I aggressively led efforts to \nidentify and enacted sensible revenue raisers aimed at closing the tax \ngap and shutting down tax shelters. And as ranking member, I continue \nto look for ways to shut off unintended tax benefits. So I consider \nmyself to be a credible authority on what is realistic when it comes to \nrevenue raisers.\n  From 2001 through 2006, Congress enacted over 100 offsets, with \ncombined revenue scores of $1.7 billion over 1 year, $51\\1/2\\ billion \nover 5 years, and $157.9 billion over 10 years. So if you look at \nrecent history, we can realistically figure the tax staff will find \nabout $1 billion a month. Let taxpayers who are trying to avoid \nhonestly paying taxes beware of that.\n  Right now, however, all we can find that is specified, that is \ndrafted and is scored, is that $58 billion. The revenue-raising well \nshows about $58 billion in available, defined, and scored offsets.\n  Defenders of the resolution before the Senate will say a virtual \ncornucopia of revenue raisers is there from the tax gap and from \nshutting down offshore tax scams. I take a backseat to no one on \nreducing the tax gap or shutting down offshore tax shelters. I have \nscars to show from my efforts over the years. But the defined as well \nas the scored tax gap proposals are included.\n  We have that here already.\n  Likewise, we have a proposal targeted at tax haven countries and \nother off-shore activities on this chart. The well has, then, about $58 \nbillion of offset water. This budget anticipates Congress will be \nthirsty for this limited group of offsets. On the thirst or demand \nside, you will see the bucket will be busy bringing up that water. On \nthe demand side, I have talked about next year's AMT patch--there is \n$74 billion for the patch for next year. There is $16 billion for tax \nprovisions that ran out at the start of this year. That estimate, by \nthe way, is probably low. Then there is $29 billion for next year's \nextenders, and there is $15 billion for the energy tax package we want \nto pass.\n  If you add up those things--and we have to add the $5 billion we have \nthere\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nfor the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, if we get \nto it--and I hope we get to it. So the pending, the time-sensitive tax \nbusiness totals what? It is $139 billion that we have to bring up in \nthat bucket.\n  You see $59 billion of real money is available. That is quite a \ndifference. We are short about $80 billion. I have not even included \nthe demands from the myriad of reserve funds that are mentioned in this \nresolution. Since we know from almost a decade of fiscal history that \nthe Democratic leadership cannot propose spending cuts, we know the new \nreserve funding spending will be paid for with tax increases. It has \nbeen shown to be the case since the Democrats took power in January \n2007.\n  As I said earlier, the Blue Dogs in the House of Representatives are \nleading proponents of this tax and this spending practice. You can see \nit doesn't add up. The budget plan for tax legislative business is very \nmuch out of balance. It is out of balance by at least $80 billion. Even \nif the Senate were to adopt some of the new tax hikes that the House \nhas come up with, we would be substantially still out of balance.\n  I might add I have included in the Senate offset accounting proposals \nthe House has rejected. So I think on this chart is a fairly \nconservative estimate.\n  What is going to happen? How do we then bridge that $80 billion gap? \nEither the tax relief is not going to happen or we will add that to the \ndeficit. That is a frightening proposition. I had hoped that the \nshortfall would be confined to the short term, but that is not the \ncase. Over the long term--and I said I had a short-term view and a \nlong-term view of this budget resolution. So what does it look like \nafter January 20, 2009? It gets much worse.\n  Let's take a look at the budget's assumptions about revenues over \nthat long term. Over the 5-year budget window going out to the year \n2012, keeping existing policy in place will have a revenue effect of \nover $1.2 trillion. This includes AMT relief, extension of bipartisan \n2001 and 2003 tax relief, and extending other broadly supported \nexpiring provisions.\n  In the aggregate, this budget appears to provide $340 billion in new \nresources for extending these policies over the 5-year window. Let's \nlook further, and you will find a complicated obstacle course to making \nany of this tax relief happen. To me, the conditional tax relief \nlanguage is almost bait and switch. Senator Gregg has described in \ngreat detail how this mechanism would work. To me, it is as convoluted \nas a Rube Goldberg type of invention. So I have another chart.\n  The chart shows a Rube Goldberg potato peeler invention. If you want \nto peel potatoes, I would tell Rube Goldberg to use a simple potato \npeeler. If you really mean to deliver tax relief, I would tell the \nmajority, the Democratic majority, write it into the resolution. Make \nit very clear. Don't use a Rube Goldberg mechanism.\n  Suffice it to say, the supposed $340 billion in tax relief targeted \nto 2011 and beyond assumes it will not be used for future spending. \nDoes anybody really believe this new majority will not spend future tax \nrelief if given the chance? If your answer is yes, then I have a few \nbridges in Iowa that I will sell you.\n  Under this budget, $1.3 trillion in expiring entitlement spending is \nassumed to continue. It is right in the CBO outlook. So, Mr. and Mrs. \nTaxpayers, that is right, your taxes will go up by almost $1.2 trillion \nunless Congress raises taxes to offset the revenue loss.\n  When it comes to expiring entitlement spending, it is quite a \ndifferent story. There is no requirement in this resolution for \nCongress to do any heavy lifting. This emphasis upon higher taxes and \nhigher spending is reinforced by the pay-as-you-go rules, or we say \npay-go around here. That is this budget's notion of fiscal \nresponsibility--unrestrained spending is good, higher taxes are good.\n  Over the 5 years of this budget resolution, it assumes a dramatic tax \nincrease--at least $1.2 trillion. In 2011 the bipartisan tax relief \nplan will expire. Some folks will call these provisions the Bush tax \ncuts. I suppose that term, ``Bush tax cuts,'' arises from polling by \ncampaign outfits on the other side. It is true President Bush signed \nboth bills, but the bipartisan compromises occurred in the Senate \nFinance Committee. In 2011 President Bush will have been gone from \noffice for a couple of years. You can call this package of tax relief \nfor virtually every American the Bush tax cuts, but for the taxpayers, \nif Congress does not intervene, it will be a tax increase and it will \nbe the biggest tax increase in the history of the country and it is all \ngoing to happen without a vote of the Congress.\n  So I would like to run through a couple of examples. The first would \nbe a family of four. There is the husband, his wife, and their two \nchildren. This family makes $50,000 in income. That is right about the \nnational median household income today. For example, the Census Bureau \nstated that for 2006 the national median household income was $48,200. \nUnder the Democratic leadership's budget this family will face a tax \nincrease of $2,300 per year. That is a loss in their paycheck of about \n$200 per month. It is a hit on their yearly budget of $2,300. Where I \ncome from, that is real money.\n\n  I will give another example, this one a single mom, two children. She \nearns $30,000 a year. In 2011, under this budget, she and her family \nrun straight into a brick wall--that is a brick wall of $1,100-per-year \ntaxes. That is $100 a month out of the family's budget.\n  Some on the other side will say they only excluded top-rate taxpayers \nor other high-income folks from tax relief. I am going to tell you \ndon't believe it. We have tax bills of the previous several decades to \nprove it, that you don't tax just the wealthy when you raise taxes. The \nfacts are otherwise. Low-income folks, including millions of seniors, \npay no tax on their dividends or their capital gains income. If this \nbudget stands, even with the Baucus amendment, millions of these low-\nincome taxpayers, especially seniors, will pay a 10-percent rate on \ncapital gains and could pay as high as a 15-percent rate on dividends.\n  Nationally, over 24 million families and individuals reported \ndividend income. Let's say that again--24 million Americans reported \ndividend income--because you think it is just a few hundred thousand of \nvery wealthy people--24 million families. In Iowa, for instance, we \nhave 299,000 families and individuals claiming dividend income on their \nincome tax returns. There are not 299,000 millionaire families and \nindividuals in Iowa. Nationally, we are talking about over 9 million \nfamilies and individuals reporting capital gains income. In Iowa we are \ntalking about 127,000 families and individuals.\n  There are many marginal rates other than the top rate that would rise \nif this budget stands, even with the amendment of Senator Baucus. The \n25-percent rate--which for 2007 starts at $31,850 for singles and \n$63,700 for married couples--would rise by 3 percent, to 28 percent. \nThe 28-percent rate would go up 3 percentage points to 31 percent. The \n33-percent rate would go up 3 percentage points to 36 percent. The top \nrate would go up from its current 35 percent level to 39.6 percent.\n  To sum up, even with the Baucus amendment added to this budget, there \nwould be marginal rate increases on millions of taxpayers, and not just \nmillionaires. Those marginal rate increases would reach taxpayers with \ntaxable incomes as low as $31,850 for singles and as low as $63,700 for \nmarried couples.\n  What I just described is accurate only if the Democratic leadership \nintends to follow the letter and the spirit of the Baucus amendment. If \nyou look at last year's track record, the House neutered the effect of \nthe amendment in the conference committee. They created a Rube Goldberg \ntype of mechanism to impede the amendment.\n  As I pointed out a few minutes ago, that mechanism is right back \nagain. Of course, after the budget conference report was agreed to, all \ntalk and action around the amendment then somehow ceased.\n  I wouldn't put much stock on the followthrough on the Baucus \namendment. The distinguished chairman and friend of mine points out \nthat since last year's budget, we passed tax relief of $50 billion for \nlast year's AMT patch. He will also point to the stimulus package \npassed earlier this year. The senior Senator from North Dakota is \ncorrect that those tax relief packages did pass. He used the assertion \nto counter the assertion on our side that there is a $1.2 trillion tax \nincrease in the budget.\n  The distinguished chairman omits a critical fact in his assertion, \nand that\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\nis the ``unoffset'' AMT patch passed only because Senate Republicans \nand the administration insisted that they would not use the AMT problem \nas a money machine for current and future spending. If the Democratic \ncaucus had prevailed, the AMT patch would have been offset.\n  Likewise, on the stimulus bill, there was bipartisan consensus that \neconomic stimulus should not be a tax increase.\n  When you step back from the differences across the aisle on this \nbudget, you probably will not be surprised to find some differences \namong Presidential candidates. Generally, the candidates on the other \nside have proposed to take heavily from the taxpayers under the guise \nof fiscal responsibility. This is true when they are talking about \nending the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003. It is true \nwhen they are talking about the same loophole closers for a myriad \nnumber of expansions of existing entitlements and creating new ones. \nNowhere is there discussion of reining in spending.\n  So the tax side of the Federal ledger is the only route to fiscal \nresponsibility from the perspective of Presidential candidates on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I wanted to give you one telling example. One Democratic candidate \nhas proposed to repeal the bipartisan tax relief plans for taxpayers \nearning above $250,000. This proposal raises $226 billion over 5 years \nand 10 years. A key fact is that the source of that revenue peters out \nover the next few years because under current tax law, the tax relief \nsunsets at the end of 2010.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator through the Chair that we would be \nhappy to accede to the request if the Senator could say something nice \nabout the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Besides the work of Senator Harkin, we have an \noutstanding farm bill because of the hard work of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What a kind and gracious thing to say. We would be happy \nto agree to the request. The Senator would like 4 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think that is it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Why don't we give the Senator 5. You can give back any \ntime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I interrupt the Senator and ask unanimous consent \nwhen the Senator has concluded, we go to Senator Wyden?\n  How much time would the Senator speak?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think it would range up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Are we confident that 10 is sufficient?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then I ask unanimous consent to go to Senator Wyden for \n10 minutes after Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, I was talking about Presidential candidates and \nwhat their budget plans might do.\n  Like the Democratic leadership's budget, the candidates on the other \nside oversubscribe the revenue sources from proposals that are popular \nwith the Democratic base. The deficiency can only be made up in three \nways: One, other undefined sources of revenue would need to be tapped. \nThe taxpayers should rightly be worried about that avenue. Two, the \nproposed spending plan would need to be abandoned or curtailed. There \nis not much history on the Democratic side of this avenue being taken. \nThree, add to the deficit for the cost of the new programs. \nUnfortunately, this avenue has been taken too many times.\n  We will hear a lot of criticism of the Republican candidate, Senator \nMcCain, from those on the other side. They will argue, like the \nPresident's budget, a continuation of current-law levels of taxation \nsomehow costs the Federal Government too much revenue, just like all \nthe money every worker makes belongs to the Government and we let the \ntaxpayers keep a little bit of it. They will argue that the spending \nincreases they propose are more important than the restrained levels of \nthe President's budget, and they will argue that despite the record tax \nhikes in their budget, entitlement reform is a matter for another day. \nIn fact, Senator McCain's plan intends to keep the revenue take where \nit is as a share of the economy. You see revenue averages of about 18.3 \npercent of the economy. That is 18.3 of the GDP.\n  The state of the economy affects revenues more than anything else. \nThere are dips when we have been in recession and peaks when growth is \nhigh. Our side cares about keeping the revenue line at a reasonable \nlevel, about 18 to 19 percent.\n  We do not see the merits of an imperative behind a growing role for \nGovernment in the economy. The other side disagrees. That is their \nphilosophy, they are entitled to it. I think they are wrong.\n  They impliedly or explicitly reject our premise that the size of \nGovernment needs to be kept in check. That view has been best expressed \nin an editorial of October 22, 2007, in the New York Times. The lead \nparagraph says it best:\n\n       President Bush considers himself a champion tax cutter, but \n     all the leading Republican presidential candidates are eager \n     to outdo him. Their zeal is misguided. This country's meager \n     tax take puts its economic prospects at risk and leaves the \n     Government ill equipped to face the challenges from \n     globalization.\n\n  But the bottom line is the New York Times directly states the view \nbehind this budget and the position of the Democratic candidates. From \nthis perspective, the historical level of taxation is not somehow \nappropriate as a measure for the next decade.\n  The New York Times implies that the Federal Government must grow as a \npercentage of our economy by at least 5 to 8 points. That is more than \never in the history of the country. If we were to follow the path \nsuggested by the Times, the Government's share of our economy would \ngrow by one-third. One-third. One-third is a great big increase in \nGovernment. The Democratic leadership budget takes some big steps on \nthat path. So do the campaign proposals of the Democratic candidates. \nThey go in the same direction.\n  Our Republican conference takes a different view. America is a \nleading market economy. American prosperity and economic strength, in \nour view, is derived from a vigorous private sector that affords all \nAmericans the opportunity to work hard, to save, and to invest more of \ntheir money.\n  A growing economy is the best policy objective. It makes fiscal sense \nas well. Fiscal history shows that despite criticism to the contrary, \nthe bipartisan tax relief plan drove revenues back up after the \neconomic shocks we suffered earlier this decade. I am referring to the \nstock market bubble, corporate scandals, and the 9/11 terror attacks. \nRevenues bounced back when the economy bounced back. The revenue \noutperformed CBO's projections by a significant extent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. PRYOR). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Oregon is to be recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4602-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4602-S4603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the television news folks spent much of \nyesterday looking at brain scans and pretty much counting out our \nfriend Ted Kennedy. But I will tell you today, I think the TV crowd is \nmissing a much bigger story; that is, Ted is the most determined person \nI have met, and anybody who counts Ted Kennedy out needs to have their \nhead examined.\n  Now, earlier today, Senator Kennedy's son, Ted junior, gave me a \ncall. Ted junior is a wonderful guy. We talked about all of the \ninstances where his family has tackled illness, defeated cancer. Ted \njunior told me earlier today that his dad is mobilizing, he is building \na battle plan against cancer, he is talking to the experts, he is \ndigging out the facts the way we know Ted Kennedy does unlike anybody \nelse here in the Senate. And certainly Senator Kennedy is not \nsugarcoating anything.\n  But I think it is also important to note that he sure is looking \nahead. Senator Kennedy is especially looking forward to the passion of \nhis life in public service, fixing health care and universal health \ncoverage, coverage for all of our people.\n  Ted has always been America's go-to guy on health care. He has always \nbeen our conscience, our leader on the premier domestic issue of our \ntime. Ted is always telling me--he is telling a lot of\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\nthe Senators--that this time Democrats and Republicans here in the \nSenate can get it done, that after 60 years of bickering and quarreling \npartisanship, at this time, it can get done. Ted says there is no \nreason the richest and strongest country on Earth cannot figure this \nout and cannot figure out a way to get good health care to all of our \npeople. I especially like the way Ted points out that we have thousands \nand thousands of wonderful doctors and hospitals and health care \nproviders. They are ready and waiting for the political leadership to \nstep up and tackle this issue.\n  Now, nobody has stepped up on health care the way Ted Kennedy has. \nNobody has put the effort into looking ahead and what is it going to \ntake to fix the system, to build the coalitions--business, labor, \nseniors, doctors, health care providers--all the people who are going \nto be necessary to fix health care.\n  We should be very grateful that Ted Kennedy has always stepped up on \nfixing American health care, particularly the challenge of our time, \nuniversal coverage. And I for one am very glad this afternoon that \nSenator Kennedy is looking forward to being back at his post, as we go \nforward, Democrats and Republicans, and tackle this issue, this issue \nso important to our people and our families. That is what Senator \nKennedy and his public service is all about. I want to report this \nafternoon, he is sure looking ahead to the big challenges we face. And \nwe want him back here with us as soon as he can.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last year we were obligated to accept the \nassurances from the majority that under this new regime, pay-go would \nbe respected, spending would be curbed, the entitlement crisis would be \naddressed, and the debt would be attacked. Undoubtedly, that was an \nambitious agenda. Obviously, it didn't happen. We now have results, not \npredictions. When all was said and done last year, there was an $83 \nbillion increase in discretionary spending. There was $143 billion in \npay-go violations. Pay-go violations are provisions we put in the \nbudget that help assure we get moving toward deficit reduction and \neventually balancing the budget and reducing debt. We didn't close the \ntax gap. We added to the national debt. The budget was used to add \nspending, not reduce it.\n  Previous to that year, we had always had strong budget provisions \nthat forced budget discipline that actually held down spending. We did \nnothing for entitlement reform, and we assumed tax increases.\n  When we began consideration of the fiscal 2009 budget resolution, I \nhoped everyone was aware of what was promised last year and what \ntranspired. I hope they will use that knowledge with what we see today \nto understand that what we have now, with two budgets written, soon to \nbe approved, is a pattern, a distinct pattern. That pattern is fiscally \ndamaging to this country. The Democratic budget assumes a tax hike of \nat least $1.2 trillion which will hit 116 million Americans. This is \nthe second year in a row that the majority party is expecting the \nAmerican public to surrender more of their income to fund big \ngovernment.\n  The pay-for assumed in this budget is simply fantasy. The tax gap, \nfor instance, instead of being closed, was actually expanded last year. \nMiddle-class tax relief was not passed last year either. This budget \npushes annual spending over the $1 trillion mark for the first time \never. It increases spending over the President's budget by at least \n$210 billion over 5 years. That is without including the $79 billion we \nare considering on the floor this week in the supplemental. We have \ncertainly lost control of our budget.\n  I want to take a moment and comment that our Budget Committee \nchairman must be having a little fun with us with his chart showing the \ndifference between his budget and the President's budget. His claim \nthat there is little difference between the two lines on his chart must \nbe intended to be humorous, when the Y axis is over a trillion dollars. \nIf he is teasing us, I appreciate his humor; if he is serious, I fear \nfor us.\n  Another huge problem in this budget is that the biggest fiscal danger \nin our future, the looming entitlement crisis, is made worse. Actually, \n``danger'' isn't the word. It is not a threat. It is not a danger; it \nis reality. It is a fact. We need to deal with it. For a second year in \na row, nothing is done to address the $66 trillion entitlement crisis \nnow on our doorstep. The budget allows entitlement spending to grow by \nat least $500 billion over 5 years. This is a huge avalanche of debt \nwaiting to bury our future. But we do nothing. We are not even doing \nsomething as productive as fiddling. We are just talking year after \nyear and perhaps wishing it will go away. Instead of reducing the debt \nas they promised, the majority allows gross debt to climb by $2 \ntrillion by 2013. That debt will have to be paid back by future \ngenerations. In fact, every American child will owe an additional \n$27,000 or more under this budget.\n  We didn't see many amendments that tried to reduce the debt. I \noffered one to try to do that, where we looked at those programs that \nwere rated as ineffective. I asked the Members of this body to vote \nwith me to not have a pay increase to these ineffective programs. I \nthought at least we will let them maintain their funding levels for the \nprevious year. We won't give them an increase, just as we would do with \na poorly performing employee. We were not able to get the votes we \nneeded to even put that simple policy in effect. We face a huge \nchallenge, and we need to have a budget that provides the enforcement \nmechanisms that bring some fiscal sanity back to the process.\n  There is so much that is disappointing in this resolution that I hate \nto call attention to some specific points for fear of ignoring all \nothers. But let me point out that an amendment I added in markup, which \ncalled for disclosures on debt, was removed. This shows the American \npublic that there are things being done to their paychecks in this bill \nthat the majority party doesn't want them to know. Now that our economy \nis trending in the wrong direction and when we need the benefits of a \nreasonable and pro-growth tax policy, we are going to depress our \neconomic growth by adding to the debt and increasing taxes.\n  When we consider these tax increases, let's remember, last year we \nwere assured we would see tax relief. The first vote we were presented \non the budget last year was to budget for an alleged middle-class tax \ncut. This never materialized. I believe Congress and especially the \nBudget Committee should be committed to rigid budget discipline, not \npolitically expedient gamesmanship. I urge a return to a tighter and \nmore credible budget document. I plan to offer several amendments to \nshore up the fiscal discipline we are seeing erode.\n  Given that this budget assumes raised taxes, increased spending, \nincreases in the debt, failure to address the entitlement crisis, and \ncontinuing the ongoing erosion of fiscal discipline in the Government, \nI feel compelled to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, in recent polling, close to 80 percent of \nthe American public have told pollsters the Nation is on the wrong \ntrack. We have enormous problems to solve. The American people know it, \nand we should be working together to solve those problems. But this \nbudget, written behind closed doors and in secret by a partisan group \nof Senators, will do\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nnothing to close the gulf that is keeping us from the people's \nbusiness. Maybe that is by design.\n  Majority Leader Reid recently explained that Senator Clinton \nrecommended to him that the Democrats should have a Senate ``war \nroom.'' The war room is up and running today, churning out falsehoods, \nsuch as claims that Republicans have staged 71 filibusters--a claim now \ndisputed by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Who are the \nDemocrats at war with?\n  Just as my good friend, General Petraeus, began to make progress \nreversing the insurgency in Iraq, the leadership of the Senate decided \nto wage a different kind of war--a war on Americans who do not share \ntheir vision of the future. The vision Democrats would promote, to the \nexclusion of all others, is laid out in this budget document before us. \nIt begins with more tax enforcement. Everybody should abide by the law \nand pay the taxes they owe. And I support our new IRS Commissioner. But \nthe notion that we can save anywhere near the amount proposed by \nSenator Conrad is nonsense, and he should know it.\n  The only way to collect that revenue would be to toss out the \nprocedural rights American taxpayers now enjoy. These rights are \ncritical because they assure fair and evenhanded enforcement by the \nIRS. The Government will lose far more revenue than Senator Conrad \nproposes to save if the public loses confidence in the fairness of our \ntax system.\n  His own colleagues in the House are not serious about this either. If \nthey were, the House would not have voted on party lines to stop audits \nof a handful of wealthy Americans under audit by the IRS who claim to \nbe Virgin Islands residents. What is the IRS to make of this mixed \nmessage?\n  The next part of the Democratic vision is predictable: more taxes. In \norder to achieve balance, the Democrats' budget assumes $1.2 trillion \nin additional revenue compared to today's baseline. Has anybody asked \nthe 80 percent who think we are on the wrong track whether they would \nraise taxes on 116 million Americans?\n  At least 43 million American families will pay $2,300 more per year \nin Federal tax for the spending in this budget proposal.\n  Finally, and most significantly, the Democrats' plan on entitlement \nreform is to stay the course. Senator Domenici, the former chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, told Budget conferees yesterday that he fears for \nour future and the future of our children and our grandchildren. Having \n35 grandchildren, I share his concerns.\n  As any ship's captain knows, when you are heading for the rocks, it \nis time to change course. Staying the course is the wrong policy and \nthe wrong message, and I am disappointed my colleagues have been \nunwilling to work with me and with the President to turn the ship of \nstate in the right direction with this budget document.\n  Please--the American people are watching--let's do what is right and \nreject this partisan document and write a budget we can all be proud \nof.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, while we have been in caucus discussing \nhow the business of the Senate will be concluded over the next several \ndays, I note that a number of my colleagues have spoken to once again \nassert and claim that there is a tax increase in the budget conference \nreport before us. That is a fiction. Our friends on the other side have \na very consistent speech, and they give it regardless of what is \nactually in the legislation. I can say that because we have a record \nnow of their giving this same speech, because they gave the exact same \nspeech last year, almost word for word.\n  Last year, as shown on this chart, this was the description of the \nranking member of the Budget Committee with respect to the conference \nreport. He said then:\n\n       It includes, at a minimum, a $736 billion tax hike on \n     American families and businesses over the next five years--\n     the largest in U.S. history.\n\n  Now we are able to check the record and able to see what, in fact, \nhas happened. Did the Democratic Congress pass the largest tax increase \nin history in the last year? No. Did we pass any tax increase? No. Here \nis what we did do: We passed $194 billion of tax reduction. That is the \nrecord. People do not have to know what specific legislation has \noccurred here to know what I am saying is true. All they have to do is \ngo to their mailbox. Because tens of millions of Americans are getting \na check from the U.S. Treasury, courtesy of the Congress controlled by \nDemocrats and, in fairness, a law signed by the President--one \nnegotiated in a completely bipartisan way to provide stimulus to the \neconomy.\n  There were $7 billion of loophole closers enacted during the same \nperiod. So the net effect of the two is $187 billion of tax reduction. \nThat is our record.\n  Now they are saying: Well, they have this big tax increase in this \npackage. No, we do not. That is their assumption. It is not ours. What \nis provided for in this package is $340 billion of tax reduction. The \nBaucus amendment, passed here--it is included in the conference \nreport--extends all the middle-class tax cuts and reforms the estate \ntax. Mr. President, $340 billion of tax reduction.\n  Now, our colleagues say: Well, they had that in last year's budget \nand did not pass a law to implement it. That is true. You do not need \nto implement it until the tax reductions that are in place expire. They \ndo not expire until 2010. So, yes, we have provided for them in the 5-\nyear budget. That is to be responsible to show we can balance even with \nthose tax cuts extended. But you do not need to pass the law now \nbecause those tax cuts are in effect until 2010.\n  I wanted to say that to set the record straight. I know Senator Kyl \nis here waiting to speak, so I will stop at this time so he has a \nchance to make his remarks.\n  I say to Senator Kyl, for the good of the order, could you give us a \nrough idea how long you might speak?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to Senator Conrad, I would say no more \nthan 10 to 15 minutes. I will say 15, but probably I will not take that \nmuch time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would it be appropriate to have a unanimous consent \nagreement that the Senator have 15 minutes--or 20, and then he can \nyield back time if he wishes.\n  Mr. KYL. No. Mr. President, I am happy to ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 15 minutes, and then whatever time Senator Conrad would urge \nafter that, subject to Senator Gregg's intercession as well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I say, then we have a couple of other Senators on \nour side who wish to say something and, hopefully, we will then be done \non our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me engage in a little bit more of the sparring \nbetween the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and the \ndistinguished ranking member, both of whom have had a good debate here. \nBut I would like to add to that debate.\n  There is a lot of discussion here that must cause Americans watching \nthis to wonder what on Earth is going on here when we pass a budget and \nthat budget assumes various things, and then there are charges back and \nforth that you have passed a tax cut, you have not passed a tax cut, \nyou have passed a tax increase, you have not, and so on.\n  Let me see if I can clarify that with what are, in fact, the real \nassumptions in the budget and what the Senate has and has not done.\n  The ranking member of the Budget Committee is correct that the budget \nthat has passed the Senate already, and that the Senate is about to \nenact again, in fact, assumes tax increases which will amount to the \nlargest tax increase in the history of the world--$1.2 trillion. Those \nare assumed in this budget.\n  Now, the chairman of the committee correctly says: Well, we have not \nactually passed those tax cuts. That, of course, is true. The budget is \nnot a law, a bill that is sent to the President for\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nhis signature so he can sign it and then it becomes law. That is not \nwhat a budget is. The budget is the document we use to frame our \ndeliberations in the Congress for this coming year. We are supposed to \nstick to it. It sets an upper limit on spending. It sets the revenues \nthat we assume will come in, and part of the revenue is based on taxes.\n  So what this budget does is to say we assume we are going to have \ntaxes of $1.2 trillion more than we have today. That is what this \nbudget assumes, and that is the largest tax increase in the history of \nthe world.\n  Now, the chairman responded first by saying: Well, actually we have \nalso included something else in this budget so you cannot say it is \nnecessarily the biggest tax increase in the history of the world \nbecause we passed what is called the Baucus amendment, and the Baucus \namendment is supposed to provide an extension of certain current tax \nrates that would otherwise expire in the year 2010, and if we do that, \nthen we will not actually have that tax increase.\n  The answer is, that is true, were we to do that, that tax increase \nwould not occur--at least it would not occur to that amount.\n  Well, we did the same thing last year. We had the Baucus amendment \nlast year. But Congress never passed any tax relief based on the Baucus \namendment. So while the Baucus amendment was in the budget, it was \nnever implemented. The truth is, it is not going to be implemented this \nyear either. I think everyone will acknowledge that.\n\n  So it is no answer to say the tax increases that are assumed in the \nbudget are actually wiped off because the Baucus amendment is also a \npart of the amendment. The Baucus amendment is not going to be \nimplemented this year, just as it wasn't implemented last year.\n  The third response the chairman of the Budget Committee made was: \nWell, that is true, but we actually don't have to pass the Baucus \namendment until these current tax rates expire because they currently \nexist until the end of 2010. So we can still say we passed a tax cut, \neven though we haven't enacted anything, because we are going to assume \nexisting law continues until the end of 2010.\n  Well, that is an odd way to argue that you have actually cut taxes. \nYou haven't cut any taxes at all. You have done nothing but allow \ncurrent rates to continue for next year and the year 2010. It is a good \nthing those rates are continuing; we wouldn't want them to increase. \nThey are the Bush tax cuts that many Democrats have been very critical \nof. But here now Democrats are bragging about keeping them in effect \nfor another 2 years. Well, I am glad. I am happy they are being kept in \neffect for another 2 years. I am worried about what is going to happen \nafter that. The problem is this budget assumes they are going away. \nThat is the $1.2 trillion we are speaking of.\n  Now, what happens to average Americans if this tax cut fails to \nmaterialize and, in fact, the tax increase actually occurs? Well, this \nbudget conference agreement we will be voting on assumes that single \npeople earning as little as $31,000 a year, couples making $63,000, \nwill see their taxes go up. That is because it assumes the 25-percent \nbracket which kicks in around $32,000 next year for single filers, \n$63,000 for married couples, will go to 28 percent. Well, is this 3 \npercentage points a lot? Is that a big deal? Well, it is a marginal tax \nrate increase of 12 percent. When you add percentage points onto 25 and \ngo to 28, that is a 12-percent increase. That means people in the 25-\npercent bracket--and that is people earning as little as $32,000 a \nyear--will give the Federal Government 12 percent more of every dollar \nthey earn over $32,000 more than they do today.\n  What does that mean? Well, let's look at some high school teachers in \nPhoenix and Tucson, AZ, my home State. In Phoenix, they make between \n$42,000 and $63,000 on average. So they would see a significant tax \nincrease. How big? Well, according to calculations run by the Budget \nCommittee, the average tax increase for this middle-income family will \nbe more than $2,000. That may not be much to some, but it is a lot of \nmoney to the average school teacher in Phoenix. The average school \nteacher in Tucson makes between $38,000 and $56,000, on average. Most \npeople think of that as middle class, not wealthy. But under this \nbudget, they would see their taxes go up almost the same amount--\n$2,000.\n  Small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy--that is \nwhere most of our employment is occurring today. Yet this budget \nconference agreement raises taxes on small businesses because all \nincome tax brackets above the 15-percent bracket will increase, and \nsmall businesses pay on those upper tax brackets. Most small \nbusinesses--in fact, the owners of small businesses report their \nbusiness income on their individual income tax returns and, in fact, \nover 80 percent of filers in the top bracket report small business \nincome. So you think you are going to soak the rich by increasing the \ntop tax bracket? Well, you are increasing taxes for the small \nbusinesses of America. That is who ends up paying the increased taxes.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses \nrepresent 99.7 percent of all employer firms. They employ about half of \nall private sector employees. They generate between 60 to 80 percent of \nthe net new jobs annually. Increasing small business taxes will hurt \nour economy.\n  How about investors? This is becoming an investor Nation, people \nsaving for their retirement, American seniors living off their savings. \nIn fact, every American who saves and invests rather than spending \ntheir extra earnings will see their taxes go up under this budget.\n  The budget allows the 15-percent capital gains rate to go to 20 \npercent. That is a 33-percent increase in the tax rate. The dividends \ntax rate will go up a whopping 164 percent. We talked about a little \nbit of an increase--164 percent is not little. That is on dividends. \nThat is what seniors get when they invest their retirement savings and \nget a dividend from the corporation they have invested in. That goes \nfrom 15 percent to 39.6 percent.\n  Why are these rates important? Because keeping tax rates low on \ninvestment income gives people the incentive to put their money to work \nby investing it; by investing in businesses, small and large, and it \ngives the businesses the resources they need to grow: to hire more \nemployees, to buy more equipment, produce more goods and services. All \nthis, of course, helps the economy grow; it helps produce more wealth \nand, by the way, it helps produce more revenue for the Federal Treasury \nas well.\n  I said we have become an investor Nation. Capital gains. Now, 45 \npercent of all elderly taxpayers reporting capital gains had an \nadjusted gross income of $50,000 or less. Rich? We are going to tax the \nrich here? No. We may be aiming at the rich, but we are hitting the \nmiddle class. A $50,000 income is not rich. These are our senior \ncitizens' dividends. Mr. President, 67.6 percent of all elderly \ntaxpayers reporting dividend income had an adjusted gross income of \n$50,000 or less. The same thing; these are not wealthy people. They are \nreceiving dividends based on retirement income, and they are going to \nreceive a whopping tax increase under the assumptions of this budget. \nIn fact, if you look at the data for all filers under $50,000, capital \ngains that are $50,000 of income, 35.8 percent of the filers reported \ncapital gains income. Forty-one percent of the filers with incomes of \nless than $50,000 reported qualified dividend income. So we are talking \nabout folks who are not wealthy, who are reporting not only income but \ndividend income and capital gains income, getting a huge increase in \ntheir taxes because the rates on dividends and capital gains are \nincreased under the assumptions of this budget.\n  As I said before, there has also been talk of not only taxes going \nup, but the budget chairman actually said we have actually cut taxes by \nabout $187 billion. Now, this is--well, let's say it bears examination. \nThe tax cut the chairman is counting is simply the existence of the law \ntoday. It is existing law. It is continuing that law. As he said \nbefore, we don't have to take any action because it is already law, and \nit continues for 2 more years. That is right. But it is not as if we \npassed a law to cut taxes. We haven't. We have left them alone. That is \nnot cutting taxes.\n  This year we are going to enact a 1-year fix for the AMT because we \ndon't want people to have to pay for that. We are going to extend the \nso-called tax extenders for businesses, such as the\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nR tax credit. We will do those things, but it is not as if the people \nshould be grateful to us for cutting their taxes. That is simply taking \naction to make sure their taxes don't go up. It is to keep them exactly \nwhere they are. That is not a tax cut; that is protecting people to \nretain the existing level of taxation.\n  Then, the stimulus checks which make up the rest of this, they are \nnot a tax cut either. Remember, that is what the President did when he \nnegotiated with the House of Representatives and said: Let's stimulate \nthe economy by giving people $300 or $600 to spend, and that money is \nstarting to be received by Americans today.\n  So I don't think the Congress should be bragging about a big tax cut \nwhen, in fact, all we have done is to retain existing rates, and all we \nare going to do is retain existing rates. When I say all we are going \nto do, believe me, that is important. It is important that we not let \ntaxes increase, but that is what this budget assumes. As the ranking \nmember of the committee pointed out, the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the world is assumed in this budget, and here is the \nproblem: Right now, Congress does not have to do anything, as the \nchairman of the Budget Committee said. That is true. But in 2 years, we \ndo have to do something or else taxes are going to go up. This is not a \nmatter of stopping a big tax increase; this is a matter of all these \ntax rates--the marginal income tax rates, the death tax, capital gains \nrates, dividend rates--all these rates that are currently in law \nexpire, and they are all increased unless we act.\n\n  That is the assumption of this budget. That is why it would be \nirresponsible for us to support this budget and assume Congress is not \ngoing to do the responsible thing and stop those tax rates from \nincreasing. That would be devastating to our economy. It is the last \nthing you would want to do in a time of economic downturn, and it would \nbe the last straw for American families who are already seeing too much \nof their income having to go to buy gasoline, to buy a quart of milk or \nto buy whatever else it is they need for their families with the prices \nhaving gone up. To have a tax increase on top of that would, as I said, \nnot only be devastating for the economy, but it would be critical to \nAmerican families. Ironically, if we are concerned about revenues to \nthe Federal Government, it is also the best way to make sure the \nGovernment doesn't collect very much revenue either, because in an \neconomic downturn, the people don't make as much, and therefore they \ndon't pay the Government as much in taxes.\n  The bottom line is this is a budget that assumes a huge tax increase. \nIt doesn't do a thing to cut taxes. It is not something we should be \nsupportive of. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from New \nHampshire earlier in pointing out the fact it is a budget Congress \nshould reject on behalf of the American people. Go back, do this work \nover again, abide by the instructions to conferees that we passed on \nthe floor of the Senate last week, and ensure that these things can \noccur without raising taxes, which would be the last straw for the \neconomy we are in right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to, once again, thank \nSenator Conrad and all the conferees who have worked so hard. I know \nSenator Gregg and Senator Conrad may have a different view on the \nbudget, but certainly I appreciate our ranking member's professionalism \nin working across the aisle on so many issues and working to place this \nbudget resolution, the final resolution, in front of us.\n  The chairman and the conferees are presenting the American people \nwith a budget resolution that lays out the Nation's priorities and \nfocuses on what we ought to be doing to improve our economy. We put \ntogether a budget, and as a member of the Budget Committee, I am very \nproud to have played a role in putting it together. I believe it gets \nit right. It is about our values and our priorities. It is about \ninvesting in our future as Americans.\n  Today we are saying our Nation's budget, which lays out our values \nand priorities, will focus on the economy, on jobs, and on the future \nof the country. I come from the great State of Michigan, where the \nissue of jobs is very serious and very real. People in Michigan want us \nto act in a way that is going to allow people to have a good-paying \njob, to be able to work hard, to be able to pay the bills and pay for \nthe outrageous gas prices and the soaring costs of health care and the \ncost of college and food and all the other things that are squeezing \nfamilies on all sides. They want to know they have an opportunity to \nwork. We work hard in Michigan. People across this country, middle-\nclass families every day are working hard, and they want to know that \nour Federal priorities include creating opportunities for people to \nwork, to be able to care for themselves and their families.\n  Let me first indicate it gets pretty old. You know, it seems the old, \ntired refrain comes from colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nWhen in doubt, when you can't say anything about the economy under this \nWhite House and 6 of the last 8 years under colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, when you can't say anything about soaring deficits, \nwhen you can't say anything about the inaction and unwillingness of the \nWhite House to work with us in a manner that will quickly respond to \nthe housing crisis; when you can't say anything about any of those \nthings, what do you say about Democrats? Well, it is the tired, old \nrefrain of tax and spend.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that this budget resolution is 1 \npercent higher than the President's budget resolution--1 percent \nhigher--and it returns to a surplus. In other words, we balance the \nbudget in 2012 and in 2013. It is a 1-percent difference. What does \nthat mean? This is not about tax increases on low-income or middle-\nincome families. This is not a budget that is focusing on adding costs \nto families. This is a budget that focuses on taking costs off families \nand valuing work and creating opportunity and investing in the future \nof our children with education, focusing on the things Americans want \nto see focused on. People in America are saying, what about us? We are \nseeing a war where we are spending $12 billion a month, unpaid for--\nhundreds of millions of dollars that have gone into rebuilding roads \nand schools in Iraq, even though they have oil revenues and have not \nbeen contributing, as they should, to rebuilding their own country. \nPeople in America are saying, what about us, our roads, schools, and \njobs in America?\n\n  That is what this budget addresses. We focus on the future and on \nmaking sure American families have the confidence that we are putting \nthem first. Last year, Congress began fixing the fiscal mess caused by \nthe administration's 6 years of neglecting the homefront. This budget \ncontinues that effort by focusing on what is most important to American \nfamilies.\n  We have three priorities in this budget: jobs, jobs, and jobs. I am \nvery proud of that.\n  Today, we are bringing fiscal sanity back to our budget, while at the \nsame time investing in a plan that will create good-paying American \njobs, including rebuilding our Nation's aging infrastructure, our \nroads, bridges, and other infrastructure--in other words, rebuilding \nAmerican jobs, rebuilding America, with jobs that cannot be outsourced \noverseas--good-paying jobs, middle-class jobs--investing in America.\n  Promoting education and job training is so critically needed in this \nfast-paced, changing world we live in. There is also investment in the \nfuture of our energy economy. I am proud my green collar jobs \ninitiative is a part of that. Let me speak to that for a moment. As \npart of our effort to create jobs and look to the future, I was very \npleased that the Senate included my green collar jobs initiative, and \nthat it is substantially intact as it comes out of the conference \ncommittee. We focused on 5 areas in the proposal that we put forward: \nenergy efficiency, and conservation, jobs, weatherizing buildings, \ngrants to State and local communities for energy efficiency, and \nconservation. We can immediately create thousands and thousands of jobs \nby doing the right thing on energy efficiency and conservation.\n  Secondly, there is advanced battery technology. When you come from my \ngreat State, where we are proud to make automobiles, the buzz word \nthese\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\ndays is ``batteries.'' If we are going to compete and meet our mandate \non fuel efficiency and move away from dependence on foreign oil, we \nhave to be investing in advanced battery technology. Right now, China, \nJapan, and South Korea are ahead of us. When Ford Motor Company decided \nto make their first hybrid SUV--and I am proud they did that--they \ncould not find a battery in America. They had to buy that from Japan. \nWith all of the American ingenuity and the smart people we have, we \nhave not been investing in advanced battery technology.\n  Last year, the President's budget had something like $22 million in \nit versus the hundreds of million around the world. Our plan that we \npassed here in the Senate had $250 million in investment in advanced \nbattery technology to make sure we can do the plug-ins, and that GM can \nquickly move on this technology, and Chrysler is investing in hybrids \nand other technology, so our companies can compete globally because \nAmerica invests in our technology.\n  Retooling older plants. We don't want to say come over and we will \nbuild you the plant. We want to keep the jobs in America.\n  As to biofuel production and access, we know we have spent a lot of \nenergy on biofuel production.\n  Infrastructure and assets are very important. It is great to make the \nfuel. We want to grow it in Michigan--and we are--but if you cannot buy \nit at the pump, it doesn't do much good. This focuses on that as well.\n  Finally, green job training programs, to create new opportunities. \nThat is what this resolution is all about--value work and looking to \nthe future. This budget provides, as well, $2.5 billion more than the \nPresident requested for transportation accounts for rebuilding America. \nIt fully funds the highway and transit programs authorized by the \nhighway bill and includes funding for airport improvement--all things \nthat help us and our communities create safer ways to be able to move \naround, whether it is airports or roads or whether it is commerce or \nfamilies going on a vacation or going back and forth to work. These are \ninvestments in America. It is about creating good-paying jobs.\n  The Department of Transportation estimates that for every $1 billion \nin highway spending, you create 47,500 good-paying middle-class jobs. \nThis budget recognizes that. It also creates $2 billion in economic \nactivity for every $1 billion we invest in infrastructure.\n  I am glad to see, for the benefit of our country and our families, \nthat the conferees have also invested in other important areas related \nto education and job training for the future. This is absolutely \ncritical for us.\n  This budget resolution reflects the values and priorities of the \nAmerican people. It makes sure we are rejecting the President's efforts \nto eliminate the COPS program. We want to keep our families safe in \ntheir communities, with our children being able to play in parks and on \nthe streets, and know that we have community police officers available \nto help keep them safe. Then there are the Byrne grants to help our \nfirst responders, the firefighters and police officers.\n  We also, I am proud to say, keep the promise we began last year to \nfully fund veterans health care as a major priority for our country.\n  So there is a lot to celebrate in this budget. On top of the new \ninvestment and new priorities and changing the way things are done, \nthese investments are paid for because we are following what is called \nthe pay-go rules, which helped balance the budget back in the 1990s and \nbrought us into surplus at the end of the last decade.\n  We cannot mortgage our children's future, as the administration has \ndone, with soaring deficits and record spending that is not paid for. \nInstead, we invest in our children's future, in our families, and we \nbalance the budget by 2012.\n  Again, I congratulate our chairman for his tenacity, his passion, and \nhis commitment to doing the right thing, doing it in a fiscally \nresponsible way. We have all worked so hard to lay out a vision of \nAmerica that is about jobs, about the future, about investing in \nAmerica. It is time we did that. The American people expect us to do no \nless.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Stabenow, who is an extremely valuable member of the \nBudget Committee, for her contribution throughout the budget process \nthis year. She has been an absolute champion of the green jobs \ninitiative. We have $2 billion in this conference report for green \njobs, which is not only going to help the economy, but it is also going \nto be good environmentally, and we think even better long term in the \neconomics of the country, because we are going to have, as the world \nturns its attention with greater concern to environmental issues, high-\npaying jobs here in this country.\n  That takes some work, some investment. That is provided for in this \nconference report. Frankly, it is one of the things I am most proud of \nin this conference report. It would not have happened without the \neffort of the Senator from Michigan. She deserves great credit for \nthat. She has also been one of the real leaders on making certain that \nour veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan have the health care \nthey need and deserve. That is the second part of this bill of which I \nam especially proud--the additional resources--some $3 billion above \nwhat the President requested--for health care for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  A third area in which the Senator from Michigan has been especially \nhelpful has been the health care. She has championed health information \ntechnology, and we have a reserve fund here to take advantage of the \nopportunity that is out there for the Nation by more broadly adopting \nthe use of information technology in medical care.\n  The RAND Corporation has told us--and the Senator has brought it to \nour attention repeatedly, and that is why it is very much in my mind--\nthat we can save $80 billion a year, if I am not mistaken, if we would \nbroadly adopt information technology in the health care industry, the \nhealth care sector. Think of that--$80 billion a year, over 5 years. \nThat is more than $400 billion. So that makes common sense.\n  I will conclude by saying I think this has been a healthy and full \ndebate today. We have had almost 4 hours, which is about typical on a \nconference report. I am being informed by the leadership we will not \nvote until tomorrow morning. I am told that the likelihood is that the \nbudget, which is subject to agreement with both sides--I am being told \nof the likelihood that the budget vote will not occur until perhaps \n9:30 tomorrow morning. I am told the farm bill override vote will also, \nmost likely, occur tomorrow.\n  I don't have that conclusively, but that is the initial indication I \nam receiving, that that is the most likely outcome. So I urge Senators \nnot to jump in their cars and head home without checking out with \nleadership staffs on both sides, but that in fact is the likelihood. I \ndon't think I have anything further to add.\n  I do think we have laid out the case for this conference report \nclearly and, I hope, in a compelling way. This has been a difficult \nchallenge--to write a budget in an election year. We know the Congress \nhas not adopted a budget in an election year since 2000. It is \nextraordinary, if you think about it. This country, in an election \nyear, has not had a budget since 2000. That cannot be the way we do \nbusiness around here.\n  I am very proud we had a budget last year. I am very proud we are on \nthe brink of getting a budget this year, even though it is an election \nyear. I hope that sets an example for whoever is in charge that getting \na budget does matter.\n  We have to bend our best efforts on both sides to make certain that \nthis country, the greatest nation on Earth, has a budget. That is about \nas basic as it can get.\n  I again thank the Senator from Michigan for her leadership and her \ngreat assistance on the Budget Committee and also on the Agriculture \nCommittee on this very important legislation on which we will be \nseeking to\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\noverride the President's veto. That bill really should not be called a \nfarm bill. It is far more than that. It is a food bill, an energy bill, \na conservation bill, a trade bill, although inadvertently the enrolling \nclerk over in the House dropped off the trade title. So that will \ncreate a bit of a challenge for us as well.\n  I thank very much the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ndata on pay-go.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    GOP CLAIMS ON PAYGO FULL OF HOLES\n                    Alleged ``Real PAYGO Violations''\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Claim        Fact\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImmigration Reform............................   $30.3 B               0\n    --Never passed Senate.....................\n    --Fully paid for on unified basis.........\nEnergy Bill...................................     4.2 B          -$52 M\n    --Final bill sent to President more than\n     paid for.................................\n    --Passed Senate 86-8......................\nMental Health Parity..........................     2.8 B               0\n    --In conference--final bill will be fully\n     paid for.................................\n    --Passed Senate by unanimous consent......\nPrescription Drug User Fee Amendments.........     0.2 B            -4 M\n    --Final bill sent to President more than\n     paid for.................................\n    --Passed Senate by unanimous consent......\nMinimum Wage Increase.........................      50 M               0\n    --Fully paid for on unified basis.........\nWater Resources Development Act...............       4 M            -5 M\n    --Final bill sent to President more than\n     paid for.................................\n    --Passed Senate 81-12.....................\n                                               -------------------------\n        TOTAL.................................     $38 B            61 M\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: SBC GOP ``Swiss-Chesse-Go'' chart, SBC Majority staff.\nNote: Minimum wage increase in 2007 supplemental was fully paid for on\n  unified basis, but had small net on-budget cost.\n\n\n                Alleged ``Gimmicks to Get Around PAYGO''\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Claim        Fact\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSCHIP Reauthorization.........................     $45 B         -$207 M\n    --More than paid for over 6 and 11 years..\n    --5-year reauthorization--Congress will\n     reauthorize in 2012 with new policies and\n     offsets..................................\nFarm Bill.....................................    27.5 B          -102 M\n    --More than paid for over 6 and 11 years..\n    --5-year reauthorization--Congress will\n     reauthorize in 2012 with new policies and\n     offsets..................................\nHigher Ed Reconciliation Bill.................      26 B    -752 M/5 yrs\n    --More than paid for over 6 and 11 years..  ........    3.6 B/10 yrs\n    --Savings will continue to grow in decades\n     beyond budget window.....................\n2007 Supplemental--County Payments/PILT/MILC..     6.5 B               0\n    --PAYGO rule applies to mandatory spending\n     and revenues only--not to appropriations.\n    --Discretionary spending controlled by\n     separate caps............................\n    --2008 budget resolution established new\n     60-vote point of order to limit changes\n     in mandatory spending on appropriations\n     bills and strengthen PAYGO even further..\n                                               -------------------------\n        TOTAL.................................     105 B          -3.9 B\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: SBC GOP ``Swiss-Cheese-Go'' chart, SBC Majority Staff.\nNote: Per section 201 of 2008 budget resolution, net savings enacted\n  pursuant to reconciliation are not included on PAYGO ledger. They are\n  reserved solely for deficit reduction.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this budget resolution conference report \nallows Congress to take action on many of America's priorities.\n  This conference report starts by providing for many priorities \nthrough the revenue side of the budget.\n  This agreement includes monies to pay for extending expired and \nexpiring revenue provisions.\n  These provisions include the teacher expense deduction, which helps \nteachers who buy school supplies.\n  These provisions include school construction bonds, to help repair \nour country's deteriorating school infrastructure.\n  And these provisions include help to businesses to stay competitive. \nIn particular, the budget assumes extending the research and \ndevelopment credit, which gives businesses an incentive to increase \nresearch. This will keep America as a top innovator in science and \ntechnology.\n  This conference agreement on the budget resolution also includes \nmonies to provide for education tax reform. So far this year, the \nFinance Committee has held two tax reform hearings. One of the major \nthemes of the testimony has been simplification.\n  Witnesses almost always cite education tax incentives as an example \nof needless complexity. This conference report would allow us to help \nmake education more accessible and affordable by making the education \nincentives easier to use.\n  The agreement also includes my amendment that was successfully added \nto the budget resolution on the Senate floor.\n  My amendment took the surpluses in the budget resolution and gave \nthem back to the hard-working American families who earned them.\n  My amendment provided for some important priorities so that the \nbusiness of America's families can be taken care of.\n  First, my amendment provided for permanence of the 10-percent tax \nbracket. That is an across-the-board tax cut for every taxpayer.\n  Second, my amendment provided for making permanent the changes to the \nchild tax credit. That is a $1,000 tax credit per child. This tax \ncredit recognizes that a family's ability to pay taxes decreases as the \nfamily size increases. Unless we act, the child tax credit will fall to \n$500 per child in 2010.\n  Third, my amendment provided for making permanent marriage penalty \nrelief. This relief makes sure that a married couple filing a joint \nreturn has the same deductions and tax brackets as they would if they \nfiled separately as individuals.\n  Fourth, my amendment provided for making permanent the increased \ndependent care credit and changes to the adoption credit.\n  Fifth, my amendment provided for tax provisions to help military \nfamilies. And I am pleased to say that these are very close to being \nadopted by the Congress. This shows that Congress values the sacrifices \nthat our men and women in uniform make for us every day.\n  Nearly 1\\1/2\\ million American service men and women have served in \nIraq, Afghanistan, or both. Nearly 30,000 troops have been wounded in \naction.\n  Congress is about to show our support for our service men and women \nby making the Tax Code a little more troop-friendly.\n  We will extend the special tax rules that make sense for our military \nthat expire in 2007 and 2008.\n  We can eliminate roadblocks in the current tax laws that present \ndifficulties to veterans and servicemembers.\n  One of these roadblocks is how the Tax Code treats survivors of our \nfallen heroes. The families of soldiers killed in the line of duty \nreceive a death gratuity benefit of $100,000.\n  The Tax Code restricts the survivors from putting this benefit into a \nRoth IRA. We are about to make sure that the family members of fallen \nsoldiers can take advantage of these tax-favored accounts.\n  Another roadblock in the tax laws impedes our disabled veterans. I am \ntalking about the time limit for filing for a tax refund. Most VA \ndisability claims filed by veterans are quickly resolved. But many \ndisability awards are delayed due to lost paperwork or the appeals of \nrejected claims.\n  Once a disabled vet finally gets a favorable award, the good news is \nthat the disability award is tax-free. The bad news is that many of \nthese disabled veterans get ambushed by a statute that bars them from \nfiling a tax refund claim. We are about to give disabled veterans an \nextra year to claim their tax refunds.\n  Most troops doing the heavy lifting in combat situations are the \nlower ranking, lower income soldiers. Their income needs to count \ntowards computing the earned-income tax credit, or EITC. Under current \nlaw, however, income earned by a soldier in a combat zone is exempt \nfrom income tax. This actually hurts low-income military personnel \nunder the EITC.\n  The EITC combat-pay exception allows combat zone pay to count as \nearned income for purposes of determining the credit. That way, more \nsoldiers qualify for the EITC. But this EITC combat-pay exception \nexpires at the end of 2007.\n  We are about to make this provision permanent.\n  The budget resolution conference report also provides for some \ncertainty to American families on the estate tax.\n  Lowering the estate tax to 2009 levels is the least that we can do as \nestate tax reform.\n  I am pleased that the conference report recommends appropriations of \n$240 million more than the President requested for the administrative \ncosts for the Social Security Administration for fiscal year 2009.\n  These funds are badly needed to reduce the enormous waiting times \nthat many applicants for Social Security disability benefits must wait \nbefore their claims are finally approved. Funds are also badly needed \nto improve the low levels of service to the public in SSA's local field \noffices.\n  I am pleased to see that the resolution captures Democratic health \ncare priorities and provides economic relief\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\nfor families. It provides funding for maternal and child health; \nnutrition assistance for women, infants, and children or WIC; and the \nSocial Services block grant. And the resolution accommodates \nlegislation to modernize the unemployment insurance program.\n  The resolution retains the reserve funds passed in the Senate to \nreauthorize CHIP and expand coverage to eligible but unenrolled kids. \nThis is a personal priority for me.\n  The budget also works to protect seniors from unscrupulous marketing \nof Medicare drug plans, thereby laying the groundwork for a strong \nMedicare bill currently under negotiation.\n  The resolution also provides for important improvements to Medicare, \nsuch as promoting the use of Health IT.\n  And it would set up a ``comparative effectiveness'' reserve fund to \nhelp us learn what treatments work best and most efficiently to keep \nAmericans healthy. I am working with Chairman Conrad to introduce \nlegislation on this topic this year.\n  All of these investments take steps toward addressing the underlying \ngrowth in health care costs.\n  The resolution is also tough on government waste, fraud, and abuse \nand includes important program integrity initiatives to crack down on \nwasteful or fraudulent spending in the Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Unemployment Insurance Programs.\n  This budget resolution also accounts for important international \ntrade priorities under the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. The \nresolution establishes a reserve fund for trade adjustment assistance \nand a separate reserve fund for other trade initiatives. These reserve \nfunds will allow the Finance Committee to realize legislation to \nreauthorize trade adjustment assistance, as well as pursue legislation \nto extend trade preferences, reauthorize customs functions, and \nimplement bilateral trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, I am thus pleased that this budget resolution \nconference report allows Congress to take action on these important \npriorities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to implement \nthe improvements contemplated in the resolution. And I urge my \ncolleagues to support the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The distinguished majority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am sorry to interrupt my friend from \nNorth Dakota, but we are not going to have any more votes tonight. We \nexpect votes early in the morning, as early as 9:30. They will go on \nthroughout the day. So everyone should be aware we are not going to \nhave a vote tonight on the budget or the farm bill, but we will do the \nbudget the first vote tomorrow, and after that we will move to the farm \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the leader. I was thinking about \nthis the other night. We don't thank the leader enough. We are blessed \non our side with a leader whom I think every Member on our side has \nhigh confidence in because of his good judgment, his fairness, his \nbalance, his willingness to listen and then decide. Even though he may \nnot always agree with any one of us on a particular issue, he always \nlistens, and he does it with respect, and then he decides. He makes a \ndecision. I thank him for it. I know the role of leader is absolutely \nthe toughest job in this town. It is an extremely difficult, demanding \njob, and our leader does an outstanding job of it. That is why he \nenjoys the confidence of our colleagues and the affection of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I may thank the Senator from North \nDakota but also say there isn't anything that I agree to out here that \ndoesn't have the full consent of the Republican leader. So even though \nSenator McConnell and I in public kick and bite and scratch and all \nthose things, I have the ability to work with him on issues, which \nmakes it possible for us to get business done outside the press and a \nlot of times Senators.\n  I really appreciate my friend from North Dakota. He and I came to the \nSenate together. I can remember the first time I saw Kent Conrad. It \nwas in the LBJ Room. It wasn't named the LBJ Room at the time. We were \nthere for the purpose of indoctrination--I don't know the right word--\nbut we were nominees of our parties. We were running for the Senate in \n1986. Neither one of us was expected to get elected. We were both long \nshots. He was running against an incumbent Senator. I was running \nagainst President Reagan and Paul Laxalt. But we surprised them; we \nwon.\n  We have such a warm relationship. I love Lucy, his wife. When we \nfirst came here, a lot of people mixed up Landra and Lucy because they \nare both short, somewhat dark complected, but we don't mix them up.\n  I say to the people watching C-SPAN, the only Senators in this \nChamber are Senator Conrad, Senator Reid, and Senator Stabenow. Senator \nStabenow has indicated in a meeting we just completed that she said the \nright thing at the right time to help us get to where we are today.\n  I am embarrassed with the kind words of my friend from North Dakota, \nbut I thank him very much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the leader.\n  Madam President, I wish to indicate to the Chair that we have one \nother Member on our side who is going to come to the Chamber to talk. \nSenator Whitehouse is going to come. I think he will only be seeking \nabout 15 minutes, I say to the Chair. He will be here in 10 minutes. He \nwill seek only about 15 minutes. I mentioned this to Senator Gregg. So \nafter Senator Whitehouse, other than Senator Dodd, who might still come \nfor 6 or 7 minutes, that will complete speakers on our side. Senator \nGregg told me he does not believe he has any further speakers on his \nside.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4609-S4610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, as we conclude the discussion on the \nbudget, in which the Presiding Officer participated so eloquently just \na few moments ago, I wanted to come to the floor because there is a \nsignificant feature in America's fiscal picture that affects this \nbudget considerably but has not really gotten the attention it \ndeserves; that is, the debt of the United States of America that has \nbeen run up by President George W. Bush. It is a frightening legacy, \nreally, because of the weight, the fiscal burden of it that will weigh \non our children and our grandchildren.\n  If I may, we calculated the Bush Debt at $7.7 trillion, and we did it \nthis way. We took the projections for the U.S. budget on the day George \nBush took office, which, as the Presiding Officer may recall, projected \nthat we actually would have no debt left at all in our country by as \nearly as fiscal year 2009--and, indeed, there was economic debate among \nAmerica's leading economists wondering if it is really good for our \ncountry for America to be completely debt free. What is the ideal level \nof debt? Should we maintain some level of debt? Are there potential \nproblems if the United States were to be completely debt free? That was \nthe discussion. That was what America was looking forward to.\n  The nonpartisan, professional Congressional Budget Office had a \nprojection on where that budget was going to go on the day George W. \nBush took office, and that is the top line of our projection. We call \nit the Clinton budget landscape because it resulted from the economic \npolicies of the Clinton administration which left this country in such \ngood health for President George W. Bush. That was what could have \nbeen. The other line is what he did, what this country has done to \nitself fiscally under George W. Bush. When you compare the difference \nbetween the upper line, where the country was going, and where George \nBush took us, the difference is the Bush Debt, and it amounts to $7.7 \ntrillion. To me, that is an almost unimaginable number. So just to kind \nof give an idea of how many zeros that will be, this is what it looks \nlike. That is $7.7 trillion. Even in the great State of Michigan, where \nthe Presiding Officer hails from, that is a\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nbig number. To somebody like me, from Rhode Island, it is almost \nunimaginable. So I asked my staff to give me some means of comparing, \nsome way of thinking about how big that number is.\n  This is a penny. And I asked my staff: If a penny was $1 billion and \nyou put a stack of pennies on my desk here, how high would that stack \nof $1 billion pennies go to make $7.7 trillion? Well, they found out \nthat the stack of $1 billion pennies would have to go 39 feet high to \namount to $7.7 trillion. I don't think the television camera can take \nthis in, but from here to the very top of this room is about 39 feet of \n$1 billion pennies. That is the enormous burden on our country from the \nimprovident, wasteful, feckless policies of the Bush administration.\n  I have a credit card. The distinguished Senator from Michigan has a \ncredit card. If we borrow money on our credit cards, we have to pay \ninterest. American families across the country work to pay interest on \nmortgages, on credit cards, and on loans of various kinds. Well, guess \nwhat. We have to pay a lot of interest on a debt such as we have. And \nin the recent budget, as the Presiding Officer will recall, that we \njust passed in the Budget Committee and that we are discussing on the \nfloor, there is $260 billion in interest, much of it paid to foreign \ncountries, on our national debt--$7.7 trillion of it run up by one \nadministration, the administration of George W. Bush.\n  Now, that $260 billion is another pretty big number. So I asked: What \ncould we do with $260 billion if we didn't have to give it to the \nSaudis and the Chinese and the Mexicans and everybody else we have \nborrowed money from to fund George Bush's $7.7 trillion debt? Well, \nhere is what we could do: For starters, we could pay for health \ninsurance for everyone. We would have universal health care in this \ncountry. And you know what, there would be money left over. With the \nmoney that was left over, you could also add a million children--a \nmillion children--to Head Start Programs. Universal health care for \neveryone, a million extra children getting Head Start, and still there \nwould be money left over. You could double every Pell grant, which \nhelps kids in America pay for college and reach out and seize their \nfutures. Universal health care, a million extra kids in Head Start, and \ndoubling every Pell Grant. And there would still be money left over. \nWith that last bit of money left over, you could repair or replace 95 \npercent of the bridges that currently need repair and reconstruction in \nAmerica--not 100 percent, only 95 percent. You would have to wait until \nnext year to do that last 5 percent.\n  That is what the cost to us is of an administration and a Republican \nCongress that ran up $7.7 trillion in debt.\n  So I appreciate very much the ranking member who spoke eloquently \nlast week about the problem of that last $9.6 billion in discretionary \nspending we authorized in the Senate-passed budget above the $1 \ntrillion mark. We wouldn't need to worry about that $9.6 billion if his \ncolleagues and President Bush hadn't run up $7.7 trillion in debt for \nAmericans to have to pay in the future because this administration, \nfrankly, was too cowardly to pay its own way and has borrowed from \nfuture generations to pay for the war in Iraq and to pay for tax cuts \nfor the richest Americans. In a country where the difference between \nthe wealthy and the poor, between the CEOs and the workers is growing \ndramatically, is straining the very fabric of our society, instead of \nbringing us together, what was the President's solution? Lots more tax \ncuts for the very richest people, who are doing the absolute best \nalready, the ones who have nothing to worry about except whether they \ntake the Lincoln or they take the Benz. They are the ones who need the \ntax cuts in this country? I don't think so. But the President did, and \nhe didn't even have the guts to pay for it or find the cuts. He \nborrowed the money. That is why we are at $7.7 trillion.\n  So I think it is fascinating that we are having this budget \ndiscussion. I want to salute our chairman, Senator Conrad, who is \nabsolutely brilliant with the budget. He works so well with people in \nthis body and has such enormous credibility that he is able to work \nthrough issues in a very special way--in large part because of his \npersonal character and his credibility. We all benefit from his being \nable to do that.\n\n  But he has had to work very hard to try to bring this budget into \nbalance, 3 or 4 years out from now. It is not easy work, putting this \nbudget together.\n  When people come to the floor and criticize his efforts and try to \nknock $9.6 billion off and worry that this might not be fiscally \nprudent, it is astonishing when those remarks come from the people who \naided and abetted George Bush in running up $7.7 trillion in money that \nwe owe now to the rest of the world, that we will have to pay off \nindefinitely, that will be a weight and a burden on the shoulders of \nthis country for decades if not generations.\n  I actually think we need to do something about the $7.7 trillion Bush \nDebt. I recommended that we have a formal commission of some kind, an \nauthority whose job it is to take the best and the brightest people who \nunderstand our economy and figure out how we pay down $7.7 trillion. It \nis really a disaster.\n  Some of us have served in State government before we came here. Some \nof us have served in municipal government. If there is a crisis at the \nState government level--an economic crisis--if a municipality has a \nterrible fire in a facility and has to rebuild, you take that problem \nand you set it aside and you create a revenue stream and you deal with \nit. You don't try to force it through the regular operating budget of \nthe State or of the municipality.\n  We may be at the stage where the Bush Debt of $7.7 trillion is so \nserious for us fiscally that we should start thinking about getting \ntogether a group of the most learned economists, the people who care \nthe most about America's future, who see the hazard to our welfare, to \nour national security that this kind of debt creates, and can think \ncreatively about how we can set up special revenue streams to pay it \ndown and begin to bring our country back in balance.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair in listening to these remarks. \nI did think as we closed out the budget debate it was important to \nremind everybody that, for all the big talk the Bush administration may \nmake about fiscal prudence and about being responsible, it is the most \nfiscally imprudent and the most irresponsible administration in our \nhistory. Indeed, President Bush alone has borrowed more money from \nforeign countries than all 42 Presidents who preceded him--not any one \nof them, all of them. If we add up everything they borrowed through the \nentire history of the Republic, in just one Presidency he has them \nbeat.\n  It takes a little brass to be able to come and argue for fiscal \nprudence and responsibility and not mention that President Bush and the \nRepublican Congress ran up $7.7 trillion in debt. I thought we should \nthink about it and reflect on that as this debate concludes.\n  I appreciate working with the very distinguished Senator from \nMichigan. Her work on the Budget Committee is very valuable. She is a \nwonderful colleague to me, and I appreciate the indulgence this \nevening.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, both the international community and \nexperts from across our country have come to a definite consensus. \nClimate change is not a theory. It is a reality. We may not like it, \nbut we have to confront it. Rising temperatures, melting icecaps, and \nextreme weather show the increasing effects of global warming in the \nUnited States and especially around the globe. Without action, we will \nbe unable to avoid dangerous consequences for our children, \ngrandchildren, and subsequent generations. We risk the health of our \ncitizens, the\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\nwell-being of our coastal areas, the productivity of our farms, \nforests, and fisheries.\n  There is solid support in this institution and around the country for \na mandatory cap-and-trade approach to reducing carbon emissions. All \nthree Presidential candidates--Senators Obama, Clinton, and McCain--and \nboth political parties have agreed on this philosophy. The Senate \npassed the Lieberman-Warner bill out of committee in December. It is \nlikely to reach the floor of the Senate in the next few weeks. I am not \nsaying a climate change bill will pass this year. I am saying a climate \nchange bill will pass. No more burying our heads in the sand, no more \nignoring the issue and putting it off for another day. It is not a \nquestion of whether; it is a question of when and a question of what it \nwill look like.\n  As a manufacturing State reliant on coal--not too different from the \nState of the Presiding Officer--Ohio is going to be significantly \naffected by the climate change bill regardless of its specifics. I am \nworking with Senators from other industrial States--Senators Casey, \nBayh, Lugar, Durbin, Stabenow, Levin, and others--to ensure that the \neffects on manufacturing jobs are considered as this legislation is \ndrafted. We can't shut our eyes or turn our backs or hope that global \nwarming goes away and becomes someone else's problem. That is not going \nto happen. But we can maximize Ohio's gains, Pennsylvania's gains, the \ngains of other States, and minimize those losses, looking first at the \nopportunities presented to us by global change legislation.\n  The mandatory cap-and-trade approach to climate change will create a \nmarket for clean energy and green jobs. By creating markets for clean \nenergy, we can stabilize our Nation's energy supply, reduce greenhouse \ngases, and bolster manufacturing in Lima, Zaynesville, Toledo, and \nAshtabula. It has been estimated that in terms of a global market, the \nadvanced and alternative energy sector will double several times over \nin the next decade, from a $55 billion industry to a $226 billion \nbusiness. Wind power alone, it is estimated, will grow from $18 billion \nto a $61 billion market. In the last 15 months, I have conducted \nroundtables in Ohio, bringing together 15 or 20 people to talk about \nproblems, about their communities. You can see what is happening in a \nState such as mine.\n  The Cleveland Foundation, in conjunction with Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, is going to build a field of wind turbines in Lake Erie, \nthe first time wind turbines have ever been placed in a freshwater \nlake.\n  I have seen the Composite Center in Dayton which makes new, lighter, \nstronger materials, initially for airplanes, now for fuel-efficient \nautomobiles and wind turbines. The University of Toledo is doing some \nof the best wind turbine research in the United States. In Columbus and \nOhio State, there is the Center for Automotive Research, the work they \nare doing for more fuel-efficient automobiles. Today I talked with \nsomeone who was visiting Washington from Battelle Institute. They are \ndoing astonishing things on a whole range of issues; Stark State and \nRolls-Royce on fuel cells. Oberlin College has built the largest \nbuilding of any college campus in the country fully powered by solar \nenergy. The problem is those solar cells and panels are not made in \nthis country because we don't make them. They were bought from Germany \nand Japan.\n  At the same time, we are seeing the largest solar company in the \ncountry producing near Toledo in Perrysburg. In Ashtabula, right across \nthe border from Erie, we are seeing components for wind turbines. In \nplace after place, Ohio is helping to lead the way to make my State the \nSilicon Valley of renewable energy.\n  Ohio has the potential to create 20,000 new jobs through renewable \nenergy projects. That puts Ohio second only to California in terms of \npotential job creation. But we have a lot of work to do. Any climate \nchange legislation must invest in the deployment of renewable energy \ntechnology and promote green job growth. That is why I introduced \nlegislation called the Green Energy Production Act last month. It is an \nenergy bill, an environment bill, and a jobs bill. The bill creates a \ngovernment corporation that will set up loan programs and grant \nprograms for green energy manufacturers, mostly small businesses, to \nget them to develop products and get them to market.\n  Over 5 years, the bill would invest $36 billion with no political \nstrings attached, no Government picking winners and losers but \ncompanies that need capital that are just taking off, small businesses, \nbusinesses that need to grow, businesses that need to expand. Some $36 \nbillion will be invested in green energy manufacturing. We have great \nR in my State, but the big problem is commercialization, the key to \ncreating jobs in my State.\n  Speaking of jobs, we can't overlook the tremendous challenges the \nindustrial Midwest will face under climate change legislation. My State \nis the seventh largest in the country by population. We are the fourth \nlargest carbon-emitting State, behind California, Texas, and New York. \nIn the past year and a half, I have held roundtables all over my State \nin some 60 of the 88 counties. They have given me an opportunity to be \nwith workers and business people and civic leaders and local government \nofficials.\n  One thing is crystal clear: Ohioans are anxious about their \ncommunities' futures, and the statistics match their anxiety. More than \n40,000 manufacturing plants have shut down in the United States since \n2001. More than 3.3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost, about \none-sixth of all U.S. manufacturing jobs. My State has lost more than \n200,000 jobs. Pennsylvania is comparable. The simple fact is, our \neconomy cannot prosper unless we manufacture and sell goods as a State \nand a nation. Manufacturing is too important to the prosperity of this \ncountry and to our economic and national security. Manufacturing is too \nimportant to ignore, as this Government has done in the last few years.\n  I know, given a level playing field, our companies can outcompete any \naround the globe. Any climate change legislation must be developed in \nconjunction with manufacturers to ensure U.S. competitiveness with \nother growing industrial giants in the world, particularly China and \nIndia. We must work together to ensure that domestic manufacturers are \nprotected from imports that come from countries without comparable \nclimate change legislation. That means working together to provide \nappropriate transition assistance to our energy intensive industries. \nMy State, in some sense, specializes in energy-intensive industries--\nsteel, chemicals, glass, cement, aluminum. We must work together to \nminimize any economic harm while ensuring the environmental integrity \nof the climate change legislation.\n  The bill that came out of committee needs to do a better job. It has \nmade progress from the original bill to the substitute bill brought \nforward by Senator Boxer. It has made major progress, but it has to do \na better job of addressing the need, particularly in people's own \npersonal electric bills and the cost of energy to manufacturers. The \nbill needs to help low- and middle-income consumers who will face \nhigher energy costs and must help communities and workers who are \ndisplaced due to a shift from coal power. It means providing support \nnecessary to create green jobs in Ohio and across the Midwest, and it \nmeans helping those energy-intensive manufacturers I was talking about \nwith their energy costs and with unregulated international competition. \nSome environmental groups quote economic models saying that business \nunder a cap-and-trade program will be all wine and roses. They are on \none side. Some business groups are touting economic models that predict \nclimate change legislation will send us all back to living in caves. \nBoth sides are wrong. It is not going to be that easy, but it is also \nnot going to put American business out of business.\n\n  One last point. When you talk to people about climate change, one of \nthe first questions that always comes up is what do we do about China \nand India. If they are not going to, why should we, in some sense, \nunilaterally disarm as a country, putting more and more costs on Ohio \nbusinesses in Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati? Why should we \nput more cost on these businesses, when China and India are not doing \nthat? We have three possibilities. One is do nothing. That is \nunacceptable. We have two other possibilities:\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nTo work with countries around the world on bringing them to a level of \nclimate change comparable to the level we want to get to; one is \nmultilateral environment and climate change agreements, negotiations, \nKyoto-type agreements among all the major industrial powers in the \nworld. That will take years. That will perhaps only be as successful as \nKyoto, which wasn't very successful, ultimately.\n  The other path to walk down is what we do about trade legislation, \nabout accepting those products coming into the United States from other \ncountries. When we have pretty strong environmental laws, you know in \nyour State what has happened with the steel industry, where they have \nput huge numbers of dollars into scrubbers and other kinds of \nenvironmental cleanup. China and India, frankly, don't do that. When we \nbuy products from China and India, we buy steel from them, discounting \nthe issue of toxic toys and contaminants in vitamins and all the unsafe \nproducts they send us that are ultimately consumer products, but when \nwe buy steel from China and India, that steel is made by cheaper labor, \nand it is also made with very weak environmental rules.\n  The only way to change that, to get China and India to the table, if \nyou will, if we will not do the negotiations that will be so difficult \nand tedious and take so long, is to say, every time we import steel \nfrom China and India, steel where there is an environmental cost in its \nproduction, we charge a tariff at the border, a tariff reflecting the \ncost that they have not borne but that our manufacturers bear on the \nproduction of that steel. So why should a steel company in Lorain or a \nfoundry in Mahoning Valley have to pay these huge additional costs \nunder climate change to deal with their carbon emissions, when people \nin China and India don't? The only way to equalize that and to make \nthis competitive and keep American business competitive is to figure \nout what it actually costs China and what moneys China and India save \nby not coming up to the same level of environmental protection that we \ndo.\n  That should always have been part of the trade debate. The Bush \nadministration has never believed that. That is one of the reasons we \nhave lost so many manufacturing jobs in my State, since President Bush \ntook office--bad trade policy, bad environmental policy, bad labor \npolicy.\n  Ultimately, this climate change issue is going to be about equalizing \nthe cost of making air cleaner, limiting carbon emissions, dealing with \nall the issues around CO2. The way to do that is through a \ntrade policy that works for us, for China, for India, and especially \nworks for our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and those subsequent \ngenerations. We must work together in this institution to shape \nlegislation that truly addresses global climate change while protecting \nour manufacturing jobs. That means working assiduously with countries \naround the world in reaching those goals.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address some of the \ncritical issues this body faces at this point in history, and to \nreflect on why these challenges are surmountable if we focus on working \ntogether to forge ahead.\n  These are clearly not easy times. We are engaged in a global battle \nfor the future of freedom. We are up against radical Islamic extremists \nwho will do anything they can to annihilate those who do not live and \nbelieve their way.\n  At home, we face some daunting questions when it comes to expanding \nopportunity for all Americans. So do we follow a proven path of tax \nrelief? Can we change the way we educate our children to prepare them \nfor global competition in the 21st century? How do we provide quality \nhealth care that is accessible and affordable for all of our families? \nHow do we secure our borders and strengthen legal immigration? Can we \ncome together to make difficult decisions about the future of \nentitlements before they bankrupt this country?\n  Today, we face the task of funding the global war against Islamic \nextremists, providing our troops with the resources they need and \nprioritizing funding so we do not incur unnecessary debt.\n  Yes, these are tough questions, with serious consequences. But more \nthan two centuries ago, a group of patriots convened to write our \nConstitution, and they provided the framework for the Government in \nwhich we have the honor to serve today.\n  They faced questions we take for granted centuries later but which \ncould only have been resolved by incredible vision and the grace of \nGod.\n  As Delegate James Wilson stated:\n\n     . . . we are providing a Constitution for future generations \n     and not merely for the circumstances of the moment.\n\n  How votes would be apportioned in the Congress was one of the first \nand most difficult questions this convention tackled. The smaller \nStates wanted an equal vote, and the larger States, obviously, \npreferred a proportional vote. Some argued that the vote in the lower \nHouse should be based on taxes paid. There were threats of breaking up \nStates to make them smaller and more manageable to govern. Decisions \nhad to be made regarding the terms of Members of Congress. How would \nthey be paid? What powers would be granted to the Government?\n  Remember, this was a country that had fought its way out from under \nthe control of a powerful monarchy. The Framers of the Constitution \nwere incredibly aware of that fact.\n  The Great Compromise was the measure that gave every State two \nSenators. But would foreigners be permitted to serve in the Congress? \nWhere would the seat of Government be? Would officers of the Government \nbe required to swear an oath to support the Constitution? Who would \nratify the Constitution--the States or the people?\n  To think today about the number of decisions and compromises that \nwere made over the course of a summer is humbling. The North Carolina \ndelegates wrote to their Governor:\n\n       A very large Field presents to our view without a single \n     Straight or eligible Road that has been trodden by the feet \n     of Nations.\n\n  Yet great thought, debate, and deliberation went into every single \ndecision. Issues were often revisited time and again before a consensus \nwas painstakingly reached.\n  The Constitution was by no means thrown together quickly or \nhaphazardly. Once decisions were ultimately made about the branches of \nGovernment and their powers, a document needed to be artfully drafted \nto steer the United States in 1787 as well as for generations to come. \nThe product was nothing short of miraculous. Yet the Constitution was \nstill not a done deal.\n  The Constitution and its revolutionary ideas had many supporters, but \nit also faced fierce opposition. It was described as ``a most \nridiculous piece of business'' by some. Those who stood against the \nConstitution honed in on people's fears. After all, this was a \ncompletely experimental government with no proven model to follow. As \ndelegate Davie of North Carolina declared: ``It is much easier to alarm \npeople than to inform them.''\n  Fortunately for this Nation the constitutionalists prevailed. To \nstudy the transformation of a blank slate of hopes and aspirations to a \nfunctioning Constitution that would guide a democracy for more than 200 \nyears is awesome. There are several valuable lessons that I wish to \nshare with my colleagues.\n  It is difficult to pass legislation today with a closely divided \nSenate. It was painfully difficult to make decisions about forming a \nnew government and then determine and agree on what should be included \nin our Constitution. To make progress even more frustrating, a subject \nalready voted on could be reconsidered again the next day and voted on \nagain.\n  But these men did not let the process interfere with their progress. \nTheir experience and their reasonableness\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nshined during the most difficult days. They understood if they were \nserious about creating this Constitution, they would have to work \ntogether and consider and respect each other's differences.\n  In the end, the Constitution was the work of those for it and those \nagainst it. They came to many compromises in order to make the final \nproduct that all could live with. John Adams described the Constitution \nas:\n\n       If not the greatest exertion of human understanding, the \n     greatest single effort of national deliberation that the \n     world has ever seen.\n\n  Although I serve as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial \nCommittee, I have always prided myself on reaching across the aisle to \nwork for the common good. For example, my home State of Nevada has \ngreatly benefited from the work Senator Reid and I have done together \non several public lands bills. He brings certain people to the table \nwho trust him; I bring others to the table who trust me. We encourage a \ndialogue that has resulted in crucial legislation for our State. I \nimagine this is the kind of give and take that made the Constitution \npossible.\n  Another important lesson from the Constitutional Convention was the \nunderstanding of the implications that our leaders' words have around \nthe world. There were people who were completely opposed to the \nConstitution, but they knew how damaging their opinions could be, \nespecially if those opinions were made overseas.\n  Benjamin Franklin stated:\n\n       The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrificed to the \n     public good. I have never whispered a syllable of them \n     abroad. Within these walls they were born and here they shall \n     die.\n\n  I think this is a critical flaw that is too often made in this body \ntoday. Our words have consequences. Today, it is much more difficult to \ncontain what we say. Technology ensures that our enemies have access to \nthe same television shows, Internet sites, and newspapers that our \ncitizens have today. It is naive to think that a debate on the floor \nabout retreating from Iraq has no impact on those plotting against us. \nIt absolutely feeds into their strategy and their hope for our failure \nand our demise. We should all remember Benjamin Franklin's approach of \nworking to contain our opinions that may be harmful to our Nation.\n  Finally, there comes a time after a contentious issue when we must \ncome together and move forward. Abraham White, a fierce opponent to the \nConstitution, gave his word that he would work to convince his \nconstituents to submit to the new law of the land and to live in peace \nunder it.\n  Mr. President, 220 years ago, the States were in the midst of \ndeciding whether they would ratify the Constitution. It was the \npinnacle of a turbulent summer that left many of our delegates amazed \nat what they had actually achieved. George Washington called it \n``little short of a miracle.'' The entire effort, from the first days \nof the convention to the parades that celebrated the United States and \nits Constitution, was in fact a miracle. Benjamin Rush, a Philadelphia \nphysician who signed the Declaration of Independence, described the \nunparalleled emotion that was shared by all during the Philadelphia \ncelebration of the Fourth of July--even greater than at any wartime \nvictory. His description included the words: ``We have become a \nNation.''\n  It is overwhelming to think about the work that was done hundreds of \nyears ago so that we could continue to live and uphold the tenets of an \nenduring Constitution today. What a remarkable tribute to the delegates \nof the Convention and to the leaders whose vision led to the \nratification of our Constitution.\n  I hope we can keep in mind the many hurdles overcome in 1787 by the \nConstitutional Convention and the men who were gathered there and come \ntogether in drafting a real supplemental that will fund our troops, \ngive our military leaders the tools they need, and show the Nation we \nare united and that we are committed together in this global war \nagainst radical Islamic extremists. We have a tremendous legacy on \nwhich to continue building. Let's commit to doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4613-S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MERIDA INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2008 supplemental \nappropriations bill provides $450 million for the Merida Initiative, \nincluding $350 million for Mexico and $100 million for Central America, \nHaiti, and the Dominican Republic. This is the first installment of an \nongoing commitment to help our neighbors to the south respond to the \ngrowing violence and corruption of heavily armed drug cartels. It \nrepresents a tenfold increase in assistance for Mexico in a single \nyear.\n  The Merida Initiative is a partnership, and we recognize that \nachieving its goals presents an extraordinarily difficult challenge. \nThe United States is the principal market for most of the illegal drugs \ncoming from Mexico and Central America. We are also the source of most \nof the guns used by the Mexican and Central American cartels. Each \ncountry contributes to this problem, and we each have to be part of the \nsolution.\n  President Calderon and President Bush deserve credit for the Merida \nInitiative. Better and more cooperative relations between our countries \nare long overdue.\n  It is unfortunate, however, that neither the Mexican or Central \nAmerican legislatures, nor the U.S. Congress, nor representatives of \ncivil society, had a role in shaping the Merida Initiative. There was \nno refinement through consultation. I first learned of it from the \npress, as did other Members of Congress.\n  As we have come to expect from this administration, the White House \nreached a secret agreement with foreign governments calling for \nhundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars, and then came to \nCongress demanding a blank check.\n  I support the goals of the Merida Initiative, and this bill provides \na very generous downpayment on what I believe will be a far longer \ncommitment than the 3-year initiative proposed by the administration. \nIt will take longer than 1 year just to obligate and expend the $350 \nmillion for Mexico in this supplemental bill, and the President has \nrequested another $477 million for Mexico in fiscal year 2009.\n  In addition to appropriating the funds, most of which may be \nobligated immediately, we require the Secretary of State to determine \nand report that procedures are in place and actions are taken by the \nMexican and Central American governments to ensure that recipients of \nour aid are not involved in corruption or human rights violations, and \nthat members of the military and police forces who commit violations \nare brought to justice.\n  This is fundamental. For years we have trained Mexican and Central \nAmerican police forces, and it is well known that some of them have \nended up working for the drug cartels. It is common knowledge that \ncorruption is rampant within their law enforcement institutions--the \nvery entities we are about to support.\n  It is also beyond dispute that Mexican and Central American military \nand police forces have a long history of human rights violations--\nincluding arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and extra-judicial killings \nfor which they have rarely been held accountable. Examples of army and \npolice officers who have been prosecuted and punished for these heinous \ncrimes are few and far between. Mexican human rights defenders who \ncriticize the military for violating human rights fear for their lives.\n  Some, particularly the Mexican press, argue that conditioning our aid \non adherence to the rule of law is somehow an ``infringement of \nsovereignty,'' ``subjugation'' or ``meddling,'' or that it ``sends the \nwrong message.'' I strongly disagree.\n  Since when is it bad policy, or an infringement of anything, to \ninsist that American taxpayer dollars not be given to corrupt, abusive \npolice or military forces in a country whose justice system has serious \nflaws and rarely punishes official misconduct? This is a partnership, \nnot a giveaway. As one who has criticized my own government for failing \nto uphold U.S. and international law, as has occurred in Guantanamo, \nAbu Ghraib, and elsewhere, I believe it is our duty to insist on \nrespect for fundamental principles of justice. I am confident that the \nMexican and American people agree.\n  Mr. President, like Senators Dodd, Reid, Menendez and many others \nhere, both Democrats and Republicans, I\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nhave long urged closer relations with Mexico. We have much in common, \nyet throughout our history U.S. policy toward Mexico has been far more \none of neglect than of mutual respect and cooperation.\n  Whether it is trade and investment, immigration, the environment, \nhealth, science, cultural and academic exchange, human rights, drug \ntrafficking, weapons smuggling and other cross border crime and \nviolence--our contiguous countries are linked in numerous ways. We \nshould work to deepen and expand our relations.\n  The Merida Initiative is one approach, and while I and many others \nwould prefer that it encompassed broader forms of engagement, it is a \nstart. Most of the funds are for law enforcement hardware and software, \nwhich is necessary but insufficient to support a sustainable strategy. \nAs we have learned from successive costly counterdrug strategies in the \nAndean countries that have failed to effectively reduce the amount of \ncocaine entering the United States, we need to know what the Merida \nInitiative can reasonably expect to achieve, at what cost, over what \nperiod of time.\n  Senator Gregg as ranking member, and I as chairman of the State and \nForeign Operations Subcommittee had to make difficult choices among \nmany competing demands within a limited budget. We had to find \nadditional funds to help disaster victims in Burma, Central Africa, \nBangladesh and elsewhere, whom the President's budget ignored. We had \nto find additional funds for Iraqi refugees and for crucial \npeacekeeping, security, and nonproliferation programs. We could not \nhave funded virtually any program at the level requested by the \nPresident without causing disproportionate harm to others, and we \nsought to avoid that.\n  Considering the amount we had to spend, the Merida Initiative \nreceived strong, bipartisan support. Again, this is not simply a 3 year \nprogram as the administration suggests. It is the beginning of a new \nkind of relationship, and we need to start off prudently and with solid \nfooting.\n  That means the direct participation of the Congress and of civil \nsociety and attention to legitimate concerns about human rights, about \nmonitoring and oversight, about rights of privacy, due process, and \naccountability. How these issues are resolved is critical to future \nfunding for this program, and we need to work together to address them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4614-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On Thursday evening, May 15, 2008, in Sacramento, CA, a 23-year-old \nman was sitting in his car at a gas station when he was approached by \nthree men. According to police, one of the men asked him if he was gay \nand he responded that he was. When the man then exited the car, he was \nattacked by the three men as they yelled homophobic slurs. Micah \nJontomo Tasaki, 21, Gregory Lee Winfield, 20, and Robert Lee Denor, 19, \nwere arrested at the gas staion where the attack occurred in connection \nwith the assault. Luckily for the victim, he did not sustain injuries \nserious enough to necessitate a hospital visit. A Sacramento police \nofficer investigating the crime has called it a ``gay bashing'' and a \nhate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4614-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4614-S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, earlier this spring, I introduced \nlegislation to address the challenge of how to deal with greenhouse \ngases. The bill is called the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Atmospheric \nRemoval Act, or the GEAR Act.\n  Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the \noutput of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it through a cap-and-\ntrade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are \naimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere. Many \nproposals have been introduced and debated using this approach of \ndealing with carbon output.\n  We want to protect our environment and we want a strong economy. The \nway to have both is by thinking anew and acting anew. It is time to use \nour untapped human potential and the American spirit to develop the \ntechnologies we need.\n  The Senate will soon be debating climate legislation. I believe we \nshould identify solutions through imagination, innovation, and \ninvention, not through limits.\n  It is my hope and my goal that the GEAR Act will foster the kind of \nsolutions that we need to address the concerns about climate change.\n  Recently, there was a very thoughtful editorial which was printed in \n``Wyoming Agriculture,'' which is published by the Wyoming Farm Bureau \nFederation.\n  The editorial was written by Ken Hamilton. Ken is the executive vice \npresident of the Wyoming Farm Bureau. I believe he does a terrific job \nof summing up the feelings of Wyoming people on the need to find \npractical ``real'' solutions to climate change.\n  I recommend it to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Ther being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                You Can't Have Your Cake And Eat It Too\n\n            (By Ken Hamilton, WyFB Executive Vice President)\n\n       One of the first little sayings you probably heard when you \n     were growing up was that you can't have your cake and eat it \n     too. Generally everyone will agree that this is self evident, \n     but that doesn't stop Americans (and probably people in other \n     countries) from always trying to have it both ways.\n       This is never more evident than the actions surrounding \n     global warming. We are continually being bombarded by \n     pronouncements about man caused global warming (it's hovering \n     around 4 degrees with a 25 mph breeze blowing as I write \n     this). When I was discussing this global warming issue with a \n     friend, he said what people need to do is stop arguing with \n     the activists over whether there is man caused global warming \n     and start asking them what their solutions are going to be.\n       The more I thought about it the more I realized the whole \n     global warming debate is absent any discussion of real \n     solutions. We hear vague pronouncements about a greenhouse \n     gas tax, but not much else. And none have enough details to \n     fully analyze what the impact will be on people. There are \n     numerous shows on television where people are talking about \n     reducing their ``carbon footprint'', but most of these \n     solutions revolve around still living the lifestyle you want \n     while feeling good about using a material someone has \n     pronounced as ``green.''\n       For instance, one of the new ``green'' materials for \n     flooring in houses now is bamboo. Why someone feels this is \n     greener than oak or pine is beyond me, but nevertheless \n     apparently it is. The interesting thing is that while \n     everyone is talking green, they are busy building a house \n     that's twice the square footage of a generation ago. Our \n     grandparents lived in a house where one or two rooms had heat \n     part of the time. In today's modern homes there is heat \n     running to every room, plus a television set in half of them, \n     a minimum two-car garage (heated of course) and appliances \n     that grandma couldn't even dream about. All of these, of \n     course have some ``green'' marketing gimmick attached to \n     them, so, you guessed it, people can live in even bigger \n     houses while feeling good about doing their part.\n       But if meaningful curbs in greenhouse gases must occur as \n     they profess, then there shouldn't be houses with two-car \n     garages. You don't find those sorts of things in third world \n     countries where the people's carbon footprint is less than \n     here. Dishwashers must go as well as washing machines, \n     dryers, and central heating. In third world countries where \n     they don't have such a big carbon footprint, health clubs are \n     not needed, nor are double ovens.\n       Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is in a panic over global \n     warming, should stop driving around in his Humvee. In fact, \n     to adequately address this issue, he should stop driving \n     period.\n       But we don't see any of this happening and probably won't \n     in the future. The people worried about global warming are \n     still driving to work every day. They come home to heated and \n     air conditioned homes, turn on\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\n     their 42-inch flat panel television while getting their meal \n     delivered by a college freshman in a fuel-efficient \\3/4\\-ton \n     four-wheel drive vehicle so they don't have to crank up one \n     of those double ovens and hear the latest news about climate \n     change. Recently a weather event caused a power outage in \n     Arnold's state and not once did I hear him say, ``thank \n     goodness, now we can start to do something meaningful about \n     man caused global warming.''\n       Politicians and proponents of global warming only want to \n     personally do something about global warming if it doesn't \n     mean a cold house in the winter or a hot one in the summer. \n     Health clubs will still be needed because people won't walk \n     to work and will need to get some exercise somewhere. And \n     pine forests will grow old, die and burn while folks feel \n     good about their bamboo floors. Thinking all along that they \n     are getting their cake and eating it too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4615-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FRANK WOODRUFF BUCKLES\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one of the most distinguished \nAmericans living today is Mr. Frank Woodruff Buckles. Born in Bethany, \nMO, on February 1, 1901, 2 years before Orville and Wilbur Wright made \ntheir historic first flight, Mr. Buckles, now 107, is the last living \nU.S. World War I veteran. He is truly a national treasure: Of the 2 \nmillion soldiers the United States sent to France in World War I, he is \nthe lone survivor.\n  His life story is nothing short of amazing. In 1917, Mr. Buckles told \nhis Army recruiter he was 21 years old and wanted to go to war. He was \nreally just 16. Upon arrival in England, he convinced his superiors to \nsend him forward to France where he would serve as an ambulance driver, \ncarrying wounded allied troops to medical facilities.\n  When the war ended, Mr. Buckles was responsible for returning \nprisoners of war to Germany. He separated from the Army in 1920 after \nachieving the rank of corporal, but his service to the Nation continued \nas a civilian in the Philippines, where he worked for a U.S. shipping \ncompany. When the Japanese took Manila in 1942, Mr. Buckles was made a \nprisoner of war for the next 39 months, until his subsequent rescue by \nthe 11th Airborne Division in 1945.\n  During his captivity, he developed chronic illnesses that still \nafflict him today. But there was no surrender then and there is no \nsurrender today in Mr. Buckles.\n  Mr. Buckles remains witty and active. During a recent interview, he \nwas asked about the circumstances surrounding his questionable \nenlistment into the Army. He replied with a chuckle, ``I didn't lie; \nnobody calls me a liar . . . but I may have increased my age.'' I also \nunderstand he does 50 sit ups and lifts weights daily. That is more \nphysical activity than most men my age and even younger!\n  Today, before Memorial Day, I ask you to join me in honoring Mr. \nBuckles for all he has done for his country. The debt paid by Mr. \nBuckles and his fellow soldiers on behalf of future generations must \nnever be forgotten. His life epitomizes patriotism and dedication to \nour nation. His incredible individual achievements and sacrifices, \nalong with those of his fellow ``doughboys,'' deserve our ongoing \nadmiration and thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4615-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING ELWOOD ``WOODY'' LECHAUSSE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life and \nservice of Elwood Lechausse of Manchester, CT, who died on Saturday May \n17, 2008. Mr. Lechausse, known to many as ``Woody,'' enlisted in the \nU.S. Army in 1958, the day after his 18th birthday, and served with \ndistinction in the 101st Airborne Division in both Turkey and South \nVietnam.\n  Mr. Lechausse's service to his country did not end with his departure \nfrom the military in 1965. Following his honorable discharge from the \nArmy, Mr. Lechausse dedicated himself to supporting his fellow \nveterans. For over 35 years, Mr. Lechausse was a tireless advocate for \nveterans issues, serving in leadership positions in more than two dozen \nveterans organizations, including serving as a senior member of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Board of Trustees and the Secretary and \nTreasurer of the Connecticut Veterans Coalition from 1988-2002 and the \nDepartment of Connecticut Adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans.\n  Mr. Lechausse worked hard to educate his fellow Americans on the \nimportance of honoring our veterans and recognizing the challenges they \nfaced. Whether testifying before the U.S. Congress or speaking in the \nlocal classroom, Mr. Lechausse carried himself with a vigor and passion \nthat spoke volumes of his dedication to advocating on behalf of his \nfellow veterans.\n  In 2003, Mr. Lechausse was named as a Connecticut Treasure for his \nwork on behalf of Connecticut's veterans. In 2007, in recognition of \nthe many lives he touched throughout nearly four decades of service, \nMr. Lechausse was inducted into the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. Lechausse was a valuable friend of my office, and all of us in \nConnecticut owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Lechausse for his \nservice to both his country and his fellow veterans. On behalf of the \nSenate, I offer my most sincere condolences to Mr. Lechausse's wife, \nKathryn, his children James and Ralph, and all those who were touched \nby his tremendous spirit. With Woody's passing, Connecticut and the \nNation's veterans have lost a powerful voice that will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4615-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4615-S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LAUREL ZAKS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate Laurel Zaks, an incredibly dedicated and \nuniversally beloved and respected civil servant who died on Friday, \nMarch 28, 2008. Laurel was a public health adviser at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, with more than 14 years \ninternational and domestic work experience as a nutritionist.\n  Laurel started her career in 1992 as a nutritionist in Bucharest, \nRomania, with the Free Romania Foundation cross-training staff in three \norphanages with medical clinics in health and nutrition issues. She \nthen took a position as a community developer in Pop Wuj, \nQuetzeltenango, Guatemala, teaching primary health prevention \nstrategies. She returned to the United States in 1996 where she \ndeveloped and communicated policy and legislative strategy on domestic \nhunger for Congress and lobbied Congress on nutrition programs \ninvolving welfare reform. While in Washington, she also served as a \npediatric dietitian with the Children's National Medical Center working \non initial and followup nutritional assessments of HIV/AIDS and \ngastrointestinal disease patients.\n  In 1997, Laurel joined the Peace Corps volunteering in Ecuador, where \nshe used her training as a dietitian to work with the Ministry of \nHealth and indigenous organizations to develop training materials \npromoting maternal and child health and prevention of infectious \ndiseases. Next Laurel moved to the city, Santa Domingo de Los \nColorados, to work at the Center for Malnourished Children and in local \ncommunities where she served as the nutritionist/health educator \nworking in an interdisciplinary medical team. During the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears of her Peace Corps service, she was instrumental in helping to \ndesign a new $400,000 Children's Center for Nutrition Recuperation, \nwhich served an average of 40 families daily.\n  Laurel joined CDC in 2001, 1 week after finishing her Peace Corps \ntour in Ecuador. Her enthusiasm for making a difference in global \nhealth affected all who knew her. She worked in many areas of global \nhealth work at CDC, including planning for development of sustainable \nglobal public health management, planning for a global pandemic \ninfluenza outbreak, and serving as a team member traveling to Botswana \nin response to an outbreak of infant diarrhea and severe malnutrition. \nIn 2007, she was part of a team honored for rapidly assisting 20 \ncountries around the world to apply for pandemic influenza preparedness \nfunds.\n  Laurel was an active member and leader in the Atlanta chapter of the \nReturned Peace Corps Volunteers. She gave countless hours to charitable \norganizations domestically and abroad, including the Manna Food Bank in \nNorth Carolina and as a charter member of the Ecuadorian Rivers \nInstitute in Ecuador. She received various awards for her volunteer \nwork and was bestowed the North Carolina Governor's Award for \nOutstanding Volunteer Service in 1994.\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\n  Just as she did with the Peace Corps, Laurel's work over 7 years at \nCDC left a legacy of healthier people around the world. She inspired \nher coworkers to make a difference in global health, and all who knew \nher were struck by her compassion and the lasting contributions she \nmade to children living in poverty around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4616-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HAROLD ``SHORTY'' DORN\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, Albert Einstein once said, ``It is \nthe supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and \nknowledge.'' I wish today to pay tribute to the life and legacy of an \nOregonian who devoted his career to that supreme art and, in doing so, \nmade a priceless contribution to the field of journalism.\n  Harold ``Shorty'' Dorn passed away in Reston, VA, last week at 83 \nyears of age. Like countless others of his ``greatest generation,'' \nShorty proudly wore the uniform of our country during World War II. He \nentered the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943 and served in the Pacific until \nthe end of the war.\n  Upon returning home, Shorty earned his college degree and began \nnearly four decades of service as a college professor. Generations of \nOregonians are fortunate because the vast majority of Shorty's career \nwas spent at two of my State's outstanding institutions of higher \nlearning--10 years at Eastern Oregon University in LaGrande and 23 \nyears in the Department of Journalism at Oregon State University in \nCorvallis.\n  Professor Dorn was admired and respected by his students for his \nintelligence, his integrity, his warm humor, his trademark quips, and \nfor the fact that he genuinely cared about them and their future. \nShorty's commitment to his students did not end upon their graduation, \nand many continued to call on him for advice and counsel as they moved \non in their careers.\n  Just as Shorty was devoted to his students, he was also devoted to \nhis family--to his wife Ethel and to his two daughters, Jenna and \nLorah. Upon retirement from Oregon State University, Shorty and Ethel \nmoved to Reston, VA, so he could be closer to his daughters, who were \nboth building distinguished careers of service. He also discovered that \none of the best parts of retirement was the time he had to be a \nwonderful grandfather to his two grandsons, Jon and Ben.\n  Mr. President, it was once said that, ``In a completely rational \nsociety, the best of us would be teachers and the rest of us would have \nto settle for something less.'' Shorty Dorn was certainly one of the \nbest of us, and I extend my condolences to his family and \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4616-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN HONOR OF THE HEARTLAND HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I honor veterans \nfrom my home State who are taking part in the first Nebraska Heartland \nHonor Flight to visit the National World War II Memorial.\n  The National World War II Memorial is a fitting tribute to those \nremarkable Americans who served in the deadliest conflict in human \nhistory. From the beaches of Normandy to the shores of Iwo Jima, these \nveterans served with courage, honor, and selflessness. In addition to \ntheir service, these same veterans returned home to reinvigorate the \nUnited States, producing what is still the largest and most vibrant \neconomy in the world.\n  Soon after President Clinton authorized the American Battle Monuments \nCommission to establish a World War II memorial, a comprehensive \nnational fundraising campaign began under the leadership of former \nSenator Bob Dole, the national chairman and a World War II veteran from \nKansas. During this time, as Governor of the State of Nebraska, I \nrealized it was imperative to secure funding as soon as possible so \nthat a memorial could be built in time for our veterans to view it. \nTherefore, on June 1, 1998, I presented a check to Senator Bob Dole in \nthe amount of $52,900 for every Nebraskan who served in World War II. \nSubsequently, every State that donated money followed our guideline.\n  There are now close to 14,000 World War II veterans living in the \nState of Nebraska. Unfortunately, nearly 2,100 of these brave \nservicemembers pass away each year. Many of these veterans have not \nbeen able to visit the memorial, which was dedicated by President \nGeorge W. Bush on May 29, 2004, as they confront increasing \ndifficulties with traveling due to their age. However, the Honor Flight \nProgram has proven to be a reliable and capable partner in helping \nalleviate any obstacles veterans may face in traveling to Washington, \nDC. The Honor Flight Program, started in 2005 by retired Air Force \ncaptain and physician's assistant Earl Morse, now has 69 ``hubs'' in 30 \nStates and has established a goal of transporting 12,000 World War II \nveterans to view the memorial in 2008.\n  Today, I am proud to say that the Heartland Honor Flight, Nebraska's \nown program, will conduct its inaugural flight, transporting more than \n100 Nebraska World War II veterans to our Nation's Capital to visit the \nNational World War II Memorial. I am greatly appreciative to the \nbusinesses and individuals who have contributed to this cause and am \nespecially grateful to Dan and Cara Whitney, who provided nearly all \nthe funding required for the cost of this initial flight.\n  This will be an emotional and reflective occasion for these veterans \nwho look upon their service with deserved pride and remember those who \ndied making the ultimate sacrifice for our country in the name of \nfreedom. This memorial was long overdue for those who served our Nation \nin World War II, and I am confident it will become an enduring symbol \nin remembering the determination and sacrifice of our country's \n``greatest generation.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4616-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL NEIL SMART\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to BG \nNeil Smart, former battalion commander in the Battle of the Bulge in \nWorld War II and Director of the Veterans Administration Regional \nOffice in Montgomery, AL. General Smart's service to this nation was \nlong and distinguished.\n  Smart was commissioned a second lieutenant in the ROTC department of \nthe University of Alabama in 1938. He left Active Duty as a lieutenant \ncolonel and continued to serve in the National Guard. After General \nSmart completed his military service, he continued to serve the \nNation's veterans in his work with the Veterans' Administration. He led \nthe VA in Alabama in an exemplary manner from 1958 to 1974.\n  General Smart also loved to share stories of World War II. He felt \nthis was a legacy his generation should leave younger generations. He \nreally liked to tell the story about an unscheduled inspection he and \nhis battalion had to undergo during World War II. The inspectors were \nGEN Dwight Eisenhower, GEN Omar Bradley, and British Prime Minister \nWinston Churchill.\n  This 94-year-old was also a key fundraiser in the efforts to build a \nmemorial honoring the American effort in World War II.

A resolution adopted by the State Board of \n     Education of the State of Mississippi urging Congress to \n     support the passage of the Secure Rural Schools and Community \n     Self-Determination Act; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in December 2000, the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act, a Federal act, was signed \n     into law; and\n       Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act provides federal funds to school districts \n     with national forest lands located within the school \n     districts boundaries; and\n       Whereas, 36 school districts have substantial tracts of \n     land in public ownership which can neither be developed nor \n     taxed to generate revenue from economic activity or taxation; \n     and\n       Whereas, these school districts have United States National \n     Forests within its boundaries and have received critical \n     funds for schools based on revenues generated from these \n     forests; and\n       Whereas, the payments provided to these school districts \n     have been a consistent and necessary source of funding for \n     the schools, teachers and students; and\n       Whereas, in December 2007, the United States Congress \n     removed the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act from the Energy Legislation \n     to which it was attached. This legislation was subsequently \n     passed and signed into law without reauthorization for the \n     Secure Rural and Community Self-Determination Act; and\n       Whereas, the funding provided through the Secure Rural \n     Schools and Community Self-Determination Act will \n     significantly contribute to the local economy of these school \n     districts by providing the necessary funds for schools and \n     roads, which is vital for sustained economic development; and \n     Schools and Community Self-Determination Act; and\n       Whereas, these school districts depend on the funding from \n     the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act \n     and unless the funding is secured through legislation as \n     deemed appropriate by the Mississippi congressional \n     delegation, these school districts will lose critical funding \n     that it has received for decades: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the state board of education of the state of \n     Mississippi, That we, the members of the State Board of \n     Education of the State of Mississippi, respectfully request \n     that the United States Congress pass the Secure Rural Schools \n     and Community Self-Determination Act so that these \n     Mississippi school districts may continue to adequately \n     maintain schools and sustain economic development in the \n     state. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the State Board of \n     Education is directed to transmit copies of this resolution \n     to President George W. Bush, the Secretary of the United \n     States Senate, the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Governor of the State of Mississippi, \n     each member of the, Mississippi congressional delegation, the \n     Executive Director of the National Association of State \n     Boards of Education, and that copies be made available to \n     members of the Capitol Press Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-353. A resolution adopted by the Georgia State Senate \n     urging Congress to withdraw the U.S. from the Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership of North America and any other \n     agreement that seeks the economic merger of the U.S. with any \n     other country; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 827\n\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush announced the formation \n     of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America \n     with the nations of Mexico and Canada on March 23, 2005; and\n       Whereas, at a news conference on the same day, President \n     Bush said: ``So that the vision that you asked about in your \n     question as to what kind of union might there be, I see one \n     based upon free trade, that would then entail commitment to \n     markets and democracy, transparency, rule of law''; and\n       Whereas, the gradual evolution of a North American \n     partnership into some ``kind of union'' or economic merger; \n     of the United States, Mexico, and Canada would be a direct \n     threat to the Constitution and national independence of the \n     United States and would imply an eventual end to national \n     borders within North America; and\n       Whereas, on March 31, 2006, President Bush at Cancun, \n     Mexico, celebrated the fIrst anniversary of the Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership, confirmed by a White House news \n     release on that same date; and\n       Whereas, this trilateral partnership to develop any kind of \n     North American merger has never been presented to Congress as \n     an agreement or treaty and has had virtually no congressional \n     oversight; and\n       Whereas, state and local governments throughout the United \n     States would be negatively impacted by the Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership of North America process, such as the \n     ``open borders'' vision of the Security and Prosperity \n     Partnership, eminent domain takings of private property along \n     planned superhighways, and increased law enforcement problems \n     along those superhighways: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate that the members of this body urge \n     the United States Congress, especially the congressional \n     delegation from Georgia, to use all its efforts, energies, \n     and diligence to withdraw the United States from any further \n     participation in the Security and Prosperity Partnership of \n     North America and any similar bilateral or multilateral \n     activity, however named, that seeks to advance, authorize, or \n     fund or in any way promote the creation of any structure or \n     relationship to accomplish any form of North American \n     integration or merger. Be it further\n       Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and \n     directed to transmit an appropriate copy of this resolution \n     to Vice President Dick Cheney, Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and each member of the \n     Georgia congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-354. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Massachusetts urging Congress to encourage Turkey to respect \n     the religious rights of all people; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Theological School of Halki, located on the \n     Island of Heybeliada in the Republic of Turkey, was preceded \n     by the Monastery of the Trinity and was characterized as a \n     stadium of wisdom because of its library and those drawn to \n     study on its premises; and\n       Whereas, the Monastery was rebuilt and rededicated on \n     September 23, 1844, as an Orthodox School of theology, which \n     nurtured educators and scholars from around the world for 127 \n     years and served the needs of the international academic \n     community; and\n       Whereas, the Theological School of Halki, labeled as a \n     seminary, was closed in 1971 by turkish authorities pursuant \n     to a law requiring higher education and military training to \n     be controlled by the Turkish State; and\n       Whereas, Turkish law further requires that the ecumenical \n     patriarch of the Orthodox Church and all clergy, faculty and \n     students of the Theological School of Halki be citizens of \n     turkey, a requirement that greatly obstructs the prosperity \n     of religious institutions; and\n       Whereas, before its closure, the Theological School of \n     Halki was the only educational institution for Orthodox \n     Christian leadership in Turkey; and\n       Whereas, strict limitations have been imposed by the \n     turkish government that restrict access to the school's \n     library, a collection of some of the rarest and most precious \n     works in the world; and\n       Whereas, because of these limitations, people are prevented \n     from conducting meaningful scholarly research; and\n       Whereas, the ecumenical patriarchate in Turkey, where the \n     canonical structure of the\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\n     Christian Orthodox Church was established, is the spiritual \n     center for more than 300,000,000 Orthodox Christians \n     worldwide, including approximately 5,000,000 Orthodox \n     Christians in the United States and 150,000 Orthodox \n     Christians in the commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, the closure of the Theological School of Halki has \n     adversely impacted the ecumenical patriarchate's ability to \n     educate its clergy and, ultimately, to select its next \n     ecumenical patriarch; and\n       Whereas,, the closure has come to symbolize repression of \n     religious freedom for all faiths in Turkey; and\n       Whereas, freedom of religion has long been recognized as a \n     right which has contributed significantly to the \n     establishment and growth of the citizens of the commonwealth \n     and is central to the ideals of all people: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts Senate hereby memorializes \n     the President of the United States, the Congress of the \n     United States and the United States Department of State to \n     take all actions necessary to encourage the Government of \n     Turkey to adopt and uphold international standards for the \n     protection of human rights, to reopen the Theological School \n     of Halki in order to continue religious training, to \n     eliminate all forms of discrimination in accordance with the \n     ideals associated with the European Union, its member states \n     and all liberal democracies, particularly those based on race \n     and religion, and to respect the human rights and property of \n     the ecumenical patriarchate by safeguarding religious freedom \n     for all; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the clerk of the Senate to the President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of State of the United States \n     and the Presiding Officer of each branch of Congress and to \n     the members thereof from the commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-355. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     take such actions as are necessary to create a national \n     catastrophe fund; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 were \n     startling reminders of both the human and economic \n     devastation that hurricanes, flooding, and other natural \n     disasters can cause; and\n       Whereas, creation of a federal catastrophe fund is a \n     comprehensive, integrated approach to help better prepare and \n     protect the nation from natural catastrophes, such as \n     hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, snowstorms, and \n     earthquakes; and\n       Whereas, the current system of responses to catastrophes \n     leaves many people and businesses at risk of being unable to \n     replace what they lost, wastes tax dollars, raises insurance \n     premiums, and leads to shortages of insurance needed to \n     sustain our economy; and\n       Whereas, creation of a federal catastrophe fund would help \n     stabilize insurance markets following a catastrophe and help \n     steady insurance costs for consumers while making it possible \n     for private insurance to be written in catastrophe-prone \n     areas; and\n       Whereas, a portion of the premiums collected by insurance \n     companies could be deposited into such a fund which could be \n     administered by the United States Treasury and grow tax free; \n     and\n       Whereas, a portion of the interest earnings of the fund \n     could be dedicated to emergency responder efforts and public \n     education and mitigation programs; and\n       Whereas, the federal catastrophe fund would operate as a \n     ``backstop'' and could only be accessed when private insurers \n     and state catastrophe funds have paid losses in excess of a \n     defined threshold; and\n       Whereas, utilizing the capacity of the federal government \n     would help smooth out fluctuations which consumers currently \n     experience in insurance prices and availability because of \n     exposure to large catastrophic losses and would provide \n     better protection at a lower price; and\n       Whereas, when there is a gap between the insurance \n     protection consumers buy and the damage caused by a major \n     catastrophe, taxpayers across the country pay much of the \n     difference, as congressional appropriations of billions of \n     dollars for the after-the-fact disaster relief in the \n     aftermath of Hurricane Katrina demonstrated; and\n       Whereas, on November 8, 2007, the United States House of \n     Representatives passed the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007 \n     (H.R. 3355) that would help ensure that individuals and \n     communities destroyed by natural catastrophes have the \n     resources necessary to repair, rebuild, and recover in the \n     aftermath of massive hurricanes, earthquakes, or other \n     natural events; and\n       Whereas, the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007 was sponsored \n     by Florida Representatives Ron Klein, Tim Mahoney, and Ginny \n     Brown-Waite and nearly four dozen cosponsors from around the \n     country including then Congressman Bobby Jindal, now governor \n     of the state of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the Senate should pass similar legislation that \n     will integrate the approach of H.R. 3355 with H.R. 91, which \n     includes the Consumer Hurricane and Earthquake Loss \n     Protection Fund and earlier legislative initiatives that will \n     include the Consumer HELP Fund.

A bill to establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm \nNational Forest Heritage Area in the State of Alaska, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm \nNational Forest Heritage Area would be the first Heritage Area in \nAlaska, and one of a few Heritage Areas in the West. Our proposal \nencompasses the wide mountainous corridor that was the major gateway to \npioneer settlement of the State, extending from Seward through the \nKenai Mountains to the upper Turnagain Arm. Here mountain trails \ndeveloped by indigenous First Alaskans became prospectors' trails and, \neventually, the roads and railroad used by the pioneers who settled the \nlast frontier of the United States. Transportation, resource \ndevelopment and settlement in this rugged, often-treacherous landscape \nprovide a powerful reminder of the fortitude and resourcefulness of the \npioneers of America's Last Frontier.\n  Historic communities that were developed around mining and early \ntransportation routes have preserved much of their original character. \nA visit to the Hope Townsite is a visit to a living community that \nstill resembles the gold rush town that it was before the rush to the \nKlondike. The City of Whittier provides a glimpse of our Nation's \nintense effort to develop an ice-free port to supply troops who were \ndefending our boundaries in Alaska during World War II. As in the early \ndays, all the signs of human activity in the corridor are dwarfed by \nthe sweeping landscapes of the region, by the magnificence of the \nmountains, glaciers and tidal fjords and the dominance and power of \nnature. Turnagain Arm, once a critical transportation link, has one of \nthe world's greatest tidal ranges.\n  This Heritage Area proposal, truly a grass roots product, began in \n1997 when the Kenai Peninsula Historical Association asked a group of \nlocal community leaders to reach out and tell people about Heritage \nAreas. They were successful in garnering support from communities \nthroughout the corridor. These local folks have extensive knowledge of \nthe resources; they are personally acquainted with the area; they \nunderstand the ruggedness and the beauty of the land, and certainly \nappreciate the potential economic value this designation would bring to \nthe area.\n\n  In 2000 these community leaders organized the Kenai Mountains-\nTurnagain Arm National Heritage Area Corridor Communities Association \nas a non-profit organization with a board of directors made up of \ncorridor community representatives. Later a congressionally designated \ngrant made it possible for the new non-profit to serve as a local \ncoordinating entity and prove its ability to plan and accomplish \nprojects consistent with Heritage Area purposes. Through their \nmanagement of the grant, historic structures were preserved, a small \nmuseum has opened, parks and pavilions with historic interpretation \nhave been constructed, oral histories have been collected from old-\ntimers and recorded, and an excellent book on corridor history has been \npublished.\n  Since the corridor is within the western part of the Chugach National \nForest, the Association has asked to put this Heritage Area under the \nSecretary of Agriculture. The bill provides for coordination with the \nSecretaries of Interior and includes the same components, structure and \nnational recognition as Heritage Areas under the Secretary of Interior. \nSimilar components assure that the Heritage Area will not impact \nprivate property rights or public land management. A Memorandum of \nUnderstanding between the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would \nestablish coordination at the Secretarial level. Passage of this bill \nwill be an excellent way to commemorate the recent centennial of the \nChugach National Forest.\n  I am proud to lend my support to this grassroots effort by \nintroducing legislation today to designate the Kenai Mountains-\nTurnagain Arm in Alaska as our most northern and western National \nHeritage Area, the first National Heritage Area in Alaska and the first \nNational Forest Heritage Area to be assisted by the U.S. Forest \nService.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3045\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kenai Mountains-Turnagain \n     Arm National Forest Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation \n     corridor--\n       (A) is a major gateway to Alaska;\n       (B) includes a range of transportation routes used by--\n       (i) indigenous people; and\n       (ii) the pioneers that settled the last frontier of the \n     United States;\n       (C) is located in the heart of the Chugach National Forest, \n     which was established by presidential proclamation on July \n     23, 1907, by Theodore Roosevelt; and\n       (D) includes a historically significant segment of the \n     Iditarod Trail connecting Seward and Nome, which was--\n       (i) scouted by the Alaska Road Commission in 1908; and\n       (ii) designated as the Iditarod National Historic Trail in \n     1978;\n       (2) the cultural landscape formed by indigenous people and \n     by settlement, transportation, and modern resource \n     development in the rugged and often treacherous natural \n     setting of the transportation corridor provides a powerful \n     testimony to the human fortitude, perseverance, and \n     resourcefulness of the people who--\n       (A) settled the frontier; and\n       (B) represent the proudest heritage of the United States;\n       (3) the natural history and scenic splendor of the \n     transportation corridor are equally outstanding;\n       (4) the transportation corridor includes vistas of the \n     power of nature, such as evidence of earthquake subsidence, \n     recent avalanches, retreating glaciers, and tidal action \n     along Turnagain Arm, which has the second greatest tidal \n     range in the world;\n       (5) there is a national interest in recognizing, \n     preserving, promoting, and interpreting the resources of the \n     transportation corridor;\n       (6) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm region is--\n       (A) geographically and culturally cohesive; and\n       (B) defined by a corridor of historic routes, trails, \n     water, railroads, and roadways through a distinct landscape \n     of mountains, lakes, and fjords;\n       (7) the region played a unique role as a portal and \n     transportation corridor through which indigenous people, \n     explorers, missionaries, gold miners, cannery workers, big \n     game hunters, homesteaders, foresters, railroad workers, \n     military personnel, and petroleum developers traveled into \n     southcentral and interior Alaska as part of the waves of \n     travel that characterized the history of the United States;\n       (8) the region exhibits a high degree of integrity with \n     vast tracks of rugged, undeveloped areas and natural scenery \n     that still look much as the area did to the original \n     inhabitants, the indigenous people, and early explorers and \n     pioneers of the region;\n       (9) studies that led to the designation of the Iditarod \n     National Historic Trail, the Seward Highway All American \n     Road, and the Alaska Railroad National Scenic Railroad--\n       (A) determined the national significance of separate \n     transportation routes traversing the region; and\n       (B) illustrate the national significance of heritage \n     resources in the region;\n       (10) designation of the transportation corridor as a \n     national heritage area--\n       (A) provides for a comprehensive interpretation of human \n     history in the wide transportation corridor through the Kenai \n     Mountains and upper Turnagain Arm, including early Native \n     trade routes, historic waterways, mining trails, historic \n     communities, and the 3 designated routes of national \n     significance referred to in paragraph (9);\n       (B) recognizes the national significance of the Kenai \n     Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation corridor, including--\n       (i) the historic and modern resource development of the \n     transportation corridor; and\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\n       (ii) the cultural, natural, and recreational resources and \n     landscapes of the transportation corridor; and\n       (C) would provide assistance to local communities, Indian \n     tribes, and residents of the transportation corridor in--\n       (i) preserving and interpreting cultural and historic \n     resources; and\n       (ii) fostering cooperative planning and partnerships;\n       (11) an additional feasibility study for the Heritage Area \n     is not needed before designation of the Heritage Area because \n     the studies referred to in paragraph (9) provide sufficient \n     documentation of--\n       (A) the national significance of heritage resources in the \n     region; and\n       (B) the support of local communities for designation of the \n     Heritage Area; and\n       (12) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Forest \n     Heritage Corridor Communities Association--\n       (A) has been formed as a nonprofit corporation to act as \n     the Local Coordinating Entity for the Heritage Area; and\n       (B) is governed by bylaws that define the purposes of the \n     Association as the purposes established by Congress for the \n     Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Forest Heritage Area.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize, preserve, and interpret the historic and \n     modern resource development and cultural landscapes of the \n     Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm historic transportation \n     corridor; and\n       (2) to promote and facilitate the public enjoyment of the \n     resources.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \ncreate a new conditional approval system for drugs, biological \nproducts, and devices that is responsive to the needs of seriously ill \npatients, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill I \nintroduced today: the Access, Compassion, Care and Ethics for \nSeriously-ill Patients Act, ACCESS, Act. I would like to thank the \noriginal Senate cosponsors: Senators Bob Casey, Norm Croleman, Arlen \nSpecter and James Inhofe. I also especially thank Representative Dianne \nWatson who will be introducing the companion bill in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In the current era, certain cancers and other chronic diseases touch \nthe lives of almost every American. If you have had the experience of a \nfamily member or friend struggling with terminal illness, you were \nprobably aware of their need and limited timeline to access promising \ntreatments. Unfortunately, the current system often does not work for \nthe benefit of terminally-ill patients--during emotionally-charged \ntimes, patients and their families may face regulatory and bureaucratic \nhurdles if they wish to access investigational treatment options in \norder to preserve their lives. Many terminally-ill patients exhaust \ntheir treatment options and do not qualify for a clinical trial. They \nalso do not physically have months to wait for an individual \ninvestigational treatment application to be approved.\n  In this day and age of scientific breakthroughs, we must embrace \nthese advances and do so with a ``patient-centered'' mindset. \nTerminally-ill patients often reach a point where the potential \nbenefits of these breakthrough treatments outweigh their inevitable \nrisk of death from their disease.\n  I introduced the ACCESS Act to offer these patients an ethical \noption--compassionate access to treatments that show promise earlier in \nthe drug development process. The average time for a treatment to go \nthrough the entire FDA approval process is 15 years. As a result, the \ncurrent system tends to benefit future generations of patients with \nlife-threatening diseases, rather than patients of the present time.\n  The ACCESS Act offers a new Compassionate Investigational Access \napproval system for treatments showing efficacy during clinical trials, \nfor use by the seriously-ill patient population. Seriously-ill patients \nwho have exhausted all alternatives and are seeking new treatment \noptions, would be offered access to these treatments with the consent \nof their physician. This bill also improves upon the existing \naccelerated approval system, using a patient-centered framework. The \nACCESS Act also makes a technical correction that will increase patient \naccess to drugs used off-label to treat life-threatening diseases.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the ACCESS Act that \nwould offer patients, with little hope, a chance at life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S.J. Res. 33. A joint resolution recognizing the efforts of the Ohio \nDepartment of Mental Health and the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug \nAddiction Services to address the stigma associated with mental health \nand substance use disorders; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, May is National Mental Health Month. This \nproud tradition was started over 50 years ago. Each May, the mental \nhealth community comes together to raise awareness about mental health \ndisorders and to celebrate recovery. The last 50 years have seen \nsignificant progress in the treatment of mental disorders.\n  We know that with treatment and support, it is possible to recover.\n  Dr. Fred Frese knows this first hand. I met Dr. Frese at a roundtable \nthat I held in Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Frese served as Director of \nPsychology at Western Reserve Psychiatric Hospital for 15 years. He is \ncurrently an Assistant Professor of Psychology in Clinical Psychiatry \nat Case Western Reserve University and Northeastern Ohio Universities \nCollege of Medicine. He has authored and reviewed numerous articles and \nchapters, lectured in several countries and served on the boards of \ntrustees of various organizations that work on behalf of individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  In 1999, Dr. Frese received the Hildreth Award, the highest honor \ngiven by the American Psychological Association's Psychologists in \nPublic Service Division. Over the course of his career, he has \ntestified numerous times before both houses of the United States \nCongress. Dr. Frese's career has been remarkable. His life has been \nremarkable.\n  He has been living with paranoid schizophrenia since 1966. Dr. Frese \nis remarkable. But his recovery is not unusual.\n  Many people stricken with mental illness can and do recover with \nappropriate treatment. But the stigma associated with mental health \ndisorders can discourage people from getting the help they need. The \nU.S. Surgeon General's seminal report on mental health cites stigma as \na significant barrier to recovery.\n  I am proud to say that Ohio's Departments of Mental Health and \nAlcohol and Drug Addiction Services are doing something about it. They \nhave launched a ``Think Outside the Stigma'' campaign, a public \ninformation effort to increase awareness about the misperceptions \nassociated with mental health and substance use disorders.\n  Today I am introducing a resolution commending this campaign.\n  My colleague in the house, Congressman Zack Space, is offering a \ncompanion resolution.\n  Imagine a world where individuals with mental disorders are supported \nand treated, not marginalized and discriminated against. Imagine a \nworld where we see individuals first and disability second. Imagine the \nwealth of talent and resources that individuals with mental illness can \nrealize with treatment. Individuals like Dr. Frese.\n  We must work together to overcome the unfair and unnecessary burden \nof stigma associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. \nWe know that treatment can work. We know that people can recover. We \nknow that Americans are well worth the investment.\n  We know that Americans are well worth the investment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4626-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 572--CALLING UPON THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE SECOND \n    APPELLATE DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA TO UPHOLD THE FUNDAMENTAL AND \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PARENTS TO DIRECT THE UPBRINGING AND EDUCATION \n                           OF THEIR CHILDREN\n\n  Mrs. DOLE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United \n     States, and the brave members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States were called to the defense of the Nation.\n       (2) Service on active duty in the Armed Forces has been \n     especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The United States has a proud history of offering \n     educational assistance to millions of veterans, as \n     demonstrated by the many ``G.I. Bills'' enacted since World \n     War II. Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed Forces \n     after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

Nurse Training And Retention Demonstration \n     Grants. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\n       (1) America's healthcare system depends on an adequate \n     supply of trained nurses to deliver quality patient care.\n       (2) Over the next 15 years, this shortage is expected to \n     grow significantly. The Health Resources and Services \n     Administration has projected that by 2020, there will be a \n     shortage of nurses in every State and that overall only 64 \n     percent of the demand for nurses will be satisfied, with a \n     shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally.\n       (3) To avert such a shortage, today's network of healthcare \n     workers should have access to education and support from \n     their employers to participate in educational and training \n     opportunities.\n       (4) With the appropriate education and support, incumbent \n     healthcare workers and incumbent bedside nurses are untapped \n     sources which can meet these needs and address the nursing \n     shortage and provide quality care as the American population \n     ages.\n       (b) Purposes of Grant Program.--It is the purpose of this \n     section to authorize grants to--\n       (1) address the projected shortage of nurses by funding \n     comprehensive programs to create a career ladder to nursing \n     (including Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical \n     Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses) \n     for incumbent ancillary healthcare workers;\n       (2) increase the capacity for educating nurses by \n     increasing both nurse faculty and clinical opportunities \n     through collaborative programs between staff nurse \n     organizations, healthcare providers, and accredited schools \n     of nursing; and\n       (3) provide training programs through education and \n     training organizations jointly administered by healthcare \n     providers and healthcare labor organizations or other \n     organizations representing staff nurses and frontline \n     healthcare workers, working in collaboration with accredited \n     schools of nursing and academic institutions.\n       (c) Grants.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in \n     this section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     partnership grant program to award grants to eligible \n     entities to carry out comprehensive programs to provide \n     education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for \n     incumbent ancillary healthcare workers who wish to advance \n     their careers, and to otherwise carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n       (d) Eligible Entities.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section an entity shall--\n       (1) be--\n       (A) a healthcare entity that is jointly administered by a \n     healthcare employer and a labor union representing the \n     healthcare employees of the employer and that carries out \n     activities using labor management training funds as provided \n     for under section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, \n     1947 (18 U.S.C. 186(c)(6));\n       (B) an entity that operates a training program that is \n     jointly administered by--\n       (i) one or more healthcare providers or facilities, or a \n     trade association of healthcare providers; and\n       (ii) one or more organizations which represent the \n     interests of direct care healthcare workers or staff nurses \n     and in which the direct care healthcare workers or staff \n     nurses have direct input as to the leadership of the \n     organization; or\n       (C) a State training partnership program that consists of \n     non-profit organizations that include equal participation \n     from industry, including public or private employers, and \n     labor organizations including joint labor-management training \n     programs, and which may include representatives from local \n     governments, worker investment agency one-stop career \n     centers, community based organizations, community colleges, \n     and accredited schools of nursing; and\n       (2) submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (e) Additional Requirements for Healthcare Employer \n     Described in Subsection (d).--To be eligible for a grant \n     under this section, a healthcare employer described in \n     subsection (d) shall demonstrate--\n       (1) an established program within their facility to \n     encourage the retention of existing nurses;\n       (2) it provides wages and benefits to its nurses that are \n     competitive for its market or that have been collectively \n     bargained with a labor organization;

Such contributions may be made directly or through \n     donations from public or private entities, or may be provided \n     through the cash equivalent of paid release time provided to \n     incumbent worker students.\n       (B) Determination of amount of non-federal contribution.--\n     Non-Federal contributions required in subparagraph (A) may be \n     in cash or in kind (including paid release time), fairly \n     evaluated, including equipment or services (and excluding \n     indirect or overhead costs).\n       (C) Supplement, not supplant.--Funds made available under \n     this section shall supplement, and not supplant, resources \n     dedicated by an entity, or other Federal, State, or local \n     funds available to carry out activities described in this \n     section.\n       (2) Required collaboration.--Entities carrying out or \n     overseeing programs carried out with assistance provided \n     under this section shall demonstrate collaboration with \n     accredited schools of nursing which may include community \n     colleges and other academic institutions providing associate, \n     bachelor's, or advanced nursing degree programs or specialty \n     training or certification programs.\n       (g) Activities.--Amounts awarded to an entity under a grant \n     under this section shall be used for the following:\n       (1) To carry out programs that provide education and \n     training to establish nursing career ladders to educate \n     incumbent healthcare workers to become nurses (including \n     Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical Nurses, \n     Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses). Such \n     programs shall include one or more of the following:\n       (A) Preparing incumbent workers to return to the classroom \n     through English as a second language education, GED \n     education, precollege counseling, college preparation \n     classes, and support with entry level college classes that \n     are a prerequisite to nursing.\n       (B) Providing tuition assistance with preference for \n     dedicated cohort classes in community colleges, universities, \n     accredited schools of nursing with supportive services \n     including tutoring and counseling.\n       (C) Providing assistance in preparing for and meeting all \n     nursing licensure tests and requirements.\n       (D) Carrying out orientation and mentorship programs that \n     assist newly graduated nurses in adjusting to working at the \n     bedside to ensure their retention post graduation, and \n     ongoing programs to support nurse retention.\n       (E) Providing stipends for release time and continued \n     healthcare coverage to enable incumbent healthcare workers to \n     participate in these programs.\n       (2) To carry out programs that assist nurses in obtaining \n     advanced degrees and completing specialty training or \n     certification programs and to establish incentives for nurses \n     to assume nurse faculty positions on a part-time or full-time \n     basis.

Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed Forces \n     after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's healthcare system depends on an adequate \n     supply of trained nurses to deliver quality patient care.\n       (2) Over the next 15 years, this shortage is expected to \n     grow significantly. The Health Resources and Services \n     Administration has projected that by 2020, there will be a \n     shortage of nurses in every State and that overall only 64 \n     percent of the demand for nurses will be satisfied, with a \n     shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally.\n       (3) To avert such a shortage, today's network of healthcare \n     workers should have access to education and support from \n     their employers to participate in educational and training \n     opportunities.\n       (4) With the appropriate education and support, incumbent \n     healthcare workers and incumbent bedside nurses are untapped \n     sources which can meet these needs and address the nursing \n     shortage and provide quality care as the American population \n     ages.\n       (b) Purposes of Grant Program.--It is the purpose of this \n     section to authorize grants to--\n       (1) address the projected shortage of nurses by funding \n     comprehensive programs to create a career ladder to nursing \n     (including Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical \n     Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses) \n     for incumbent ancillary healthcare workers;\n       (2) increase the capacity for educating nurses by \n     increasing both nurse faculty and clinical opportunities \n     through collaborative programs between staff nurse \n     organizations, healthcare providers, and accredited schools \n     of nursing; and\n       (3) provide training programs through education and \n     training organizations jointly administered by healthcare \n     providers and healthcare labor organizations or other \n     organizations representing staff nurses and frontline \n     healthcare workers, working in collaboration with accredited \n     schools of nursing and academic institutions.\n       (c) Grants.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in \n     this section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     partnership grant program to award grants to eligible \n     entities to carry out comprehensive programs to provide \n     education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for \n     incumbent ancillary healthcare workers who wish to advance \n     their careers, and to otherwise carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n       (d) Eligible Entities.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section an entity shall--\n       (1) be--\n       (A) a healthcare entity that is jointly administered by a \n     healthcare employer and a labor union representing the \n     healthcare employees of the employer and that carries out \n     activities using labor management training funds as provided \n     for under section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, \n     1947 (18 U.S.C. 186(c)(6));\n       (B) an entity that operates a training program that is \n     jointly administered by--\n       (i) one or more healthcare providers or facilities, or a \n     trade association of healthcare providers;

or\n       (C) a State training partnership program that consists of \n     non-profit organizations that include equal participation \n     from industry, including public or private employers, and \n     labor organizations including joint labor-management training \n     programs, and which may include representatives from local \n     governments, worker investment agency one-stop career \n     centers, community based organizations, community colleges, \n     and accredited schools of nursing; and\n       (2) submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (e) Additional Requirements for Healthcare Employer \n     Described in Subsection (d).--To be eligible for a grant \n     under this section, a healthcare employer described in \n     subsection (d) shall demonstrate--\n       (1) an established program within their facility to \n     encourage the retention of existing nurses;\n       (2) it provides wages and benefits to its nurses that are \n     competitive for its market or that have been collectively \n     bargained with a labor organization;

Res. 541\n\n       Whereas, despite the formation of the internationally \n     recognized Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, \n     there has been little improvement in the governance or \n     stability of southern and central Somalia, and stability in \n     the northern region of Puntland has deteriorated;\n       Whereas governance failures in Somalia have permitted and \n     contributed to escalating violence, egregious human rights \n     abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law, \n     which occur with impunity and have led to an independent \n     system of roadblocks, checkpoints, and extortion that hinders \n     trade, business, and the delivery of desperately needed \n     humanitarian assistance;\n       Whereas the Government of Ethiopia intervened in Somalia in \n     December 2006 against the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) and \n     continues to serve as the primary security force for the TFG \n     in Somalia;\n       Whereas a United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia report \n     presented to the United Nations Security Council on July 20, \n     2007, alleged that Eritreans have provided arms to insurgents \n     in Somalia as part of a long-standing dispute between \n     Ethiopia and Eritrea that includes a series of interlocking \n     proxy wars in the Horn of Africa;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that, as of April \n     2008, 2,000,000 people in Somalia need humanitarian \n     assistance or livelihood support for at least the next 6 \n     months, including 745,000 people who have fled ongoing \n     insecurity and sporadic violence in Mogadishu over the past \n     16 months, adding to more than 275,000 long-term internally \n     displaced Somalis;\n       Whereas, despite Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein's public \n     commitment to humanitarian operations, local and \n     international aid agencies remain hindered by extortion, \n     harassment, and administrative obstructions;\n       Whereas, in March 2008, United Nations Secretary-General \n     Ban Ki-moon presented his report on Somalia based on recent \n     strategic assessments and fact-finding missions, which \n     offered recommendations for increasing United Nations \n     engagement while decreasing the presence of foreign troops, \n     including the establishment of a maritime task force to deter \n     piracy and support the 1992 international arms embargo;\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\n       Whereas the United States Government has allocated nearly \n     $50,000,000 to support the African Union Mission in Somalia \n     (AMISOM) and continues to be the leading contributor of \n     humanitarian assistance in Somalia, with approximately \n     $140,000,000 provided in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year \n     2008 to date, but still lacks a comprehensive strategy to \n     build a sustainable peace;\n       Whereas, over the last 5 years, the Senate has repeatedly \n     called upon the President through resolutions, amendments, \n     bills, oversight letters, and hearings to develop and \n     implement a comprehensive strategy to contribute to lasting \n     peace and security throughout the Horn of Africa by helping \n     to establish a legitimate, stable central government in \n     Somalia capable of maintaining the rule of law and preventing \n     Somalia from becoming a safe haven for terrorists;\n       Whereas a February 2008 Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) report entitled, ``Somalia: Several Challenges Limit \n     U.S. and International Stabilization, Humanitarian, and \n     Development Efforts'', found that United States and \n     international ``efforts have been limited by lack of \n     security, access to vulnerable populations, and effective \n     government institutions'' as well as the fact that the ``U.S. \n     strategy for Somalia, outlined in the Administration's 2007 \n     report to Congress on its Comprehensive Regional Strategy on \n     Somalia, is incomplete'';\n       Whereas the recent designation by the Department of State \n     of Somali's al Shabaab militia as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189) and as a specially designated \n     global terrorist under section 1(b) of Executive Order 13224 \n     (September 23, 2001) highlights the growing need for a \n     strategic, multifaceted, and coordinated approach to Somalia; \n     and\n       Whereas it is in the interest of the United States, the \n     people of Somalia, and the citizens and governments of \n     neighboring and other interested countries to work towards a \n     legitimate peace and a sustainable resolution to the crisis \n     in Somalia that includes civilian protection and access to \n     services, upholds the rule of law, and promotes \n     accountability: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States remains committed to the people of \n     Somalia and to helping build the institutions necessary for a \n     stable nation free from civil war and violent extremism;\n       (2) the President, in partnership with the African Union, \n     the United Nations, and the international community, should--\n       (A) provide sufficient humanitarian assistance to those \n     most seriously affected by armed conflict, drought, and \n     flooding throughout Somalia, and call on the Transitional \n     Federal Government to actively facilitate the dispersal of \n     such assistance;\n       (B) ensure accountability for all state, non-state, and \n     external parties responsible for violations of human rights \n     and international humanitarian law in Somalia, including \n     through the deployment of United Nations human rights \n     monitors and the establishment of a United Nations Commission \n     of Inquiry to investigate abuses;\n       (C) call on all parties to recommit to an inclusive \n     dialogue, with international support, in the interest of \n     promoting sustainable peace and security in Somalia and \n     across the Horn of Africa;\n       (D) urge the Government of Ethiopia, in coordination with \n     the United Nations Political Office in Somalia, to develop a \n     clear timeline for the responsible withdrawal of its armed \n     forces from Somalia, to honor its obligation under the Geneva \n     Conventions to ensure protection of civilians under its \n     control, and to observe the distinction between civilians and \n     military combatants and their assets;\n       (E) urge the Government of Eritrea to play a productive \n     role in helping to bring about stability to Somalia, \n     including ceasing to provide any financial and material \n     support, such as arms and ammunition, to insurgent groups in \n     and around Mogadishu and throughout the region; and\n       (F) call on all countries in the region and wider \n     international community to provide increased support for \n     AMISOM and ensure a robust civilian protection mandate;\n       (3) to achieve sustainable peace in the region, the \n     Transitional Federal Government, including the newly \n     appointed Prime Minister and his Cabinet, should--\n       (A) take necessary steps to protect civilians from dangers \n     related to military operations, investigate and prosecute \n     human rights abuses, provide basic services to all the people \n     of Somalia, and ensure that humanitarian organizations have \n     full access to vulnerable populations;\n       (B) recommit to the Transitional Federal Charter;\n       (C) set a detailed timeline and demonstrate observable \n     progress for completing the political transition laid out in \n     the Transitional Federal Charter by 2009, including concrete \n     and immediate steps toward scheduling elections as a means of \n     establishing a democratically elected government that \n     represents the people of Somalia; and\n       (D) agree to participate in an inclusive and transparent \n     political process, with international support, towards the \n     formation of a government of national unity based on the \n     principles of democracy, accountability, and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/21/senate-section/article/S4706-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING CUBA SOLIDARITY DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I and my colleagues wish to commemorate \nCuba Solidarity Day and the struggle of the Cuban people against a \nconstant denial of their basic liberties. Yesterday, we marked the day \nin 1902 when Cuba won its independence from Spain. Yesterday, we \ncelebrated the birth of their nation; today, we express our hope that \nthe island will experience a new birth of freedom. Today, we express \nour solidarity with Cuba's political prisoners, democracy advocates, \nand human rights activists who risk their lives so that freedom might \nlive.\n  About 6 months ago I spoke on the Senate floor with my colleague, \nSenator Martinez, to express outrage that 70 Cuban dissidents were \narrested, detained, and harassed. These 70 Cubans, according to the \nCuban regime, had committed the crime of peaceful assembly.\n  These young people were simply walking down a street in Havana. And \nwhile they were peacefully walking, they had on their arms this \nwristband. The simple white wristband says one word; ``cambio''.\n  Unfortunately, as we have seen for decades from this regime, this \ndenial of a basic liberty was not an isolated incident.\n  This regime has been marked by fear and repression for decades. For \ndecades, they have denied freedom of press, freedom of speech and \nfreedom to peacefully assemble.\n  They have refused to hold free and fair elections which represent the \nwill of the Cuban people.\n  They have denied the most basic human rights to its citizens.\n  But decades of fear and repression have also led to acts of courage.\n  And I stand here today in solidarity with all of the brave Cubans who \nhave shown such acts of courage.\n  Currently, according to Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and \nReporters Without Borders, the Cuban regime is holding more than 220 \npolitical prisoners.\n  These heroes continue to sacrifice and fight so that one day the \nCuban people will finally know freedom.\n  We in the Senate recently introduced a resolution to award a \nCongressional Gold Medal to Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, in recognition of \nhis courageous and unwavering commitment to democracy, human rights, \nand peaceful change in Cuba.\n  Dr. Biscet's fight serves as an example to all Cubans as well as a \nsource of inspiration for us here.\n  Dr. Biscet, the hundreds of political prisoners and all Cubans who \nlive with daily political repression have shown that Cuba will change. \nAnd this change will come from the Cuban people.\n  But they need our help. We must continue to fight here to do what we \ncan to empower them. And we must continue to acknowledge them when they \nempower themselves.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution to \nrecognize Cuba Solidarity Day and the struggle of the Cuban people as \nthey continue to fight for freedom. Cuba Solidarity Day is a call for \nthe world to join together in the fight against oppression in Cuba. It \nis a way of drawing attention to the injustices faced by the people of \nCuba under the current regime and a way of saying that our country \nstands together with the Cuban people as they work toward democratic \nchange.\n  I believe that it is our country's duty to push for a peaceful \ntransition to democracy in Cuba. It is a travesty that, more than a \ndecade after the Cold War ended, a brutal communist dictator is still \noppressing people just miles off the coast of Florida.\n  The people of Cuba continue to be denied the most basic human rights \nand the freedoms of speech, press, and assembly. It is estimated that \nmore than\n\n[[Page S4707]]\n\n220 individuals are being held as political prisoners by the communist \nregime in Cuba. For the dissidents suffering prison terms, and for \ntheir families and loved ones, their suffering is real. And it is our \nduty as a free nation to let them know that we remember them, that they \nare not forgotten, and that their suffering is for a purpose. They must \nknow that the world is watching and that we will not rest and will not \ntire and will keep working to support them until they are finally free.\n  I am reminded of the story that Natan Sharansky tells about his time \nin the Soviet gulag, when word came that President Reagan had called \nthe Soviet Union an ``Evil Empire.'' For the political prisoners, it \nwas the first sign that they had not been forgotten. It was a signal to \nthem that the leader of the world's most powerful democracy had no \nillusions about the true nature of that regime, that he knew of their \nplight and was ready to call the Soviet system what is was--evil.\n  This resolution sends a signal to all the dissidents and political \nprisoners in Cuba that we have no illusions about the nature of \nCastro's brother's brutal regime and that we know of their plight and \nstand ready to help them.\n  I truly believe there is hope. We are witnessing a remarkable time in \nhistory as freedom prevails in places that were once rife with \noppression. As former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel once said, \n``without free, self-respecting, and autonomous citizens there can be \nno free and independent nations.'' It is now time for the world to \nvoice its support of the Cuban people so they too can rise above the \ninjustice of the communist regime and finally achieve the freedom and \nindependence of a democratic nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
