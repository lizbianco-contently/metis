Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning \nbusiness for an hour. The time will be equally divided and controlled. \nThe Republicans have the first half. We have the second half. Following \nmorning business, Senators Mikulski and Shelby, as managers of the \nbill, will resume consideration of H.R. 3093, the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act.\n  Last night, I indicated we would work and complete this bill, either \ntonight or in the morning--and by ``in the morning,'' I mean after \nmidnight. We are going to work until we complete this bill, if, in \nfact, it is ever going to be completed. I am not filing cloture on the \nlegislation. We have a finite number of amendments, and we are going to \nwork through these amendments.\n  As I indicated last night, we have had good cooperation from the \nminority on our appropriations bills, and I hope that continues. I am \nconfident it will. But if anyone who is mischievous thinks they will \nstop us from voting tonight, we will have votes. I do not need to be \nvoting on these matters of this bill. If people think they can stop us \nfrom voting, we will have votes. Even if we have to instruct the \nSergeant at Arms or do whatever is necessary, we are going to have \nvotes tonight, unless this bill moves forward more quickly than some \nhave said.\n  We need to complete this legislation. We have things that are so very \nimportant. The President yesterday said he wants appropriations bills. \nWe cannot do the appropriations bills unless we have cooperation from \nDemocrats and Republicans. Right now, we have 29 amendments that are \nhere that Republicans want to deal with. There are eight Democratic \namendments. We want to get this bill done. We need to do Labor-HHS, \nand, hopefully, by that time we can have something ready to send to the \nPresident--any one of the six bills we would have passed. I think it is \nimportant we get this process done. The President said he wants to veto \na bill. We will send him one he wants to veto if, in fact, that is what \nhe wants to do. Hopefully, that may not be the case. But if it is, that \nis where we have to start with him. So there are going to be votes. \nThere probably will be votes before our 12:30 mandated recess time.\n  There are other items we need to work on. For example, one reason we \nneed to finish this bill and the Labor-HHS bill is the manager of the \nfarm bill is Harkin from Iowa, and we have to have him free so he can \ndo the markup of the farm bill next week--a very important piece of \nlegislation. In the Democratic caucus--I do not know of the Republican \ncaucus--more than half of the Democrats are vitally interested in the \nfarm bill because it affects their States. We have to do a farm bill. \nWe have not done one in 5 years. I think it would be negligent on our \npart to leave here without doing a farm bill.\n  There are many important issues. There are people who want to change\n\n[[Page S12886]]\n\nthe standard farm bill we have done in years past. This is what \nlegislating is all about. It is extremely important we work toward \ncompleting this legislation. So that is why we have the press we are \nhaving now.\n  I would also say, after we finish this week, we only have 4 weeks \nleft until Thanksgiving, and then we have 2 weeks we will be out for \nThanksgiving, and then, if we come back, we are going to have only 3 \nweeks before Christmas. We have a lot to do. I will not go through the \nlist of what we are obligated to do, but it is a lot of stuff. I hope \neveryone would understand that and be thoughtful and considerate of \nothers.\n\n  We may have to work some late nights. We may have to work some \nweekends. We have been very fortunate this whole year. We talked about \nworking weekends a lot, and we have not had to do it except on a couple \nof occasions. The reason we have not had to do it more is because of \nthe press of the weekend coming upon us we get our work done. That may \nbe the case this week. I hope so. But if not, everyone should \nunderstand, if they have obligations at home, they better have some \nalternatives or consider missing some votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12886-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have, as the saying goes, some good news \nand some bad news. The good news is the budget deficit has dropped in \nthe last year from 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product of this \nNation down to 1.2 percent--a historic low level for the budget \ndeficit. But as Members of the Senate know, the budget deficit is just \na year-to-year statement of what the financial obligations are of the \nFederal Government. The figure that is the bad news is the debt; that \nis, the bills, if you will, owed by the American people to finance the \ncost of Government. The bad news is on September 27--a short time ago--\nthis Congress voted to increase the debt ceiling for the United States \nof America from $8.965 trillion to $9.82 trillion.\n  Now a ``trillion'' is more money than any of us can possibly imagine, \nbut let me break it down to what it means for every man, woman, and \nchild in America. It means today, every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica owes $30,000 of the Federal debt--the cost of the Federal \nGovernment doing business.\n  So instead of passing on to our children and grandchildren the kind \nof prosperity and opportunity to start on a level playing field and to \nreach their God-given potential to achieve their dreams, we are \nburdening our children and grandchildren today, if we do not do \nanything about it, with a minimum of $30,000 of debt.\n  The fact of the matter is, it is actually worse than that. As to \nSocial Security, we understand from the Social Security trust fund, \nthey will be running red ink by the year 2017, unless we do something \nabout that. In other words, as to the Social Security taxes that are \ndeducted from your paycheck and mine and everybody's in America to help \npay our share of Social Security, the money that has to be paid out \nwill exceed the amount of money coming in as a result of those Social \nSecurity taxes by 2017, if we do not do anything about it.\n  In addition, Medicare is even in worse shape. By 2013, the amount of \nmoney coming in to pay for Medicare for seniors will be exceeded by the \noutflow of funds. So instead of being in the black and being able to \nsustain itself, both Social Security and Medicare are on the road to \ninsolvency and worse.\n  Just when you think the story, the financial picture, could not be \nany worse, there comes the revelation that actually Congress is \nspending the current surplus for Social Security, for Medicare, for \nCivil Service Retirement, and the Transportation trust fund, spending \nmoney that is a surplus now and issuing debt to be paid by our children \nand grandchildren--in other words, funding out of the Civil Service \nRetirement Fund, Medicare, Social Security, and the Transportation \ntrust fund, taking money out of that to pay the current bills of the \nFederal Government.\n  This is a dire financial circumstance that only the Federal \nGovernment could ignore. No family, no business, no one in America \ncould run their finances this way and get by with it, except for the \nFederal Government because the Federal Government can continue to issue \ndebt to borrow from surpluses in one fund to pay for bills in another. \nFrankly, this is a train wreck we are beginning to see in slow motion \ntaking place right before our eyes and will be played out over the next \nfew years, unless we act in a more fiscally responsible way right now.\n  The President has vetoed the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and I want to talk about that in a minute. Thursday, I believe \nthe House will vote on whether to override that veto and there has been \na lot of misconceptions about that and I wish to clarify that with my \nremarks.\n  But I want to suggest to you that before Congress votes to expand \ncurrent programs, even successful programs, beyond their original \nscope, such as the SCHIP program, which has been enormously successful, \ntargeted at low-income kids whose families earn too much to qualify for \nMedicaid but not enough to buy private health insurance--before we \nexpand that, not by 40 percent, which I support, but by 140 percent, to \ncover adults in 14 States, and with a combination of waivers that can \nbe issued by the executive branch of Government to potentially cover \npeople up to 400 percent of the poverty level, displacing private \nhealth insurance and taking individuals who currently have health \ninsurance and replacing it with Government--read ``taxpayer''--\nsubsidized free health care for people, families making up to $82,000 a \nyear--before Congress should attempt to expand programs in this sort of \nirresponsible manner, in my view, we ought to take a look at the \nprograms that have been rated by the Federal Government in terms of \ntheir effectiveness and look at opportunities for cost savings there.\n  I think the American people do not resent paying their fair share of \ntaxes for efficient Government and for a consensus role in what \nGovernment should be doing as opposed to the private sector. What they \nhave a right to resent is the fact the Federal Government wastes their \nmoney and grows Government at the expense of the private sector in ways \nthat crowd out the private sector.\n  I would like to suggest to my colleagues they look at a Web site \ncalled Expectmore.org. This is a Government Web site that, through the \nOffice of Management and Budget, rates various Federal programs and \nagencies. What they have concluded--the Office of Management and \nBudget--is that out of 1,016 programs they have evaluated, 22 percent--\nalmost a quarter of them--have been rated as ineffective or, perhaps \neven worse, we cannot tell whether they are working as intended--22 \npercent.\n  Only 18 percent have been rated as effective; 31 percent, moderately \neffective; and 29 percent, adequate. This is a miserable scorecard for \nthe Federal Government in terms of the taxpayers' dollars actually \ndelivering the kind of services we should expect Government to deliver, \nefficient use and respectful use of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  Before we talk about growing any program--even the SCHIP program--by \n140 percent to cover adults and people in the upper middle class with \nfree taxpayer-subsidized health insurance, should we not try to \neliminate some of these ineffective programs that have been \ninconclusive in terms of the evaluation?\n  As it turns out, I have introduced legislation, along with some of my \ncolleagues, designed to do this, building\n\n[[Page S12887]]\n\non the successful sunset commission programs in Texas and elsewhere, \nwhich periodically--say every 10 years or so--take an agency and \nevaluate it and make the agency justify its continued existence, start \nwith a zero-base budget and justify each and every dollar they use in \norder to perform that function, in order to make sure it actually is \neffective.\n  In my State of Texas, the sunset commission has been responsible for \neliminating a number of different programs and saving taxpayers a lot \nof money. We can do the same thing for the Federal Government in \nWashington if Congress would merely have the will.\n  Another idea, another proposal I have made, along with some \ncolleagues, is modeled off of the enormously successful Base \nRealignment and Closing Commission, the BRAC Commission. This, as my \ncolleagues know, is a way for Congress to make sure we eliminate \nunneeded and unnecessary military installations. When trying to do it \non an individualized basis, is very hard because there is always a \nconstituency for maintaining a military base someplace, even if it is \nnot needed by the military. But the BRAC situation is an independent \ncommission that collects recommendations for all of the unneeded bases \nand presents it to Congress for an up-or-down vote. No cherry picking, \nno putting some in and taking some out. We have to vote on all of them \nup or down. That BRAC Commission has been enormously successful in \neliminating unnecessary, unneeded, and costly military installations. \nWe need to do the same for the Federal Government. Before we spend any \nmore of the Federal taxpayer dollars, I think we need to show the \ntaxpayers we are being good stewards of the money they faithfully pay \nto the Federal Government for their tax obligation.\n  In addition to not taking care of this growing crisis I have \ndescribed, Congress continues not to keep its fiscal house in order. It \nis common knowledge that we have not passed a single appropriations \nbill for the current fiscal year, and we are operating on a continuing \nresolution that Congress passed because we have not been able to take \ncare of the simple matter of paying the bills--again, something no \nfamily or business could get away with. But the Federal Government is \nguilty of fiscal mismanagement, once again, by failing to pass a single \nappropriations bill and sending it to the President.\n  What this is leading up to, as we all know--and this is no secret--is \nlikely pulling together all of the various appropriations bills, all 12 \nof them, or some combination of them, into an omnibus appropriation, \nwhich somebody told me the other day is Latin for ``watch your \nwallet.'' We are going to have a huge game of chicken between the \nPresident of the United States, who wields the veto pen, and the \nCongress over how much excessive spending Congress is going to be able \nto pass against the President's stated intention to veto excessive \nspending.\n  Again, this is not for the benefit of the American people; it is, \nrather, for partisan political benefit--a big game of chicken and \npotential Government shutdown because Congress isn't taking care of its \nbusiness and its fiscal house is in a state of disarray. The American \npeople are enormously skeptical, and they have every right to be given \nwhat I have described a moment ago. What they want us to do is quit the \npartisan game playing and trying to score points, and simply work \nthings out in the best interests of the American people, being \nrespectful of their tax dollars and not wasting 1 penny more than we \nmust.\n  This is especially true in the SCHIP program, the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, which I described. It is currently, again, on \na continuing resolution. It is currently in effect and not in any \ndanger whatsoever of coming to an end. There is bipartisan support for \nthe continuation of this successful program, if it is intended and does \naffect children of low incomes, up to 200 percent of poverty. There is \nnot a political consensus; indeed, there are those who object--and I am \none--to a radical expansion of this program to cover adults in 14 \nStates and to go up to, along with the Presidential waiver, 400 percent \nof the poverty level for a family of four making $82,000 a year. At \nthat level, for every two people added, one of them will get \nGovernment-subsidized health care by dropping their private health \ninsurance--an unhealthy development, to say the least.\n  Here again, Congress is up to its old tricks. It relies on an \nunsustainable funding stream, a regressive tax that hits low-income \nAmericans the hardest, and a budget gimmick that will demand that \neither Americans' taxes be raised by 2012 to continue the program or \nchildren will be dropped from the program.\n  I have a prediction to make. There is, as Ronald Reagan said, no such \nthing as a ``temporary'' Government program from the Federal \nGovernment. I believe he said that a temporary Government program in \nWashington is the closest thing we have to eternal life here on Earth. \nI think he has been proven right.\n  What I would hope that the leadership--Majority Leader Reid and \nSpeaker Pelosi--would do is sit down with Republicans and with the \nPresident and try to work out our differences. As I said, everybody \nsupports continuation of this program. I am willing to predict, without \nequivocation, that this program will continue; it will continue to help \npoor children--and it should--on a bipartisan basis. We should not have \na game of chicken where, as Leader Reid said and Speaker Pelosi said--\nSenate Majority Leader Reid said this:\n\n       If the President says let's sit down and talk about it, it \n     is something that is not going to happen.\n\n  He said that in Congress Daily on September 28, 2007. Later, he said \non that same day:\n\n       We have compromised all we are going to compromise.\n\n  What we see here is more political theater and partisan point \nscoring, as opposed to working together to try to find ways to resolve \nthis impasse. We can do it. It is strictly a matter of political will \nand, frankly, I think it is what the American people want us to do. \nThey are sick and tired of Congress being dysfunctional when it comes \nto meeting the very clear needs of the American people. I have \ndescribed some of them. But at least we can try to work out this SCHIP \nimpasse in a way that is fiscally responsible and meets the intended \ngoals of this important Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n  Today, a Gallup poll reported, for what it is worth, in USA Today \nthat 52 percent agreed with President Bush that most benefits should go \nto children and families earning less than 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, about $41,000 for a family of four. Only 40 percent in \nthe Gallup poll reported today in the USA Today said benefits should go \nto families earning up to $62,000. As I said, there is a provision for \na waiver that can go up even higher if, for example, President Clinton \nis in the White House after the next election.\n  The Gallup poll says 55 percent of those polled are very or somewhat \nconcerned that the program would create an incentive for families to \ndrop their private health insurance.\n  At a time when the American people are taxed at huge levels, you can \nsee that this chart says ``living essentials squeezed by Federal \ntaxes.'' The American wage earner has to work 120 days a year to pay \nall their State, local, and Federal taxes, while they work 62 days a \nyear to pay housing, 52 days a year for health care, 30 days for their \nfood, and 30 days for their transportation. But, again, it is 120 days \nto pay Uncle Sam and State and local taxes.\n  Should we not be taking care of our finances in a way that does not \npass a huge IOU down to our children and grandchildren that we will \nnever repay? Should we not quit robbing from the surpluses of Social \nSecurity and Medicare today rather than using that money to finance \nother programs? Should we not be eliminating ineffective programs or \nthose programs that have been rated as inconclusive in terms of whether \nthey are actually effective? Should we not take a more restrained \napproach to the growth of Government programs, including programs that \nhave worked, such as SCHIP?\n  Instead of a 140-percent increase and transforming it into something \nthat bears very little similarity to what Congress originally intended \nwhen they\n\n[[Page S12888]]\n\nstarted this program, should we not take a more restrained and careful \napproach?\n  Rather than drawing lines in the sand and threatening the termination \nof benefits of their health care to poor kids, shouldn't the majority \nleader, the Speaker of the House, the President of the United States, \nand the folks on the Republican side of the aisle sit down and try to \nwork it out?\n  As I said, everybody in Congress supports this program, virtually \nwithout exception. The only difference is between those who believe \nthis is an irresponsible, radical expansion of the program beyond \nrecognition, and one that others have offered--including me--is a \nreauthorization of the program designed to meet its original target, \nand that is poor and low-income kids.\n  I hope the leadership will listen and make a sincere attempt to try \nto meet in the middle on this. The children of this country will \nbenefit, and I think the American people will be enormously relieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for leading \nthe national dialog on health care. I think Americans expect us to \naddress this issue and not just fight about it, as the Senator from \nTexas has said.\n  This national discussion is bringing us to some agreement, at least. \nI think all of us have decided in Congress--or at least most of us--\nthat every American should have access to a health insurance policy \nthey can afford and own and keep. Where we disagree is how we get to \nthat point. I think the disagreement in this body goes to how we do \nthat. Do we do it more like Canada did, where we say, OK, everybody \nneeds to have insurance, so let's let the Government take it over; \nlet's have Government-run health care?\n  Some are saying the Canadian system works fine, until you talk to \ndoctors and patients from Canada and find out that every year the \nwaiting lines get longer, every year the program gets more expensive, \nand every year the health care is of less quality. So now the people in \nCanada who have the means come to the United States to get health care.\n  The reason we have had such good health care in the United States for \nmost of our history is that it has been done by private doctors working \nwith patients, hospitals that are independent of Government; our free \nenterprise system has worked to a great degree.\n  Government programs, such as Medicare and the program we are talking \nabout today, such as the children's health plan, have helped those in \nneed to buy health insurance and have access to health care. But for \nthe most part, Americans have resisted Government-run health care.\n  We do know in the early nineties there was an attempt to move totally \nto Government health care. When that failed, we were able to see that \nthe advocates of Government-run health care believed the best way to \nget to Government health care was to do it one step at a time with the \nchildren first because it is very hard to vote against expanding health \ncare for children.\n  Certainly, all children should have health care. They should have \nhealth insurance. But the fact is, every American should have health \ninsurance, and it is not good enough just to expand a Government \nprogram from covering poor kids to covering middle-class kids.\n  We do not need to mistake the fact that this is moving us toward \nGovernment health care. If my Democratic colleagues get their way on \nthis children's health bill, over 70 percent of the children in this \ncountry are going to have Government health care. What happens to them \nonce they become adults we have not discussed. We need to help every \nAmerican own a health insurance policy.\n  What Republicans want to do is continue this children's health plan, \nto add additional funding to cover inflation and additional children. \nWe have some good proposals. One of them, by Senator Martinez, would \ncontinue the program as it is but also offer tax credits to children \nand families who are 200 and 300 percent of poverty so they can buy \ntheir own insurance, believing that the best thing we can do for \nfamilies in this country is to help them have insurance they can \nafford, own, and keep.\n  There are other Republican proposals that we will be talking about \nthat include tax credits for every family who buys their own insurance. \nIt would also allow employers to give money to individuals to help buy \ntheir insurance. We do not do that now. Employers are not allowed to \ncontribute to an individual's health plan.\n  We also have proposals that would allow individuals to shop for \nhealth insurance all over the country. A lot of folks don't know that \nwe don't allow that now. You can only shop in your own State.\n  There is a proposal that would allow people who put tax-free money in \na health savings account to use that money to buy their own health \ninsurance plan. It is pretty amazing that as a Congress, we will not \nallow people to use their own health savings account to pay for health \ninsurance premiums. And there are proposals to allow small businesses \nto come together to buy health insurance that is less expensive than \nwhen they buy it individually.\n  There is a lot we can do as a Congress that does not cost taxpayers \nany money but would make it easier for individuals to have health \ninsurance they can afford, own, and keep.\n  I hope this debate will continue to open this issue in a way that \nAmericans can really understand. The goal is that everyone has \naffordable health insurance, good health insurance. The goal is not to \nturn more and more of our health care and health insurance over to the \nGovernment because we know that won't work, we know it is not \nefficient, and we know the children we are trying to help are \neventually going to have to pay the debt we put on their heads by \npaying for something we cannot afford.\n  The fact is, we can get better health insurance, better health care \nfor less money, if we do it with private health insurance just by \nhelping individuals buy health insurance they can afford, own, and \nkeep.\n  We started the national discussion on health care. I hope as we look \nat this debate, specifically children's health care, that we will see \nit as part of a larger issue and decide today that it is not good \nenough just to get a few more children insured.\n  Every American needs a health insurance policy, and we can do it, \nfirst of all, by taking down the barriers that Congress has put in \nfront of individuals when they are trying to buy their own insurance, \nbut we can also look at those in need. Whether it is tax credits or tax \ndeductions, we can help every American have a health insurance policy \nthey can afford, that they can keep from job to job and throughout \ntheir life. We can have better health care, and it is better for our \nfuture.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we pass lots of laws in the Congress of \nthe United States, and from time to time there is a byproduct of the \npassage of some of those laws. It is called the law of unintended \nconsequences. Such is the case with the Endangered Species Act.\n  In my State of Georgia, we are in a level 4, 100-year drought. As \nmany as 7 million citizens in my State are looking at the possibility \nof there being no drinking water in less than 120 days. Our State has \nimposed restrictions of every kind. Landscapers are out of business, \ncar washes are threatened, and there is no outdoor watering.\n  My home county of Cobb, in the last 14 days, has reduced, through \nconservation, water consumption by 20 percent.\n\n[[Page S12889]]\n\nI personally commend commission chairman Sam Owens and the entire North \nGeorgia Water Planning District for everything they are doing. But in \nthe absence of rain, there is nothing we can do.\n  Why does this affect the Endangered Species Act? Very simply because \na court case was filed a few years ago under the Endangered Species Act \nasking for the management of the Chattahoochee River basin to be \ncontrolled so as to protect sturgeon. The judge in that case finally \nruled as much and developed the judge's own interim operating plan for \nthe Chattahoochee River. That plan means the Corps of Engineers makes \nreleases to keep the flow in the Chattahoochee River where the sturgeon \nexist at a level sufficient to sustain the sturgeon. The problem is the \nlevel is insufficient to sustain human life in North Georgia if it \ncontinues.\n  This morning, just a few minutes ago, on behalf of myself and Senator \nChambliss, I introduced an amendment to the Endangered Species Act to \ndeal with this law of unintended consequences. It very simply says the \nfollowing: The head of the Army Corps of Engineers or the Governor of a \nState, within which a region lies where there is a drought that \nthreatens the health, safety, and welfare of the people in that region, \nmay suspend the course and effect of the Endangered Species Act until \nthat endangerment has passed.\n  It is a simple request. We are at a place in time in our country and \nin a region, my home region, the State I represent, where the health, \nsafety, and welfare of my people are threatened. They are threatened by \nan act this Congress passed that had no intention to threaten them. If \nwe have the power to do that, we also have the power to make the \nexception to see to it that their drinking water is safe and their \nlivelihood is safe and at hand.\n  This is a critical, critical emergency. It is time sensitive. I urge \neach Member of the Senate to follow this simple amendment and this \nsimple proposal and think about what they might do if it was their \nState, if it was their people. It is time we gave the Army Corps the \nlatitude and the Governors of the States the authority to protect our \npeople.\n  I stood in this Chamber 3 years ago and raised my right hand and \nagreed to defend the Constitution of the United States and protect the \ndomestic tranquility from enemies foreign and domestic. Today I stand \nrecognizing there is a domestic enemy, and that enemy is the Endangered \nSpecies Act which controls the Chattahoochee River and limits access to \ndrinking water and safe water for the people of north Georgia. I urge \nMembers of the Senate to join myself and Senator Chambliss in this \ncritical and important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Isakson \nfrom Georgia, in support of this legislation. Georgia is in a critical \ntime in the history of our State. Atlanta, GA, is a great place to \nlive, a great place to work, a great place to visit, but we are in a \ncrisis. The water supply system for metropolitan Atlanta depends on two \nbasins, Lake Altoona and Lake Lanier. Lake Altoona and Lake Lanier are \nfed by nature, by rainfall that every year, thus far in the history of \nthose basins, has filled those basins since they were built decades \nago.\n  Unfortunately, during the month of August, we received very little \nmoisture. But at the time we were receiving very little moisture, we \nhad more 100-degree day temperatures than we have ever had in the \nhistory of Atlanta. A combination of natural forces has put us in this \nsituation of crisis, but there is also an unnatural source that has \nhelped produce this crisis, and the legislation that Senator Isakson \nhas proposed, along with my cosponsorship, seeks to address this \ncritical problem and seeks to help find a solution to this problem for \nthe short term.\n  Georgia's lakes are low and continue to decline as the Army Corps of \nEngineers releases water to protect a handful of sturgeons and mussels \nin the Appalachicola Bay in the State of Florida. Understandably, folks \nwho have had mandatory water restrictions for months in our State, who \nare watching these lakes slowly decrease, are wondering where the \ncommon sense in Washington has gone. They are calling my office and \nasking: How can our Government care more about mussels and sturgeons \nthan human beings? Obviously, that is not the case. But water continues \nto be released, and estimates are that Lake Lanier, Atlanta's main \nsource of water, will be empty--and I repeat, will be empty--by January \n2008 if the Corps does not stop releasing so much water or if we do not \nget rainfall. That is less than 3 months away.\n  It is clear that we are in a crisis. We need to do something to \nensure we are not cutting off the drinking supply to 7 million people \nin the metropolitan Atlanta area. This legislation does something very \nsimple and practical to address this crisis in the short term. It says, \nif the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Governor of a \nState, determines that a drought is in effect in a region in which \nthere is a Federal river basin that is managed by the Corps of \nEngineers, and the drought threatens the health, safety, and welfare of \nthe human population in that region, the Secretary of the Army can \ntemporarily suspend provisions of the Endangered Species Act until such \ntime as the drought is over and the health, safety, and welfare of \nhumans is no longer at risk.\n  We have larger issues to address in the long term. Updating the water \ncontrol manuals by which the Corps of Engineers operates the river \nbasins in Georgia and getting the Governors of our neighboring States \ntogether to apportion the water among the States for the long term are \ncritical issues that have to be addressed.\n  As resources get scarce, these things become more difficult to \naccomplish. Unfortunately, the people of Georgia cannot wait. They need \nimmediate relief, and swift passage of this legislation will certainly \nhelp.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss two issues this morning \nthat I believe are important not only to Members of the Senate but \neverybody across America.\n  You cannot go home and visit your home State and talk to real \nfamilies and real businessmen and real workers without coming back \nfeeling that the No. 1 issue on their minds, after the war in Iraq, is \nhealth care. Time and again people tell us stories from their own \nlives, troubling, challenging stories about trying to find the best \nhealth care and pay for it. They are concerned about the cost of health \ninsurance. The cost of health insurance goes up every single year and \ncovers less each year. That is the real family squeeze in America.\n  It isn't just from families we hear these stories. We will learn the \nsame thing with businesses. Howard Schultz is a fellow I respect very \nmuch. He is a pretty prosperous man in America. A lot of us buy his \nproducts with frequency. Howard Schultz of Brooklyn, NY, now living in \nSeattle, is the owner of Starbucks. When he started a little company \nselling coffee, I don't know if he had any idea that someday he would \nhave 14,000 stores across America. But he knew if he started a company, \nthere was one thing he was going to do. He was going to guarantee \neverybody who worked in a Starbucks store had health insurance because \nhe had a personal experience after his father lost health insurance \nafter being laid off from a job, and he decided as a business leader \nthat he would take care of that issue.\n  So if you pay an extra 50 cents to a buck for that double, double \nskim latte, you are subsidizing the health insurance of the person \nmaking the coffee for you. I think it is a pretty good deal. It is a \ndeal I am willing to make regularly and do most mornings.\n  Howard Schultz said to me and Members of the Senate: I cannot keep up \nwith the cost of health insurance. The\n\n[[Page S12890]]\n\ncost keeps going up. I can't raise the cost of a cup of coffee to keep \nup with this. You have do something.\n\n  He told us this 2 years ago. I saw him recently. Same challenge, same \nissue--his business is trying to do the moral, conscientious thing to \ncover its employees, even part-time employees, and is having a tough \ntime.\n  Large corporations, like General Motors, finally struck a deal with \nUnited Auto Workers, and the biggest problem, the biggest challenge in \ntheir negotiation is what to do with the health insurance of employees \nand retirees.\n  So when you hear this over and over again, you think to yourself: \nWell, what is Congress going to do? And the answer is: Virtually \nnothing. There is no leadership in Washington. And it has to start in \nthe White House when it comes to health care reform, with one \nexception--an important exception.\n  Ten years ago, we said: With 40 million uninsured Americans--15 \nmillion being kids--it is time we provide health insurance for those \nuninsured children in America. It was a Republican Congress, but \nDemocrats supported it. That bipartisan bill passed; it was signed by \nthe President and went into effect.\n  In a span of 10 years, we moved from covering zero children to 6.6 \nmillion children, who were given help through their families to buy \nhealth insurance from private insurance companies. Mr. President, 6.6 \nmillion out of 15 million were covered--a bipartisan proposal that \nworked.\n  Now that law is about to expire. It is called the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. So we decided we needed to not only keep this \nprogram going, but we needed to expand it from 6.6 million kids to 10 \nmillion--or 10.5 million kids. Let's keep moving until every kid in \nAmerica, every child has health insurance. Well, we put together \nanother bipartisan proposal, brought together some very conservative \nRepublican Senators, such as Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Orrin Hatch of \nUtah, and many others, and said: Let's work out something in a \ncooperative way that extends this program responsibly. And we did it. \nWe ended up with an increase in the Federal tobacco tax and the \nrevenues dedicated to covering more children with health insurance. I \nlike that because more expensive tobacco products means fewer kids will \nbuy them. I like to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids until they \nbecome adults and can make a responsible decision about a product that \ncan lead to addiction and disease and death. So I like the tradeoff \nhere from a public health viewpoint.\n  We passed that bill extending the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--over 10 million to be covered--with 69 votes in the Senate. \nThat is pretty good here. We have these death-defying struggles and end \nup passing amendments by one or two votes, but we passed this by a big \nmargin and then sent it over to the House, and they passed it. It was \nthen sent to the President of the United States, where he had his \nchance to extend children's health insurance, and he vetoed the bill. \nHe said no. He said it is socialized medicine, too much government \ninvolved in it.\n  Well, I disagree with the President. First, this is insurance from \nprivate health insurance companies; it is not Government insurance. \nSecondly, this isn't socialism. What we are talking about is helping \nworking families. The poorest families in America and their children \nare already taken care of. We have Medicaid in every State in the \nUnion. The poorest kids have that. They have that Government health \ninsurance protection. And the kids of families where mom and dad get \nbenefits are already covered. It is the kids who fall in between, the \nkids of mothers and fathers who go to work every day and have no health \ninsurance, those are the kids we are trying to help. So this isn't \nabout poor people; this is about middle-income working families who \ndon't have health insurance at work.\n  What if you had to go out tomorrow and buy a health insurance plan \nfor your family. Assume your employer doesn't offer any benefits. What \nare you going to pay? Well, if you happen to have a pretty healthy \nfamily and you don't want a lot of coverage and you have a big \ndeductible and a big copay, you may get by for $600 a month. But if \nthere is a complication there--a sick child, your wife has had some \nproblems, you have had some problems--you know what happens to those \npremiums. Pretty soon, they are $800 a month, $1,000 a month, and \npeople who are making regular, middle-class incomes in America cannot \nafford them. That is the reality. So when someone in the White House \nsays we shouldn't be helping families making $60,000 a year to pay \nthese health insurance premiums, I think they are really out of touch \nwith reality.\n  This morning, two of my colleagues, Senator Cornyn of Texas and \nSenator DeMint of South Carolina, came to the floor to talk about \nhealth care. Good. We need more conversation. But we also need their \nsupport. They didn't support the passage of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. I wish they had. We really need to make this a \nbroader, bigger, bipartisan issue.\n  In just 2 days, the House of Representatives will try to override the \nPresident's veto. I don't know if they will make it. They need 15 \nRepublican Congressmen to switch over to override the President's veto \nto extend the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe they can't do \nit. If they fail, it means, at the end of the day, this program will \ncover fewer children in America. Is that our goal? I think our goal \nshould be the other way. We need to reach a point where everybody in \nAmerica has the peace of mind of health insurance.\n  I am lucky. As a Member of the Senate and a Congressman, I get to \nenroll, as other colleagues do, in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. This is a great deal. For 8 million Federal employees \nand their families, we get to choose open enrollment every year--in my \ncase, for my wife and myself, from nine different private health \ninsurance plans offered in my home State of Illinois. Nine choices. It \nis like shopping for a car, my friends: if I don't like last year's \nmodel, I am trading in for a new model. I can go to a new company. Now, \nthis is something most Americans would dream of, to have that kind of \nopportunity. It is available to me as a Federal employee.\n\n  Shouldn't every American have that peace of mind? Shouldn't we all \nunderstand that if you go to work every day, and you love your family, \nthat you ought to be able to provide them the protection of health \ninsurance? For 47 million Americans, the answer is no, they do not have \nit. For 9 million kids out of that 47 million across America, they have \nno health insurance.\n  A child without health insurance is a child without a regular doctor, \na child without regular checkups, a child who may not get the \nimmunizations they need. That is what kids face when they do not have a \nmedical home, or a health insurance policy. I need not tell you what \nhappens when a medical disaster strikes a family like that. It becomes \noverwhelming. It can bankrupt a family that thinks it is in a pretty \ncomfortable situation.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the Senate and in the House, on both sides \nof the aisle, to get together. There has to be some common ground here. \nI thought children's health insurance was a great place to start. I \nhope the House will override President Bush's veto. I think the \nPresident is out of touch with working families in America and the \nreality of the challenge they face with health insurance. So I hope \nthat we can override his veto, that we can extend this program and \ncover many children today who don't have protection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12890-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12890-S12891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF STEVEN BRADBURY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwill hold hearings on the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be \nAttorney General. I look forward to those hearings and hope to ask some \nquestions about his plans--if he, in fact, is confirmed as our next \nAttorney General--to repair some of the damage that has been done at \nthe Justice Department. I am concerned that progress really isn't going \nto be possible without some significant changes there. In particular, I \nthink we need new leadership at the Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel.\n  Today, I am joined by Senators Ted Kennedy and Russ Feingold in \nsending a letter to President Bush calling on him to withdraw the \nnomination of\n\n[[Page S12891]]\n\nSteven Bradbury to be head of the Office of Legal Counsel and to submit \nanother nominee.\n  The OLC--the Office of Legal Counsel--is a small office. Most people \ndon't even know it exists. But it really has a lot of power, especially \nin this administration. Their legal opinions are binding on the \nexecutive branch of Government.\n  In August of 2002, OLC issued the infamous torture memo. This memo \nnarrowly defined torture as limited only to abuse that causes pain \nequivalent to organ failure or death. It also concluded the President \nhas the right as Commander in Chief to ignore the torture statute--the \nlaw of the land--which makes torture a crime. This memo was the \nofficial Bush administration policy for over 2 years. This was a memo \nproduced by the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Jay Bybee, who was then head of that office, signed the torture memo. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Bybee was confirmed to a lifetime appointment as \njudge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before Congress and the \nAmerican people learned about this infamous torture memo.\n  Jack Goldsmith succeeded Jay Bybee as head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel. We only recently learned about the critical role Mr. Goldsmith \nplayed. As head of the office, he revoked the misguided Office of Legal \nCounsel opinions regarding warrantless surveillance.\n  Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey has emerged as an almost heroic \nfigure time and again as we have learned of his role in the Justice \nDepartment under Attorneys General Ashcroft and Gonzales. Mr. Comey \nsupported Mr. Goldsmith's actions. This led to the infamous showdown at \nthe bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft where White House Chief \nof Staff Andrew Card and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then \nWhite House Counsel, tried to strong-arm Mr. Ashcroft into overruling \nMr. Goldsmith.\n  In June 2004, Mr. Goldsmith revoked the Bybee torture memo. Shortly \nafterward, he left the Justice Department.\n  In 2005, President Bush nominated Steven Bradbury to succeed him. He \nhas been the de facto head of the Office of Legal Counsel for over 2 \nyears.\n  During the confirmation process, Mr. Bradbury has refused to answer \nquestions from Judiciary Committee members regarding torture.\n  In November 2005, I initially objected to Mr. Bradbury's nomination, \nand I said:\n\n       Mr. Bradbury is currently the acting head of the Office of \n     Legal Counsel. In this capacity, he approves Justice \n     Department legal opinions. Since the Justice Department \n     refuses to provide us with OLC opinions on interrogation \n     techniques, we do not know enough where Mr. Bradbury stands \n     on the issue of torture. What we do know is troubling. Mr. \n     Bradbury refuses to repudiate un-American and inhumane \n     tactics, such as waterboarding, mock execution, and \n     physically beating detainees.\n\n  There are also seriously unresolved questions about Mr. Bradbury's \nrole in the NSA warrantless surveillance programs. Last year, the \nJustice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility opened an \ninvestigation into the conduct of the Justice Department attorneys who \nauthorized the NSA program. In an unprecedented move, President Bush \npersonally denied security clearances to the Justice Department \ninvestigators, effectively blocking the investigation. Documents \nprovided to the Senate Judiciary Committee suggest that this internal \ninvestigation was looking into whether OLC engaged in misconduct while \nMr. Bradbury was acting head of OLC.\n\n  In August 2006, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feingold, and I sent a \nletter to President Bush calling for him to allow an internal \ninvestigation relative to this issue. We have not received a response.\n  Recent reports regarding Mr. Bradbury's involvement in approving the \nlegality of abusive interrogation techniques provide further evidence \nof his unsuitability. According to an October 4 article in The New York \nTimes, Mr. Bradbury signed two OLC legal opinions approving the \nlegality of abusive interrogation techniques.\n  Mr. Bradbury reportedly authored an opinion on so-called ``combined \neffects,'' which authorized the CIA to use multiple abusive \ninterrogation techniques in combination. According to The Times, then-\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales approved this opinion over the \nobjections of then-Deputy Attorney General Comey, who said the Justice \nDepartment would be ``ashamed'' if the memo became public.\n  The Times also reports that Mr. Bradbury authored and Alberto \nGonzales approved an OLC opinion concluding that abusive interrogation \ntechniques such as waterboarding do not constitute cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment. This opinion was apparently designed to circumvent \nthe McCain Torture Amendment, then being considered by Congress, which \nclarified that such treatment is absolutely prohibited.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of turning the floor over to my \ncolleague from North Dakota, I will not read this entire statement, but \nI do wish to tell you that I believe the cumulative evidence against \nMr. Bradbury raises serious questions as to whether he should even \ncontinue in this interim capacity as head of the Justice Department's \nOffice of Legal Counsel.\n  We are not asking the President to nominate some Democrat for the \nposition. We don't expect that. But we ask him to nominate someone with \nprofessional integrity who can restore the morale of this Department \nand the luster which should be part of this important office. Jack \nGoldsmith describes himself as a conservative Republican, but he stood \nup to a White House when it came to issues of torture and warrantless \nsurveillance.\n  I urge the President to withdraw Steven Bradbury's nomination and \nsubmit another nominee for Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \nLegal Counsel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If anybody thinks they should \nnap through this or sleep through this vulnerability, they are dead \nwrong because 60 percent of the oil we need in this country and use \nevery day we get from outside of our country. We stick little straws in \nthis planet of ours and suck oil out. We suck out about 84 million \nbarrels of oil every single day. We use one-fourth of that in this \ncountry every day, or about 21 to 22 million barrels of oil. So of all \nthe oil we suck out of this planet every day, we use one fourth of it \njust in this little space called the United States of America.\n  The problem with using one fourth of it is that 60 percent of that \noil which we use comes from other countries, much of it from troubled \nparts of the world, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Venezuela. \nWell, if tomorrow, God forbid, somehow the import of oil into this \ncountry were interrupted, we would be flat on our back economically.\n  We get up in the morning and just take it all for granted. We get up, \nwe get out of bed and rub our eyes, then flick a switch, and the lights \ngo on. We get in the car, turn the key, and the engine starts. We take \nit all for granted. But what happens at some point if we shut off the \npetroleum, shut off the electricity, and see what life is like, see \nwhat our economy is like?\n  So we decided to do something about that. If we are unbelievably \ndependent on and vulnerable when it comes to foreign oil, what do we \ndo? We begin to produce energy in our farm fields.\n  We produce biofuels. That is not a new thing. It has been around over \na century. I was at a biodiesel plant the other day. It was a grand \nopening. I pointed out there that the first known use of vegetable oil \nas fuel for a diesel engine was a demonstration at the World's Fair in \nthe year 1900. Rudolf\n\n[[Page S12892]]\n\nDiesel later experimented with fuel made from peanut oil or biodiesel \nfor engines he was developing. So this is not new.\n  All of a sudden our country has decided we should produce biofuels--\nethanol, for example--and we have begun to do that. Oil companies don't \nlike it very much. The OPEC countries don't like it very much. The last \nthing they want to see is for us to begin to produce not only the \nfossil fuels in our country, including oil and natural gas, but also \nbiofuels and the renewable energy that can grow in our farm fields. We \ncan take a kernel of corn, and from that kernel of corn with various \nprocesses produce fuel that will substitute for fuel oil we now get \nfrom troubled parts of the world. That makes a lot of sense to me.\n  We use about 140 billion gallons or 145 billion gallons of fuel a \nyear. If every single gallon of fuel were blended with ethanol, our \ntotal market for ethanol would be about 14.5 billion gallons. The \nPresident says let's go to 35 billion gallons. I agree with that. So do \nmost of my colleagues. The Senate has already voted on a bill to \nproduce 36 billion gallons. But how are we going to use 36 billion \ngallons if we are only blending ethanol at 10 percent? We have to have \nthe E85 pumps. They are producing flex-fuel vehicles in Detroit now, \nand they have said they are going to get to 50 percent of all the \nvehicles they produce being flex-fuel vehicles so we can run a fuel \nthat is 85 percent ethanol. E85 they call it.\n  You might have a flex-fuel vehicle right now--in my State there are \nabout 16,000 to 18,000 flex-fuel vehicles--and there are 23 places in \nthe entire State where you can pull up to a pump and get E85.\n  In California there are over 270,000 flex-fuel vehicles, and there is \none reported gasoline pump in the entire State of California that pumps \nE85. Think of that, one pump.\n  Let me describe what some of the obstacles are. I have long been \nconcerned if we are going to produce ethanol--and we should and we \nmust--we have to not only produce it, we have to market it. We have to \nproduce it, then we have to run it through the carburetors and fuel \ninjectors of vehicles. If we don't have the market, that whole industry \ncollapses.\n  Let me give some examples of why we don't have more E85 pumps. No. 1, \nwe have some folks in here who want to produce ethanol and support all \nthat, but they don't support any kind of mandate that would require \nthat we have an infrastructure out there to actually use the ethanol. \nWe are now starting to see the results of that. Let me describe that \nwith an article in the Wall Street Journal: ``Fill Up With Ethanol? One \nObstacle Is Big Oil.'' April 2, this year:\n\n       Oil companies employ a variety of tactics that help keep \n     the E85 fuel out of the stations that bear the company name. \n     For instance, franchisees are sometimes required to purchase \n     all the fuel they will sell from the oil company. Since oil \n     companies generally don't sell E85\n\n  That is, 85 percent ethanol that you would use in a flex fuel \nvehicle--\n\n     the station can't either.\n\n  Let me describe some of the ways the major brand retailers are trying \nto prevent the widespread marketing of ethanol. ExxonMobil and BP \nrequire their franchise stations--and this is directly from the Wall \nStreet Journal article--require their franchise stations to buy fuel \nexclusively from them. Neither company offers E85. So the station \nowners must apply for an exception if they wish to sell E85, or 85 \npercent ethanol.\n\n       A ConocoPhillips memo to franchisees says the company \n     doesn't allow E85 sales on the primary island, under the \n     covered canopy where gasoline is sold. Stations must find \n     another spot. As a result, it isn't quite as simple for a \n     driver to decide on the spur of the moment to fill up with \n     E85.\n\n  ConocoPhillips says you can't market E85 with the same bank of pumps \non the same island.\n\n       Chevron says it requires Chevron-Texaco branded stations to \n     keep E85 off their primary signs listing fuel prices. To show \n     the fuel's price, and alert approaching drivers that E85 is \n     for sale, the stations have to erect a separate sign.\n\n  BP will not allow its franchisees to offer payment by credit card for \nE85.\n  Does anybody see a pattern? These companies sell oil and gas. I want \nthem to do well. But I hope they want our country to do well at the \nsame time. Our country will do well by becoming less dependent on the \nKuwaitis and Saudis, the Venezuelans. And we do that by expanding our \nsupply of renewable energy.\n  Guess what. These companies say we are not interested in that. That \nis not our product. So, by the way, we have 170,000 gasoline stations \nin our country, about 170,000 gas stations on every corner of this \ncountry, virtually, and 1,200 of them have E85 pumps. There are 170,000 \nplaces you can pull up to buy gasoline, and 1,200 of them have E85.\n  If you drive a flex-fuel vehicle and you can run it on 85 percent \nethanol--that is the way they sell the vehicle, you can run on either \ngasoline or 85 percent ethanol--and you want to choose one of 170,000 \ngas stations in this country, 168,800 or so are not going to have E85.\n  Assistant Secretary Andrew Karsner, who is the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the Department \nof Energy, said at a hearing I chaired earlier this year that last year \nwe installed around 450 E85 pumps across the entire country. As I \ncalculate it, if we continue to install 450 E85 pumps a year, that \nmeans in about 100 years we will have almost 50,000 pumps, or in less \nthan one-third of the stations where they are selling gas.\n\n  My point is simple. I see these stories in the Wall Street Journal \nand the New York Times. I know, based on what is reported, what the \nmajor oil companies are doing. It is not just setting ethanol up for \nfailure, it is setting this country up for failure. We cannot move from \n60 percent dependence on foreign oil to 69 percent dependence on \nforeign oil, and that is where the experts say we are headed.\n  If we don't find a way to be less dependent on foreign oil, this \ncountry is in trouble. How do we become less dependent? We expand our \nopportunities for renewable energy, including ethanol. But if we do \nthat, and when we do that, we are set up for failure if the 170,000 gas \nstations across this country have decided: You can't advertise E85. You \nhave to erect a separate sign. You can't sell E85 at our franchise, we \nwill not allow it. You can't pump it at the main island where you pump \nother gasoline, we will not allow it. With that sort of thing, it sets \nthis country up for failure, in my judgment.\n  What should we do about it? The Energy bill we moved through the \nSenate recently was an Energy bill that provides some grant programs--\nnot nearly enough--some grant programs to help some service stations \ninstall biofuels pumps. We are going to need to pump E85 percent \nethanol. We are going to need to have blend pumps that blend 30 \npercent, 40 percent, and 50 percent blends of ethanol and gasoline. We \nhave to do all these things if this country is determined to move in a \ndirection that makes us less dependent on foreign oil.\n  But our country, it seems to me, is willing to sit back, and Congress \nis willing to sit back and say: Whatever happens.\n  We have to make things happen. An infrastructure bill that says if we \nare going to produce biofuels--and we are, and if we are going to \naspire to get 36 billion gallons of biofuels--and we should, then you \nhave to have a plan by which you market that. If you produce it and \ndon't market it, the market for that particular energy collapses, and \nit will set us back decades.\n  What should we do? We should, in my judgment, as we move this Energy \nbill, have an infrastructure provision in the Energy bill that is \nstrong, assertive, bold, and moves in the right direction and sets up a \ncircumstance where either this happens by the market system or you have \nmandates.\n  I know nobody likes mandates. But if we are going to be less \ndependent on foreign oil, we have to find a way to make this happen and \nmake this work. I believe we have an opportunity to do something good \nfor this country. We can just sit back and exhibit a posture somewhere \nbetween day dreaming and thumb sucking and just act as if we are \nthumbing our suspenders, smoking our cigars, and saying: Ain't it a \ngood life? We are 60 percent on foreign oil. Ain't it a shame ethanol \ndon't work somehow? I know you can't find it down at the local service \nstation because they will not let them market it down there. Ain't it a \nshame?\n  It is not going to be a good life if we find someday we don't have \nthis energy\n\n[[Page S12893]]\n\ncoming in, with 60 percent coming from offshore, and it is not going to \nbe just a shame, it is going to be a catastrophe for this country if we \ndon't put in place the infrastructure to expand our opportunities to \nproduce renewable energy in this country and therefore make us less \ndependent on sources of foreign oil.\n  We are going to use our fossil fuels. I support the production of \ndomestic oil and natural gas. I support the continued use of our coal. \nI increased the President's request by 30 percent for the fossil fuels \naccount, in the appropriations bill that is written in the Energy and \nWater Development Appropriations Subcommittee that I chair. The \nPresident talks a lot about this stuff, but he doesn't commit himself \nto it. I increased by 30 percent his fossil fuels account. Why? Because \ncoal is our most abundant resource. We are going to have to use it. The \nquestion is not whether, it is when we use it, and how. We ought to \ninvest in the research and technology to allow us to use coal in zero \nemissions plants. I believe we can do that. We can't do this with the \nbaby steps coming from this President. He wants to just baby-step \nalong; a little money here, a little money there. If we are going to \nmake a commitment to use our fossil fuels, we have to make that \ncommitment. But even as we do that, much more needs to be done to deal \nwith the renewable side. We can't at the same time try to advance the \ninterests of fossil fuels in a way that does not contribute to climate \nchange and then say we are going to ignore the renewable side. We have \nto do both. We have to use the research and the capability of \ntechnology to unlock our opportunity to continue to use fossil fuels, \nbut then we have to commit ourselves--our country has to commit itself \nto renewable energy and to the ethanol and biofuels industry.\n  The reason I wanted to make this point is, I saw last evening on \n``NBC News'' a big feature story about this subject. I saw it in the \nNew York Times. I saw it in the Wall Street Journal.\n  You ought not be surprised. I mean, bowl me over? The major gasoline \ncompanies do not want to sell E85 because they believe it competes with \nthem? The fact is, what competes with them is the solution to making us \nless dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  It is unbelievable to me that we have this little planet of ours. We \ncircle the Sun, we have 6.4 billion neighborhoods, and half of them \nhave never made a telephone call, half live on less than $2 a day, and \nwe end up on this little spot called the United States. Our lifestyle \nis pretty unbelievable. What we have built is special. But we are \nprodigious consumers of energy, and now we have worked ourselves into a \nposition where we use so much energy in the form of oil from outside of \nour country, and so much of it comes from very troubled areas of the \nworld, that if we do not in a sober way understand our responsibility \nto address that, shame on us; and our future will not be very bright.\n  This is not just some other issue. This is a big issue. The standard \nof living in this country rests on the issue of our being able to \nprovide the energy. The quality of life in this country rests on our \nability to get the energy and produce the energy and acquire the \nenergy, even as we protect the airshed with respect to climate change. \nAll of that is important.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an important issue. I am going to work \nwith my colleagues. Hopefully, we can get an Energy bill, and when we \nget this Energy bill we will get this resolved in the right way.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12893-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12893-S12894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CHINA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't have enough time, but I want to show my \ncolleagues something I find absolutely fascinating. Let me suggest on a \ndifferent subject I will consume the 3.5 minutes.\n  This is the Nail House. This house is in the middle of a whole dug-\nout excavation area. This is in China. The Chinese Government, the \ndevelopers, decided we are going to go in, and we are clearing this \nwhole place out. One family said: No, you can't do that to me. It is \nnot legal. It is not fair. We are not going to move. So they came in \nand excavated around the entire house. Here is the little house in \nChina.\n  I tell you that because we just released, last week, the Congress \nExecutive Commission on China Annual Report. It is the 2007 annual \nreport. I am a cochairman, Sandy Levin, Congressman Sandy Levin, is the \nchairman. I am the cochairman of the Congressional Executive Commission \non China. This describes a whole series of things on China, those who \nare in prison today in China as a result of advocating for human rights \nand other related issues.\n  I will tell this story about the Nail House. They call it the Nail \nHouse because it is stuck right up out of the excavation. The story did \nnot have such a happy ending for the Nail House. The Chinese, \neventually--they must have thought this was funny, the Chinese \nauthorities, by digging around this fellow's house--but they eventually \ncame in and tore the whole thing down and this property was lost. It is \npretty hard to take on the Chinese Government.\n  But one of the things in this report we talk about is what is \nhappening with technology in China, and the ability, outside of the \npurview of the Communist Government, to control everything; the ability \nof people to communicate.\n  Now, the Chinese have thousands of thought police trying to figure \nout who is visiting the Internet and trying to prevent them from \nvisiting certain sites on the Internet. But there is a trend that is \ngoing on in China that is very interesting. Internet use rose from \n620,000 in the last 10 years, 620,000, to 160 million Internet users.\n  Mobile phone ownership went from 3 million to 500 million in the last \n12 years, 500 million. China has an estimated 20 million blogs, where \npeople are talking among bloggers' personalized Web pages. In the \nentire year of 2003, about 4 years ago, the Chinese people sent 137 \nbillion text messages.\n  Now, I tell you all of that because I think it is going to change \nthings in China. Part of this China Executive Commission is trying to \nunderstand what is happening in China. What does that mean for our \nfuture? But there are some striking examples of citizen activism these \ndays which are very interesting. This is one, the ``nail house,'' this \nfamily, that did not end so well.\n  But the local officials ignored the mass complaints. But what \nhappened was this picture was on all of the blogs in China, it stirred \nup a hornet's nest of people willing to demonstrate in the streets on \nbehalf of this family.\n  But there is one other issue, chemical factory protests in the \nsoutheast corner of Xiamen. The local government planned to build a \nhazardous chemical plant near the center of town. They publicized the \ninformation on Web sites and blogs, and citizens responded by \noverwhelming the local Chinese officials with a million text messages. \nLater they used blogs and text messages. They organized massive \nprotests and marches that attracted thousands, and finally the local \nofficials suspended the building of a chemical factory in the middle of \nXiamen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Another use of the Internet in China was on a slave labor \nscandal. In May and June of this year, citizen activists broke open a \nscandal that rocked China. Thousands of brick kilns were using kidnaped \nslave labor. They were men, boys, mentally ill, forced to work under \nheavy guard, often with no pay and very little food.\n  Parents looking for their missing sons organized on the Internet in \nChina, and they were pleading for Government assistance. They were \nforced to cover the story in the Chinese press because there was such a \nmass uprising here. Finally, the Chinese Prime Minister ordered an \ninvestigation. Five hundred workers were freed. One hundred sixty \npeople who ran the kilns were arrested. Very few party officials were \nseriously punished.\n  But the point is, things are changing. The technology is changing in \nChina. The Burmese monks protest, the activism continues right up to \ntoday. While the Chinese Government is attempting to shut down this \nopen and free communications with the thought police, they have got \nthousands of people trying to regulate Internet use, the fact is, it is \nnot working, and technology and communications are having a profound \nimpact and I believe will continue to have a significant impact in\n\n[[Page S12894]]\n\nthe future. But I would say to my colleagues, we have some very skilled \npeople who have worked with Congressman Levin and myself on the \nCongressional Executive Commission on China, the Annual Report, 2007.\n  We have the most complete list of those who are being held prisoner \nin China, particularly as a result of human rights issues. This \nbooklet, if you have a chance to read it, is a great description put \ntogether by some very skilled people on exactly what is happening in \nChina.\n  There is some progress, and there are areas that are of great \nconcern. We continue to monitor and work on these issues.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3286) is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds made available under the \n Act may be used to circumvent any statutory or administrative formula-\n driven or competitive awarding process to award funds to a project in \n    response to a request from a member of Congress, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 97, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 528.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be used to circumvent any statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive awarding process to award funds \n     to a project in response to a request from a Member of \n     Congress (or any employee of a Member or committee of \n     Congress), unless the specific project has been disclosed in \n     accordance with the rules of the Senate or House of \n     Representatives, as applicable.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I actually have two amendments this \nmorning. I will speak briefly on both of them.\n  I believe both sides have agreed these are good ideas, and I believe \none will be accepted, and the other we are going to have a vote at 12, \nas I understand it.\n  But the first amendment relates to earmarking and the wasteful \nearmarks we have talked about often on the Senate floor. Much has been \ndone to make earmarks more transparent, to have more earmarks \ndisclosed.\n  I think as we do that, we are probably getting a better focus as a \nFederal Government of how we should be spending our money. But old \nhabits die very hard. It has been very difficult for a number of \nMembers of the House and the Senate to give up this practice of being \nable to send money wherever they want back in their own State or \nanywhere in the country.\n  As we have made it harder to do earmarks in the open, we have found \nthat a number of Members of Congress or their staffs have been calling \nagencies to request that earmarks be done without Congress's approval \nat all. This type of ``phone marking'' has created a new loophole.\n  This amendment we are offering would disallow any use of funds for \nthat type of earmarking. If I can read the amendment it is very simple. \nAgain, I believe both sides agree on it.\n  It says:\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be used \n     to circumvent any statutory or administrative formula-driven \n     competitive awarding process to award funds to a project in \n     response to a request from a Member of Congress (or any \n     employee of a Member or committee of Congress), unless the \n     specific project has been disclosed in accordance with the \n     rules of the Senate or House of Representatives, as \n     applicable.\n\n  That is all there is to this amendment, is to disallow this whole \nidea of picking up the phone and deciding where taxpayer money should \ngo. I understand the other side is prepared to accept or have a voice \nvote on this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the spirit of \nreform of the Senator from South Carolina. We too support the spirit of \nreform on these matters. I support this amendment. I do believe we can \naccept it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3286) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3289\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the\n\n[[Page S12895]]\n\npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3289.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3289.\n\n  Mr. DeMint. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent Federal employees from purchasing unnecessary \nfirst class or premium class airline tickets at taxpayers' expense, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       On page 97, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 528.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be used to purchase first class or premium airline travel \n     that would not be consistent with sections 301-10.123 and \n     301-10.124 of title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this is another simple amendment designed \nto get more accountability in Federal agencies. The Government \nAccountability Office recently published a report that has been in the \nmedia all over the country, pointing out that millions of taxpayer \ndollars are being wasted as employees of the Federal Government are \nflying all over the world in premium business class or first class, \nwhen the rules of these agencies specifically say that should not be \ndone.\n  My amendment does not change any rules of the Federal agencies; it \nsays the rules have to be complied with or the money that is in this \nbill cannot be used.\n  I will read this amendment as well:\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be used \n     to purchase first class or premium airline travel that would \n     not be consistent [with the number of sections that are \n     listed] of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Again, we are not changing any regulation. We are demanding that the \nFederal agencies comply with their own rules and save the taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at noon \ntoday the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the DeMint amendment \nNo. 3289 and that no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote and that the time until then be equally divided between \nSenator DeMint, Senator Shelby, and myself, Senator Mikulski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I neglected to add a cosponsor of this \namendment. Senator McCaskill would like to be our lead cosponsor on \nthis amendment. I appreciate her support as well as the chairman's.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know I rise in \nsupport of the DeMint amendment. I think it is a very commonsense \namendment. I believe that when we are regulating how Government \nemployees travel, I do believe they follow the rules. I do not believe \nthey travel in a lavish lifestyle.\n  I wish to acknowledge the fact of two things: One, our colleague from \nSouth Carolina has a GAO report that indicates reform is needed; reform \nand clarity are needed on what our Government employees, traveling on \nofficial business, can do.\n  We have heard all kinds of stories about some going on business \nclass, some going on first class, some where it is even short trips, \nand so on. We acknowledge, of course, as always, the validity of the \nGAO report. What I also want to say is this subcommittee, chaired by \nmyself and my ranking member, Senator Shelby, is on the side of reform. \nOur three themes this year were security for our country, innovation to \nkeep us competitive, and, at the same time, accountability. We have \ndone a major set of reviews on things such as cost overruns in the NOAA \nsatellite program. We have also taken on things where we offered an \namendment together dealing with discipline in the funding of \nconferences. We stopped the lavish conferences, the so-called $4 \nSwedish meatball amendment.\n  We believe the DeMint amendment is also in that same spirit of reform \nSenator Shelby and I brought to this subcommittee and we now bring with \nour bill to the floor. We are deep down reformers. We want to make sure \nwe accomplish the mission of the agencies for which we are the \nguardians of the purse. But at the same time, we want to make sure \ntaxpayers are getting value for their dollar. Where there is excess, \npoor judgment, or poor management, we are going to hold agencies to the \nfire. We are going to hold agencies accountable. Therefore, when this \nvote is taken, I urge, in the spirit of reform, the spirit of \naccountability, that we join, once again, on a bipartisan basis and \npass this amendment. We so appreciate the work of the GAO, a wonderful \nindependent watchdog that Congress can turn to where it is not the \nSenator from South Carolina's opinion or the opinion of the Senator \nfrom Maryland about what is going on or the need for reform, but we \nwork on clearheaded analysis, intellectual rigor, let the facts speak \nfor themselves.\n  When you look at this GAO report, the facts do point to the fact that \nwe do need reform in this area. I am a supporter, but I also want to \nacknowledge, though we need reform, I want to clearly state that most \ncivil servants follow the rules when they book their tickets on \nGovernment travel. It ensures that these employees follow current \nregulations that will limit the purchase of first-class tickets.\n  In the spirit of accountability, reform, and responsibility for the \ntaxpayers, again, I thank Senator Shelby for his work. We have made a \nlot of progress on the spirit of reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from South Carolina, \nMr. DeMint, for his amendment dealing with travel and spending. If we \ncan save millions of dollars by people not flying first class, and so \nforth, and abusing the system, we ought to do it. The spirit of this \namendment is good and I hope we can all vote on that at 12 noon, when \nwe have agreed to do so. I commend him for offering the amendment. It \nwill be good law for us to follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside and that I may call up a couple of \namendments and talk for 3 or 4 minutes on them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3294 and 3295, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up en bloc amendments Nos. 3294 and \n3295.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes amendments en \n     bloc numbered 3294 and 3295.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendments be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3294\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the United States Marshals Service to \nensure full funding for the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act \n of 2006 and offset the increase by reducing funding for the Advanced \n                          Technology Program)\n\n       On page 33, line 26, strike the period and insert ``: \n     Provided further, That an additional $7,845,000 shall be \n     available to carry out the Adam Walsh Child Protection and \n     Safety Act of 2006 offset by a reduction in the amount \n     available for the Advanced Technology Program under the \n     heading `Industrial Technology Services' in title I of \n     $7,845,000.''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3295\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance \n   Program and offset the increase by reducing funding Nasa funding)\n\n       On page 53, line 11, strike the semicolon and insert ``:  \n     Provided, That an additional $150,000,000 shall be available \n     for such program offset by a reduction in the amount\n\n[[Page S12896]]\n\n     under the heading `National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration'  `science, aeronautics and exploration' in \n     title III of $150,000,000;''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, amendment No. 3295 is to increase by $150 \nmillion the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program and offset it with \na $150 million decrease in the NASA budget currently in the bill. The \nNASA budget was increased $150 million over the President's request in \nthe underlying bill and then an emergency spending of an additional \nbillion dollars which was, by the way, already from over a billion \ndollars more than in the bill last year. We are taking $150 million of \nthat and putting it toward this program that is underfunded every year. \nIt is to assist the States in prosecuting and arresting people who are \nhere illegally who have committed crimes.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. We don't have enough money \nfor correctional officer salary costs for incarcerating undocumented \ncriminal aliens, and this amount of money, especially for the border \nStates of the Southwest, is very important.\n  It might be drug programs people who are here illegally are running. \nI was watching a program the other day that was talking about cheese \nheroin, something that can addict our children with one dose. Kids have \ndied. I think there are 30 or 40 of them who have died in Texas \nliterally with one dose. Most of that is coming from our southern \nborder. We need to provide local law enforcement the resources to deal \nwith aliens who are coming to this country who are dealing with the \ndrug program. This is an important problem that we need to add extra \nfunding to. We still have a problem with illegal immigration in \nsecuring our borders, but without a comprehensive immigration bill, we \nat least need to add money so we can help the States prosecute and \nincarcerate people who are here illegally, undocumented criminal aliens \nwho are here illegally who are wreaking havoc on communities around the \nUnited States. I believe this is an important amendment. It is critical \nthat we help our States, counties, local parishes, tribal, and \nmunicipal governments battle illegal immigration and keep law-breaking \nillegal aliens off our streets.\n  The second amendment is an amendment that will fully fund the Adam \nWalsh program. We all know what the Adam Walsh Child Protection Safety \nAct has done. This will fund it up to the President's request. It is \n$7.8 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to fully implement the Adam \nWalsh Child Protection Safety Act. We are taking the money from the ATP \nprogram. I believe it is absolutely critical that we fully fund the \nAdam Walsh Child Protection Safety Act. As a father of three children, \nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection Act is critical to keeping the children \nsafe. It is a small amount of money, but it will bring the program up \nto what the President has requested. It is an important program. The \nadvanced technology program has been something of questionable \nefficacy. We should take some of that money and fully fund the Adam \nWalsh Child Safety Act of 2006.\n  Having briefly spoken, I can speak on it more later. I know there is \nother business to attend to, but I think these are both very important \namendments. I hope my colleagues will support them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from \nNevada, both on process as well as content. I believe, with the \nconcurrence of Senator Shelby, that there is one of the amendments we \nmight be able to take, and then the other, of course, would be a vote \nin which we would move to table the amendment after lunch. But if I \ncould respond to the Senator from Nevada in terms of content, where he \nwishes to increase funding for the Marshals Service for the full \nfunding of the Adam Walsh Protection and Safety Act, we acknowledge the \nvalidity of the concerns of the Senator from Nevada in this regard. The \nSenator and I have been involved in a group where we are trying to put \nour values into action. The Senator might recall my own background is \nthat of a social worker. I was a child abuse worker. I find that there \nis nothing more despicable than a child predator. I believe it is so \ndastardly, so despicable, so repugnant that every time I think about \nthe work Adam Walsh did, the work that comes out of our excellent bill \nwith our funding, we know we always want to do more when our children \nare stalked in neighborhoods or playgrounds. We know they are being \nstalked on the Internet. Without going into putting even more vile \nthings out there in conversation, the Senator from Nevada is well aware \nof some of the most awful things that are going on on the Internet. We \nwant to acknowledge the validity of what he wants to do.\n  I know the Senator from Alabama wishes to speak on it, but we believe \nwe could take this amendment. I know the Senator will want to speak \nabout it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator from Maryland yield briefly?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I appreciate her comments. The only reason I would object \nto a voice vote is because I have seen too many voice votes in this \nplace and then things get dropped in conference. I would hope we could \nhave a recorded vote. I know they take up a little more time, but I \nbelieve it is important to establish on the record that the Senate \nactually does support the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our majority staff who helps us organize \nthe traffic of this is now going to be writing this up. Let's see how \nwe can accommodate the Senator from Nevada. We will be able to ask for \na UC before we go into the caucus. But the minority Republican staff is \nhere. Senator Shelby will certainly protect the interests of the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  If I may comment on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, we \nwill debate that amendment later when we are heading to a vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3277\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Vitter \namendment No. 3277, which may be considered later this afternoon on \nthis pending Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill.\n  This amendment would prohibit fiscal year 2008 COPS funds from being \nused in contravention of a provision in Federal law that relates to \ninformation sharing about a person's immigration status.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has said this amendment is targeted at \n``sanctuary cities.'' He is referring to the policies that have been \nput in place by many cities, counties, and police departments in at \nleast 23 States and the District of Columbia that limit enforcement of \nimmigration laws by State or local authorities.\n  These cities, counties, and police departments have decided that it \nis a matter of public health and safety not to inquire about \nimmigration status when people report crimes or have been the victims \nof domestic abuse or go to a clinic to obtain vaccinations for their \nchildren.\n  These State and local confidentiality policies do not stop the \nFederal Government from enforcing immigration laws--a traditional \nfunction of the Federal Government, not State and local governments. \nRather, they reflect a decision made by State and local authorities \nthat they do not want to have their police departments spend their time \nand resources enforcing a traditionally Federal responsibility relative \nto immigration law. Those laws are the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to enforce.\n  In many cities, including several in my home State of Illinois, city \nand law enforcement officials have decided, reasonably, they want to \nfocus their attention and their police resources on stopping violent \ncrime.\n  Yesterday, I was in a section of Chicago known as Logan Square. There \nis a wonderful organization known as Christopher House that was opening \na family resource center, a neighborhood center in the tradition of the \nsettlement houses that were started in the Chicago area by Jane Addams \nalmost a century ago. This Logan Square area is an up-and-coming part \nof the city of Chicago. It is a beautiful neighborhood,\n\n[[Page S12897]]\n\nbut it is a neighborhood that has been riddled with violence for over a \ndecade. Literally, children are being gunned down in the street. I \nattended a memorial service a few weeks ago there for a young African-\nAmerican girl. She was killed on a playground while playing with her \nfriends by a drive-by shooting by gang bangers. The alderman in that \n35th ward, Rey Colon, who is quite a leader in the community himself, \nattended the service with me. As we walked into the church, he pointed \nto a section on the sidewalk and said: Just a few years ago a member of \nmy family was killed on that spot.\n  Violence is endemic, unfortunately, in America, and we see it in \ncities, great cities such as Chicago and others. Mayor Daley is making \nan extraordinary effort to deal with this. I am joining him in that \neffort. It is hard for me to imagine the Senator from Louisiana wants \nto cut off the COPS Program funds for the city of Chicago. That is what \nhe suggested.\n  What will the COPS Program do for the city of Chicago? It will put \nmore police on the beat. There will be more police officers out there \nin the neighborhoods to keep them safe. The COPS money can be used to \nbuy bulletproof vests so when a policeman is shot, he might survive. \nThe money is also being used for forensic analysis, DNA testing, trying \nto find ways that ex-offenders can be brought back in a peaceful way to \nthe cities and towns from where they started. It is used for task \nforces to go after sexual predators.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Louisiana would cut off these funds \nfor the city of Chicago. Why? Why in the world would the Senator from \nLouisiana--a State I have bent over backwards to help since Hurricane \nKatrina--want to cut off Federal funds to the city of Chicago, funds to \nmake the streets safer? Why would he want to cut off Federal funds to \nany city in America to make the streets safer?\n  He wants to argue about immigration laws. Well, that is a valid \ndebate. We had it for 3 weeks here in the Senate, and we will have to \nreturn to it because we ended up doing nothing. But in his effort today \nto bring this immigration issue out to the floor of the Senate, the \nSenator from Louisiana is threatening the Federal funds that many \ncities in my home State of Illinois are using to fight violent crime. \nWhy? That makes no sense at all. Will he feel better if there are more \nkillings on the street? Of course not. None of us would. I think he \nwould feel better if there were more cops on the street.\n  But his amendment seeks to cut off COPS funding for the city of \nChicago and other towns in Illinois, and that is not right. I urge my \ncolleagues, when they consider the Vitter amendment, to consider how \nyou would respond to the mayors of these towns when they ask you: How \nin the world did you disqualify my city from receiving money for \nbulletproof vests for my policemen? How can you, Senator or \nCongressman, explain to their families why that fallen policeman's life \nwas taken because no bulletproof vest could be provided from Federal \nfunds?\n  I do not understand the logic behind this. I would say that many of \nthese cities are working hard to fight crime. They are working with \nmany people. The former president of the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, Joseph Estey, said in relation to a proposal similar \nto the one offered by Senator Vitter:\n\n       Many leaders in the law enforcement community have serious \n     concerns about the chilling effect any measure of this nature \n     would have on legal and illegal aliens reporting criminal \n     activity or assisting police in criminal investigations. This \n     lack of cooperation could diminish the ability of law \n     enforcement agencies to police effectively their \n     communities and protect the public they serve.\n\n  It is particularly troubling that the Vitter amendment seeks to link \nCOPS funding to the overturning of city confidentiality policies. This \nbill, the one Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby have brought before \nus, currently provides for $660 million in COPS funding. That is a \ndramatic increase over the administration's request. The money, of \ncourse, is for new police officers, bulletproof vests, combating \nmethamphetamine, law enforcement technology enhancements, arresting and \nprosecuting child predators--the Vitter amendment would cut off Federal \nfunds for efforts to arrest and prosecute child predators--and a lot of \nother important programs.\n  This COPS money is focused on helping State and local law enforcement \nstop violent crime, stop crimes against children, stop sexual \npredators. Similarly, cities and police departments have put policies \nin place regarding the confidentiality of immigration status so they \ncan focus on stopping violent crime, and so law enforcement officials \ncan obtain information about crimes from victims and witnesses in \ncommunities where they might not otherwise be able to obtain it.\n  The goal of reducing violent crime is not served by telling police \ndepartments they can either have one crime reduction tool--the COPS \nmoney--or another--these confidentiality policies.\n  Do we want to deprive police forces in 23 States additional manpower, \nmen and women on the beat, keeping schools and neighborhoods safe, and \ndeny these same police men and women bulletproof vests through the COPS \nProgram, because local officials have determined when it comes to the \nenforcement of Federal immigration laws, the Federal Government should \nassume that enforcement? That is what it comes down to.\n  We do have a serious immigration problem in this country. I voted--\nmost Members, maybe all Members have voted--for some $7 billion more in \nenforcement at the border between the United States and Mexico. We have \nto stop the illegal flow into this country. I think we have put our \nmoney where our intentions are. That is a fact.\n  Earlier this year, we considered comprehensive immigration reform \nthat would also have greatly improved the enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. I supported this effort. It was controversial. We did \nnot have enough votes. The Senator who has brought this amendment to \nthe floor, which would cut off COPS funding, opposed any effort for a \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Instead, he wants to force on State \nand local governments a responsibility we have not met at the Federal \nlevel, and he wants to threaten them with cutting off COPS funds that \nare critically important for them. I do not think that works.\n  Violent crime is a serious problem in my State and across the Nation. \nViolent crime rates have gone up the last 2 years. We need to give our \ncommunities the tools to address this problem.\n  I hope the Vitter amendment will be defeated. Let's make sure we do \nnot make the safety of people living in 23 States a political pawn in \nthis debate over immigration. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Vitter \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3289\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are nearing the hour of 12 o'clock, \nwhen we have agreed there will be a rollcall vote on the DeMint \namendment.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment offered by Senator DeMint \nfrom South Carolina and ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The GAO, the General Accounting Office, found that over \n120 million in tax dollars were wasted by Federal agencies dealing with \ntravel--first-class travel--when economy travel or something less than \nfirst class could do. That is unacceptable to all of us here.\n  I commend my colleague from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, for \nbringing this to the Senate's attention, and I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to vote ``aye'' on this amendment in a few minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the DeMint \namendment No. 3289.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nClinton), the Senator from Connecticut\n\n[[Page S12898]]\n\n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``yea.''\n   Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we also believe we will be having a vote \nat more or less the same time on the Thune amendment, as it relates to \nthe Legal Services Corporation. We are waiting for final word from \nSenator Harkin on that. But when we return from the respective caucus \nlunches, we expect there to be a debate on the Thune amendment, the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, will be speaking, and about that time we \nexpect to have another UC.\n  There will be votes throughout the afternoon. We urge our colleagues \nat our respective party lunches to speak to both Senator Shelby and \nmyself as a way of disposing of those amendments that have been filed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there are few bills that we deal with in \nWashington, DC, that are more critical to the safety and well-being of \nour communities than the bill we are considering on the floor today. \nThis legislation is going to help fund Federal law enforcement and \njustice programs that are absolutely essential if we are going to keep \nour neighborhoods safe, keep our justice system strong, and make sure \nour communities are healthy. At a time when our budgets are very tight \nand our needs are very great, I believe this bill invests in the right \npriorities. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for their \nleadership and their very hard work to put this bill together.\n  But as all of us in this Chamber know, despite their hard work and \nleadership at their subcommittee to make a sound investment in the \nhealth of our communities, the President has said he will veto this \nbill. According to the administration, the additional funding in this \nbill is ``irresponsible and excessive.''\n  That is very hard to fathom when this administration is asking for \nover $190 billion in emergency appropriations to fight the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan for 1 year. While this President easily is spending our \nmoney overseas, local communities in my home State and around the \ncountry are going without the money they need for very critical \nprograms.\n  The increases this legislation calls for are a fraction of what this \nPresident spends on the wars in a year. The money in this bill will go \nto revitalize programs that have been overlooked by this \nadministration. My home State, for example, is experiencing a dangerous \nshortage of FBI agents who do essential work to ensure that we prevent \nanother terrorist attack at home and who perform critical law \nenforcement duties. That shortage is one example of how this President \nmixed up the Nation's priorities. But this bill does make a small step \ntoward fixing some of those years of problems.\n  In my home State, the lack of FBI agents for critical law enforcement \nneeds has been a serious concern for some time, but the urgency of this \nsituation was driven home recently in a series of articles by the \nSeattle Post-\n\n[[Page S12899]]\n\nIntelligencer. The paper's first article noted that since 9/11:\n\n     the White House and the Justice Department have failed to \n     replace at least 2,400 agents, transferred from law \n     enforcement to counterterrorism, leaving far fewer agents on \n     the trail of identity thieves, con-artists, hate mongers and \n     other criminals.\n\n  The article I referred to found that Washington State has a mere 2.1 \nFBI agents for every 100,000 residents. That is nearly half the \nnational average.\n  This past week, I met with police chiefs and sheriffs from across my \nState, and they agreed this shift has had a real impact on State and \nlocal law enforcement. One police chief told me the FBI had virtually \ndisappeared from white collar crime investigations. A sheriff told me \nthe local law enforcement now investigates and prosecutes over 90 \npercent of all bank robberies, even though this has traditionally been \na FBI responsibility.\n  Another police chief told me the FBI does not have the law \nenforcement resources to adequately staff antigang task forces, even as \nthe gang presence and gang-related crime increases in our communities.\n  All of these sheriffs and police chiefs had nothing but praise for \nthe essential work that FBI agents perform in their communities. But \neven as the FBI focuses on counterterrorism, they ask that it not \nabandon law enforcement. The Seattle FBI field office has remained \nunderstaffed even for counterterrorism agents. That is especially \ntroubling because Washington State's industry-leading companies, \ninternational seaports, and important military facilities make it a \nprime target for a terrorist attack. Three years from now, thousands of \npeople are going to travel through my home State to attend the 2010 \nVancouver Winter Olympics. We have to be prepared for the worst. \nCurrently, Washington State ranks 35th in per capita FBI agents. \nClearly, that makes no sense.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for working with me on \nthis issue; specifically an amendment that would end this disconnect \nand ensure we are placing our FBI agents where they can best protect \nour communities. It will also get the FBI to tell us how it intends to \ndistribute its resources.\n  That amendment is the first step toward ensuring that the FBI's \npriorities are in sync with our country's security needs and its own \nstated priorities. I commend Senator Mikulski for her recognition of \nthat need. Her work to include additional funding for the FBI in this \nbill is a very good first step. The next step is to increase funding to \nhire, train, and place new FBI agents throughout the country that will \nhelp to ease the burden the FBI has had to bear since 9/11 changed its \nmission.\n  But I think we all know more funding is needed. Unfortunately, if \nthis President believes that increasing our FBI budget is irresponsible \nand excessive and plans to veto this bill, we will not be able to make \nthe necessary investments today that will make our country more secure \ntomorrow.\n\n  While Federal agents are critically important to maintaining the \nsecurity of our country, we all know that State and local law \nenforcement are the real guardians for our communities. In this post-9/\n11 world, we have asked them to place counterterrorism at the top of \ntheir priorities.\n  But criminals have not stopped abusing children or robbing stores or \ndealing drugs. The local police have been told they need to do more \nwith less, but we have reached a point today where we simply cannot ask \nthem to do more without help.\n  A recent FBI crime report showed that after a decade of declines, \nviolent crime is now rising for the second straight year. We have to \nmake sure it doesn't rise again. This bill restores funding for our \nState and local law enforcement to nearly $2.7 billion and fills a \nmajor gap, after the President cut its budget in half. This will also \nprovide $1.4 billion for State and local law enforcement grants, \nincluding $550 million for COPS grants, and over $100 million for Byrne \ngrants. These funds are critically important and they support antidrug \nand antigang task forces around the country.\n  They fund communications equipment that helps our police and our \nemergency response teams talk to each other, something we all know is \ndesperately needed in all our communities.\n  They fund critical programs to deal with the spread of \nmethamphetamine, and police chiefs and sheriffs have consistently told \nme these grants were absolutely essential to their ability to protect \nour communities. Unfortunately, as I said, we have heard the President \nsay he is going to veto this legislation. This bill addresses critical \npriorities across our country and I urge all my colleagues to support \nthe bill and send the President a message from our constituents at home \nthat he is taking our country's safety and economic well-being in the \nwrong direction and that we need to change focus and give our \ncommunities what they need to be safe and sound and secure.\n  This bill also addresses vital commercial and economic interests \nacross the Nation.\n  In my home State, that means helping to ensure a healthy, sustainable \nsalmon population. In Washington State, healthy salmon mean a healthy \neconomy. That's why I am thankful that this bill includes $90 million \nin funding for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. This money \nwill help support our State's coordinated effort to restore salmon runs \nand preserve a way of life in the Pacific Northwest.\n  When I talk with leaders in my home State about the need to restore \nour salmon populations, they call it critical.\n  When I go home and discuss with law enforcement officials, experts \nand the media, about the need to increase the number of FBI agents, \nthey say it is an urgent problem.\n  When I talk to local police and sheriffs about the need for COPS and \nByrne grants, they say these grants are crucial to the security and \nsafety of our communities.\n  Yet when I return to Washington, DC, I am told by this President that \nthe money that is so desperately needed at home is ``irresponsible and \nexcessive.''\n  It could not be clearer that this Administration is out of step with \nthe priorities of the people of State and the people of this country.\n  We have presented the President a measured, responsible bill to \nbolster our security and build our economy, and I understand he has \ndecided to reject it.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and send the President \na message from our constituents at home: That he is taking our \ncountry's safety and economic well-being in the wrong direction, and \nthat we need to change focus and give our communities what they need to \nbe safe, and sound, and secure.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3317\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 3317, offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Mr. Thune, equally divided and controlled by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am hear to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota. The amendment he \noffered would reduce the vital legal assistance to our most vulnerable \ncitizens, low-income Americans who need help with their most critical \nlegal needs.\n  First of all, I wish to say I am a strong supporter of the bill \nbefore us. The President proposed drastic cuts in funding for State and \nlocal law enforcement, but the bill provides a total of $2.6 billion \nfor State and local law enforcement which is about $1.5 billion above \nthe President's request. The President's budget also proposed to reduce \nthe number of Federal law enforcement agents working to combat violent \ncrime, but this bill rejects that cut, as well as lifting the hiring \nfreeze on DEA agents.\n  I wish to point out something else. The bill further provides $1.7 \nbillion for U.S. attorneys, $92 million more than last year, and it \ndirectly addresses Native American needs. The bill provides $35 million \nfor tribal law enforcement efforts. The bill further provides $1 \nmillion in research on violence against Native American women.\n  I know Senators Mikulski and Shelby did their best to provide \nadditional resources, especially given the severe budget constraints we \nface, but the answer to the problems that Native\n\n[[Page S12900]]\n\nAmericans have with domestic violence and violent crime is not to \ndeprive them and other poor citizens of our country of basic legal \nservices. That is what the Thune amendment does. Senator Thune is \nputting more money into the U.S. attorneys to combat violent crime, but \nhe is taking it out of Legal Services. That tradeoff is wrong and I \nencourage my colleagues to reject the Thune amendment and support the \nlevel of funding provided in the bill.\n  Let me take a minute to explain why the increase in funding for Legal \nServices is so important. In 1996, Legal Services took a drastic cut in \nfunding by the Congress. It went from $415 million to $278 million. It \nwas almost cut in half. We have been trying to get the funding back up \nsince that time. I point out if at that time, from 1995 to now, we had \nkept pace with inflation, Legal Services would currently be funded at \nabout $566 million. This bill gets it up to $390 million, so we are not \neven back up to where we were in 1995. As I said, the Thune amendment \ncuts $20 million out of the increase provided in this bill and gives it \nto U.S. attorneys. But I also pointed out, the U.S. attorneys already \ngot a $92 million increase in the bill, for $1.7 billion in total \nfunding.\n  Of course, it is not just Native Americans but a wide range of low-\nincome Americans including, in recent years, victims of Hurricane \nKatrina and even victims of 9/11, who utilize legal services. We have \nall read in recent months about the vast increase in the number of \npeople losing their homes because of foreclosures and the scandal in \nthe subprime lending market. Many of these people are low income, and \nthey are going to need help from Legal Services because they will not \nbe able to afford an attorney.\n  Again, make no mistake, even under this bill as it is, Legal Services \nis not able to serve the legal needs of all low-income Americans. For \nexample, 50 percent of eligible applicants requesting legal assistance \nfrom the Legal Services Corporation grantees are turned away because of \nlack of funding. Keep in mind that, in order to be eligible for Legal \nServices, you have to be at or below 125 percent of poverty level. That \nis an income of $25,000 a year for a family of four. That means right \nnow we are turning away half of the families earning less than $25,000 \na year who need legal help. In some parts of the country, it is even \nhigher. In Wisconsin, 80 percent of poor households who face legal \nproblems do so without an attorney.\n  In California, 66 percent; in Nebraska, 86 percent; in Utah, 87 \npercent; in New Mexico, 80 percent. On and on. Those are the percentage \nof low-income people in those States who face a legal problem yet do \nnot get any help.\n  With so many people going unserved, every cent is crucial. The \nadoption of the Thune amendment would only result in furthering the \njustice gap in this country and in many cases hurt the very people the \nSenator from South Dakota wishes to help, Native Americans.\n  The clients of Legal Services Corporation funded programs are the \nmost vulnerable among us, and many of them are Native Americans. Since \n2001, 2.8 percent of all of the appropriations going to Legal Services \nhas gone to meet the legal needs of disadvantaged Native Americans in \nthis country. That means that under this bill about $10.4 million would \ngo to Native American legal services. That includes South Dakota. In \nmany of these States like South Dakota, a majority of legal services \ngoes to serve Native American populations. In fact, in 2006, fully 67 \npercent of the clients served by civil legal services in South Dakota \nwere Native Americans--67 percent. By taking money from Legal Services, \nyou are hurting the very people who need legal help, including many of \nour Native Americans.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator's presentation. \nI have indicated to my colleague from South Dakota that I share his \ninstinct and we need better law enforcement on Indian reservations. I \ndo not think there is any question about it.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby added \nback funds that had been eliminated in the President's budget. But we \nhave a long way to go and we have talked about that here. The instinct \nis right to try to provide more funding so we are able to deal with \nthose issues.\n  I held a hearing last week. A report shows that 34 percent of Indian \nwomen will be raped or sexually assaulted in their lifetime. That is \nunbelievable. We have serious law enforcement problems.\n  But I must vote against this amendment for the following reason: I \ncannot support an amendment, even though it adds money we need, that we \nwill pay for by eliminating--by reducing funding for legal services, \nprecisely because, as the Senator from Iowa says, legal services are \nthe access to the legal system for low-income folks. It is the only \nopportunity they have, in many cases, for them to access the legal \nsystem.\n  That budget has been cut, and cut repeatedly. Now we are trying to \nadd some back. To cut it now would be the wrong thing.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding to me. I am very interested, I know \nthe Senator from Iowa is very interested, in working with Senator Thune \nand others, Senators Shelby and Mikulski. I have talked to them to try \nto find ways to add back to these accounts in the future. We must do \nthat. It has been partially restored in some of these areas by Senators \nMikulski and Shelby.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for allowing me to weigh in. I say I \ncertainly support his presentation. I support the instinct of the \nSenator from South Dakota in wanting to try to improve this area of \nfunding. But we cannot do it by taking away from such important funding \nas Legal Services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also appreciate the efforts of the Senator from South \nDakota. Again, if you are asking whether I have any problems with where \nthe Senator from South Dakota wants to provide additional funding, no, \nI do not. I have problems with where we are taking it from. That is my \nbasic problem, because all of the data and all of the testimony tells \nus that Legal Services are helping the very people we are talking \nabout, especially women who are victims of domestic violence.\n  Because, a lot of times, Legal Services attorneys are handling family \nlaw matters. But before they get to the prosecutorial level, for \nexample, there are things that can be worked out. Individuals have a \nlawyer--for example, domestic violence restraining orders, separation \nagreements, or child custody arrangements, those types of things, which \nare civil matters. U.S. attorneys do not handle that. That is what \nLegal Services does.\n  The incidence of violence toward Native American women is tragic. As \nthe Senator from South Dakota pointed out in his presentation earlier, \nhe said Native American women are seven times more likely to be victims \nof domestic violence than other women. That is what the Senator from \nNorth Dakota also just told us.\n  But, again, it is precisely these citizens whom Legal Services \nCorporation-funded programs assist. Three out of four clients of Legal \nServices are women--three out of four.\n  Legal aid programs identify domestic violence as one of the top \npriorities in their caseloads. Recent studies have shown that the only \npublic service that reduces domestic abuse in the long term is women's \naccess to legal aid, the very assistance this amendment would \ndrastically curtail. So legal services does make a big difference.\n  As I said, it is not just Native Americans I am talking about. Legal \nServices is still helping victims of 9/11, flood victims, Katrina \nvictims. Now we have a whole new group of people accessing Legal \nServices. I am almost embarrassed to say this. There is another group \nwe now see accessing Legal Services in a big way. Do you know who they \nare? Our soldiers and their families. Our soldiers and their families, \nbecause some of these enlistees who are privates and below do not get \nenough money. They may have problems, separations. They have been gone \na long time. There are family problems. They do not have enough money \nto hire an attorney. Their spouses might not. So they are accessing \nLegal Services. This amendment would say: No, we are going to cut back \non that. So, again, I think it is important for us to keep this in \nmind.\n\n[[Page S12901]]\n\n  I know the Senator from South Dakota had mentioned the recent \nmanagement problems at Legal Services headquarters. Believe me, no one \nwas more upset than this Senator when the reports came out a year ago, \nfirst with the IG investigation and then GAO report. I say that because \nI started my life after law school as a Legal Services attorney. That \nis what I did. I know that every cent in the field counts. So if they \nare wasting money up here in Washington with chauffeured limousines and \nfancy hotels and all of that kind of stuff, it makes my blood boil, \nbecause I know what the Legal Services attorneys in the field are \nliving with, and they are pinching pennies. They are not paid a lot.\n  That is why I was glad, in the education bill that passed earlier, we \nincluded Legal Services lawyers as those who would have their loans \nrepaid if they stayed and became Legal Services attorneys.\n  Again, I share with the Senator from South Dakota and others my total \nabhorrence of what was going on in the hierarchy. I will say this: The \nGAO recommended a number of things for Legal Services to do to address \nthese problems that are now being implemented, in terms of the board \nstructure and other important oversight protections. Why it was not \ndone before, I do not know. There is no excuse for it. There is \nabsolutely no excuse for it. But I can say that the board is now \nimplementing the suggestions and the recommendations of the GAO. I made \nit very clear as a long-time supporter of the Legal Services \nCorporation, I made it very clear to management that they needed to act \nimmediately to address the GAO recommendations. I know both Senator \nShelby and Senator Mikulski have said the same thing to LSC. So LSC \nmanagement knows that people here are watching. I know they are acting \nto address it. Their board of directors has publicly accepted all of \nGAO's recommendations. They have begun their implementation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Legal Services Corporation's response to GAO which outlines the \nsteps they are taking to ensure better management at headquarters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Comments From the Legal Services Corporation\n\n                                                    July 31, 2007.\n     Jeanette M. Franzel,\n     Director, Financial Management and Assurance, Government \n         Accountability Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Franzel: Thank you for the opportunity to provide \n     written comments on the Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) draft report entitled Legal Services Corporation--\n     Governance and Accountability Practices Need To Be Modernized \n     and Strengthened. This is Management's response to your draft \n     report. The Board of Directors is responding separately.\n       We are pleased with your findings that LSC ``has stronger \n     federal accountability requirements than many nonprofit \n     corporations'' and that LSC Board members ``demonstrated \n     active involvement through their strong board meeting \n     attendance and participation in LSC oversight.'' We intend to \n     build on this strong base of accountability and oversight as \n     we respond to the recommendations for executive action which \n     you have made. We fully accept three of your recommendations \n     and we are committed to further action in the spirit of the \n     fourth recommendation.\n       Regarding the appropriate financial reporting standard for \n     LSC, we are reviewing the Government Accounting Standards \n     Board standards, and we expect to complete our evaluation by \n     the end of October 2007.\n       Regarding a Continuity of Operations Plan program, LSC has \n     adopted elements of a program, as noted in your draft report, \n     and we expect to complete our comprehensive program during \n     2008.\n       Regarding a code of conduct, we have established a staff \n     task force to develop proposals for an LSC compliance \n     program, which will include a comprehensive code of conduct. \n     Our goal is to have recommendations to the Board of Directors \n     by the January 2008 Board meeting.\n       Regarding a risk management program, we are committed to \n     improving the risk management program at LSC. We note that \n     LSC has managed its risks well over the past 33 years. We \n     will review and implement those additional program elements \n     that are desirable and appropriate for an organization of our \n     size.\n       We recommend that several clarifications be made to your \n     draft report narrative to insure its overall accuracy. In \n     discussing the accountability of LSC for the management of \n     its federal appropriations, the draft report does not address \n     the existence of congressional oversight. LSC has both \n     authorizing and appropriations committees in the House and \n     the Senate, and LSC is subject to regular oversight from \n     these committees. LSC has been the subject of appropriations \n     and oversight hearings five times in the past three years. \n     LSC staff meet regularly with both Members and congressional \n     staff to discuss ongoing operations.\n       In discussing LSC's whistleblower protections, the draft \n     report does not acknowledge that LSC has a whistleblower \n     protection statement in its Employee Handbook. This \n     protection for those who complain to the Office of Inspector \n     General (OIG) has been in place at LSC for almost 20 years.\n       The draft report references potential conflicts of interest \n     with respect to LSC's Acting Special Counsels. All of the \n     relevant information relating to the Acting Special Counsels \n     was provided to the OIG. The OIG made no findings of any \n     conflict of interest with respect to the Acting Special \n     Counsels, and no report of any potential conflicts of \n     interest exists. LSC has been and remains diligent in its \n     ethical obligation to avoid any conflicts of interest. Since \n     the draft report itself makes no finding by GAO of potential \n     conflicts of interest, the placement of this reference in the \n     ``What GAO Found'' section (see Highlights page) is \n     particularly troublesome.\n       Finally, while we recognize that your recommendations of \n     matters for congressional consideration are not made to LSC, \n     we feel compelled to observe that LSC's existing statutory \n     framework is appropriate and has served very well the \n     purposes which Congress intended, as described in the \n     appendices to the draft report which explain the rationale \n     for establishing LSC as a non-profit corporation. Should \n     there be a desire to apply some additional management \n     requirements to LSC, that can be accomplished without \n     modifying the nonprofit corporation framework which Congress \n     enacted. To change the framework of LSC to that of a \n     government corporation or federal agency would subject the \n     mission of providing civil legal assistance to poor people to \n     the kind of political pressure and operational controls which \n     Congress wisely sought to avoid in 1974.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment upon the draft \n     report. This has been a helpful and constructive process for \n     us. We welcome your recommendations for executive action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Helaine M. Barnett,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Regardless of what we may think about the management of \nLegal Services, and what the board was or was not doing, asleep at the \nswitch, it is important to note that this amendment would not impact \nmanagement. Only $13 million of the $390 million appropriated in the \nbill goes for management and administration. That account has not \nreceived a single penny increase in the funding, thanks to Senator \nShelby and thanks to Senator Mikulski. I know this because I worked \nwith them and I championed the increase included in the bill, but to \nensure that the money went where it was needed, to the programs in the \nfield and not to management here in Washington.\n  Senator Thune's amendment, in taking this money out of Legal \nServices, may talk about the management, but none of the increase we \nput in here goes to management. It all goes to the field operations. \nThose are the people who need it the most.\n  Again, I echo what my friend from North Dakota said. I think the \nthrust of what Senator Thune is trying to do is laudable. Obviously we \ndo have a problem with domestic violence and abuse of Native American \nwomen. Obviously this needs to be prosecuted. I would say before that \nstep, though, we need to make sure we have legal services available to \nthem, so that we cut down on the incidence of domestic abuse and \ndomestic violence. For that reason I would oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, amendment No. 3317 I submitted last night. \nI spoke to it at that point, but I wish to again make some comments \nwith regard to the amendment and the need that exists in the Indian \ncountry for this additional funding.\n  I appreciate the passion of my friend from Iowa for Legal Services \nCorporation and support of that organization. But I would simply say \nthat once again, these appropriations bills are forcing us to make \ndecisions about what our priorities need to be.\n  This debate is about choosing priorities. I also say to my friend \nfrom Iowa that we are not talking about cutting Legal Services \nCorporation over the level they were at last year. They were at $348 \nmillion in fiscal year 2007. My amendment would still allow a $22 \nmillion increase over last year's level. It\n\n[[Page S12902]]\n\nwould fund them at $370 million instead of the $390 million that is \nincluded in the base bill. So you are still talking about a 6.3-percent \nincrease in funding for the Legal Services Corporation, so they can \ncontinue to do the work they need to do to fulfill their obligations to \nthe American public and the American taxpayers. But what this simply \ndoes is say we have a very desperate need in Indian country, and this \n$20 million could go to very good use in helping us combat violent \ncrime on our reservations.\n  I guess the question we come down to in these debates on \nappropriations--and particularly with regard to this amendment--is: \nShould we provide more badly needed funding to fight violent crime in \nIndian country or should we put additional funds into an organization \nthat has engaged, according to the GAO and the inspector general, in \nwasteful spending of taxpayer dollars by providing what would be a \nsubstantial increase above the President's recommendation of $311 \nmillion and, as I said before, an increase of $42 million over the $348 \nmillion that Legal Services Corporation received in last year's \nappropriations bill?\n  This bill, the underlying base bill, provides $390 million to Legal \nServices Corporation. It is a program that has not been reauthorized \nsince 1980. That is a 12-percent increase over the amount appropriated \nfor the Legal Services Corporation in fiscal year 2007, and a 20-\npercent increase over the recommendations that were made earlier this \nyear in the administration's budget. That substantial increase comes at \na time when the Legal Services Corporation has faced very serious \nquestions about its management and expenditure of taxpayer dollars.\n  The GAO and the Office of Inspector General within the Legal Services \nCorporation clearly lay out the management and waste that has been \ngoing on in the LSC. As I said, my amendment is a modest decrease in \nthe amount of spending that is reflected in the underlying bill. \nInstead of a $40 million increase, the Legal Services Corporation would \nstill receive a substantial increase of $20 million under my amendment.\n  Again, I would say that if you look at the GAO report, it is not some \ndated thing. This is August of 2007. The GAO in their report, entitled \n``Legal Services Corporation: Governance and Accountability Practices \nNeed to be Modernized and Strengthened,'' noted a dozen officers and \nemployees of the Legal Services Corporation have received compensation \nin excess of the statutory compensation limitation. According to the \nGAO and outside legal counsel, they issued an opinion last May \nconcluding that LSC had not complied with the statutory limitation on \nthe rate of compensation. The GAO agreed with that conclusion, and went \non to state that: Without a properly designed and implemented end \nprocess for overseeing compensation, LSC remains at risk of not \ncomplying with related laws and regulations and engaging in imprudent \nmanagement practices.\n  Now, as my friend from Iowa has noted, they are responding, as \nrightly they should, to address those things. But I think the question \nis, do you want to reward, with a 12-percent increase, a significant \nincrease over fiscal year 2007, that kind of behavior?\n  We have an opportunity here again to set priorities. In my view, we \nhave a very serious priority that needs to be dealt with on our Indian \nreservations in this country, which has been pointed out in any number \nof different stories and articles.\n  I have lots of personal examples I can offer from people who actually \nlive on reservations who work in the education system. I have a letter \nfrom a superintendent from a reservation school who says: We have one \nschool resource officer in our school system who is certified as a law \nenforcement officer. However, on this particular reservation, we have a \ntotal of seven BIA policemen to patrol 2.2 million acres of \nreservation. The response time by the BIA police department can be \nhours for our residents on the reservation or typically result in no \nresponse at all.\n  If you look at the way these cases are prosecuted on the reservation, \nI have another letter from a constituent who lives out there who says:\n\n       In some of these situations the people committing the \n     criminal activities have been caught. They have been sent to \n     jail, released and [are] back on the street committing more \n     crimes, sometimes within 24 hours of the last crime.\n\n  This principal in his letter talked about what is becoming a very \ndeep endemic problem on reservations; that is, the increased presence \nof organized gangs, violence, and drugs.\n  There are lots of anecdotal examples I could share of the need for \nadditional law enforcement presence. I cosponsored, along with Senator \nDorgan, an amendment earlier on this bill that would increase the \nnumber of law enforcement personnel who would be on the reservations to \naddress what is the issue of actually apprehending people when they \ncommit crimes. What my amendment does is couples with that the other \naspect, and that is making sure that when people are apprehended for \ncommitting these types of crimes, they go on to get prosecuted.\n  What is amazing is, if you look at the rate of prosecution on Indian \nreservations and how it compares with prosecutions elsewhere--there was \nan article recently in the Wall Street Journal that said that based on \nJustice Department data, only 30 percent of tribal land crimes referred \nto U.S. attorneys were prosecuted. That compares with 56 percent for \nall other cases. It goes on to say that one of the reasons those cases \ndon't get prosecuted in Indian country is because Federal prosecutors \nhave long distances involved, a lack of resources, and the cost of \nhauling witnesses and defendants to Federal court. As a consequence, a \nlot of cases are not being dealt with.\n  The U.S. attorney who deals with this in a very admirable way in my \nState of South Dakota suffers from a lack of resources to do the work \nthat is necessary to make sure that crimes that are committed on the \nreservation are dealt with, and dealt with in an expeditious way.\n  If you look at the data--this is Justice Department data from 1992 to \n2001--the average rate of violent crime among American Indians was 2\\1/\n2\\ times the national rate. In fact, according to one report in the \nIndian Country Today newspaper, Native American women are seven times \nmore likely to be the victim of domestic violence than are other women, \nand more than 60 percent of Indian women will be victims of violent \nassault during their lifetime.\n  Senator Dorgan was on the Senate floor yesterday discussing this \nissue. He noted that one-third of Indian women will be raped or \nsexually assaulted during their lifetime. This is unacceptable. This \nhas to stop.\n  What we are simply saying with this amendment is, here is a way to \naddress the issue. Again, we need more law enforcement personnel on the \nreservations, which this bill will attempt to address, as will an \namendment that was offered earlier by Senator Dorgan. I cosponsored an \namendment offered by Senator Bingaman, the meth hot spots legislation, \nthat would allow the cops made available under that legislation to be \nused by Indian reservations. But it is important that we get at the \nissue of making sure our U.S. attorneys are in a position to be able to \nprosecute when violent crimes are committed in Indian country. These \nstatistics are stunning, when you look at the number of Native American \nwomen who are subject to these types of violent crimes--in many cases, \nsexual assault--that go unprosecuted because of a lack of resources to \nthe Justice Department so U.S. attorneys can bring those cases in \ncourt.\n  I again come back to the basic premise of the amendment. It does \nincrease funding for the Legal Services Corporation, the underlying \nbill does. The base bill increases it to $390 million from the $348 \nmillion level in fiscal year 2007. The administration budget actually \nrecommended $311 million. So $311 to $390 million is about a 20-percent \nincrease. That was over the administration's budget. It is about 12 \npercent in the base bill over the fiscal year 2007 level from $348 \nmillion to $390 million. What my amendment does is pares back the size \nof that increase by $20 million. So it will now go from $348 million in \nfiscal year 2007 to $370 million in fiscal year 2008. That is a better \nthan 6-percent increase. So we are not taking away anything from Legal \nServices Corporation or their ability to do their job. We are simply \nsaying a part of that substantial increase, coming at a time when the \nLegal Services Corporation is under tremendous scrutiny\n\n[[Page S12903]]\n\nand criticism from the Government/Accountabiilty Office, as well as \nfrom their own inspector general, it makes sense, in my view, to take \nthose resources, those $20 million out of that particular account, \napply that to giving the U.S. attorneys the resources they need to \ncombat violent crime on our Indian reservations.\n  There isn't anything that works if you don't have a secure, safe \nenvironment. Public safety is the most important responsibility we \nhave. Our Indian reservations today are suffering from a tremendous \nlack of enforcement of laws, a failure on the part of our Government to \nrespond to providing security. I have talked with school \nsuperintendents and principals whose children cannot learn when they \ndon't have a safe learning environment. That is what we are dealing \nwith today because of a lack of law enforcement personnel and a lack of \ncapability on behalf of the U.S. attorneys to prosecute crimes \ncommitted in Indian country so that those who perpetrate those crimes \nare not released and back out on the street to commit further crimes.\n  It is a straightforward amendment: $20 million out of the Legal \nServices Corporation increase, a substantial increase still over what \nthey received last year, and take that $20 million and apply it to a \nvery desperate need that we have on our reservations to make sure we \nare doing our best to provide public safety so our young children in \nIndian country have the ability to learn, to get educated, to conduct \ntheir lives, and to create an opportunity where the economy in Indian \ncountry can grow and prosper as well. You can't do that absent public \nsafety and security.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Up to 3 minutes has been reserved. Who seeks \nrecognition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond. Again, I want to read \nfrom the bill so it is clear in everyone's mind that none of the money \nthe Senator from South Dakota is taking out of Legal Services will come \nfrom administration. The bill itself says, page 81: $372 million is for \nbasic field programs, $13.8 million for management and administration--\nexactly what they had last year.\n  Again, we are not rewarding LSC management for being bad actors, nor \nare we rewarding the board for the poor oversight they provided. We are \nkeeping the management and administration account to the same level it \nwas funded at last year. So the money Senator Thune is proposing to cut \nwill come from field operations.\n  Secondly, there is a glass half full/half empty story about the \nincrease in this bill for Legal Services. Over 11 years ago, this \nCongress cut Legal Services in half. Since that time, the number of \npeople in poverty has grown. We have more poor people. Yet we still are \nnot even at the level we were in 1995 for Legal Services. Imagine that. \nIf we had kept pace with inflation from 1995 to now, Legal Services \nwould be funded at the level of about $566 million. This bill only gets \nit back to $390 million. So we are not even where we were in 1995.\n  Lastly, while I understand what the Senator from South Dakota is \nsaying about violent crime in Indian country and on reservations, we \nare cognizant of that, but why take the money away from the very \nservices helping our Native Americans. As I said, 67 percent of Legal \nServices money spent in South Dakota goes to Native Americans. I would \nsubmit that a lot of that goes to help prevent the kind of domestic \nviolence that results in prosecutorial action later on. Think of it \nlike preventive medicine. Better to have Legal Services there, access \nfor poor Indians who want to come in who may have domestic problems, \nlandlord-tenant problems, child custody problems, whatever, that may \nlead to some kind of domestic violence. Better to let them have access \nto Legal Services and take care of it that way before it blows up into \na violent situation.\n  I, again, hope Senators will reject the amendment of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from Iowa, this \namendment doesn't take anything away from Legal Services Corporation. \nThey received $348 million in fiscal year 2007. This base bill proposes \nto increase that by $42 million, or about 12 percent, to $390 million \nin 2008. This isn't taking away anything they currently have. In fact, \nunder my amendment the Legal Services Corporation gets a 6.3-percent \nincrease over fiscal year 2007. There is nothing being taken away from \nanybody. There is nothing they have today that is going to be taken \naway. They will see a 6.3-percent increase. What this does is shift \nmoney to what, in my view, is a higher priority, and that is the need \nwe have in Indian country for making sure that we are doing a better \njob of prosecuting cases and enforcing the law. We have a serious \nproblem.\n  This is from the Justice Department: American Indians annually \nexperience 7 sexual assaults per 1,000 residents compared with 3 per \n1,000 among African Americans and 2 per 1,000 among whites. The \nstatistics are in front of us. We cannot afford to allow these \nconditions to continue to exist at a time when we have a lot of young \npeople coming up on Indian reservations who need access to good \neducation, need an opportunity to achieve their dreams. You just can't \ndo that absent public safety. What we have today in Indian country is a \nvery serious situation. For everybody who comes into my office, this is \nthe issue that continues to recur that they share with me. We have to \naddress it. I believe we have a responsibility to do that.\n  This amendment does it in a responsible way, not by cutting anything \nfor an organization from where it is today, but it simply reduces the \nincrease that the Legal Services Corporation would get, from a 12-\npercent increase over last year's level to a 6.3-percent increase over \nlast year's level, which seems a fair way of going about this.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and to do something \nabout law enforcement and the crime problem that exists today on \nAmerica's Indian reservations. In so doing, we will improve the quality \nof life for our citizens who live on America's reservations and \nhopefully provide a safer future for their children.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know the hour between 3 and 3:15 has not been \ndesignated for debate, but as the manager of the bill and also as a \nprofessionally trained social worker, I want to speak against the Thune \namendment.\n  What we want to acknowledge is the validity of the concerns to fund \nhelp for the Indian tribes. But let's go to the facts. Fact No. 1, the \nPresident's budget request eliminated dedicated funding for tribes. \nThis very President, this very administration has eliminated dedicated \nfunding for tribes. This committee, on a bipartisan basis, rejected \nthat. It is true, we do need to help get those resources into Indian \ncountry. We do not doubt the validity of that. In response, we said no \nto the President eliminating dedicated funding, and yes to $83 million. \nThis subcommittee will put in $83 million for tribal programs to fight \ncrime, protect victims, and to help troubled tribal youth; $35 million \nfor tribal law enforcement, for training, hiring, for equipment, for \ncourt improvement projects; $28 million for additional tribe \nassistance; $10 million for youth intervention programs; $6 million for \ndomestic violence programs. We have said no to the President \neliminating this, and yes to the $83 million. Even the way OMB counts, \nthat is real money. The second thing is we should not pit one group of \nneedy Americans against the needs of other Americans.\n\n  Let's go to Legal Services. This agency was created in 1974, and it \nhas been fighting for its existence ever since. But little by little \nover the years we made incremental improvements in its funding. \nHowever, in 1996 came a horrendous and Draconian cut. Legal Services \nendured a 50-percent cut in their funding. In 1980, the funding was \n$300 million. Remember what we are talking about now. In 2007 funds, we \nare talking about $390 million. If we had kept funding at the 1980 \nlevels, just\n\n[[Page S12904]]\n\nwith inflation, Legal Services would be funded at $757 million.\n  So guess what. Senator Mikulski, the Democrats take charge. We take a \nlook at Legal Services and we say: We are concerned. We are concerned \nthat for over 1 million people Legal Services helps, 1 million need to \nbe turned away. Fifty percent of the people who come for legal services \nhave to be turned away because of a lack of lawyers, paralegals, and \nother support staff.\n  Let me say this: As a social worker--and, I might add, I am a dues-\npaying National Association of Social Workers member. I was a foster \ncare worker. I was a child abuse worker. I was an antipoverty program \nworker. I am still that kind of social worker, only now I fight it on \nthe floor of the Senate rather than in the neighborhoods of Baltimore.\n  As social workers, two of our best friends were our Legal Services \nlawyers and our school nurses. We could turn to them to have a team to \nhelp get families on the right track. We would turn to those Legal \nServices lawyers so that if a spouse was in a domestic violence \nsituation, we could get the law enforcement help to them. We could get \nthem through a divorce proceeding to get them on the right track, to \ngive them a second chance, to get them moving.\n  Often they were victims of predatory lending or other schemes and \nother scams. It was the Legal Services lawyers to whom we would turn to \nget that taken care of. Sometimes unscrupulous landlords would have \nthem in lead-saturated houses. We could turn to our Legal Services \nlawyers and our public health nurses and we were able to turn lives \naround. Thank God for the Legal Services lawyers.\n  Now, the Senator from South Dakota says this will not hurt anybody. \nYou are not going after a corporation. We are eliminating lawyers and \nparalegals and the social support staff to help 1 million people. Darn \nright you are having an impact. You are not going after something \ncalled a corporation; you are going after our increases there.\n  Now, we did not fund administrative costs. We did not kind of bloat \nup a bureaucracy. Our money is specifically focused on lawyers, \nparalegals, and the social support staff for a difference. So when we \nsay let's take it from Legal Services to help the tribes, well, 70 \npercent of the Legal Services population in South Dakota is Native \nAmerican.\n  So I would hope we are not pitting one group of needy Americans \nagainst another group of needy Americans. We hope you reject the Thune \namendment, support the Mikulski-Shelby bipartisan bill that puts $83 \nmillion in to help with tribal assistance. We are looking at how to \ndeal with additional resources on the meth issues.\n  Let's put Legal Services back on track. Let's help those lawyers. \nLet's help those paralegals. Let's help that social support staff work \nwith people, families, and child services to turn lives around. One of \nthe best ways to really help fight crime is in those early \ninterventions we can do with families. So really, I ask you, with all \nthe professional experience I ever had in these areas, let's stick with \nLegal Services.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote sequence now \ncommence at 3:30 p.m. today under the same conditions and limitations \nas previously ordered and that the time until then be equally divided \nbetween the managers or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3295\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, in about 15 minutes we will be voting \non a series of amendments, and I wish to comment now on one of them, \nthe Ensign amendment No. 3295.\n  I want my colleagues to know I oppose the Ensign amendment No. 3295. \nWhat the Senator from Nevada is proposing is to reduce the NASA funding \nin this bill by $150 million and to put it into something called the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program.\n  Again, we are pitting good ideas against each other. That is why you \nhave to really rely upon the chairman and ranking member, who kind of \nstrike a balance with this bill.\n  In the CJS bill, we did want to fund the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program. We know how important it is because it reimbursed \nthe States for detaining illegal immigrants. This is a priority for \nthis subcommittee, and we provided $400 million to do that. We are very \naware that State budgets are stretched thin, that they should not bear \nthe cost of paying the bill for detaining illegal immigrants. We do not \nwant to create another unfunded Federal mandate there. So working with \nmy colleague on the other side of the aisle, we made sure there was \n$400 million in it. Now, we acknowledge that the Senator from Nevada \nwould like to increase it. We would like to increase it as well. But \nalready the President is threatening a veto because we restored the \nfunding for the COPS Program.\n  Now, the cut to NASA is not a benign cut. It would be a devastating \nblow to NASA. It would be a major setback to the exploration programs \nand a devastating blow to the science programs. It would harm our \neffort to do very important things, one of which is a key priority for \nfunding the next-generation shuttle.\n  The shuttle, as we now know it, will retire in 2010. It is getting \nolder, it has fewer flights that it can continue, and we need to be \nreturning to space with a new vehicle. It is the No. 1 priority, on a \nbipartisan basis, for Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison, Richard Shelby, \nBill Nelson, and Barbara Mikulski, who kind have been the space \nSenators here. Also, it is the No. 1 priority for the administration, \nand it is the No. 1 priority for the director of NASA that we need not \ndelay in getting ready for that vehicle that returns us to space.\n  From 2010, for another 3 to 5 years, we will have no access in space. \nWe are going to rely on the kindness of allies to go back. We cannot \nlose time or ground. Our national security and our national honor \ndepend upon it. Also, this would have a tremendous impact on the state \nof science, which goes to major efforts in terms of better \nunderstanding our planet Earth, where we do suspect intelligent life, \nand also the impact of climate changes. It is wonderful that we win the \nNobel Prize on climate change--and we support our former colleague, \nVice President Gore--but we have to keep winning those. Remember, the \nNobel Prize not only went to Gore but to the scientists studying this. \nRegardless how you feel about the climate crisis, I think we need sound \nscience and sensible solutions. So please, while we are looking at how \nare we going to pay the bills for the detention of illegal aliens in \nState facilities, don't penalize NASA. That would be an incredible \nsetback to national security, to national honor, to national \ninnovation, and a key administration priority.\n  So I hope that when the Ensign amendment No. 3295 comes up for a \nvote, my colleagues will join me in tabling this amendment.\n  I cannot say enough about the cooperation of Senator Shelby and his \nstaff and about finding a balance in this bill, because we had so many \ncompeting needs, and in each one we tried to strike the balance. We had \nthe will, but we didn't quite have the wallet to do what we needed to \ndo. But we certainly have made significant progress and went well \nbeyond downpayments in meeting our responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. \n3295 offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  This amendment seeks to take $150 million from NASA and will give it \nto the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program--a program that is \nalready $400 million dollars over the budget request of zero.\n\n[[Page S12905]]\n\n  At first glance, a reduction of $150 million from NASA's $17 billion \nbudget would seem minimal.\n  However, let's look at the facts. After debating this bill, it is \nclear that NASA is a priority for the Senate.\n  We debated and added an additional $1 billion to NASA in order to \npartially compensate for the funding shortfall NASA has endured since \nthe Columbia disaster. This funding will only cover one-third of the \n$2.7 billion needed to keep NASA on track.\n  To cut funding will endanger NASA missions that will inform us about \nthe world we live in, and cripple our ability to be competitive in \nspace.\n  We are in a space race. While we are the current leader in space, \nthere are many countries that want to take our place and are \naggressively moving forward to do so.\n  The administration has articulated, and Congress has endorsed, a \nvision for exploration. The return of our astronauts to the Moon is a \nPriority and we have provided the funding to accomplish that goal.\n  Now this funding is in jeopardy.\n  And what are we jeopardizing our future for? The State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program--a program that was not requested by the \nadministration, and currently is funded in this bill at $400 million.\n  We are being asked to add $150 million to a program that barely \ntouches many of our States. Since 2000, five States have received 77 \npercent of the $2.8 billion in funding for this program.\n  Let me say that again--77 percent, or $2.2 of the $2.8 billion, for \nthis program since 2000 has gone to only five States.\n  This can hardly be called a national program, although I'm sure it is \nan important program.\n  Yet, our Nation's space program benefits the lives of every American. \nThe work that NASA does, from encouraging students into science and \nengineering careers, to innovative technology advances, improve our \nquality of life. The forward and innovative thinking at NASA helps to \nensure our Nation has the ability to compete, and lead, in the global \neconomy.\n  We are committed to keeping our leadership role in space.\n  In order to do so, we must make the right investments in space at the \nright times. That time is now.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Ensign amendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are 2 minutes remaining under the previous order.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I reserve 30 seconds for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to oppose this \namendment. What we have, thanks to the two Senators who are leading \nthis bill, is emergency funding for NASA to replace the funds that NASA \nhad to expend as a result of the destruction of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia. These are funds that normally would be provided, as they were \nover two decades ago in the destruction of the Space Shuttle \nChallenger, out of emergency funds. Instead, this time, NASA has had to \ntake it out of its hide, out of its own operating funds. Therefore, all \nthe plans of what NASA is doing to complete the International Space \nStation, as well as prepare for the new vehicles, Orion and Ares, in \nthe stack called Constellation, in a program to take us into human \norbit again and eventually to the Moon, as well as all the scientific \nresearch that is going on, it is all coming out of these funds instead \nof out of emergency funds.\n  The two Senators have offered the leadership to make NASA whole. This \nlittle agency which is being starved of funds, they have restored these \nemergency funds. And now here comes Senator Ensign wanting to penalize \nNASA again.\n  I understand my time is up, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3294\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate, equally divided and controlled, prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 3294, offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nEnsign.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, on Ensign amendment No. 3294, I \nsupport this amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well. We have \narrived at a bipartisan solution. It is Ensign amendment No. 3295 that \nthe Senators from Florida and Alabama and I oppose.\n  So on Ensign amendment No. 3294, I urge support of this amendment and \nurge we go to a vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back. The question is on agreeing to Ensign \namendment No. 3294. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, very briefly, this is an amendment that \nwould take $150 million out of the NASA budget. We know NASA has been \nincreased by $1 billion over last year's budget, and we also increased \nthis past week $1 billion in emergency funding. It is $150 million, not \nincluding the billion dollars in emergency funding over the President's \nrequest. We seek to help something that is always underfunded, and that \nis to help especially the southwestern States and their local law \nenforcement to combat criminals who are illegal aliens. There is a huge \nproblem. They do not have the resources. So we took $150 million out of\n\n[[Page S12906]]\n\nthe NASA budget to put it toward programs to help combat not only \nillegal immigration but especially those who are here illegally and who \nare committing crimes. That is simply what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President and colleagues, I hope very much we \nwill not adopt this amendment. We are already looking at a 5-year gap \nbetween 2010 when the shuttle goes out of existence and 2015 when the \ncrew-returned vehicle comes online. That is a security risk for the \nUnited States. If we adopt this amendment, we are going to lengthen the \ntime that America cannot put anyone in space. Russia can, China will \nprobably be able to, India may be able to, but not America. That is a \nsecurity risk I am not ready to take, and I hope my colleagues will \ndefeat this amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I too oppose the Ensign amendment. We \nhave met our responsibility to the State Criminal Alien Program. We \nhave put $400 million in it. I believe the amendment is unnecessary.\n  I oppose it, and I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 3317, offered by the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Thune.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last year the Legal Services Corporation \nwas funded at $348 million. This year the administration's budget \nproposed a funding level of $311 million. The base bill under \nconsideration today funds the Legal Services Corporation at $390 \nmillion, which would be a 12-percent increase over the appropriated \nlevel in fiscal year 2007. What my amendment does is simply takes $20 \nmillion out of that increase. It still increases the Legal Services \nCorporation by 6.3 percent over fiscal year 2007 but takes $20 million \nof that proposed increase for the Legal Services Corporation and \napplies it to fighting violent crime on America's Indian reservations \nby increasing funding for our U.S. attorneys so they can prosecute \ncrimes committed on Indian reservations.\n  Around the country, 56 percent of crimes that are brought to U.S. \nAttorney's Offices end up being prosecuted. On Indian reservations that \nnumber is 30 percent. People on Indian reservations should not have to \nlive in fear. Public safety is something for which we have \nresponsibility. It is important we do something to address that. This \namendment will move money toward fighting crime on Indian reservations \nto make it safer for people who live there.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself, \nwe vigorously oppose this amendment. We too acknowledge that we should \nhelp people who are victims of crime on Indian reservations. But the \nadministration eliminated all funds to do that.\n  The bipartisan agreement puts $83 million in for tribal programs to \nfight crime, protect victims, and help troubled tribal youth. What this \namendment does is take money out of the first meaningful increase that \nLegal Services has had. This does not take money from something called \na corporation, it takes it out of the lawyers, the paralegals, and the \nsupport staff who provide legal services to the poor in this country. \nIn South Dakota, 70 percent of those are Native Americans.\n  Senator Harkin and I oppose this moment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer a modified amendment that will \nprovide an additional $15 million for the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica so the Clubs can continue to help our Nation's children become \nproductive, law abiding teenagers and contributing adults.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure that our children are safe and \nsecure. I know firsthand how well Boys and Girls Clubs work and what \ntopnotch organizations they are. When I was a prosecutor in Vermont, I \nwas convinced of the great need for Boys and Girls Clubs because we \nrarely encountered children from these kinds of programs in criminal \nactivity. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was \nsuch a big fan of the work of the Boys and Girls Clubs, that he asked \nme to help fund a club in his district rather than helping him secure \nfunding for a couple more police officers.\n  In Vermont, Boys and Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime \nand supporting our children. The first Club was established in \nBurlington 63 years ago. Now we have 6 clubs in Vermont and 25 other \nlocations throughout the State managed by the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica. These clubs serve well over 10,000 kids statewide. In a small \nState such as mine, that is a significant number.\n  I had a terrific visit last month at the Boys and Girls Club of \nBurlington, VT, and was approached by parents, educators, law \nenforcement officers and others who told me: Keep doing this. It gives \nour children a chance to grow up free of drugs, gangs and crime. That \nis my ultimate proof. If these folks are asking for more clubs and more \nsupport, then we ought to do it.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys and Girls Clubs. Since 1998, \nCongress has increased federal support for Boys and Girls Clubs from \n$20 million to $85 million. Due in large part to this increase in \nfunding, there now exist more than 4,000 Boys and Girls Clubs in all 50 \nStates serving almost 5 million young people.\n  In 2004, Senator Hatch and I worked together to shepherd into law a \nreauthorization of Justice Department grants at $80 million for fiscal \nyear 2006, $85 million for fiscal year 2007, $90 million for fiscal \nyear 2008, $95 million for fiscal year 2009 and $100 million for fiscal \nyear 2010 to Boys and Girls Clubs to help establish 1,500 additional \nBoys and Girls Clubs across the Nation.\n  Because of these successes, I was both surprised and deeply \ndisappointed to see that the President requested no funding in his \nbudget for Boys and Girls Clubs for fiscal year 2008 in an effort to \nconsolidate and cut grant funding in the Department of Justice. That \nrequest will leave thousands of children and their clubs behind. We \ncannot allow such a thing to happen. We seem to find an unlimited \namount of money to send to Iraq, where half the time we cannot even \nfind out what happened to the money after it went there. I would like \nto spend a little bit of that money in the United States to help \nprotect our children. We owe it to them. This will do it.\n  If we had a Boys and Girls Club in every community, prosecutors would \nhave a lot less work to do because of the values that are instilled in \nchildren from the Boys and Girls Clubs. They deliver results and \nrepresent the best of what communities can do to improve the lives of \ntheir young people.\n  Across the Nation, Boys and Girls Clubs are proven and growing \nsuccesses in preventing crime and supporting our children. Our \namendment will restore funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America \nto reach $75 million. It also provides an offset by rescinding $15 \nmillion in unobligated balances from the Department of Justice in prior \nfiscal years. It would have no effect on budget authority.\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican idea; it is just an idea that \nmakes sense. It is also an idea that works. We all know instinctively \nthat our Nation's strength and ultimate success lies with our children.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt the Leahy amendment to provide an \nadditional $15 million for the 2008 fiscal year for the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America. Our greatest responsibility is to help children \ninhabit this century the best\n\n[[Page S12908]]\n\nway possible and we can help do that by supporting the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Leahy-Hatch \namendment which will increase funding for the Boys and Girls Club of \nAmerica, BGCA. The Boys and Girls Club of America consists of more than \n4,000 neighborhood facilities that provide services for more than 4.8 \nmillion young Americans each year. Many of the developmental programs \nthat are offered increase and emphasize the education, leadership, and \ncharacter of participating children. The amendment offered today will \nnarrow the gap between the authorized and appropriated funds for the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America.\n  It is easy to see how important the Boys and Girls Clubs are to \nshaping the lives of at-risk youth. By creating an environment where \nAmerica's children can learn and grow, Boys and Girls Clubs helps \nproduce better students, better citizens, and stronger families. Boys \nand Girls Clubs are a vital part of communities across the Nation, and \nby continuing to help fund this organization, the more than 4 million \nyouths served by BGCA will continue to have a place where they can find \nfriendship, mentorship, and support.\n  Congressional support for BGCA has resulted in support for 13 new \nclub start-ups in Utah. Successes like this are being repeated in every \nother State across the country. At-risk children in public housing and \npublic schools, on military bases and on Native American lands have \ncome to know the Boys and Girls Clubs of America as a place where they \ncan be themselves and escape the streets.\n  The tremendous success stories of the BGCA program are abundant. \nThese successes can be increased with the passage of this amendment. I \nfully endorse the amendment, and urge my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nworking with the subcommittee. I know from firsthand experience how \nimportant Boys and Girls Clubs are in keeping our kids safe in \nneighborhoods and also doing the very important work that keeps them on \nthe straight and narrow. Both the Senator from Alabama, my ranking \nmember, and I would like to do more for Boys and Girls Clubs. We are \nmore than willing to accept the amendment of the Senator from Vermont. \nIt has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I, therefore, urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3249), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside in order that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3313\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3313 pending at the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Dole] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3313.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To set aside $75,000,000 of the funds appropriated under the \nheading State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance for activities that \n support State and local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to \n    assist the Federal Government's enforcement of immigration laws)\n\n       On page 53, line 11, insert ``, and of which not less than \n     $75,000,000 shall be used by United States Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement for activities that support State and \n     local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to assist the \n     Federal Government's enforcement of immigration laws'' before \n     the semicolon at the end.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I have just returned from North Carolina \nwhere this morning I attended a presentation by Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement to the North Carolina Sheriffs Association. I heard today, \nas I have many times before, that ICE resources for enforcing our \nimmigration laws are woefully underfunded. They tell me they are \nstretched much too thin, and they are asking for our help. As seen \nfirsthand in parts of North Carolina, the programs carried out by ICE \nwork, particularly where there are partnerships with local law \nenforcement. In North Carolina today we were announcing an exciting \npartnership between our 100 county sheriffs and ICE where tools will be \nmade available to local law enforcement so they can help identify, \napprehend, and remove illegal aliens who have self-identified \nthemselves by committing crimes. But these programs that are so \ncritical to enforcing our laws must have funding.\n  This is the Senate's opportunity to act to make certain that these \nvaluable programs are funded and our law enforcement professionals have \nthe tools they need. My amendment would target $75 million in funds \nappropriated by the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program to benefit \nlocal law enforcement agencies as they assist ICE in enforcing Federal \nimmigration laws. When it comes to tackling this complex issue of \nimmigration, an important first step must be addressing the criminal \nelement and ensuring that people can feel safe in their homes and \ncommunities. We have all heard about families shattered when an illegal \nalien driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol or engaged in \ngang-related activity kills a law-abiding citizen. Many tragedies can \nbe prevented if we give our local law enforcement officials the tools \nand resources to identify and process illegal criminal aliens. \nProviding greater funding for ICE programs will demonstrate our \ncommitment to helping local law enforcement officials secure the \nresources they need, and it is the right thing to do for all our \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, ordinarily I would wholeheartedly and \nenthusiastically agree with the Senator from North Carolina, but here I \nhave to respectfully disagree, not with her intent but where she is \ngetting the money. I rise to oppose this amendment because it would \ntake $75 million from State and local law enforcement that has already \nbeen troubled and under siege and give it to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, an agency that has its own appropriations.\n  I acknowledge the work of North Carolina, what they are doing, the \nfact that they have a unique partnership that has been done. We \nacknowledge that, and we acknowledge that other law enforcement would \nalso benefit. But she is talking about $75 million. The Department of \nHomeland Security received billions. The place for the Senator to have \nmade this fight was when Homeland Security was on the floor, and she \nshould have offered that as an amendment on Homeland Security and \ngotten it through an offset or gotten it in Homeland Security or gotten \nit by raising the Budget Act under a point of order.\n  Let me tell you where we are. When we received the President's budget \nin February, I was horrified, as was my colleague. The COPS Program was \neliminated. That is the program that actually puts money into the \nFederal checkbook to put cops on the street to fight violent crime. But \nit was eliminated.\n\n  Under President Bill Clinton, who created the program--of course, \nCongress creates the programs, but working in partnership with the \nPresident when we did have the White House, we put on the streets of \nAmerica 118,000 cops through that program, and we reduced violent crime \nby 10 percent. But in this President's budget it was eliminated.\n  Then we saw another program called Byrne grants--not B-U-R-N, as if \nwhen\n\n[[Page S12909]]\n\nyou are injured in a fire, but B-Y-R-N-E, named after Edward Byrne, a \npolice officer killed in the line of duty--it was President Bush's dad \nwho created that program, again, with money going to local law \nenforcement to fight local problems, including sheriffs' departments.\n  Now, the Senator from North Carolina is going to gut State and local \nlaw enforcement by taking $75 million out of it. We cannot do this. \nViolent crime in America is on the rise--murder, burglaries, rape, \nother things so despicable I do not want to speak about it on the \nSenate floor.\n  When the Senator talks about her sheriffs, I have sheriffs too. But I \nam going to be one of the posse that helps them shoot straight. That \nmeans they need their resources that will come from State and local law \nenforcement grants we are going to provide for them to either add more \npolice officers, have technology upgrades to maximize their efficiency \nand help them get real convictions, and have the kinds of things that \nwill help them get the bulletproof vests they need, the other more \nadvanced equipment that our rural communities--as the Presiding Officer \nfrom Colorado knows--do not have.\n  So what we did in the Mikulski-Shelby bill is restore $1.5 billion so \nwe could have cops on the beat, so we could have money to fund local \nlaw enforcement for technological upgrades, for the equipment they need \nsuch as bulletproof vests to protect themselves while they are busy \nhelping us.\n  We have to make sure they have those resources. I do not deny what \nthe Senator is talking about, but I will say what she is trying to do \nright now would gut the local law enforcement program. She would have a \nDraconian impact on our ability to put cops on the beat and to also \ngive them the equipment to protect themselves, the technology that is \nneeded to extend their effectiveness and make sure the thin blue line \ndoes not get thinner.\n  So I think this $75 million request is inappropriate. It is \ninappropriate not because of what she wants to accomplish, but it is \ninappropriate because she is taking money out of a Justice account and \nputting it in a Homeland Security account, when we had a Homeland \nSecurity bill and the Senator could have added it there. That was the \nplace to make this fight.\n  Now, we are afraid that no matter how well intentioned this amendment \nis--and I know it is very well intentioned and has a lot of \nintellectual rigor behind it--it is not appropriate to take money out \nof State and local law enforcement and give it to Homeland Security, \nwhen they have their own whole subcommittee, and that was the place to \nmake that fight.\n  It is not about which committee. This is not about committees. But I \nam telling you, the Senator from Alabama and I have worked hard--really \nworked hard--to make sure we are helping our local law enforcement--our \nvery first line of defense--with the resources they need with more \nofficers and better equipment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to \nthe Dole amendment occur at 5 p.m., with no amendment in order to the \namendment prior to the vote and that the time until then be equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I simply wish to make the point that what I \nhave suggested is ICE works at common purpose with SCAAP for money on \nthe frontlines, where it is desperately needed by our law enforcement \nofficials. This is State and local law enforcement. So I think they are \nworking at common purpose. I wished to add that comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North \nCarolina, I am sorry, I was handling a procedural issue. Could you \nrepeat what you said?\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I said what I have said earlier works at \ncommon purpose with SCAAP--the ICE funding--for money on the \nfrontlines, where it is desperately needed by our law enforcement \npersonnel. This is State and local law enforcement.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But, Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, whom I worked with when she was at the Department of \nLabor as well as the Department of Transportation, along with other \nissues in our community--her support for the concern of battered women, \nhomeless women is so well known--this is not SCAAP. This is not the \nprogram that helps pay State funds for the detention of detained \nillegal immigrants. This is taking real dollars in the Federal \ncheckbook out of which local law enforcement can apply for the COPS and \nfor the Byrne grants.\n  So I have to continue my opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think the intention of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is good. I know she is concerned about border \nenforcement and everything that goes with it dealing with immigration. \nBut that is the province of Homeland Security. We have an \nappropriations bill dealing with homeland security. I happen to serve, \namong others, on that committee too. But this bill deals with the \nJustice Department and related agencies.\n  I do not think we should be taking money out of this bill to give to \nHomeland Security for some program or taking money out of Homeland \nSecurity to give to Justice. We have allocations, as the Presiding \nOfficer sitting here knows.\n  I think the Senator means well, but I think this is the wrong vehicle \nfor what she is trying to do, and I oppose her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I oppose the Dole amendment No. 3313. \nI move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

The pending question is now the Vitter \namendment No. 3277. The time between 5:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. will be \nequally divided.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as I look about, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3277\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to strongly urge all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in support of Vitter \namendment No. 3277. We will be voting on that amendment shortly.\n  This is a commonsense, straightforward amendment, reasonable in \nnature, which is supported by the vast majority of the American people. \nIt is supported because it makes good common sense. It says very simply \nthat everyone at all levels of government should be part of the \nsolution and should cooperate fully with Federal immigration \nenforcement officials and should not refuse to cooperate, refuse to \ngive information to those officials trying to do a very difficult job, \nand in those cases where local jurisdictions do not properly cooperate \nwith Federal officials, as is currently mandated by Federal law, then \nthose local jurisdictions will not get COPS funds. It is pure and \nsimple. This is present law. So we tell local and State jurisdictions: \nPlease follow present Federal law. And if you don't, don't expect to \nget money from the Federal Government, particularly in the area of COPS \nfunding.\n  Again, I think it is very important to make clear that we are not \nchanging present Federal law with this amendment; we are simply trying \nto enforce it.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act, and section 642(a) of that legislation, now over 10 \nyears old, is very clear:\n\n       Federal, State, or local government entity or official may \n     not prohibit, or in any way restrict any government entity or \n     official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service information regarding the \n     citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any \n     individual.\n\n  It couldn't be clearer, and it couldn't be simpler. That is present \nFederal law and has been for over 10 years--cooperate and share \ninformation. You cannot prohibit that basic, straightforward, \nreasonable sharing of information. Our Federal authorities have a very \ndifficult job to do, and they can never get it done without reasonable \nminimal help from other law enforcement officials around the country.\n  The problem is there are these so-called sanctuary cities or \nsanctuary jurisdictions that have made it perfectly clear they are \ngoing to ignore that Federal law. They are going to break that Federal \nlaw. They are not going to cooperate in any way with the enforcement of \nour immigration laws. They are going to be part of an active movement \nto flaunt them, to not enforce those laws, and to frustrate the \nenforcement of those laws.\n  Not surprisingly, this is perhaps clearest coming out of San \nFrancisco. There the mayor said very clearly--and this was just this \npast April in response to the Federal authorities' raid on an Oakland \nbusiness, where they arrested 13 foreign nationals who entered the \ncountry illegally--the San Francisco mayor said:\n\n       I will not allow any of my department heads or anyone \n     associated with this city to cooperate in any way, shape, or \n     form with these raids. We are a sanctuary city, make no \n     mistake about it.\n\n  One of his counterparts in the area, the mayor of Richmond, CA, just \noutside of San Francisco, actually went a little further, if you can \nbelieve that, if you can believe it is possible to go further. This \npast February, he said:\n\n       I really don't believe that any of our residents should be \n     living in a climate of fear and terror like this. People have \n     no real criminal behavior at all and have been unjustly \n     placed under arrest.\n\n  That was in response to a raid by Federal officials.\n  So the San Francisco mayor said: We are not going to have anything to \ndo with it, we are going to do everything we can to frustrate the \nFederal law. The Richmond mayor went beyond that and said: We don't \nthink Federal immigration officials should be doing their job.\n  I think that is wrong.\n  This has reached a ridiculous level, Madam President. It is no \nsurprise to the American people that we are not enforcing our laws when \nthey hear local jurisdictions acting like this, flaunting the law, \nignoring clear Federal law that has been on the books for over 10 \nyears. If we have any chance to rein in illegal immigration and enforce \nthe rule of law, Federal officials need reasonable help. That is what \nit will take to enforce our immigration laws. And in enforcing our \nimmigration laws, we will make this country safer.\n  I clearly, strongly disagree with these arguments that somehow this \nis going to lessen public safety. This will increase public safety as \nwe enforce our laws. Surely, surely some horrible and tragic incidents \nfrom the past several months should make this clear.\n  For instance, in Virginia Beach, 17-year-old Allison Kunhardt and 16-\nyear-old Tessa Tranchant were killed when their car was struck by a \ndrunk driver who happened to be an illegal alien. Now, that is tragic \nenough, but that illegal alien had multiple prior convictions for drunk \ndriving. He had gone through the local criminal justice system multiple \ntimes, and guess what--not once had that been reported to immigration \nofficials. If it had, and if immigration officials had properly acted, \nthat person would have been off the street, unable to kill through his \nvehicle.\n  Similarly, in Newark, NJ, some college students were horribly and \ntragically shot execution style by Jose Carranza. Carranza was out on \nbail awaiting trial on two separate felonies. He was also in this \ncountry illegally. So not only was he out on bail under questionable \ncircumstances, but if immigration officials had been notified and if \nthey had acted properly, he could have been under arrest and/or out of \nthe country. Instead, three completely innocent college students were \nexecuted and are dead today.\n  This does have everything to do with the rule of law. It has \neverything to do with public safety. It has everything to do with \ngetting hold of our safety and immigration laws and everyone working \ncooperatively in the right spirit, in the right vein, and following the \npresent Federal law to do just that.\n  I would also note that an identical amendment to this was passed \nquite easily--by voice vote, as a matter of fact--in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Let's act on common sense, let's be reasonable, and let's enforce \nFederal law that has been on the books for over 10 years now. Let's \nadopt this amendment.\n\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from New \nJersey, an outspoken opponent of this amendment, such time as he may \nconsume, reserving for myself the last 5 minutes of my time for my own \nclosing argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for \nyielding me time. Can I get a sense of how much time that is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, as I listened to our colleague describe his \namendment, one might say: Why shouldn't I support this amendment? The \nproblem is, the very issues he described, including the one in my own \nhome State of New Jersey, would not be resolved by his\n\n[[Page S12911]]\n\namendment. That is a breakdown of the system that had nothing to do \nwith communities making a decision not to go ahead and assist and \ninform, when they actually have someone who has committed a crime, of, \nin fact, the status of that individual.\n  What this amendment will do--what this amendment will do--is it will \nundercut the ability of communities to actually prosecute the crime--to \nprosecute the crime. Why? Because a crime is committed against an \nindividual, and if that individual happens to be a victim who is \nundocumented in this country, that community wants--and communities \nacross the country want--the victim to come forth and say: Hey, I had \nthis crime committed against me. I had this robbery committed against \nme. I was assaulted. I was raped. We want the victim to come forward \nand talk about the crime and testify against the perpetrator because \nsociety, the community, is best served by having the criminal--the \ncriminal--put away in jail. If you don't have people coming forth to \ntestify about the crimes committed against them--you might have had a \nsexual predator, you might have had someone who was involved in a whole \nhost of things--the bottom line is, if you don't have the person who \nwas the victim coming forth, you don't get to the person committing the \ncrime, and that person is allowed to stay out there committing more \ncrimes.\n  What if you are a witness to a crime. As a witness to the crime--you \nsaw it, you are an eyewitness--you can help the police, you can help \nthe prosecutor, you can help the sheriff put that person away. But, no, \nyou are not going to come forth because, in fact, your status in this \ncountry isn't clear, and ultimately why should you come forth and put \nyourself in jeopardy?\n  Communities across the landscape of the country have said: We want to \nget to the criminal element. We want that witness to come forth. We \nwant them to come and testify. What the Vitter amendment does is it \ncuts the legs out from under law enforcement, who say they prefer to \nget the perpetrator of the crime and that is much more important than \nultimately going to the question as to whether that person has a legal \nstatus in this country. That is why a large number of people whom we \ntrust every day, who put their lives on the line for us in terms of \nprotecting us as citizens, have said they oppose the Vitter amendment, \nincluding the National Sheriffs Association, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, Major City Police Chiefs Association, \nMajor County Sheriffs Association, and those who, as the chief \nexecutive officers of their municipalities, are actually responsible \nfor making sure that their citizens are protected, the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors--they have all come out in opposition to this amendment \nbecause they understand it goes to the very heart of being able to keep \ntheir communities safe.\n\n  This amendment would deny funding to over 70 law enforcement \njurisdictions in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nthe District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, \nNew York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and \nWisconsin; jurisdictions that have made it their decision to have laws \nand policies and practices that put the enforcement against the crime, \nthat puts the perpetrator away in jail, as their primary goal.\n  There are plenty of things that can be done to pursue people who are \nundocumented in this country if that is the right policy. But denying \nmunicipalities the funding, the Federal moneys for police officers, \nbecause they want to get the perpetrator versus get the undocumented \nimmigrant is, in my mind, the wrong policy. That is why all these major \nlaw enforcement entities, the people on whom we depend, consistently \nare in opposition.\n  Last, it seems to me when the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, in testimony over in the House, said nothing that these \ncommunities do stops ICE, which is ultimately responsible for \nprosecuting individuals, for detaining them and deporting them--that \nnothing by any of these jurisdictions is stopping them from being able \nto do that--as is being suggested, that that is why this amendment is \nnecessary--I think it makes a very compelling argument.\n  Let's make sure the victims of crime come forth. Let's make sure the \nwitnesses of crimes come forth. Let's listen to the law enforcement \nentities that say they oppose the Vitter amendment. Let's make sure we \nhave the community policing opportunities that take place to reduce \ncrime, which has risen 2 years in a row in the country, and ultimately \nlet's listen to the Secretary of Homeland Security who says nothing \nthese jurisdictions have done has stopped them from being able to have \nICE pursue their duty to proceed against an individual who is \nundocumented in this country.\n  I would rather get the perpetrators, those who are committing a rape, \nwho are committing a robbery, who are sexual predators, who are doing \nthose things--who are breaking the law. The rule of law is very \nimportant and there are a lot of elements to that. We want to make sure \nthe rule of law is preserved by ensuring those who can help us put \ncriminals away have the wherewithal to do so and are not ultimately \nafraid to come forth. That helps all the citizens in the community and \nthat is why I believe we should defeat the Vitter amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished ranking member of \nthe subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Vitter \namendment No. 3277, pending before the Senate. I commend Senator Vitter \nfrom Louisiana for offering this important amendment.\n  The Vitter amendment would seek to eliminate Federal COPS funds to \nlocal municipalities with what are commonly referred to as sanctuary \npolicies, whereby law enforcement officials are barred from asking \nsuspects about their immigration status or reporting them to \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.\n  Generally, sanctuary policies instruct city employees not to notify \nthe Federal Government of the presence of illegal aliens living in \ntheir communities. The policies end the distinction between legal and \nillegal immigration so illegal aliens often benefit from city services \ntoo. The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter, would ensure existing law is enforced uniformly across \nthe country by withholding COPS Federal funds for cities that choose to \nviolate the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act.\n  A similar amendment was added to the House CJS appropriations bill \nrecently. In August, a poll conducted by Rasmussen reported a \nproportion of likely voters in favor of cutting Federal funding for \nsanctuary cities at 58 percent for, with only 29 percent opposed. It \nwas an overwhelming vote.\n  Sanctuary policies, official or otherwise, result in safe havens for \nillegal aliens and potential terrorists. Sanctuary policies allow \ncriminal aliens to avoid deportation because they prevent local police \nfrom reporting aliens to the ICE, the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement. Cities that blatantly ignore Federal law and put their \ncities at increased risk of harm by illegal aliens should not be \nawarded taxpayer dollars.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana for offering this amendment and \nurge my colleagues to support the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, who is \na leading expert on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I thank the Chair for the nice comment. I \nwill be necessarily brief here.\n  By depriving major cities around the country of COPS funds, the \nVitter amendment undercuts the efforts of law enforcement and \ncontributes to the growing crime rate in three ways.\n  First, it takes much needed funds away from State and local law \nenforcement agencies that are now struggling to protect their \ncommunities against a rising tide of crime. The FBI's Uniform Crime \nReport statistics indicate that\n\n[[Page S12912]]\n\nfor a second year in a row, crime is increasing. In the first 6 months \nof 2006, murders rose by 1.8 percent and violent crime by 1.9 percent. \nIn 2005, the Police Executive Research Forum found that many of the \nsame cities to which the Vitter amendment would deny COPS funding have \nrecently experienced double-digit increases in murder and violent \ncrime, and the COPS Program has proven to be effective in fighting \ncrime. As a recent Brookings Institute study shows, for every $1.4 \nbillion spent on COPS, society saves between $6 and 12 billion. That is \ntheir report.\n\n  In 2005, the General Accounting Office report found between 1993 and \n2001 the COPS Program contributed to a steady decrease in the crime \nrates.\n  This amendment is going to have a very chilling effect on victims and \nwitnesses in the immigrant community, who would otherwise report \ncrimes.\n  Finally, the amendment would reverse successful Federal crime \npolicies that recognize that State and local law enforcement know what \nis best in their community to drive down the crime rate. It would \ndisregard the judgment of 70 law enforcement jurisdictions that found \nimmigration status confidentiality policies are an effective part of \ncommunity-oriented policing in their States, counties, and cities.\n  To vote for the Vitter amendment, to stay with the Vitter amendment, \nis to vote, I believe, against effective law enforcement. A vote for \nthe amendment is a vote against safer communities, and I believe a vote \nfor this amendment would perpetuate the rise in crime rates all across \nthe country.\n  I understand there is a tabling motion that is going to take place. I \nmay be mistaken. But vote against the Vitter amendment or vote to table \nit.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for the incredible job she has been doing on \nthis, and for the additional funding for the COPS bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to use 2 minutes of my remaining \ntime and reserve the rest.\n  We are talking about present Federal law over 10 years old. Are we \ngoing to enforce it or are we going to flout it? Let's not kid \nourselves. We have all these arguments about law enforcement. I think \neveryone paying attention to this debate realizes it comes down to \nwhether you think it is a problem, a big deal, for folks to be here in \nthis country illegally. The other side of the argument doesn't even \nlike to use the term being in the country illegally. They talk about \n``status issues'' and all of this other politically correct language \nfor the fact that folks are in the country illegally, having broken the \nlaw to get here, and consistently are breaking the law to stay here.\n  That is what the disagreement is about. That is what the debate is \nabout. It is obvious, when you look at the fervor, the political fervor \nwith which so many of these sanctuary cities proclaim their sanctuary \nstatus. It is a cause celebre because they basically do not think it is \na problem for these folks to come to the country illegally and stay \nillegally.\n  As I said, look at this quote from the mayor of Richmond, CA. He is \ncriticizing the Federal authorities, the immigration authorities, for \ndoing their job enforcing Federal law.\n  The American people are watching. They know the fundamental question \nis: Are we going to get serious with the problem? Are we going to get \nserious with enforcement? I suggest this amendment is an excellent way \nto start.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time does the Senator from \nLouisiana have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute one second.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. And how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will use 3 minutes now and reserve the remainder of 1 \nminute.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have spoken on this bill. I thank \nthe assistant majority leader, Mr. Durbin, for helping me work this. \nThe reason I am thanking him is this is a very important amendment. \nThis isn't some throw-away amendment on how we can say we are being \ntough on illegal immigrants.\n  First, every single Senator here opposes illegal immigration. We \noppose illegal immigration. This is why we voted for strong measures \nwhen border enforcement came up. This is why we advocated comprehensive \nimmigration reform. We are opposed to illegal immigration. But we are \nwhere we are.\n  Let's talk about why municipalities have said ``no'' to enforcing \nimmigration laws. Many municipalities, cities, towns, say they cannot \nafford to be the Federal cop on the beat. They know that enforcing \nimmigration law takes a tremendous amount of training and takes a \ntremendous amount of money, and they simply cannot put their resources \ninto that.\n  The second is they have the right to decide how they best want to \nfight crime. Many municipalities have chosen not to ask their local law \nenforcement to enforce immigration laws exactly because they want to \nfight crime. What they would say is, if we go in and we are INS \nofficers or ICE officers by proxy, we will never find a witness, and \nvictims in many instances will not come forward.\n  If you are a young girl and you have been gang-raped by MS-13, do you \nthink you are going to come forward if you think that when you do, \ninstead of getting the protection of the United States of America and \ngetting justice done, you are going to be doubly brutalized and asked \nyour immigration status, and you are the one who is punished?\n  Do you think the witnesses to these brutal crimes that sometimes \noccur in communities--not Latino against Latino, but if someone were \nworking in an office building and saw a burglary, would they say: Heck, \nI am not going to report that, even though I am an eyewitness, because \nthey are going to ask my immigration status? Or if you are walking down \nthe street, and you might be a day laborer, and you see someone mugged, \nyou aren't able to go report it.\n  My time has expired, but I think we need to defeat the Vitter \namendment. At the appropriate time I will make the appropriate tabling \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, in closing, let me address one specific \npoint the distinguished Senator from Maryland raised. I think she is \ngiving the wrong impression to suggest that the Vitter amendment, or \nanything else in Federal law, places some affirmative duty on local or \nState law enforcement to all of a sudden take up the responsibility of \nFederal immigration officials. They have no duty to start enforcing \nFederal law and use up their budget and their time affirmatively \nenforcing Federal immigration law.\n  But what we are saying, and what present Federal law says, is these \njurisdictions cannot establish a set policy that absolutely prohibits \nthat sort of communication and information sharing with Federal \nauthorities. That is exactly what these sanctuary cities, sanctuary \njurisdictions, have done. It is a left political cause celebre to \nproclaim yourself a sanctuary city and actually work to frustrate \nFederal law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I oppose the amendment. I disagree \nwith the interpretation of the Senator's amendment. I want local law \nenforcement to get every nickel they are entitled to from the Federal \nGovernment. Again, I oppose the Vitter amendment. I move to table the \nVitter amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``yea.''\n\n[[Page S12913]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3279\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment provides $23 million in \nfunding to the FBI for purposes of clearing its backlog of untested DNA \nevidence. This backlog consists of DNA evidence from untested rape \nkits, other untested crime-scene evidence, and samples collected from \ncriminal offenders. The amounts provided by this amendment are the \nminimum amount that the FBI would need in order to be able to clear its \ncurrent backlog of untested DNA evidence.\n  Two recent articles in USA Today highlight the nature of this problem \nand why it matters. The first news story--published just last month--\nindicates that FBI's backlog of untested DNA evidence has grown to over \n200,000 samples. As USA Today notes, past experience testing DNA \nsamples indicates that testing the current backlog would probably solve \nover 3,000 rapes, murders, and other serious crimes.\n  Allow me to repeat that statistic: according to USA Today, testing \nthe current backlog of DNA evidence is expected to solve over 3,000 \ncold cases--violent crimes and other serious offenses for which no \nperpetrator currently has been identified. Obviously, solving these \ncrimes would bring relief to thousands of crime victims and their \nfamilies. By identifying these criminal offenders and leading to their \nprosecution and incarceration, testing the DNA backlog would \nundoubtedly prevent many future offenses as well. But first we have to \nappropriate the funds to test that backlog.\n  Another recent article in USA Today describes the costs imposed by \nnot promptly testing DNA evidence. This article begins as follows:\n\n       Under Maryland law, Raymont Hopewell should have had his \n     DNA taken after he was sentenced for selling $20 worth of \n     cocaine in April 2004.\n       But the state police, who lacked sufficient technicians, \n     never got around to it. So no one knew that Hopewell's DNA \n     matched a pair of unsolved rape/murders on the national DNA \n     database. He served a few months in a halfway house and went \n     on to commit three more murders, one rape and four assaults \n     before being caught in September 2005. Then, a DNA test was \n     performed.\n       Hopewell, now 36, pleaded guilty to all five murders, \n     including three that a DNA match could have prevented. He was \n     sentenced to four consecutive life terms last year.\n\n  That is the cost of not promptly testing DNA evidence. The failure to \ntest evidence in just this one case allowed the commission of three \nmurders and one rape that clearly could have been prevented. The USA \nToday story goes on to note that:\n\n     cases in which such missed DNA matches led to further crimes \n     have begun to ``pop up increasingly'' as test backlogs grow, \n     [according to Lisa Hurst, a DNA expert].\n       Cases similar to the Maryland case have been reported in \n     California, Ohio, Illinois and elsewhere in the past four \n     years. ``You have to believe there are a whole lot more than \n     what gets reported,'' Hurst says. ``This is not something \n     that people want to talk about. It's much worse than just an \n     embarrassment.''\n\n  If we want the current Federal DNA backlog to be tested, we must \nprovide FBI with this money. There are not a lot of things that the \nFederal Government can do that will directly prevent violent crimes, \nbut this is one of them. I am pleased that the Senate will adopt my \namendment and allow the FBI to promptly test its current evidence \nbacklog, before another preventable rape or murder is committed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following articles appearing in \nUSA Today printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Oct. 13, 2007]\n\n                      DNA Backlog Piles Up for FBI\n\n                          (By Richard Willing)\n\n       Washington.--The FBI has fallen behind in processing DNA \n     from nearly 200,000 convicted criminals--85% of all samples \n     it has\n\n[[Page S12915]]\n\n     collected since 2001--Justice Department records show.\n       The backlog, which expands monthly, means most of the \n     biological samples the bureau collects have not been stored \n     in the national DNA database and used to solve crimes. DNA \n     from 34,000 convicts has been added to the database since \n     2001, resulting in 600 matches to unsolved crimes, according \n     to statistics furnished by the Justice Department to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee. At the same rate, the unloaded \n     samples could help solve an additional 3,200 crimes.\n       The backlog expanded by about 80,000 samples in 2006, when \n     a law took effect requiring that all federal convicts, rather \n     than just violent felons, submit DNA samples. A new law \n     requiring DNA to be taken from about 500,000 federal \n     arrestees and detainees could swell the backlog. Rules for \n     implementing that law are due early next year, according to \n     Office of Management and Budget documents.\n       Justice provided the backlog data to the committee in July \n     in response to questions posed to Attorney General Alberto \n     Gonzales during an April appearance before the panel.\n       Using different figures, FBI lab spokeswoman Ann Todd said \n     in an e-mail that about 156,000 DNA samples, about 78% of \n     those collected, have not been put in the database. She \n     declined to comment on the discrepancy with the numbers from \n     the Justice Department, the FBI's parent organization. The \n     lab processes about 5,500 samples a month, Todd said. The \n     laboratory receives about 8,000 samples a month, meaning the \n     backlog continues to grow.\n       ``It's embarrassing because it's the FBI, which is supposed \n     to be this powerful organization, but it's not surprising,'' \n     said Lawrence Kobilinsky, biology professor and DNA \n     specialist at John Jay College in New York City. ``Across the \n     nation, backlogs are an ongoing problem, a tragedy, really, \n     but one that it looks like is going to be with us for \n     awhile.''\n       Since 1998, the FBI has maintained a system that matches \n     genetic profiles from criminals and, in some states, criminal \n     suspects with DNA drawn from unsolved crimes. All 50 states \n     and the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., maintain their own \n     databases, which are linked by computer software maintained \n     by the FBI.\n       Through May, the national DNA database held 4.8 million \n     criminal samples and DNA from about 178,000 unsolved crimes, \n     according to an FBI website. It had scored matches that \n     assisted 50,343 investigations.\n       The FBI's exacting testing standards caused the DNA \n     ``bottleneck,'' Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard \n     Hertling said in a letter to the committee. The FBI lab is \n     studying an automated system that could cut test times \n     significantly, he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Oct. 13, 2007]\n\n                   DNA Lag Leaves Potential for Crime\n\n                          (By Richard Willing)\n\n       Washington.--Under Maryland law, Raymont Hopewell should \n     have had his DNA taken after he was sentenced for selling $20 \n     worth of cocaine in April 2004.\n       But the state police, who lacked sufficient technicians, \n     never got around to it.

He was \n     sentenced to four consecutive life terms last year.\n       Since 1998, the state and federal governments have used a \n     computer database to match genetic samples from convicted or \n     suspected criminals to DNA taken at the scene of unsolved \n     crimes.\n       The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which is overseen by \n     the FBI, has become a staple of television crime shows and \n     has produced some dramatic results. It has made matches that \n     caught criminals or otherwise aided in nearly 50,500 cases \n     since the system's inception. The DNA profiles of about 4 \n     million criminals have been added to the system since 2001.\n       Along with the success stories, however, comes a growing \n     list of DNA samples collected but not analyzed. Lisa Hurst, \n     who edits the DNAResource.com website, said cases in which \n     such missed DNA matches led to further crimes have begun to \n     ``pop up increasingly'' as test backlogs grow.\n       Cases similar to the Maryland case have been reported in \n     California, Ohio, Illinois and elsewhere in the past four \n     years. ``You have to believe there are a whole lot more than \n     what gets reported,'' Hurst says. ``This is not something \n     that people want to talk about. It's much worse than just an \n     embarrassment.''\n       At first, most states and the federal government took DNA \n     samples only from people convicted of the most serious \n     felonies, such as rape and murder. As DNA has proved its \n     usefulness, legislators have sought to extend its reach to \n     people convicted of lesser offenses and even to arrestees.\n       Forty-five states and the federal government require DNA \n     samples from all felons, and 11 states take it from some \n     arrestees. Next year, the federal government is scheduled to \n     begin taking DNA samples from as many as 500,000 new federal \n     arrestees and detainees such as immigration violators.\n       DNA testing requirements began to strap overworked crime \n     labs. In 2003, the Justice Department estimated that \n     nationwide, 200,000 to 300,000 samples had been taken and \n     awaited analysis, while as many as 1 million more awaited \n     testing. By this July, the FBI's backlog by itself totaled \n     nearly 200,000, according to Justice Department records.\n       Congress has tried to bridge the gap, allocating over $560 \n     million since 1999 to allow states to outsource some DNA \n     testing, to hire staff and to improve lab capacity.\n       Barry Fisher, director of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs \n     Department crime lab, says the federal payments have had \n     ``some success'' but have had trouble keeping up with ever-\n     increasing demands.\n       In California this year, for instance, a combination of \n     federal and state grants reduced a 160,000 backlog by more \n     than half, according to state Department of Justice research. \n     But a state law that takes effect in 2009 will add DNA \n     samples from felony arrestees and others, probably adding \n     400,000 samples per year to the backlog.\n       It's critical for the FBI to cut its backlog before the \n     federal government starts taking DNA from immigration \n     violators and other federal detainees next year, said Rep. \n     Dave Reichert, R-Wash., a major supporter of federal funds \n     for DNA testing.\n       That program could add more than 1 million samples annually \n     to the FBI's workload, according to a paper an FBI technician \n     presented at a science conference in February.\n       ``We can get them more money and more people, but the \n     bottom line is, (the FBI) has got to get those DNA samples up \n     there,'' says Reichert, a former King County sheriff. ``It's \n     the only way the DNA does everything it's capable of.''\n       President Bush's DNA initiative, a five-year plan designed \n     to improve the use of DNA in the criminal justice system, has \n     accounted for about 75% of the federal DNA spending. Funding \n     expires after this year, and no follow-up legislation has \n     been proposed.\n       Increased use of technology and private sector management \n     techniques helped the Forensic Science Service (FSS), the \n     United Kingdom's national lab, eliminate a 500,000-sample \n     backlog in 2004, says Richard Pinchin, the service's director \n     of U.S. operations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3304\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am greatly concerned about the environmental impacts of \nthe federally owned obsolete vessels in Suisun Bay, CA, on the marine \nenvironment. We need to ensure that these vessels are properly cleaned \nand disposed of, and minimize the impacts of these ships by addressing \nany remaining contamination.\n  I am grateful that Chairman Mikulski and the CJS Subcommittee have \nagreed to accept my amendment to provide funding out of NOAA's \noperations, research, and facilities program to conduct sampling and \nanalysis of heavy metals and other contaminants to better understand \nthe degree of toxic contamination, and to develop appropriate \nremediation recommendations that use the best available science and \nenvironmental practices.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am glad that the subcommittee will include $1.5 \nmillion in NOAA funding in the report to address the environmental \nneeds at Suisun Bay and I pledge to carry that funding through \nconference.\n\n\n                        juvenile accountability\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I want to thank Chairman Mikulski for her leadership on \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science and \nfor engaging in this discussion on how we can best combat violent crime \naround the country. The chairman's expertise and experience in these \nmatters is second to none and I am grateful for her leadership.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his leadership in this area and \nlook forward to working with him on securing funding that is necessary \nto fight violent crime across the country. I know from our \nconversations of your concern for your home State of Pennsylvania and \nyour particular concern about the recent rise in violent crime in \nPhiladelphia.\n  Mr. CASEY. As the Senator knows, I have authored an amendment to the \nCommerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill that would increase \nfunding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program by $30 \nmillion. On behalf of Senator Biden and Chairman Mikulski, I have also \noffered an amendment that would increase funding for the Community \nOriented Policing Services Program by $110 million. I am also a strong \nsupporter of the Byrne justice assistance grant program, and I \nappreciate Chairman Mikulski's efforts to significantly increase \nfunding for this program. If we truly want to decrease violent crime, \nresearch and evidence-based practices show that we must simultaneously \ninvest in law enforcement programs and\n\n[[Page S12916]]\n\nprevention and intervention services for young people. My support for \nthese amendments, for the Byrne/JAG program, and for the underlying \nbill, reflect my strong commitment to this two-prong approach to \nreducing crime. Would the chairman permit me a moment to discuss the \nmerits of the juvenile accountability block grant program?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Certainly.\n  Mr. CASEY. As the chairman knows, the juvenile accountability block \ngrant program, or JABG as it is more commonly known, is a bipartisan \nprogram that was originally created in 1998 for the purpose of \nstrengthening and creating greater accountability within the juvenile \njustice system. Funds are available for many program purposes, \nincluding building, expanding, and operating temporary or permanent \njuvenile correction or detention facilities, training of correctional \npersonnel, developing and administering accountability-based sanctions \nfor juvenile offenders, hiring additional juvenile judges, prosecutors, \nprobation officers, and court-appointed defenders, and funding pretrial \nservices for juveniles.\n  The program has been reauthorized twice since 1998, and additional \nprogram areas purposes now allow States to implement graduated \nsanctions programs that include counseling, restitution, community \nservice, and supervised probation, to establish or expand substance \nabuse programs, and to promote mental health screening and treatment. \nProgram funds can also be used to establish and maintain restorative \njustice programs, which focus on creative sentencing and meaningful \naccountability measures for juvenile offenders. JABG can also be used \nto fund programs focused upon gang prevention, antibullying \ninitiatives, and reentry programs that help juvenile \noffenders reintegrate back into the community and help lower recidivism \nrates among this population.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have always been a strong supporter of the juvenile \naccountability block grant program and its goals. I wholeheartedly \nagree that we must link law enforcement with effective prevention and \nintervention strategies aimed at at-risk youth. JABG does this and \nassists the juvenile justice system and community-based programs to \npromote accountability among youthful offenders. The value of this \nprogram is that it helps youth understand the impact of their actions \nand holds them accountable. This approach has been shown to be \ninstrumental in helping young people turn away from delinquency and \nwork toward becoming productive adults.\n  Mr. CASEY. I agree with the chairman that holding young offenders \naccountable for the consequences of their actions is one of the most \neffective ways to reduce juvenile crimes. We cannot ``arrest our way'' \nout of this problem. This truth has been emphasized over and over by \nthe law enforcement community. While incarceration is necessary for \nsome offenders, there are other more effective--and less costly--\ninterventions that can be used with many young offenders. That is why \nthe JABG Program has been so effective and is so necessary.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. CASEY. And so, in addition to support for increased funding for \nthe Byrne/JAG and COPS programs, my goal is to increase funding for \nJABG. Unfortunately, funding for the JABG Program has decreased \ndramatically since its inception. Originally authorized at $350 \nmillion, it was funded at $250 million from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal \nyear 2002, then dropped to $190 million in fiscal year 2003, and then \nto $60 million in fiscal year 2004. Since that time, funding has \nhovered between $50 and $60 million. President Bush sought to eliminate \nfunding for this valuable program altogether in this year's budget \nproposal and in previous budget recommendations. Elimination of funding \nfor this critical resource would seriously hamper efforts to deal \neffectively with juvenile delinquency. JABG would no longer be \navailable to communities for the ongoing implementation of important \naccountability programming and service alternatives to youth and \nfamilies involved in the juvenile justice system, including community-\nbased alternatives to detention and intervention activities, and \nschool-based violence prevention programming. I recognize the \nsubcommittee's commitment to this program, and appreciate the \nchairman's role in restoring funding for JABG.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The reduction in funding for this program has been an \nunfortunate result of overall budget cuts in recent years. We have \nworked hard to maintain funding and restore cuts that impact State and \nlocal law enforcement. It is our duty first and foremost to protect the \nAmerican public. I share your support for the JABG Program and would \nsupport your amendment if it were possible to find funding for an \nadditional $30 million. I regret to say that is not the case.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the chairman for her support of this valuable \nprogram and appreciate her tireless work over the years to get our \nStates and communities the funding they need to fight crime. Her \ncommitment to this issue is truly inspiring. While I regret that my \namendment to increase funding for the JABG Program cannot move forward, \nI understand the realities facing the subcommittee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the Senator's remarks and I look forward \nto working with him whenever the opportunity arises to strengthen our \ncapacity to fight crime through increased funding for both law \nenforcement and prevention and intervention strategies for youthful \noffenders.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the chairman and appreciate her support for the \nByrne/JAG Program, the JABG Program and the COPS Program. In \nparticular, I appreciate her support for the amendment offered by \nSenator Biden, myself and others to increase the COPS Program by $110 \nmillion. That is a great victory for State and local law enforcement. I \nassure the chairman and my constituents that I will continue the fight \nagainst crime throughout my Senate career.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3314\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of an amendment to \naddress the problem on fisheries failures in New England.\n  In November 2006, the New England Fishery Management Council imposed \nnew regulations on groundfishing, known as Framework 42. Under these \nstrict new rules, the number of days allowed to fish was effectively \ncut in half. These hardworking fishermen don't catch twice as many \nfish, and they don't get paid twice as much, but they are only allowed \nto work half as much. This is not to suggest efforts to rebuild the \nfisheries are not necessary or important, they are. But we must also \naddress the impact of the regulations we impose.\n  As a result of Framework 42, the States of Massachusetts, Maine, and \nNew Hampshire are seeking the declaration of a commercial fisheries \nfailure. The Magnuson-Stevens Act, which we worked so hard to \nreauthorize last year, allows the Secretary of Commerce to assist \ncoastal communities hit by both natural disasters and regulatory \nburdens. Unfortunately, no funding has been provided in the past and \nthere is no funding in the CJS bill for this purpose.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Senators Gregg, Snowe, and Collins, \nwould provide $15 million for fisheries disaster assistance. It does \nnot dictate how or where this money would be spent. It does not \ninterfere with the Secretary's ability to determine when fisheries \nfailures are declared. It does ensure that fishermen and fishing \ncommunities that may be eligible for assistance under the Magnuson-\nStevens Act have resources available.\n  We sometimes romanticize life on a New England fishing boat. But in \ntruth, it is a difficult and dangerous way to earn a living. The New \nEngland groundfishing industry has accepted strict limits as part of \nour effort to rebuild a fish population that has helped feed us for 500 \nyears. When they shouldered this regulatory burden, Congress said that \nthere would be help. This amendment provides the financial resources to \nmeet this obligation.\n\n\n                             nasa workforce\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chair of the \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, my distinguished colleague from Maryland, in a colloquy \nconcerning current Federal investments in space research programs that \nprovide hands-on training experience for university students in the \nspace science and engineering disciplines.\n\n[[Page S12917]]\n\n  The senior Senator from Maryland has a long history of successfully \nchampioning Federal investment in the National Aeronautics & Space \nAdministration, NASA. That history of Federal investment has kept the \nUnited States at the forefront in exploring space and expanding our \nknowledge of the complex world in which we live today. This investment \nin NASA has also made NASA an important partner of our Nation's \ncolleges and universities in providing unparalleled educational \nexperiences in the critical areas of science, technology, and \nengineering. Scientific research is critical to innovation, yet \nfederally funded science programs have not kept pace with our need to \ntrain future generations of scientists and engineers, thereby \ndiminishing the research and training opportunities offered to \nuniversity students across the country. In the last 40 years, U.S. \nsuborbital experimental launches have decreased 80 percent--from 270 \nper year to 50 planned launches in 2007. Decreases in suborbital \nlaunches have resulted in a corresponding drop in the hands-on training \nopportunities our universities provide to undergraduate, masters, and \ndoctoral students in hard sciences. These training opportunities are \nessential for recruiting and maintaining a highly trained workforce and \nfor protecting our national preeminence in science, engineering, and \nexploration.\n  The National Research Council released a report in June on ``Building \na Better NASA Workforce and Meeting the Workforce Needs for the \nNational Vision for Space Exploration.'' The report recommended that \nNASA focus more of its education budget on workforce-related programs \nsuch as the Graduate Student Researchers Program and other co-op \nprograms. We know that some of NASA's programs involving sounding \nrockets, weather balloons, and small satellite launches are outstanding \nexamples of worthy Federal investment that not only produces usable \nscientific data but provides outstanding hands-on learning \nopportunities for the next generations of scientists and engineers. Our \ninvestment in these programs has not kept pace with demand, and that is \na problem we may want to address in future years as we consider the \nNASA budget. But before we make a decision about the right level of \nfuture Federal funding for these programs, I think it would be helpful \nfor NASA, as one of our premier research institutions, to provide a \nreport on its current investment in suborbital experimental launches \nand what will be needed in the future.\n  I ask my colleague from Maryland, in her role as chairman of the \nCommerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Subcommittee, whether she would \nagree that it would be useful for NASA to study this issue and report \nback to the Congress on it in time for our consideration of the fiscal \nyear 2009 CJS appropriations bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree that such a study would be useful and I thank \nmy colleague for bringing this important matter to our attention.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senators \nMikulski and Shelby for their leadership in drafting the Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill.\n  This bill empowers our police and law enforcement professionals with \ntools and resources to keep our children safe. Today, our police need \nthese tools more than ever.\n  The FBI just released its violent crime data for 2006. After years of \ngoing down, violent crime went up in each of the past 2 years. Murders \nwent up from 2005 to 2006, and nearly 15,000 people were murdered in \n2006. Those statistics are people--people whose lives were changed or \nended by a horrible act of violence. But instead of reacting to those \nstories with vigilance, this administration has reacted by cutting the \nvery programs that keep our streets safe from crime and violence.\n  This bill fights back. It restores funding for the programs the \nadministration wrongly cut and lets families feel more secure in their \nhomes. For example, this bill provides $550 million for the COPS \nProgram, and I was proud to cosponsor an amendment to add $110 million \nfor hiring police officers. In New Jersey alone, the COPS Program has \nadded 500 new cops on the beat. It is because of programs such as COPS \nthat I am proud to support this bill. It is preposterous that President \nBush is threatening to veto it.\n  I must note, however, that there is one provision in this bill that \nis dangerous. Instead of making us safer, it puts our communities and \nthe people trying to protect them at greater risk. That provision is \nthe ``Tiahrt amendment,'' which has been a staple in appropriations \nbills over the last few years. Instead of helping our police, the \nTiahrt Amendment makes their job harder.\n  The Tiahrt amendment limits the information the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, can tell our police about \nguns used in crimes.\n  The Tiahrt amendment does not protect responsible gun owners; it \nprotects criminals, gang members, and gun traffickers.\n  Before the Tiahrt amendment, ATF data showed 60 percent of crime guns \ncame from 1 percent of gun dealers. It is only common sense that police \nshould be able to target corrupt gun dealers, but the Tiahrt amendment \nmakes it difficult for the police to identify those dealers.\n  Limiting access to ATF gun trace information means that police have \nto wait until after a crime has been committed to get information about \ndangerous weapons, instead of being able to get that information to \nprevent crimes. That makes no sense.\n  It is bad enough that the Tiahrt amendment restricts the information \nour police can get, but the language in the Senate bill is even worse \nthan in previous years and in the current House bill. The Senate \nversion of the Tiahrt amendment requires local cops to certify to the \nATF why they want the information--and it threatens them with up to 5 \nyears in jail. It is simply outrageous to threaten our cops with jail \ntime in order to protect the people committing gun crimes. Even the \nDepartment of Justice admitted in 2006 that threatening our police with \ncriminal penalties could create a ``chilling effect'' on law \nenforcement. The Senate language also further restricts the sharing of \ninformation between law enforcement agencies when they do obtain \ninformation from ATF. With violent crime on the rise, we should be \nencouraging law enforcement to work together, not prohibiting \ncollaboration.\n  Simply put, the Tiahrt amendment hurts our law enforcement efforts. \nThat is why more than 10 national law enforcement organizations, 240 \nmayors, and State and local leaders from across the country have joined \ntogether to oppose the Tiahrt amendment. And that is why Senator \nMikulski showed leadership and left this language out of the bill to \nbegin with. Regrettably, the Tiahrt Amendment was added back during the \ncommittee markup.\n  The job of fighting crime is hard enough already. We don't need to \nmake it any harder.\n  I will continue my fight against the Tiahrt amendment until the \nTiahrt amendment is no more.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, nearly 5 months ago, the Congress sent the \nPresident the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, \nand Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act 2007.\n  Despite the President's signing the measure into law on May 25, 2007, \nI have learned with great disappointment that the Office of Management \nand Budget has yet to release more than $104 million included in this \nlegislation by the Congress for the purpose of assisting the FBI in \ncombating terrorism.\n  These were funds that the FBI had asked the OMB to include in the \nsupplemental in order to deal with various aspects of homeland security \nsuch as carrying out the FBI's new responsibility for rendering safe a \nchemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear incident in the United \nStates. The funds were also requested by the FBI to make advances in \nareas such as DNA and other identification technologies, which offer \nopportunities to positively identify individuals and prevent \nterrorists, criminals, and other ineligible individuals from entering \nthe United States, thus better securing our borders.\n  I call upon the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to \nrelease these funds for the purposes identified by the FBI. This is a \ndangerous way to waste time. Nearly 5 months have already been wasted. \nThese funds should\n\n[[Page S12918]]\n\nbe put to use for the purposes for which they were appropriated in \norder to better secure the homeland and combat terrorism.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n3093, the fiscal year 2008 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations \nbill. I congratulate the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, \nand the ranking member, Mr. Shelby, for their fine work in producing a \nbill that supports law enforcement, scientific research and technology, \nand enhances U.S. competitiveness. I would like to take a moment to \nnote just a few of the bill's important provisions.\n  This body recently passed the DOD appropriations bill supporting our \ntroops overseas. The CJS bill supports our day-to-day warriors here at \nhome. That is, our law enforcement officers. It funds the FBI, the DEA, \nand the ATF; Federal law enforcement agencies charged with protecting \nour citizens from internal terrorist threats, international drug \ncartels, and the rising threat of violent crime. Further, the bill \nprovides for important victims' assistance programs for those whose \nlives are forever altered by violent crime.\n  The CJS bill focuses on what is right with America by providing the \nresources needed to compete in the global economy. In my home state of \nMaryland, we are very fortunate to have The National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, or NIST. NIST assists industry in developing \ntechnology, modernizing manufacturing processes, ensuring product \nreliability, and facilitating rapid commercialization of products based \non new scientific discoveries. Advances in avionic navigation systems \nand modern-day mammograms and semiconductors are indicators of the \nvalue of NIST. This bill provides $186 million above the \nadministration's request for this significant agency that is crucial to \nU.S. competitiveness.\n  Maryland is also fortunate to be home to several National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration facilities. NOAA provides scientific, \ntechnical, and management expertise to promote safe and efficient \nmarine and air navigation; assess the health of coastal and marine \nresources; monitor and predict the coastal, ocean, and global \nenvironments, including weather forecasting; and protect and manage the \nNation's coastal resources. NOAA's significance is strongly felt in \nMaryland which, with the Chesapeake Bay, boasts 4,000 miles of coastal \nland. I am proud that this bill strongly supports NOAA through the \nprovision of $4.21 billion.\n  I join my colleagues to note the importance of NASA. NASA programs \nserve a number of functions, such as planetary exploration, pioneering \naeronautic technologies, and space operations. This includes \nmaintaining the space shuttle and supporting the International Space \nStation. Previous cuts, combined with the Columbia tragedy have \nstrained NASA's resources. We must provide the necessary funding in \norder for America to remain a leader in space exploration, aeronautics, \nand planetary science. I applaud the committee for identifying this \ntruth and supporting NASA.\n  I would like to further thank the committee for supporting several \nkey programs in Maryland, including:\n  Chesapeake Bay Programs--The health condition of America's largest \nestuary is critical. Programs that assess, manage, and monitor bay \necosystems are imperative to preserving this vast natural resource. I \nthank my colleagues for recognizing the significance of focusing on the \nChesapeake Bay. Funded bay programs will not only research viable \nrestoration solutions but also focus on educating the public as to the \nimportance of preserving the bay. These education efforts include the \nsuccessful Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education and Training Program, or \nB-WET, that enhances environmental literacy in K-12 students. In \naddition, there are Chesapeake Interpretive Buoys that act as markers \nfor the newly established Captain John Smith Chesapeake National \nHistorical Trail, providing interpretive information for both trail \nusers and educators while also providing essential science information \nabout bay health.\n  Maryland Eastern Shore Broadband Coverage--The bill provides funding \nfor the continued construction of a broadband link between the Wallops \nIsland Flight Facility and the Patuxent River Naval Station. This \ntelecommunication enhancement will help pave the way for high-tech \nbusiness and employment opportunities on Maryland's eastern shore.\n  Maryland Radio Interoperability Project--The State of Maryland has \ncommitted to developing a radio interoperability Project that will link \nState and local law enforcement agencies. Cooperation and shared \ninformation between agencies will develop a more effective, efficient \nlaw enforcement system for the protection of our citizens.\n  Baltimore Felony Diversion Program--The city of Baltimore has \ndeveloped a pilot project designed to divert drug addicted offenders to \nlong-term substance abuse treatment, aftercare, and monitoring as an \nalternative to detention and method of reducing recidivism.\n  This bill is good for Maryland and good for America. I am honored to \nsupport it.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \n$10 million in the Senate fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations Act for the landmark Penobscot River Restoration \nProject, the most significant river restoration project ever in the \neastern United States. I was pleased to work with my colleague from \nMaine to secure funding for this important environmental restoration \nproject. This funding will provide significant federal cost-share \ntoward the purchase of three hydropower dams on the Penobscot River \nthat are slated for removal. When the project is complete, nearly 1,000 \nmiles of habitat for endangered Atlantic salmon and other fish species \nwill be restored.\n  Atlantic salmon populations have declined drastically in the last 200 \nyears, from an estimated half million adult salmon returning to U.S. \nrivers each year in the early 1800s to as few as 1,000 in 2001. The \nNational Academy of Sciences completed a report in 2004 on Atlantic \nsalmon in Maine which identified several specific threats to the \nrecovery of Maine's salmon populations. Top among them was the \nobstructed passage and habitat degradation caused by dams. The National \nAcademy of Sciences recommended that dam removal projects are precisely \nwhat is needed to best enhance Atlantic salmon populations.\n  The Penobscot River Restoration Project represents such a \ncomprehensive effort and is one of the largest, most creative river \nrestoration projects in our Nation's history. In fact, Interior \nSecretary Kempthorne highlighted the project as a successful example of \ncooperative conservation during his September 20, 2006, visit to \nBrewer, ME.\n  The 5-year, $50 million project would restore the natural flow of \nMaine's largest watershed. This project is a partnership of the State \nof Maine, local communities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the U.S. Department of Interior, the National Park \nService, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Penobscot Indian Nation, \nthe Atlantic Salmon Federation, PPL Corporation, the Natural Resources \nCouncil of Maine, and other environmental groups.\n  In addition to enhancing Atlantic salmon recovery efforts, it will \nalso have far-ranging benefits for the entire Gulf of Maine, protecting \nendangered species, migratory birds, and a diversity of riverine and \nestuarine wetlands. Finally, the project will help revive the social, \ncultural, and economic traditions of New England's second largest \nriver.\n  The merits of this project are demonstrated by the fact that it has \nattracted both federal and private support. The federal government has \nalready contributed $5.5 million to this important project, and a \nprivate fundraising campaign recently reached its goal of raising $10 \nmillion.\n  I congratulate the Penobscot River Restoration Trust for its \noutstanding efforts to secure funding for this critical project. Their \ndedication and commitment, sustained over years of effort, have helped \nbring the project closer to completion.\n  The Penobscot River Restoration Project is a critical environmental \nrestoration project. Including the $10 million in the final FY 2008 \nCommerce,\n\n[[Page S12919]]\n\nJustice, Science Appropriations bill is crucial to ensure the success \nof the project. I urge swift passage of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to support the funding bill for the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, Science and Related Agencies and \ncommend Senators Mikulski and Shelby for their hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  This bill provides important funding that will strengthen the \nAmerican economy, promote scientific advancement, and protect our \nnational security. It reflects our priorities by funding State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies across the country. Since September 11, \n2001, these agencies have been on the front lines of Nation's efforts \nto fight crime as well as to safeguard our communities against terror.\n  Our law enforcement officials have accepted these responsibilities \nwillingly and have performed admirably. But for several years, they \nhave been burdened by their expanded role. These agencies have asked \nthe administration and Congress for help--but instead of providing them \nwith the funding they need, the Bush administration and the Republican \nCongress sought instead to cut their budgets. To those who patrol our \nstreets, these repeated budget cuts made no sense, and they made no \nsense to those of us in the Democratic minority in Congress.\n  Thankfully, there's a new group of sheriffs on Capitol Hill. This \nDemocratic Congress is committed to providing law enforcement with the \ntools they need to help keep our communities safe.\n  This bill delivers on our commitment. It provides nearly $2.7 billion \nin State and local law enforcement assistance--$1.5 billion above the \nPresident's request.\n  The American people learned a decade ago that federal funding for \nState and local law enforcement helps reduce violent crime. During the \nClinton administration, we provided meaningful funding for tough and \neffective anticrime programs. The Community Oriented Policing Services \nProgram put more than 115,000 additional cops on the street and in our \nschools. Byrne grants helped fund state and local law enforcement \nagencies, criminal justice systems, and antidrug task forces.\n  This investment in State and local law enforcement paid off. Violent \ncrime nationwide fell by nearly 26 percent between 1994 and 2000. And \nstudy after study showed the link between lower crime rates and Federal \nassistance for law enforcement. In Illinois, nearly $40 million in COPS \ngrants have funded 5,540 additional police officers and sheriffs. \nNearly 700 local and State law enforcement agencies in my home State \nhave directly benefited from this funding.\n  In northern Illinois, the village of Johnsburg has a population of \nabout 7,000. Experts recommend 1 police officer per 400 to 500 people. \nJohnsburg, however, has only 10 officers--an average of 1 per 700 \nresidents. The lack of officers in Johnsburg means that often they have \nonly one car patrolling the streets. This is no way to ensure the \nsafety of small town residents. Small towns like Johnsburg desperately \nneed the funding provided by COPS grants in order to put cops on the \nbeat and keep crime off of their streets.\n  COPS grants also play a crucial role in the war against drugs. I am \nsorry to say that Illinois has a serious problem with methamphetamine \nabuse. In Williamson County, Sheriff Tom Cundiff is using COPS funding \nto train some 150 individuals in dismantling meth labs. This is no \ninexpensive undertaking--the breathing apparatus needed for each person \nalone costs $3,000. Sheriff Cundiff tells me that COPS funding has \nallowed him to train eight times the number of officers than he could \nhave trained without our help.\n  This funding is also vital for the safety of our schools. Nearly $22 \nmillion has been awarded to add 181 school resources officers to \nimprove safety for students and teachers in public schools throughout \nIllinois. Why is this money so important? In Breese, IL, town of 4,000, \nthe population doubles every day as the children of Clinton County \narrive in Breese to attend school. This influx strains the resources of \nthe police department and its six officers. With a grant of just \n$56,000, the Breese police department will be able to install cameras \nand other security equipment in their schools. These cameras will feed \nimages to computers in police cruisers so officers can patrol the \nvillage while still keeping track of what's happening at school.\n  Since the late 1990s, the Bush administration and the Republican-led \nCongress have cut funding for State and local law enforcement, year \nafter year, budget after budget. Not surprisingly at the same time the \nadministration was slashing funds for state and local law enforcement, \nviolent crime rates started going up.\n  According to the FBI's crime reports, violent crime rates increased \n2.3 percent in 2005 after years of decreases, and then rose again by \n1.9 percent in 2006. This represents tens of thousands of additional \nviolent crimes each year. This alarming increase in violent crime rates \nshould have been a call to action. But it wasn't.\n  Instead, the administration's's 2008 budget request tried to cut more \nthan half of all State and local law enforcement funding. It cut the \nCOPS program down to a mere $32 million, virtually eliminated the \nByrne/JAG program, and eliminated the juvenile accountability block \ngrant program.\n  Can the administration honestly say that we should be spending \nbillions of dollars a month to police the streets of Iraq but that we \ncan't afford to pay for proven crime prevention programs here at home? \nEarlier this year, Russ Laine, the chief of police in Algonquin, IL, \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing about \nrising crime.\n  Chief Laine also serves as the vice-president of the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, and he speaks on behalf of chiefs \nthroughout the Nation. He talked about the growing crime problem in \nAlgonquin, a tiny town that had just suffered its first drive-by \nshooting and has seen clashes between violent gangs. He also talked \nabout the strain that law enforcement agencies have felt in trying to \nfight crime while also detecting, investigating and preventing \nterrorist acts.\n  In his testimony, Chief Laine said the following:\n\n       We willingly accept the new responsibilities in combating \n     terrorism, but our ability to continue with traditional \n     policing is our best weapon against terrorism. . . . Law \n     enforcement are doing all that we can to protect our \n     communities from increasing crime rates and the specter of \n     terrorism, but we cannot do it alone. We need the full \n     support and assistance of the federal government.\n\n  Chief Laine, help is on the way.\n  The fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution passed by this Congress \nearlier this year provided $2.6 billion in State and local law \nenforcement assistance programs. It included funding increases for the \nCOPS and Byrne/JAG programs. The bill we consider today further \nincreases state and local law enforcement funding. It provides $550 \nmillion for COPS and $1.4 billion for State and local law enforcement \ngrants.\n  This bill also increases funds the crime and terror prevention \nefforts of Federal law enforcement agencies. The FBI, DEA, ATF and the \nU.S. Marshals are all funded in this bill, and all at levels exceeding \nthe President's request.\n  Let's pass this bill and give law enforcement agencies the tools they \nneed to keep our communities safe.\n  I would be remiss, however, to yield the floor without mentioning \nthat this bill goes beyond providing vital support to law enforcement \nagencies across the country.\n  This legislation also helps another important issue we face today--\nclimate change. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our \nability to monitor severe weather systems, declining fish stocks, \nshortages of freshwater, increased soil erosion, and significant \nchanges to the global climate all depend on NASA's Earth science \nbudget.\n  This bill restores funding for environmental polar-orbiting and \ngeostationary satellites. These satellites provide data about our \nplanet that allow Federal and State agencies, scientists, and industry \nto identify and assess environmental patterns and threats. After the \nBush administration proposed cutting funding for these satellites, \nscientists from both NOAA and NASA reacted strongly, arguing that the \ndecision would place ``the overall climate program in serious \njeopardy.''\n  This measure also provides funding to implement some of the \nrecommendations made by the Joint Ocean Commission to protect the \nplanet's waters. It funds research into\n\n[[Page S12920]]\n\ncoastal areas and the Great Lakes, including studies on invasive \naquatic species. The need to address invasive species is nowhere \ngreater than in Illinois, where the Asian Carp threatens Lake Michigan \nand the entire Great Lakes ecosystem.\n  Global climate change poses a threat to our future and to our \nnational security. Failing to recognize and plan for the consequences \nof global warming would be a serious mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation for the safety of \nour communities and the future of our planet.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that once again, \nthe Senate is considering a bill that mortgages our children's future \nfor our own political gain. To date, the Senate has passed five \nspending bills--the majoirty of which exceeded the President's budget \nrequest. Today, the Senate will seek to add a sixth appropriations bill \nto that list.\n  The Senate Commerce, Justice, Science, and related agencies \nappropriations bill, 2008, H.R. 3093, provides $54 billion in total \ndiscretionary spending and exceeds the President's budget by $3.2 \nbillion. This has prompted the White House to call the bill \n``irresponsible'' and threaten a veto. If this bill passes in its \ncurrent form, the Senate will have approved six spending bills that \ncombined exceed the President's budget by $8 billion. And, the Senate \nstill has six more appropriations bills to consider this year\n  While the recently enacted ethics and lobbying reform measure \nrequires the disclosure of the authorship of earmarks, it seems to have \nhad little, if any, impact on curtailing earmarks. Indeed, 91 members \nsecured earmarks in this appropriations bill alone. There are over 600 \nearmarks in this bill that total $486 million. For example, this bill \ncontains: $1 million for the National Fatherhood Initiative; $500,000 \nfor a Maritime Museum in Mobile, AL; $15 million for a Massachusetts \ngroundfish disaster--I was unaware there was such a disaster--$215,000 \nfor the Alaska Sea Otter and Steller Sea Lion Commission; $360,000 for \nHawaii Rain Gages; over $9 million for Human Intelligence Management; \n$500,000 for Girls, Inc. of New York, NY.\n  And if that wasn't enough, the bill also includes: $450,000 for an \nadvanced undersea vehicle; $500,000 for horseshoe crab research; $2 \nmillion for permanent displays for the Thunder Bay Exhibit; $3 million \nfor the Maryland Institute for Dextrous Robotics; $400,000 for wireless \ncameras in Elizabeth, NJ; $5 million for forensic lab equipment in West \nVirginia; $1.5 million for the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation.\n  In addition, the bill provides funding to many programs that were \nproposed to be cut by the President. It also funds many other programs \nat levels beyond what was recommended by the President's budget. For \nexample, $100 million is allocated for the Advanced Technology Program \nthat the President has sought to eliminate for the past several years \nand $110 million is allocated for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program--$64 million above the President's budget request. \nThe sole purpose of both programs is to subsidize private firms and \nindustries, which, as I have argued previously, are nothing more than \nwelfare programs for corporate special interests. I have fought against \nfunding for both of these programs for many years to no avail, but will \ncontinue to speak out against hard-earned taxpayer dollars being \nprovided to assist corporations that have billions of capital available \nto them on the private markets.\n  Since the bill has been brought to the floor, over $1 billion worth \nof spending has been added. Specifically, the Senate voted to add $1 \nbillion on top of the $10 billion the bill already provided to NASA. I \ncontinue to support NASA and space research, but at what cost to our \nNation's children who will inherit the largest national debt this \ncountry has seen? :\n  Again, I would like to express my disappointment that Senate \nleadership has brought to the floor a bill that is $3 billion over the \nPresident's request, containing more than 600 earmarks. In my recent \ntravels around the Nation, I hear again and again from citizens who are \nfed up with porkbarrel spending, and yet Congress fails to listen. It \nis a shame and I can only hope that the American people will join me \nand the President in expressing their displeasure with this bill. I \nhope that the remaining six appropriations bills do not contain such \nrampant and reckless spending, and that Congress works to regain some \nfiscal discipline.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Senate fiscal year 2008 \nCommerce, Justice, Science and related agencies appropriations bill. \nThis bipartisan bill increases funding for many important programs \nincluding some that aim to improve our Nation's innovation and \nmanufacturing infrastructure.\n  American companies can compete with any company in the world if we \nhave a level playing field, but the problem is that our manufacturing \ncompanies often are not competing against foreign companies, but \nforeign governments. Two of the programs that have helped to give a \nboost to our manufacturing companies are the Advanced Technology \nProgram, recently renamed the Technology Innovation Program, and the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership. Unfortunately, the administration \nhas cut funding for these programs in recent years. This bill turns \nthat trend around by providing the necessary increased funding in \nfiscal year 2008 for both of these important programs.\n  The bill increases funding for the National Institute for Standards \nand Technology, NIST, which administers the Advanced Technology \nProgram, ATP. I have long fought for the Advanced Technology Program, \nand I believe we have achieved an important victory today.\n  The ATP enables U.S. companies to develop the next generation of \nbreakthrough technologies that allows our country to compete against \nforeign rivals who often employ large and effective programs to support \ntheir industries. The ATP invests Federal R resources in public-\nprivate partnerships, enhancing U.S. competitiveness by accelerating \ndevelopment, commercialization, and application of promising \ntechnologies, and by improving manufacturing techniques of small and \nmedium-sized manufacturers.\n  During Senate consideration of H.R. 2272, the 21st Century \nCompetitiveness Act of 2007, the bill that authorizes NIST programs, I \nworked to build support for a more robust ATP program. The Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee chairman offered to support a funding \nincrease for the ATP in the conference committee between the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives, and with his support we were able to \nachieve a stronger ATP-like program.\n  I was pleased that the final legislation that was signed into law \nadopted the Technology Innovation Program. This is a victory for \ninnovation and manufacturing because the TIP Program is basically an \nimproved version of the ATP program which retains many of ATP's best \nfeatures while modifying the program to address past criticism. The TIP \nprogram will continue the excellent work that has been undertaken by \nATP. Like the ATP, it will continue to bridge the gap between the \nresearch lab and the marketplace by providing cost-shared funding to \nsmall and medium-sized companies conducting high-risk R with broad \ncommercial and societal benefits that would probably not be undertaken \nby the private sector because the risk is too great or because rewards \nto the private company would be insufficient to make it worth the \ninvestment.\n  We have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since January 2001. In the \nface of these losses and strong global economic competition, we should \nbe doing all we can to promote programs that help create jobs and \nstrengthen the technological innovation of American companies. I \nbelieve the TIP program is one way to give American companies resources \nthey need in the important fight for American manufacturing to remain \nglobally competitive.\n  TIP allows for greater industry input in the operation of the \nprogram, allows university participation for the first time, and \nrequires the lead grant recipient to be a small or medium-sized firm to \naddress past criticism that grants went to large companies--joint \nventures between smaller and larger companies will still be allowed.\n  I am pleased this bill strongly supports the ATP/TIP program. A \nportion of the new funds must go toward funding new awards which \nguarantees there will be a new competition each year to\n\n[[Page S12921]]\n\nfund high-risk groundbreaking research by some of America's most nimble \nand innovative small and medium-sized technology companies.\n  The bill also increases funding for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program, MEP, providing $110 million in fiscal year 2008 to \nfund MEP centers and to fund a technology deployment pilot. The MEP co-\nfunds a nationwide system of manufacturing support centers to assist \nsmall and midsized manufacturers modernize to compete in a demanding \nmarketplace by providing technical assistance and helping small firms \nboost productivity, streamline operations, integrate new technologies \nand lower costs.\n  The bill also provides important resources to combat illegal \ncounterfeiting of America's innovation and products by providing an \nincrease in funding for the FBI to enforce intellectual property laws \nand to the International Trade Administration, ITA, to improve \nenforcement of our trade agreements. Acknowledging the need to do more \nto fight against unfair foreign trade practices that result in our \ncompanies having to compete not against foreign companies but against \nforeign governments that are often illegally subsidizing their domestic \nindustries at the expense of our industries, the bill provides \nimportant additional funding to the Department of Commerce's Import \nAdministration which enforces U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty \nlaws. This is especially timely since the Commerce Department recently \nagreed it should apply our countervailing duty law to imports from \nChina, a non-market economy, and as a result, an increase in the number \nof subsidy cases is expected.\n  I requested, and the bill provides, $2 million for the Thunder Bay \nNational Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve. The Thunder Bay \nNational Marine Sanctuary is the only sanctuary designated in the Great \nLakes, and it protects a significant collection of approximately 160 \nshipwrecks which span over a century of Great Lakes shipping history. \nThe funding provided in this bill will be used for the completion of \npermanent displays for the facility's new visitor center as well as the \nacquisition of telepresence equipment. The Thunder Bay National Marine \nSanctuary has been in existence since 2000, and the visitors center was \nonly recently constructed. Therefore, it is important that the \nsanctuary construct exhibits for the new visitors center that educates \nvisitors on the maritime history of the Great Lakes. Additionally, the \nThunder Bay Sanctuary will have telepresence to allow students in \nclassrooms across the country as well as visitors to the sanctuary, to \nsee the actual shipwrecks at Thunder Bay through underwater cameras.\n\n  I am pleased that my amendment to enhance the FBI National Name Check \nProgram was included in the bill. The FBI National Name Check Program \nis used to run background checks on many who apply for immigration \nbenefits, and those seeking employment with the U.S. Government, as \nwell as other checks requested by the National Security Agency, other \nGovernment agencies, and some private users. Many immigrants who are \napplying for adjustment of status to legal permanent resident, applying \nfor naturalization, asylum or a waiver end up waiting for months or \nyears for the completion of the name check that the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services, CIS, or other agencies request from the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  The FBI has recognized the flaws in this program. In 2003, Robert J. \nGarrity, Jr., then Acting Assistant Director of the Records Management \nDivision of the FBI stated before the House Committee on Government \nReform that, ``[t]he name check delays have significant consequences to \nFBI customers and stakeholders. The delays impede hiring or clearing \nskilled workers; completing government contracts; student enrollment, \nand . . . clearing requested visas for business visits to the United \nStates. More importantly than all of the foregoing, these processing \ndelays can also diminish counterterrorism effectiveness.'' In the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, Ombudsman's 2007 Annual \nReport, Mr. Prakash Khatri, the USCIS Ombudsman, stated that ``the \nproblem of long-pending FBI name check cases worsened'' since last \nyear, with 93,358 more name check cases pending than last year for a \ntotal of 329,160 pending as of May 4, 2007. Around 31,000 cases have \nbeen pending for at least 33 months. This is unacceptable. If these \nindividuals are a security threat, we must know that sooner rather than \nlater.\n  My amendment would help ensure that these important security checks \nare completed in a timely manner by requiring the FBI to report to \nCongress every year regarding progress made in improving the FBI's \nsystem of processing background checks and automating investigative \nfiles.\n  This legislation restores vital law enforcement funding that has been \ndecreasing for far too long. Although violent crime has increased over \nthe past 25 years, the President has continued to propose reduced \nfunding and the elimination of vital law enforcement programs. This \nbill appropriately restores that funding and reinforces our commitment \nto keeping our communities safe. For Michigan, the bill provides \nfunding training programs for law enforcement personnel, computers for \npatrol vehicles and interoperable communications equipment.\n  I am pleased that the Senate passed an amendment that I cosponsored \nthat increases the drug court appropriation to $40 million. Drug courts \nintervene and break the cycle of substance abuse, addiction, and crime. \nThey place substance abusing offenders under strict court monitoring \nand community supervision, coupled with effective, long-term treatment \nservices, and I am pleased that we have appropriated adequate funding \nto continue these vital services.\n  The Senate has put together a responsible bill that funds the \nprograms that our citizens rely on, in spite of the fact that the \nPresident has threatened to veto it. I am hopeful that these funding \nlevels will remain intact in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now coming to the closing hour of \nthis debate. As we get ready for the Republican leadership to offer an \namendment, then Senator Shelby and I will be making the appropriate \nmotion to move to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                            motion to commit\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now move to commit the bill and send \nthat motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] moves to commit \n     H.R. 3093 to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate with the \n     total discretionary amounts not exceeding the amount \n     ($51,238,522,000) recommended in the President's budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2008 submitted to Congress.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are 16 days into the fiscal year, \nand Congress has yet to enact a single appropriations bill.\n  This bill, should it pass, will never get signed into law.\n  It is time to start taking our obligations to the taxpayers \nseriously. I believe that we can do so in a fiscally responsible way.\n  The bill, when reported, increased spending by 8.1 percent over last \nyear's bill, and it has only grown since it has been on the floor. When \nwe finish this bill we will have increased spending by nearly 10 \npercent--a double digit increase--at a time when the CPI went up only \nby about 2 percent.\n  The American people demand that Congress get serious about \nrestraining spending. We can pass the buck--and fund government through \nmultiple continuing resolutions--or we can make the choices necessary \nto responsibly legislate.\n  Senator Lott and I propose to send this bill back to committee and \ninstruct them to prioritize spending in a way that is both responsible \nto the taxpayer and will secure a Presidential signature. We will move \nto commit H.R. 3093 to the Committee on Appropriations with \ninstructions to report back with total amounts not to exceed $51.238 \nbillion. I urge my colleagues to vote for fiscal responsibility and to \nsupport the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S12922]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with all due respect to the Republican \nleader, I rise to oppose the motion to commit this bill to the full \ncommittee. This bill is the product of strong bipartisan work. Our bill \ntotals $54 billion in discretionary budget authority. Some say we spent \nmore than the President asked. Yes, we did. We are proud of the fact \nthat what we spent money on was that we didn't overspend, that the \nPresident underfunded.\n  We had three--when I say ``we,'' I am talking about the ranking \nmember, Senator Shelby, and I--priorities: Security, keeping 300 \nmillion Americans safe from terrorism and violent crime; our second \npriority was innovation, investments in science and technology that \nwill create jobs that will stay in the United States of America; No. 3, \nreform. We were soundly on the side of fiscal accountability and \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars. We stood sentry over waste, fraud, and \nabuse. We stood sentry over lavish conferences that spent $4 on a \nmeatball. We reformed the NOAA satellite program.\n  But our first priority was also to make sure local communities are \nsafe. We lifted the hiring freeze on DEA agents so they could fight the \nheroin and Taliban in Afghanistan as well as keeping our streets clean. \nWe also, at the same time, added money for local law enforcement, \nparticularly dealing with the fact that the COPS program had been \neliminated and that the Byrne grants had been cut down to only $32 \nmillion. Yes, we added $1.5 billion. We certainly did. People all over \nAmerica who understand what violent crime is know what this means.\n  I know my other colleagues want to speak. I do appreciate the \nRepublican leadership for wanting fiscal accountability and \nstewardship. But I believe we also need to fund America's priorities. I \nbelieve law enforcement and the fight against terrorism is No. 1. By \nGod, we did it in this bill. And by God, this bill should stand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to \ncommit. Chairman Mikulski and I have worked hard with a lot of Members \non both sides of the aisle to meet the priorities of the Senate and the \nNation. This bill funds State and local law enforcement $1.6 billion \nover the administration's request. The budget proposed to cut law \nenforcement to an unacceptable level. The bill fully funds the \nPresident's vision for space and makes critical investments in science \nand education that will be needed to keep this country competitive. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill Senator Mikulski and I have \ncrafted to meet the needs of the Senate and the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to commit \nthis appropriations bill with instructions to report back to the Senate \nforthwith with a total discretionary amount not exceeding the amount of \n$51,238,522,000.\n  Let me make it clear, I understand these appropriations bills are \ndifficult. You have a lot of demands from a lot of Members. You have to \nwork with the administration. You have to work with outside people who \nhave needs, concerns, and priorities. It is not easy to live within a \nbudget. But if we are ever going to begin fiscal responsibility and \nsome restraint on spending, when is it going to be?\n  This is a bill which richly deserves to have some restraint applied \nto it. I think this bill demonstrates why the American public has such \na dismal view of the Congress.\n  At a time when the CPI went up barely 2 percent and average weekly \nearnings went up 3.9 percent, the Senate is considering a bill that has \ndouble-digit increases for these Departments that are involved.\n  Spending for the Commerce Department, not the Justice Department--and \nby the way, I suspect people have some doubts about some of the ways \nthe Justice Department has been spending money--Commerce is up 14 \npercent. Spending for the Legal Services Corporation is up 12 percent. \nOverall spending for Commerce, Justice, and Science--more than $55 \nbillion, a 10-percent increase. How much is enough? No wonder people do \nnot think we have any desire to restrain spending.\n  This is, by the way, not just a partisan charge; it is a problem that \nhas been building for quite some time. At some point, we have to begin \nto say we have to get a control on this. Let's send it back to \ncommittee. They know what is in this bill. I do not want to pit one \ndepartment or one agency against another. It won't be easy for them to \ndo it, but they have the knowledge, the ability to get this under \ncontrol.\n  The proposal the President sent up was $900 million over the previous \nyear--a 1.8-percent increase. But we added--I believe this is correct--\n$4.2 billion over last year's spending.\n  So I think this is a tremendous burden. We can get this under \ncontrol. Why do we want to force this into a confrontation where we run \nthe risk or expectation of a veto and an override when we can get it \nunder control now, hopefully get it under control along the way as we \ngo into conference?\n  I supported the Treasury, Transportation, and HUD appropriations \nbill. I supported going to conference. But there, too, it was $3 \nbillion over the budget request of the President. If you add this up--a \nbillion here, a billion there--the combination is about $40 billion \nover the appropriations bills we have. When you couple that with $20 \nbillion more we added earlier in the year, that is $60 billion more \nthan should be expected in this budget.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let's support the motion to commit. We can \npick away at this earmark or take a little away from this agency or \ndepartment, but we need hundreds of millions of dollars to be moved \naround here. Let these leaders of the committee, who know where the \nfunding is, make some decisions of where we can bring this spending \nunder control.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senator Mikulski for her \nskillful management of this bill. The Commerce-Justice-Science bill \nrequires tough tradeoffs between critical programs that serve our \ncountry well.\n  I thank Senator Shelby for his many contributions to this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I urge Senators--do you hear me?--I urge Senators to vote no on the \nmotion to commit the bill to committee for the purpose of reducing the \nbill to the President's request. If such a motion were approved, the \nbill would need to be reduced by $3.2 billion. Did you get that? If \nsuch a motion were approved, now, the bill would have to be reduced by \n$3.2 billion.\n  Now, to any Senators who intend to vote for the motion, I ask this \nquestion--listen--what programs would you cut? Hear me. What programs \nwould you cut? Stand up. Let me see you. Let me hear you.\n  Should we reduce funding for the FBI while it is struggling to fight \nthe global war on terror and fight crime on our streets? Should we? Is \nthat what you want? Should we? I ask again, should we reduce funding \nfor the FBI? I do not hear anyone responding on that.\n  Should we reduce funding for law enforcement grants to State and \nlocal governments when violent crime is on the rise in this country? \nShould we? Let me ask you again. Should we reduce funding for law \nenforcement grants? Step up to the plate now. Should we reduce funding \nfor law enforcement grants to State and local governments when violent \ncrime is on the rise in this country?\n  This summer, the President signed the America COMPETES Act \nauthorizing increased funding for the National Science Foundation and \nfor NIST. Should we cut those programs that will help to drive a \nprosperous economy?\n  Should we reduce our commitment to NASA? Should we? Should we reduce \nour commitment to NASA? I hear nobody. Why all this silence? I think \nnot.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to commit, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am opposed to the motion to commit \nbecause it would constitute abandonment, a surrender of the Congress's \nauthority to participate in the appropriations process. There is a \nfundamental constitutional issue involved by this body at this time.\n  I believe we ought to be frugal and fiscally responsible, and I have \nrepeatedly supported the constitutional\n\n[[Page S12923]]\n\namendment for a balanced budget so we would live within our means. I \nhave supported the line-item veto. In the tenure I have had here on the \nAppropriations Committee, I have been zealous in supporting programs \nwhich were meritorious and worthy of the taxpayers' money. We all pay \ntaxes, and we know how painful that is. I do not believe we are being \nprofligate.\n  Now, there was an opportunity in the Appropriations Committee for \nthis motion to have been made to establish the President's figure, but \nit was not done. There were opportunities to pare and trim many of the \nitems. But if we are going to accept the President's figure, then we \nare surrendering our constitutional authority to be involved in the \nappropriations process.\n  Now, Congress does not act alone. We all know that. Congress makes a \npresentment, and the President either signs it or he vetoes it. But \ncertainly who can deny we have a role--really the fundamental role, as \narticle I is written--giving the constitutional authority to Congress \non appropriations.\n  Now, we have a similar matter pending on SCHIP, health care for \nchildren. Congress has submitted a bill with a $35 billion increase \nover 5 years. The President has said it is too much. He wants $5 \nbillion. He has said he is prepared to negotiate. Well, that is the way \nthe political process works. The Congress passes a bill, the President \nvetoes it, and then we sit down and try to work it out. But I do not \nthink it is appropriate for the Congress to submit to whatever figure \nthe President puts on it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is he wiser than the 535 Members of Congress? Does he \nhave more authority under article II than the Congress? Article II does \nnot say anything about the President's authority on appropriations. He \nderives that authority by virtue of the Constitution, which gives him \nthe right to sign or veto. But the appropriations authority, all \nthrough the Constitution, vests with the Congress.\n  Now, this is an issue and a vote which goes far beyond this \nparticular bill. Next we have the appropriations bill on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education, a subcommittee which I chaired for \nmany years and am now ranking. If we are going to submit on this bill \nto the President's figure, you can be sure there will be a motion to \ncommit that bill, which is over the President's figure, and a motion to \ncommit all of the bills which are over the President's figure. We might \nas well not even convene and act.\n  These appropriations bills are the result of a lot of very careful \nthought and a lot of hard work by staff and by Senators. We have \nsubcommittees, we have full committee work, and we present it to the \nbody. If there are some motions to reduce it, those motions could have \nbeen made before the bill came to the floor of the Senate.\n  We had a confrontation in 1995, where the Government was shut down, \nand I think a lesson was learned by both branches. I do not think that \nis going to recur. But at least let's try to compromise, to follow on \nthis bill and other bills the same outline which the President has \nrecommended. The President's view was we ought to negotiate and \ncompromise on SCHIP, and that ought to be done here if we are to \nfulfill our constitutional responsibility for appropriations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to \ncommit. This appropriations process is about choices. We have to make \nthese choices. I think Senator Mikulski, as chairman of the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science Subcommittee, and her counterpart, Senator Shelby, \nhave made good choices. If you look at the money that is spent here \nover what the President requested, you have a right to ask: What are we \ngoing to spend it on? When you ask that question, you understand why \nthey made the right choices.\n  Does America need 100 more FBI agents to fight the rising threat of \nviolent crime? We do in Illinois and in Maryland and in West Virginia, \nmaybe even in Mississippi, because we find the violent crime rate \nrising in America. Do we need the 100 more FBI agents the Senator has \ncalled for? I think the people across America would say: Obviously, we \ndo.\n  How about the Drug Enforcement Agency? Is the drug issue no longer a \nproblem in America? I wish that were the case. We know better. What \nSenator Mikulski has done here is put an extra $50 million in this bill \nfor the Drug Enforcement Agency to lift its hiring freeze, to hire 200 \nnew agents to fight the drug peddlers and drug gangs across America. Is \nthat a priority? Is that worth spending more than the President \nrequested? Obviously, it is.\n  Have you been back to your hometowns to meet with the police \ndepartment? Remember what they asked you about first: What have you \nheard about Byrne grants? What have you heard about the COPS Program? \nHow about the Federal money that is going down to police departments so \nthey can have better training, better equipment, and be ready if, God \nforbid, something terrible happens in that community. That is what they \nask me about in Illinois. Senator Mikulski heard that, Senator Shelby \nheard that, and they put an additional $1.6 billion in to go back to \nState and local governments to help on law enforcement preparedness.\n\n  If we ever face another act of terrorism, it is unlikely that our \nlocal residents are going to pick up the phone and call Members of \nCongress. They are going to dial 9-1-1 and pray to God that the party \non the other end of that call is a fire department and a police \ndepartment and a medical responder ready to move, and move quickly and \neffectively. With this appropriation, we will be able to do that. The \nlist goes on.\n  What troubles me about this whole debate is that last year, when the \nRepublican Congress sent spending bills to the President $50 billion \nover his request, he didn't veto one of them. He didn't even threaten \nto veto one of them. He didn't take a trip to South Carolina to \nannounce he was going to veto one of them. Not one. This year, we are \n$20 billion over and the President says: I am standing my ground.\n  Well, let me tell you about the ground that he is standing on. It is \nshaky.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Because in a week from now, this same President is going \nto come to this Congress and ask us for, I say to the Senator from West \nVirginia, $192 billion more for the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. BYRD. Get out of my face.\n  Mr. DURBIN. He will ask us for $192 billion for the war in Iraq. That \nis for 1 year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Just 1 year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is not paid for, and now we hear from the President's \nparty: We can't afford $3.2 billion to make America safe at home, for \nour own police departments, our own FBI, our own Drug Enforcement \nAgency.\n  I think the Members who are pushing this motion to commit believe the \nSenate is suffering from attention deficit disorder; that we cannot \nthink ahead, that the President will just in a few days ask us for $192 \nbillion to make Iraq safe. We know that is coming. They don't want to \ntalk about that. Is it too much to ask for $3.2 billion to make America \nsafe? Doesn't a stronger America begin at home? Doesn't it begin with \nour own Department of Justice? Doesn't it begin with our police \ndepartments?\n  I would say to my colleagues, we understand the choices here, and the \nright choices have been made by this committee on a bipartisan basis. \nThey worked this bill through the committee, and they worked hard on \nit. Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby brought it to the floor. \nAmendment after amendment they have gone through the process. Now, the \nSenate will make a decision: Are we going to toss all their work \noverboard, are we going to commit this bill back to the committee? I \nhope we don't. I hope we stand up for this country in which we live, \nthis country we love that deserves the protection that this bill will \ngive. Let's defeat this motion to commit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I was listening to Senator Byrd, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and he asked \nwho would stand up. I will stand up. I think we ought to cut a lot of \nthings, but the first thing we ought to do is cut out claiming \nsomething that isn't true.\n  What we need to claim is that we can live within the same parameters \nthat every family in this country has to live\n\n[[Page S12924]]\n\nwithin. We are not doing it on this bill. It is not about whether the \nFBI is funded. It is not about the ATF or the Drug Enforcement Agency--\nit is about priorities. There is just $640 million worth of earmark \nnonpriority things in this bill. So we could get $640 million tomorrow \nout of the earmarks that are not priorities, and I will be happy to \nlist for anybody the total for every State, for every Senator who has a \npriority they think is more important than families having to live \nwithin a budget that they have to live with every day.\n  This isn't a debate about the President. This is a debate about the \nfuture of our country starting to live within the means of which we \nhave.\n  The very things we claim we want to do for all the States that they \ndon't have money to do--by the way, there are cumulative budget \nsurpluses over $40 billion right now. Ours is, if you take Washington \nspeak, $160 billion; if you take true accounting, it is $330 billion. \nBut the States have a surplus. The Justice Department had the highest \nunexpended balances they have ever had this last year--almost $1.6 \nbillion. Yet we think they need more money. Does anybody in this \ncountry think every agency of this Government couldn't run 5 percent \nmore efficiently? Nobody outside of Washington believes they couldn't. \nThey know they can because they know they have to make those same \nchoices every day in everything they do because they can't run with a \ncredit card and charge it to their grandchildren.\n\n  Now, 10 percent growth in this bill is too much. This motion to \ncommit doesn't have anything to do with the President. It has to do \nwith whether we will stand up and do what every other American has to \ndo, and that is live within the realities of the money available to \nthem. We can claim that we are doing everything. Since when is fire \nprevention the total responsibility of the Federal Government? Since \nwhen is police protection the total responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment? It is not going to go away. If it is a higher priority, \nthen let's make it a higher priority, but let's get rid of some things \nthat aren't. There are no choices to get rid of things that are low \npriority. We can't have it both ways. Those who want to grow the \nGovernment can't have it both ways. Either you want to live within the \nmeans, you want to be honest with the American people and say: You are \nright; we can do a better job.\n  This bill does not do a better job. We ought to relook at it, \nreformulate priorities. That doesn't undermine what the committee has \ndone. We added $1 billion on the floor. The committee didn't do that, \nwe did. What we ought to say is let's add 2 or 3 percent, live with \nless than inflation, do what every American has to do, and if we do \nthat all the way across the board, then we will start solving the \nfiscal problems that are in front of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will agree to the yeas and nays. \nFirst, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to vote on \nthe motion to commit; that no amendments be in order to the motion; \nthat if the motion is defeated, no further amendments or motions be in \norder and the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate; and that the subcommittee be \nappointed along with Senators Byrd and Cochran; that following morning \nbusiness on Wednesday, October 17, the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3043, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill; and \nfurther, that if the motion is agreed to, then the remaining provisions \nof this agreement be nullified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the majority clerk, Gabrielle Batkin; Erin \nCorcoran; Doug Disrude; Kevin Kimball; and Robert Rich.\n  I also thank my staff who worked so diligently on this bill: Art \nCameron, Goodloe Sutton, Allen Cutler, Rachelle Schroeder, and Augusta \nWilson. Without them, we could not have done it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I, too, thank the Appropriations Committee staff, \nparticularly Charles Kieffer and his able team.\n  Mr. President, I thank the floor staff of both parties, because we \nworked together and showed that you can actually run a bill and have \ncollegiality and have civility and yet have robust debate where we can \ndisagree without being disagreeable.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act of 2008 and that the bill contains higher levels of \nfunding for state and local law enforcement than Congress has provided \nin recent years.\n  I believe that Congress, in partnership with states and local \ncommunities, has an obligation to provide the tools, technology and \ntraining that our Nation's law enforcement officers need in order to \nprotect our communities. I have consistently supported a number of \nFederal grant programs, including the Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, Program, which is instrumental in providing funding to \ntrain new officers and provide crime-fighting technologies. I also have \nlong supported funding for the Byrne grant program, which provides \nfunding to help fight violent and drug-related crime, including support \nto multijurisdictional drug task forces, drug courts, drug education \nand prevention programs, and many other efforts to reduce drug abuse \nand prosecute drug offenders. I know how important these programs have \nbeen to Wisconsin law enforcement efforts, particularly in light of the \nrecent increase in the violent crime rate across the country.\n  I am pleased that the Senate approved an appropriation of $660 \nmillion for the COPS program for fiscal year 2008, $110 million above \nthe CJS Subcommittee recommendation. This funding level, in conjunction \nwith the House appropriation of $725 million, leaves me hopeful that \nCongress will ultimately fund COPS at an adequate level this year. I am \npleased that both Houses of Congress took action to increase funding \nfor COPS, especially as crime rates rise and the needs of law \nenforcement officers and our Nation's first responders continue to \ngrow.\n  Byrne grants also fared better in fiscal year 2008 than in recent \nyears. The House bill allocates $42 million more than it did last year, \nand the Senate appropriated a total of $660 million, $105 million more \nthan last year. The Democratic majority in Congress has made it a \npriority to work responsibly toward restoring funding for these \nprograms--funding that has been disastrously slashed in recent years. \nThe level of funding included in the final version of this bill puts \nCongress back on track towards funding Byrne grants at higher levels.\n  I was pleased as well that the Senate agreed to Senator Menendez's \namendment to bolster the funding for juvenile mentoring programs and \nSenator Dorgan's amendment to restore funding for the Drug Court \nprogram to fiscal year 2005 levels. These grant programs assist state \nand local governments in their efforts to pursue a comprehensive \napproach to crime reduction, including preventive measures and \ninnovative approaches as well as more traditional law enforcement \ninitiatives.\n  I hope that increased funding for State and local law enforcement \nwill become a trend that continues, and that the years of neglecting \nour State and local law enforcement officers are finally over. It is \nour responsibility to support the men and women who keep our \ncommunities safe. The Senate's work today is a good start.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment and requests a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair appoints Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Domenici, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Cochran as conferees \non the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the record to reflect that it is the \nfeeling of the Senate, not just me, of a tremendously good job done by \nthe managers of this bill. Senator Shelby, Senator Mikulski, and I \nserved in the House together. We came to the Senate together. And the \ntwo managers of this bill are two of the very best.\n  Now, I can't say enough positive things about Senator Mikulski. I \nhave told her this. And I don't want to hurt the feelings of anyone \nelse in the Senate, but I have said publicly and privately that the \nfinest orator we have in the Senate is the Senator from Maryland. She \nis outstanding. But not only is she a fine orator, she is a great \nlegislator, and this bill is an example of that.\n  I also want to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance that we got \nfrom the membership of our Senate. This is a bipartisan bill, as \nindicated by the vote that was just taken. So I deeply appreciate the \nwork of all Senators but especially that of my friend from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to share a joy as \nthough in Morning Business, and I ask unanimous consent to have my \nwhole statement appear in case I am not able to make it through this \nemotional sharing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          LILLY'S ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am a grampa again. Incidentally, that is \nspelled with an ``m,'' not an ``n,'' and no ``d.'' Grampa. It is the \ngreatest title anyone can have. It is really indescribable, unless you \nhave felt the thrill, felt the love, felt the awe.\n  This weekend, my son and his wife had a daughter, Lilly Grace. My \nson, like me, had the good fortune to over-marry to Danielle, a \ndelightful young lady from Kentucky whom he met here in Washington. She \nis one of the most organized and focused people I know. My son Brad and \ndaughter-in-law Danielle already have a son, Trey, who first made me a \ngrampa. Now they have a daughter, Lilly Grace Enzi. I can't begin to \nshare the emotion and feeling that overwhelms me today. It is such an \nincredible feeling to hold another generation in your hands, to see \nsuch a miniature person and such a huge miracle.\n  Danielle and Lilly Grace had extremely fortunate timing for my wife \nDiana and me. Trey and Lilly were both born when we were close by in \nWyoming. Trey was born when we were attending a University of Wyoming \nfootball game, just 45 miles away. Lilly was born during a Redskins \nfootball game when we were just 2 blocks from the hospital. Brad \nchecked Danielle into the hospital at 11 Sunday morning, and at exactly \n2 p.m., October 14, that Sunday, we had a granddaughter. Lilly Grace \nweighed 7 pounds, 2 ounces,\n\n[[Page S12926]]\n\nand was 20 inches long, with delicate hands and long fingers.\n  Danielle came through, as is her nature, invigorated and \nenthusiastic. You would not have known by looking at her face, except \nfor the aura of a mother, that she had just given birth. The rest of us \nwere emotional wrecks. When Danielle went into labor, I rejoiced at the \ntiming and extended the weekend another day and had the pleasure of \nholding that baby and watching her breathe and move ever so delicately, \nwith a thousand different expressions, and listened to all the sounds \nshe made. Of course, I had to let Diana hold her a little, too, and her \nmom and dad even wanted turns.\n  If you would have told me that I would spend time just gazing at the \nmiracle of life and having only that thought for hours, I probably \nwouldn't have believed you. But I have some great instant replay \nmemories of that little face and those moving hands and all those \nblankets and the cap they use to hold in the body heat locked in my \nmind, and I am constantly doing instant replays for myself and thanking \nGod for the opportunities he has given me--from finding Diana, to \nlearning about prayer with our first child, the daughter who was born \npremature and who showed us how worthwhile fighting for life is, to the \nbirth of our son, to the birth of our youngest daughter, to helping me \nthrough open-heart surgery so that I might have this chance to hold yet \nanother generation in my hands.\n  I think of the prayer of Jabez in Chronicles where he says, ``Lord, \ncontinue to bless me, indeed,'' and to that I add my thanks for this \nand all the blessings, noticed and, unfortunately, often unnoticed.\n\n  So now I am grampa. That is not grandfather. That is too stilted. \nYears ago, my daughter gave me a hand-stitched wall hanging that says: \nAny man can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad.\n  That is a challenge for grampas to live up to, too. Again, I note \nthat the name is not grandpa. That is a title a little too elevated. \nThis grampa is with an ``m'' and no ``d.'' That is what I called my \nGrampa Bradley, who took me on some wonderful adventures and taught me \na lot of important lessons, including fishing. Now it is my turn to \nlive up to that valued name. He liked being called grampa, and I am now \ndelighted to have the opportunity to earn that name, too. I wish I \ncould adequately share with you the joy that is in my heart.\n  Now, some would say: Lilly Grace, you have been born at a scary \ntime--a time of fear; fear of almost everything: fear of war, fear of \npeople from other countries, fear of our neighborhoods. As an Enzi, we \nhave faith that doing the right thing, doing your best, and treating \nothers as they want to be treated will solve most problems, which will \novercome fear.\n  In my job, I get to hear a lot of disparaging comments about our \ncountry and our Government. But for you, granddaughter, you are lucky \nto be born in this country. I have been to a lot of places in the world \nnow, and I can tell you that there are none anyone would trade for the \nUnited States. In my job, I often have to remind people that I never \nhear of anyone trying to get out of our country.

Mr. President, let me take this opportunity in this few \nminutes to touch on a few issues that I think we do not discuss enough \non the floor of the Senate; for that matter, on the floor of the House.\n  There are a lot of people in the United States who turn on the \ntelevision every night and they hear the President of the United States \nand other people tell them how wonderful the economy is doing; that the \neconomy is robust; that we have never had it so good. This is what they \nhear over and over again. And people start scratching their heads and \nsaying: I don't quite understand it. The economy is supposed to be \ndoing well when I am working longer hours for lower wages? Why is it \nthat my job has just gone off to China, and the new job I have maybe \npays half as much as the job that I lost? Why is it that in the last \nseveral years, actually since President Bush has been President, over 8 \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance? Does that sound \nlike an economy that is working well for ordinary people?\n  Since George Bush has been President, 5 million more people have \nslipped into poverty. Median family income today is less than it was \nback when President Bush first came into office. I think we have to be \nhonest and say, yes, the economy is doing very well, in fact, for those \npeople who have a lot of money. In fact, what we can say today is that \nif you are within the top 1 percent of American wage earners, you are \nprobably doing extraordinarily well. What we can also say is that the \nwealthiest 1 percent today are doing better than at any time since the \n1920s. So I take my hat off to the CEOs of large corporations and to \nthe wealthiest people in this country.\n  But you know, I just had a series of town meetings in the State of \nVermont. I talked to a lot of people. The message I get back in \nVermont--and I doubt it is terribly different in Colorado or any other \nState in this country--is that the middle class is hurting. The reality \nis, if you look at the cold statistics, what you find is that in \nAmerica today the middle class is, in fact, shrinking. People are \nworking longer hours for lower wages.\n  Today, amazingly enough, because of lowered wages huge numbers of \nwomen are now in the workforce. Yet, despite that, a two-income family \ntoday has less disposable income than a one-income family had 30 years \nago. The reason for that is people are spending an enormous amount of \ntheir limited income on housing. The cost of housing is soaring. They \nare spending money on health care. They are spending money on child \ncare. They are spending money on college education. At the end of the \nday, they do not have a whole lot left. In fact, there are many \nmillions of families today that are one paycheck away from economic \ndisaster.\n  It seems to me we have to be honest with the American people and not \ntalk about how great the economy is but talk about an economy which is \nsplitting right down the middle: the people on top doing fantastically \nwell, people down below doing very poorly, and the middle class in many \ncases struggling against economic desperation.\n  The statistics with regard to income distribution in this country are \nstaggering in terms of their inequality. We do not talk about this \nterribly much. I guess it is something we are not supposed to be \nmentioning. But the reality is that according to the latest analysis, \nin 2005 the top 1 percent of earners made more money than the bottom 50 \npercent of Americans. One percent earned more income than the bottom 50 \npercent, which translates to the top 300,000 earners making more money \nthan the bottom 150 million--300,000 making more money than the bottom \n150 million. While the top earning one one-hundredth of 1 percent \nreceived an average income increase of $4.4 million in 2005, the bottom \n90 percent saw their average income decline by about $172.\n  What we are looking at is tens of millions of Americans working hard, \nand they are seeing their health care costs go up, they are seeing \ntheir housing\n\n[[Page S12927]]\n\ncosts go up, they are seeing education costs go up, they are seeing the \nprice they are paying for a gallon of gas to get them to work going up, \nhome heating oil going up, basic supplies going up, and at the end of \nthe year they have less money than they did the previous year. But the \npeople on top are making out like bandits. And it is a fact, many of \nthem are bandits, and it is high time we began to address the issue of \nincome inequality in this country.\n  I talked a moment ago about income. That is how much money people \nmake in a year. But the same phenomenon takes place regarding wealth. \nThe unfair distribution of wealth, which is accumulated income, is even \nmore appalling. Forbes magazine recently found that the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans--400 people, not a whole lot--were worth $1.54 trillion in \n2006; 400 people, $1.54 trillion. That is up $290 billion from the \nprevious year. In other words, while inflation-adjusted real wages \ndeclined for the vast majority of working people in our country, the \ntop 400 wealthiest individuals saw, on average, a $750 million increase \nper person. That is not bad, on average: $750 million.\n  Today, disgracefully--and this is a issue I am going to come back to \ntime and time again until this body does something about it--\ndisgracefully, and despite all the rhetoric we hear around here about \nfamily values, the United States has, at 18 percent, the highest rate \nof childhood poverty of any major country on Earth. Eighteen percent of \nour kids are living in poverty. You go to Scandinavia, the numbers are \n3 percent, 4 percent; Europe, 5 or 6 percent. Eighteen percent--almost \none in five children in this country lives in poverty.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, as I mentioned earlier, \nnearly 5 million Americans have slipped into poverty. We have 37 \nmillion people in this country living in poverty. Almost 9 million have \nlost their health insurance. Three million have lost their pensions. \nPeople work their entire lives, they expect to have a pension when they \nretire, and in many cases corporate America says: By the way, we are \nchanging the rules of the game; thanks for working us for 30 years, but \nyou are not getting the pension you were promised. And median income \nhas declined since Bush has been President by about $2,500.\n  Thirty-five million Americans struggled to put food on the table last \nyear. That is called food security. We have 35 million Americans in \nthis country who worry about whether they are going to have enough to \neat. That number is going up.\n  Within that reality, we have another reality in that the wealthiest \npeople in this country are increasingly emulating the robber barons of \npast decades as they garishly look for ways to spend their fortunes. \nThey have a very difficult time. If you are worth hundreds and hundreds \nof millions of dollars, what are you going to buy? Another pair of \nshoes? It is hard to say. What they are doing is looking into things \nlike yachts that are longer than football fields and all kinds of \nexcesses to show everybody just how wealthy they are.\n  Robert Frank is a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. He has \nwritten a recently published book called ``Richistan.'' He writes in \nhis book that households of a net worth of between $100 million and $1 \nbillion, the very top of the top, spent last year on average $182,000 \non watches--on watches. I have a good watch. It worked well for 5 \nyears. It cost me 30 bucks. But they managed to spend $182,000 in 1 \nyear on watches. That is what they do. It is very important that we \ncontinue to give these people tax breaks. I really do think so. If you \ncould only spend $182,000 on watches, clearly the President is right \nand we need massive tax breaks to help these folks out. But it is not \njust the money they spend on watches. Mr. Frank, the author of \n``Richistan,'' details how, during this 1-year period, the same \neconomically elite households spent $311,000 on automobiles. How many \ncars do you buy for $311,000? I don't know how many cars people need. \nAnd $397,000 in one year on jewelry. Obviously, the stress is very \ngreat figuring out how you are going to spend that money, so they had \nto spend on average $169,000 on spa services. You are sitting around, \nit is a tough thing, what new watch do you buy? What new vehicle do you \nbuy? It is tough, and you need spa services. That is where they are \nspending the money.\n\n  But also, as it happens, during that same year, 400,000 qualified \nyoung people in this country couldn't afford to go to college. They \ndidn't have enough money to go to college. Our Nation is in desperate \nneed of a well-educated workforce. We all know that a ticket to the \nmiddle class in many cases is a college education. So while the richest \npeople in this country are spending $182,000 a year on watches, we have \nhundreds of thousands of kids who cannot go to college.\n  The decline of the middle class, combined with the growing income \ninequality in our Nation, is a national scandal, and it is something we \nmust address. I think it is high time Members of Congress kind of look \nbeyond the wealthy campaign contributors who fund the operations in \nboth the House and the Senate and begin to deal with the needs of the \nmiddle class and working families.\n  Obviously, there are a lot of issues out there as to how we can \nimprove the economy. We can go on for hours talking about that. There \nare a lot of thoughtful ideas here in the Senate and in the House. But \nlet me mention five areas, at least, where I think we should be paying \nsome more attention.\n  First, I think we have to reorder our national priorities. What we \nhave to say to the wealthiest people in this country: President Bush \nhas given you hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks, and yet we \nhave children in this country who are hungry, we have millions of \nchildren who lack health insurance, we have kids who are going to \ninadequate schools. You know what. We are going to rescind the tax \nbreaks that have been given to you so that we can take care not only of \nour children but we can take care of those people who are disabled.\n  I don't know about Colorado, but I can tell you in Vermont one of the \nserious problems we have is higher and higher property taxes. One of \nthe reasons the property taxes for education are going up is because \nthe Congress has not kept the promises it made in terms of funding \nspecial education. Special education, as you know, is a very expensive \nproposition, so local school districts have to come up with the money \nthe Federal Government promised but has not committed. I think we \nshould be adequately funding that and actually keeping the promise we \nmade to special education.\n  We should make sure our seniors get what they need.\n  Our veterans--I am proud to say we are beginning to make some \nprogress in adequately funding the needs of our veterans, but more \nneeds to be done. We have to begin to stand up for all Americans and \nnot just for the wealthiest.\n  When my Republican friends talk about tax breaks and tax breaks for \nthe richest people in country, I say enough is enough. At a time when \nwe already have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income, the \nvery richest who are doing phenomenally well do not need more tax \nbreaks.\n  Second, I think we have to take a very hard look at our trade \npolicies. I think it is clear to anyone who has studied these issues \nthat NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China, and \nother trade agreements were essentially written by large multinational \ncorporations in order to benefit large multinational corporations, and \nthey have done that. They have done that. What is going on as a result \nof many of our trade policies is that corporate America is shutting \ndown plants in America. We have lost 3 million good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 6 years. In my own State of Vermont, we \nhave lost 25 percent of our manufacturing jobs in the last 6 years. We \nare beginning to see the loss of many good-paying white-collar \ninformation-technology jobs--jobs going to China, jobs going to India, \njobs going to low-wage countries all over the world.\n  On the other side, what we are seeing, because of these trade \nagreements, is increased poverty in Mexico, for example, as a result of \nNAFTA. As a result of NAFTA, 1.3 million small farmers have been driven \noff the countryside, off the farms they held for generations, because \nthey couldn't compete with cheap American corn. Poverty has increased. \nBut we do have the good\n\n[[Page S12928]]\n\nnews, I guess, in Mexico: as a result of this NAFTA stuff, there is one \ngentleman named Carlos Slim Helu, a big guy in telecommunications \ncoming from the poor country of Mexico, now the richest guy in the \nworld, worth $60 billion; he passed Mr. Gates. You have a guy worth $60 \nbillion, poverty in Mexico increasing, and small farmers driven off the \nland.\n  We can create trade agreements which work for working people in this \ncountry and working people abroad, not for the CEOs of large \ncorporations, and that is what we have to do.\n  I think given the failure of trade agreements, it is time to take a \nmoratorium to stop these trade agreements until we get them right.\n  On another issue, we have discussed, as you know, a whole lot about \nthe SCHIP program. I strongly support what the leadership here is \ntrying to do. But let us be clear. Let us be clear. While it is a good \nstep forward, bringing 4 million more kids into the SCHIP program, \nthere are millions of children, after we pass this legislation, or if \nwe can override the President's veto, who will still not have health \ninsurance. We are living in a nation in which 47 million Americans have \nzero health insurance. Even more are underinsured.\n  I met recently in Burlington, VT, with a group of young people who \nsaid: Yes, they have health insurance. They have to pay 50 percent of \nthe cost of the health insurance. There is a large deductible. So at \nthe end of the day, despite the health insurance they have, they are \npaying out a lot of money for health care.\n  It is time that we place on the table the fact that we are the only \nNation in the industrialized world, the only one that does not have a \nnational health care program which guarantees health care for every \nman, woman, and child.\n  The programs are different in Germany than Canada, than in the United \nKingdom, than Scandinavia. They are all different. But essentially what \nevery other major country on Earth has said is that health care should \nbe a right, not a privilege--a right.\n  Meanwhile, we spend twice as much per person on health care as any of \nthe people of any other country. Yet, if you look at the health care \nindex situation, our infant mortality rate is very high; in many \ncountries people live longer than we do.\n  Our health care system is disintegrating and the time is long overdue \nthat we have the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry, the \ninsurance industry, and move toward a national health care program \nwhich provides health care to all people as a right of citizenship.\n  Lastly, I am on both the Energy Committee and the Environmental \nCommittee. Both committees are working very hard on one of the great \ncrises facing our planet today; that is, global warming. It is clear to \nme that as a nation, we have got to radically change our course, which \nfor many years under President Bush has almost denied the reality of \nglobal warming. We have got to move away from that and not only \nunderstand its severity but move in an aggressive way to reverse \ngreenhouse gas emissions and to make sure our kids and our \ngrandchildren can live on a planet with the quality of life we enjoy \ntoday.\n  In addition to that, as the tragedy in Minnesota a few months ago \nindicated, our infrastructure is in very serious shape. The engineers \ntell us we need to spend over a trillion dollars to rebuild our \nbridges, our culverts, our waste water systems, and our water plants.\n  In my view, we should be investing substantially in sustainable \nenergy, in energy efficiency, in solar technology, in wind technology, \nand geothermal. When we do those things, we will accomplish two goals: \nNo. 1, we are going to reverse global warming, and, secondly, we will \ncreate millions and millions of good-paying jobs. Instead of spending \n$10 billion a month on the civil war in Iraq, we should be rebuilding \nour infrastructure and moving away from fossil fuels to energy \nefficiency, to sustainable energy as we take a leadership role in this \nworld to reverse global warming.\n  Let me conclude by saying it is no secret that the American people \nnow are not looking terribly favorably on the White House or the \nCongress. I can understand why. I think one way we can begin to win the \nrespect of the American people is to at least acknowledge the reality \nof their lives, to acknowledge what is going on, and then to begin to \nstart addressing some of those problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12928-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with sadness that I come to the \nfloor today to pay respects to one of our former congressional leaders \nwho passed away earlier this week.\n  Congressman Joe Waggonner represented the Fourth District of \nLouisiana from 1961 to 1979. Literally up until the last weeks of his \nlife, he stayed very active in the Fourth District. He was active on \nwhat went on there both at a political level and a civic level, lending \nhis voice to many important efforts in the community--and I emphasize \nliterally up until the last few weeks of his life.\n  He was always engaged, always open, always welcoming to leaders \ncoming into the Shreveport area. He was not from the big city in that \ndistrict, Shreveport, LA; he was from a small town called Plain \nDealing. It was actually a very fitting name for this Congressman \nbecause he was a very straightforward, plain-speaking, progressive-\nleaning Congressman from this small town called Plain Dealing of only a \nthousand people. That small community of loving and supportive \nfamilies, made up of farmers and small business owners and churchgoers, \nprovided a great foundation for Joe Waggonner as he grew and came into \nhis professional life and then became a Congressman from this small \ntown. He was down to earth, he was honest, and he was a Congressman who \nrepresented his constituents with a lot of enthusiasm and intelligence. \nHe was a Congressmen who would see an issue from all different sides \nand then make the best decision he could. His favorite saying was: ``Do \nunto others as you would have them do unto you.'' So he was always \nquite courteous and respectful in the way he treated other people.\n  He was a natural leader. He was a lieutenant commander in the U.S. \nNavy during World War II, and after returning from service there, he \nbegan his political career as a school board member. Throughout his \ncareer, he carried an enthusiasm and excitement and energy for school \nissues and for the children of the Fourth District in our State. In \n1961, he won a special election after longtime U.S. Representative \nOverton Brooks died in office and again continued that great tradition \nof representing the Fourth District.\n  I can't name all the things Joe did for our State. It would be such a \nlong list. But there are a few things that cannot be overlooked. \nBecause of Congressman Waggonner's work in his congressional district, \nBarksdale Air Force Base is now one of the largest and strongest Air \nForce bases and is home to the mighty 8th Air Force. This base had been \nscheduled to close some decades ago, but because of his efforts and \nothers, led by many of the business and civic leaders in that district \nbut primarily because of this Congressman, Barksdale is not only open, \nbut it is now going to be the proud home of U.S. Strategic Command's \nCyber Command.\n  Joe was also known for being a pioneer of interstate highways in \ntheir early days, wanting to put Shreveport on the map. Shreveport and \nBossier City today are growing in large measure because of his fierce \nadvocacy for ports and airports and transportation hubs, as well as the \nBarksdale Air Force Base.\n  Along with my predecessor, Senator Bennett Johnson, Joe's efforts \ncreated a whole new image for Shreveport because of the work they did \nregarding the Red River. With their hard work they opened it to trade \nand transportation. Also, this river is now home to several \n``floating'' casinos that have transformed Bossier City and Shreveport, \nLA, from very sleepy small towns\n\n[[Page S12929]]\n\nto really booming commercial developments attracting gaming interests \nfrom all over the region and contributing mightily to the economy in \nnorth Louisiana.\n  I personally say many thanks to his family--his wife Mary Ruth Carter \nWaggonner, his two children, Carol and David, and his three \ngrandchildren--for the contributions they made supporting a man through \nmany careers in public service in Louisiana. David is a personal friend \nand I know him and his son, Peter, are mourning the loss of their \nfather and grandfather. He was a man of tremendous faith. He made \nLouisiana proud. He served us with distinction and with honor. He will \nbe remembered as a very distinguished and dignified leader for our \nState, particularly north Louisiana.\n  Joe Waggonner was a straightforward, straight-thinking man from Plain \nDealing, LA. He was a graduate of Louisiana Tech University and was \nvery proud of his alma mater and very proud to call Plain Dealing home. \nHis leadership and friendship will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12929-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, in this Chamber, we passed \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program and passed it by a big \nmajority, passed it bipartisanly, when almost two dozen Republicans \njoined, I believe, all the Senate Democrats in passing a program that \nhas worked for 10 years.\n  I was in the House of Representatives when we initially wrote the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. It was written by a Democratic \nPresident, with a Republican House and a Republican Senate. It has \nworked splendidly for the last 10 years. It has, in fact, provided \nhealth insurance for literally millions and millions of American \nmiddle-class families--families making a little bit too much to qualify \nfor Medicaid but families either not earning quite enough to buy \ninsurance or not working in a place that offers insurance at a decent, \nreasonable rate. We know the children who are in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program are sons and daughters of working parents--again, \nworking parents overwhelmingly making between about $20,000 and $50,000 \na year.\n  The Senate passed the Children's Health Insurance Program expansion, \nwhich would have meant, in addition to the 6.6 million children in our \ncountry receiving health insurance under the Children's Health \nInsurance Program today, it would have added about another 4 million \nAmerican children. About 200,000 children in my State--from Ashtabula \nto Hamilton, from Wauseon to Marietta--now receive coverage under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. This would have added tens of \nthousands more to the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Unfortunately, a couple weeks ago, the President of the United States \ndecided to veto this legislation even though it passed with more than \nfour dozen Republican votes in the House joining almost every Democrat \nand passed with almost two dozen Republican votes in the Senate.\n  I wish the President, before he vetoed this legislation, had done \nwhat a lot of us did. I know the Presiding Officer from Missouri has \ndone this. So many of us have talked to families in our States. I have \ntalked to families in Lima and in Canfield and in Columbus and in \nDublin and in Springfield about what the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram means to them.\n  Eleven-year-old Tanner Stainbrook of Toledo has cystic fibrosis. Both \nof his parents work. They are playing by the rules, working hard, and \npaying their taxes. But without CHIP, without the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, Tanner cannot get the care he needs.\n  Seth Novak is a 3-year-old boy who lives in Lebanon, OH, down in the \nsouthwest corner of the State near Cincinnati. Seth has Down's syndrome \nand needs the Children's Health Insurance Program to help him stay \nhealthy. Again, his parents are working, but they simply cannot get the \ninsurance, in part, as with many of these children, because of a \npreexisting condition and also because of the finances the family faces \nand the lack of health coverage.\n  Emily Danko of Columbus also has Down's syndrome. Without CHIP, Emily \nhas no health insurance.\n  I wish the President had talked to the Stainbrook family and the \nNovak family and the Danko family and talked to them about their \nsituations. I am not sure he would have vetoed this bill if he had done \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, the President made the decision to veto this bill. \nWhen he did, he mentioned several things. I would like to briefly touch \non what he said and what the truth really is.\n  The President of the United States said this will result in all kinds \nof families shifting their children from private health insurance to \nGovernment health insurance. Were it so that all those families he \ntalks about had private health insurance--if they all had private \nhealth insurance--we would not be concerned about this Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. But the fact is, most of these families--the \noverwhelming majority of these families--who will be on this Children's \nHealth Insurance Program expansion are not getting private insurance or \nthey are getting very inadequate private insurance.\n  The President said families making up to $80,000 a year could get \nthis insurance. That is patently untrue. If a State wants to do that, \nthey have to apply to the Federal Government, and the President has \nalready said no to the State of New York. He could say no to other \nStates. So that is clearly, simply not true.\n  The President also said the Children's Health Insurance Program is \njust too expensive--a $7 billion-a-year increase over the next 5 years; \n$7 billion a year to insure 4 million children a year; $7 billion a \nyear contrasted with what we spend on the war in Iraq: $2.5 billion a \nweek; $7 billion a year for 4 million children versus $2.5 billion and \nclimbing per week for a war we never should have been in, a civil war \nthe President continues to immerse our Nation in, with no plan to end.\n  The last thing the President said is this program is socialized \nmedicine, that we are going down the path of socialized medicine. The \nPresident forgets to say he and many Members of Congress get health \ncare from Bethesda--go out to Bethesda and get their health care, with \nGovernment doctors taking care of Members of Congress and the \nPresident.\n  The President also forgets to mention that when he calls it \nsocialized medicine, that, in fact, this legislation was supported \nbipartisanly 10 years ago in a Republican House, Republican Senate, and \nwith a Democratic President--hardly socialized medicine supported by \nthat many conservative Republicans back then and today. This \nlegislation is supported by 68 Senators, including 18 Republicans; is \nsupported by 43 Governors, including 16 Republicans; is supported by \nmore than 270 organizations, representing millions of Americans.\n  The beauty of this legislation is for 10 years it has worked for \nAmerica's children. And 6.6 million children have insurance today \nbecause of the Children Health Insurance Program. We can expand this \nprogram at the cost of about $3.50 a day to cover a child through the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and do that for 4 million \nchildren.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great man, \nRepresentative George Sangmeister, a great servant of Illinois who \npassed away on October 9.\n  George served Illinois in more ways than anyone I know; his was a \nlifetime of dedicated public work, and honesty. I had the good fortune \nto work as a staff lawyer in the Illinois State Senate when George was \nserving there. He was kind and determined, and these traits have shown \nthrough his work, his family life, and his long battle with leukemia.\n  Not surprisingly, George came from a family of dedicated Illinoisans. \nHis father was mayor of Frankfort from 1923 to 1955 and a great \npolitical influence on his son. George attended Joliet Junior College \nbefore entering the military to serve in the Korean war. He was always \nproud of his service, and it informed many of his initiatives. He \nalways took time to pay tribute to our warriors and veterans.\n\n[[Page S12930]]\n\n  After serving in the Korean war, George attended Elmhurst College and \nearned a law degree from John Marshall Law School. He spent some time \nin private practice, but was always active in the public realm. He was \na volunteer for President Kennedy's 1960 election and eventually \nreturned fulltime to his public service origins.\n  George started as a magistrate for Will County and then served as the \ncounty's district attorney. In 1972, he was elected to the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives and then to the Illinois Senate in 1976.\n  George was a natural. One of his peers recently noted that ``George \nwas one of those individuals who had an unbelievable capability of \nbringing parties together.'' He was direct yet pleasant; he would stick \nto his position but never alienated those who disagreed. George was \nwidely known as a man of his word, and a true statesman--traits that \nare in short supply in too many places.\n  His integrity and talent led him to become a powerful leader in the \nState senate, and a respected Member of the House of Representatives. \nHe served three terms in the House from 1988 to 1994, and I was again \nprivileged to work with him during those historical years.\n  As the cold war wound down, his attentions turned increasingly to our \nenvironment, our children, and our ability to adjust to a new world \norder. He joined me in pushing to ensure that newly independent nations \nsuch as Lithuania would be guaranteed an opportunity to prosper. George \nwas keenly aware of our Nation's freedom, independence and our history. \nHe regularly addressed his colleagues on Independence Day, rising to \nremind us all of our political origins and the things we must be \ngrateful for.\n  He spoke often on veterans' affairs, the environment, education, and \non issues that directly impacted his constituents in Illinois. He was \nunmovable when it came to fiercely fighting for the constituents that \nhe had served for so many years and in so many ways. Frustrated with \nnational politics, George returned to private practice in 1995, after \nmore than 30 years in public service.\n  George is survived by his wife Doris, their children George and \nKimberly, and four grandchildren. I have expressed my condolences to \nthem in person and assure them now that George's unblemished reputation \nand service will be long remembered.\n  George was a great man and a great friend, and I feel that nothing is \nmore fitting than to conclude his presence in the Congressional Record \nwith his own words. They are indicative of a man who maintained his \nidealism and values throughout life's trials--a man unafraid to speak \nboldly during dramatic times.\n\n       We should begin to worry about educating brilliant children \n     so that America can face the next challenge. Having served in \n     the U.S. Army myself, I strongly believe that national \n     security should be a top priority for the Federal Government. \n     But national security includes having a strong economy and a \n     healthy, well-educated work force . . . What is more \n     important than educating our kids and preserving our \n     environment? . . . As a people, we were not defeated by Pearl \n     Harbor or Watergate or Irangate, and we will survive. But, we \n     must be ever vigilant against the abuse and arrogance of \n     power, whether it be on Wall Street or on Main Street--\n     whether it be by big business or by big government. To fail \n     in our vigilance would mean the death of ``power people.'' \n     And so, let us, as a united people, ``highly resolve that \n     this Nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and \n     that government of the people, by the people, and for the \n     people shall not perish from the earth.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12930-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12930-S12931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Seaman Apprentice Shayna Ann Schnell\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young sailor from Tell \nCity. Shayna Ann Schnell, 19 years old, died on October 1 in Dubai, \nUnited Arab Emirates, from injuries she received in a vehicle accident \nseveral days earlier. With her entire life before her, Shayna risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Shayna was a lifelong Hoosier, growing up in Dubois and Perry \ncounties. Shayna graduated Perry Central High School in 2006 and joined \nthe Navy later that year. After completing basic training in Great \nLakes, IL, Shayna was stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in San \nAntonio, TX. Her hard work earned her an assignment as a master-at-arms \nwith the Naval Security Force Bahrain in the United Arab Emirates.\n  Shayna died while serving her country by supporting Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. She is survived by her mother and stepfather, Suzanne and \nVernon Silacci; her father and stepmother, Doug and Peggy Schnell; her \nsister Nicole; and her brothers Trent and Tyler, who is also serving \nhis country in the Navy. Shayna was known for her dedication to her \nfamily and her love of country. Today and always, she will be \nremembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice she made while dutifully \nserving her country.\n  Today, I join Shayna's family and friends in mourning her death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example she set, bravely fighting to make the world a \nsafer place. It is her courage and strength of character that people \nwill remember when they think of Shayna, a memory that will burn \nbrightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shayna's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Shayna's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shayna Schnell in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for her service to this country and for her \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nShayna's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Shayna.\n\n\n                         Captain Scott N. Shimp\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army CPT \nScott Shimp of Bayard, NE.\n  Captain Shimp's love for the military was obvious to his mother, who \nsaid ``even when he was little, he wanted to be a soldier, running \naround in his camouflage.'' He graduated from Bayard High School in \n1998 as the salutatorian of his class. He was also quite active in many \nactivities: football, wrestling, 21st Century Singers, choir, and the \nNational Honor Society. In addition, Captain Shimp received his Eagle \nScout Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Boy Scouts of America, \nin 1998. Upon his graduation from high school, he pursued his dream of \nbecoming a pilot by enrolling in the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint, graduating in 2002.\n  Following his commission as a second lieutenant, Captain Shimp served \ntwo tours of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I and III. \nAfter graduating from the Aviation Captain's Career Course at Fort \nRucker, AL, he reported to Company C, 4th Battalion, 101st Aviation \nRegiment, 159th Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, at \nFort Campbell, KY, to serve as company commander.\n  A highly decorated soldier, Captain Shimp's leadership qualities were \nunmistakable. He was a rare example in the 101st Airborne Division, as \nevidenced by taking over a command soon after graduating from the \nAviation Captain's Career Course, thereby demonstrating the respect and \ntrust afforded him by his superiors. On September 11, 2007, Captain \nShimp, along with two crew members, passed away when the Black Hawk \nhelicopter he was piloting during a training exercise crashed due to \nfog near the town of Skyline, AL. He was 28 years old.\n\n[[Page S12931]]\n\n  Captain Scott Shimp is survived by his parents Curtis and Teri Shimp \nof Bayard, NE; his older brother Chad and his younger sister Misty. I \noffer my most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Captain \nShimp. He made the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our \nNation. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of this remarkable \nyoung man and know that Captain Shimp's passion for serving, his \nleadership, and his selflessness will remain a source of inspiration \nfor us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12931-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AUTHORIZING INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nregarding the most recent revelations of administration memos \neffectively authorizing the use of interrogation techniques that most \ncertainly rise to the level of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \nor punishment, if not to the level of torture.\n  In 2002, senior administration officials prepared a classified memo \nthat sought to provide legal cover for interrogation practices that \nwould clearly violate U.S. and international law. This ``torture memo'' \nwas leaked to the press after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke and, in \nturn, caused such outrage that it was quickly disavowed by the Justice \nDepartment. A new, improved, and sanitized legal memo on interrogation \nnorms was then issued in December 2004.\n  It now appears, according to a report published by the New York Times \non October 4, that the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel \nsubsequently issued two additional legal memos that once again defined \ntorture as ``not torture'' and--in an apparent effort to end run \ncongressional efforts to close loopholes in the existing prohibition \nagainst cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment--simply \ndeclared that no CIA interrogation practices violated that prohibition.\n  I would also draw my colleagues' attention to a subsequent, highly \ntroubling report published by the New York Times on October 11 stating \nthat the Director of the CIA, Michael Hayden, has ordered an \ninvestigation of the inspector general, John L. Helgerson. The CIA \ninspector general is known to have undertaken critical examinations of \nCIA interrogation procedures.\n  With these latest developments in mind, I would like to share three \nobservations.\n  First, the revelation that--even while the Abu Ghraib scandal was \nstill being investigated--the administration was issuing additional \nsecret memos authorizing abusive interrogation techniques, stands as \nthe latest blow to the credibility of the United States as a global \nadvocate for human rights and democracy. We simply cannot win hearts \nand minds around the globe if we are perceived to condone a violation \nof basic human rights, our own laws, and international law. As \ncochairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am painfully aware of the \nextent to which these policies have undermined our nation's reputation, \nand even our ability to build support for counterterrorism operations \nworldwide.\n  Second, these revelations once again draw attention to this \nadministration's breathtaking interpretation of the scope of executive \npower. In fact, the 2002 ``torture memo'' actually consisted of two \nparts. One part effectively sought to define torture as ``not \ntorture.'' The second part addressed the authority of the President to \nauthorize torture. In essence, that part of the memo described the \nPresidency--when the President is acting as Commander in Chief--as \nvirtually unrestrained by the Congress, the Constitution, or the \ncourts. The Justice Department's renunciation of the 2002 torture memo \nonly appeared to renounce the first part of that memo.\n  Accordingly, during the January 2005 confirmation hearing for \nAttorney General Gonzalez, he was repeatedly questioned regarding his \nviews on the scope of Presidential authority--and he repeatedly \nstonewalled. His refusal to answer those questions, coupled with the \nPresident's signing statements attached to the 2005 Detainee Treatment \nAct and the 2006 Military Commissions Act and most recent revelations \nof additional torture memos, suggest that President Bush does believe \nhimself to be beyond or above the law.\n  Many retired military leaders have argued that abusive interrogation \ntechniques undermine America's moral authority, fuel jihadist \nrecruitment, and weaken international norms that have protected \nAmerican service men and women for decades. Moreover, a now \ndeclassified report issued by the Government's Intelligence Science \nBoard has concluded there is no scientific evidence that coercive \ninterrogation methods even produces good intelligence. And we now know \nthat the use of these techniques has, in actual cases, produced false \nor misleading intelligence.\n  Sadly, the one of the greatest tragedies of the President's misguided \npolicies on torture is this: this administration's justification of \nabusive techniques has not made us any safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12931-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12931-S12932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD FOOD DAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, each October, the eyes of the world \nappropriately turn to Des Moines for the presentation of the World Food \nPrize, called by the former President of Mexico, ``the Nobel Prize for \nFood.''\n  Created by Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, each year on or around October 16--\nWorld Food Day--representatives from more than 60 countries gather in \nthe magnificent Iowa State Capitol to honor the newest laureate for his \nor her exceptional breakthrough achievements in increasing the quality, \nquantity or availability of food in the world. In past years, this \nhonor has gone to individuals from India, Denmark, Brazil, China, and \nSierra Leone. This year the winner is an American from Indiana. But no \nmatter where they are from, all of these laureates have in common that \nthey have reduced hunger and human suffering around the globe.\n  It is most fitting that this weeklong celebration begins today, \nOctober 16 with the first ever Iowa Hunger Summit.\n  There are people flying today from the east coast and the west coast \nto Des Moines. No, they are not Presidential candidates--although there \nare already plenty of them in the State. Rather, they are national \nleaders of the Alliance to End Hunger and representatives of the U.N. \nFoundation, and ambassadors from the United Nations and leaders of the \nOneVote08 campaign. They are all coming to join hundreds of Iowans to \nlisten to the leaders of Bread for the World and MAZON, the Jewish \nResponse to Hunger offer an inspiring vision about how to diminish \nhunger at home and abroad in this inaugural Iowa Hunger Summit.\n  At the center of this endeavor will be Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, Iowa's \nand America's greatest hero in the struggle against hunger. Today is \nU.N. World Food Day all around the globe. But I would argue, that \nperhaps the most significant observance of this special day will be \ntaking place in Des Moines, where it is also Dr. Norman E. Borlaug/\nWorld Food Prize Day.\n  I want to commend Iowa's three former Governors, Tom Vilsack, Terry \nBranstad, and Robert Ray for their bipartisan leadership in making this \nfirst ever Iowa Hunger Summit possible. I also express my appreciation \nto the World Food Prize Foundation for its initiative in starting this \nnew program. Iowa has a rich legacy of coming together above partisan \ndifferences when human suffering is involved. Governor Ray has \nexhibited exemplary leadership of Iowa SHARES to feed emaciated \nCambodians, who had suffered under the genocidal Khmer Rouge. \nSimilarly, Governor Branstad has led Iowa CARES to send food to \nstarving populations in Ethiopia. And here at home, Governor Vilsack \nhas worked in Iowa to greatly expand the number of hungry people \nreceiving assistance.\n  I am pleased to add my name to the list of those in support of this \nmarvelous new focus on hunger--the Iowa Hunger Summit. It is most \nfitting that we in the Congress would also join together in a \nbipartisan fashion to further commit ourselves to efforts to alleviate \nmalnutrition and human suffering wherever it is found, at home or \nabroad.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is harvest time in Iowa and \nthroughout heartland. It is the time of year when farmers work around \nthe clock to bring in the year's harvest of corn, soybeans, and other \ngrains. Just this past weekend while on my farm in New Hartford,\n\n[[Page S12932]]\n\nI was able to help my son with the harvest.\n  Across Iowa and the Midwest, farmers are harvesting a bumper crop. It \nis during this time that we pray that these bounties from the land make \ntheir way into of the mouths of the hungry.\n  It is appropriate, then, that during this season of harvest, a \ngathering will be taking place in northeast Iowa focusing on global \nhunger. Not far from my farm, a dinner is taking place tonight in the \nsmall town of Protivin, to honor one of America's greatest fighters of \nhunger.\n  Dr. Norman Borlaug, who grew up just a few miles from Protivin in \nHoward County, shared his talents to help populations around the world. \nHis efforts to increase food production, and alleviate global hunger \nand famine earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 and the title of \n``Father of the Green Revolution.''\n  His work in food production was also acknowledged this summer when \nDr. Borlaug was presented the Congressional Gold Medal by President \nBush and the bipartisan leadership of Congress. As a testament to his \nwork around the globe, officials from Mexico, India, Japan, and \nnumerous countries in Africa were present to honor Dr. Borlaug. I was \nproud to join this distinguished group in honoring him, and I thank my \ncolleagues for acknowledging Dr. Borlaug's accomplishments.\n  It is clear that Dr. Borlaug has never forgotten his roots. He \nremains a rural Iowa farmer at heart. That is why I am sure tonight's \ndinner near his hometown will mean as much as, if not more than, the \nformal banquet that followed his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  It is also appropriate that Dr. Borlaug is making this trip back to \nthe heartland today, October 16. Today has been designated ``World Food \nDay'' around the globe, and ``Dr. Norman E. Borlaug/World Food Prize \nDay'' in Iowa.\n  Dr. Borlaug continues to lead the effort to end global hunger and \nwill do so today by participating in the first Iowa Hunger Summit in \nDes Moines. This summit will bring together people from across Iowa and \nthe country to focus on feeding the hungry at home and abroad. Iowa \nGovernor Chet Culver and former Governors Vilsack, Branstad, and Ray \nwill also be in attendance for the summit.\n  I would like to thank the World Food Prize Foundation which provided \nthe leadership in making this daylong focus on hunger possible. The \nfoundation has worked closely with the Alliance to End Hunger, the One \nCampaign, and Iowa State University to make this event a central focus \nof World Food Day.\n  This is an appropriate time of year for us to focus on hunger and \nfeeding the malnourished worldwide. I hope my colleagues will join in \ncommending those who are working daily to raise the awareness of world \nhunger and working to provide adequate food for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12932-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING LOUISBURG COLLEGE\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today I recognize Louisburg College, \none of North Carolina's fine institutions of higher learning, on the \noccasion of its celebration of 220 years.\n  Louisburg College is the oldest chartered 2-year, church-related, \ncoeducational college in the Nation and can trace its roots back to the \nearly years of the town of Louisburg, NC. The town was founded in 1779, \nduring the Revolutionary War, and was named in honor of King Louis XVI \nof France. The college in existence today has evolved from three \nearlier institutions, Franklin Male Academy, Louisburg Female Academy, \nand Louisburg Female College. Franklin Male Academy was founded on \nDecember 4, 1786, when Senator Henry Hill of Franklin County introduced \n``An Act to Erect and Establish an Academy in the County of Franklin.'' \nThe bill was enacted into law on January 6, 1787, thereby providing \nFranklin Academy with its first charter. Franklin Male Academy opened \non January 1, 1805, and, under the able direction of Yale graduate, \nMatthew Dickinson, prospered in its early years and soon had an \nenrollment of 90 students. In 1814, a counterpart to the Franklin Male \nAcademy was established when the State legislature ratified an act \nchartering the Louisburg Female Academy. The third stage of the \nevolution of Louisburg College began in January 1855, when the State \nlegislature authorized the transfer of property by the trustees of \nLouisburg Female Academy to the directors of Louisburg Female College \nCompany. A four-story, fifty-room brick Greek revival building for the \nfemale college was constructed in 1857 on the west campus where the \nfemale academy building formerly stood. Old Main is still in use today \nas the administrative building of Louisburg College.\n  At the beginning of the 20th century, the institution became known as \nLouisburg College, and the college was officially linked to the \nMethodist Church. Washington Duke, a Durham philanthropist, had \nacquired ownership of the college property in the 1890s; after his \ndeath in the early 1900s, his son Benjamin N. Duke presented the \nproperty to the North Carolina Conference of the Methodist Church. \nLouisburg College became coeducational in 1931, and student enrollment \nimmediately increased. In 1952, Louisburg College was accredited by the \nSouthern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\n  Building on its rich history, Louisburg College today enrolls around \n750 students, 90 percent of whom go on to 4-year colleges and \nuniversities after graduation. This impressive accomplishment is \nachieved through a dedicated faculty who devote themselves to teaching, \nadvising, and individual assistance to ensure that each student is \nacademically prepared to meet the requirements of major 4-year colleges \nand universities. The college also holds the distinction as North \nCarolina's only residential junior college providing a unique \neducational experience and filling a niche for those college freshmen \nand sophomores who desire to further their education in a collegiate \natmosphere.\n  Louisburg College has made a significant impact on the intellectual \nlife and development of countless North Carolinians over the past four \ncenturies, an accomplishment that indeed deserves commendation by the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12932-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO YWCA OF NORTHWEST GEORGIA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on October 25, 2007, the YWCA of \nNorthwest Georgia will hold a vigil on Marietta Square in my hometown \nto commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I wish to express my \ngratitude for the work of the YWCA of Northwest Georgia and its \nexecutive director, Holly Comer, as they bring awareness to this \nimportant issue and its impact on our community.\n  The YWCA of Northwest Georgia opened the doors to the first domestic \nviolence shelter in Cobb County in 1978 in an effort to end domestic \nviolence in our State, our communities, and our homes. A home should be \na place of stability, comfort, and love. Domestic violence shatters \nthis important foundation. The terrible tragedies that result from \ndomestic violence destroy lives and insult the dignity of women, men, \nand children. I believe I represent all Georgians when I say thank you \nto the YWCA of Northwest Georgia for its hard work to combat domestic \nviolence and help those who have been victimized.\n  I am grateful for the social service providers, advocates, \ncounselors, and many others who provide care for the victims. I am also \ngrateful to the law enforcement personnel and others who work to bring \noffenders to justice. As we recognize Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, we are reminded of the important service these individuals \nprovide.\n  Domestic violence has no place in our society, and I am strongly \ncommitted to addressing domestic violence and helping those who have \nbeen victimized. By working together with the YWCA of Northwest Georgia \nand its dedicated staff, we can build a Georgia where every home honors \nthe value and dignity of its loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12932-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12932-S12933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LYNNE ROSS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, prior to my election to the U.S. \nSenate, I\n\n[[Page S12933]]\n\nserved Alabama as the attorney general. During that time I had many \nopportunities to work with the organization that assists attorneys \ngeneral in their many dealings with the Congress, White House, and \ngovernment agencies the National Association of Attorneys General, \nNAAG.\n  NAAG was founded in 1907, `` To facilitate interaction among \nAttorneys General as peers and to facilitate the enhanced performance \nof Attorneys General and their staffs.'' They opened their Washington \noffice in 1976, and Lynne Ross was their first full-time employee. Her \nextensive work with attorneys general has been immensely valuable. She \nhad strategic skills, dedication and wit. She understood how things \nwork in the DC political world and knew how to negotiate on the many \nissues that were of importance to attorneys general. NAAG has been as \nsuccessful as it is in no small part due to her leadership. She is a \nnon-lawyer with a great understanding of lawyers.\n  During her years at NAAG, Lynne was also instrumental in the creation \nof an organization of former attorneys general--the Society of \nAttorneys General Emeritus, SAGE, of which I am a member, and she has \nalways been a great resource for our members.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to offer my appreciation to \nLynne for her many years of dedicated service to NAAG. Her \naccomplishments are many. The organization and the Nation's attorneys \ngeneral, both past and present, are stronger because of her hard work. \nThank you, Lynne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12933-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LOUISIANA HONORAIR\n\n Mr. VITTER.

    By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2168. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to enable \nincreased federal prosecution of identity theft crimes and to allow for \nrestitution to victims of identity theft; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this month the Nation is observing National \nCyber Security Awareness Month and, today, I am pleased to have Senator \nSpecter join me in introducing our Identity Theft Enforcement and \nRestitution Act of 2007. This bipartisan criminal bill will provide new \ntools to federal prosecutors to combat identity theft and other cyber \ncrimes.\n  Senator Specter has been a valuable partner in addressing the growing \nproblem of identity theft for many years. When he served as Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, we worked closely together on comprehensive \ndata privacy legislation to combat identity theft. During my tenure as \nChairman, we have continued our efforts to enact comprehensive data \nprivacy legislation. I appreciate Senator Specter's willingness to work \nwith me once again on this important privacy issue and I look forward \nto our close partnership yielding results in this Congress.\n  When Senator Specter and I first introduced our comprehensive data \nprivacy bill in 2005, we both knew that there was an urgent need to \nbring data privacy reforms to the American people. The Judiciary \nCommittee has twice favorably reported the Leahy-Specter Personal Data \nPrivacy and Security Act, most recently in May 2007, and that important \nprivacy bill is now\n\n[[Page S12939]]\n\nawaiting consideration by the full Senate as S.495. The privacy reforms \nin that bill are long overdue and I sincerely hope that the Senate will \nfulfill its obligation to bring meaningful privacy protections to the \nAmerican people.\n  The bipartisan Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act that we \nare introducing today takes several important steps to build upon our \npast efforts to protect Americans from the dangers of identity theft. \nFirst, our bill provides the victims of identity theft with the ability \nto seek restitution in Federal court for the loss of time and money \nspent restoring their credit and remedying the harms of identity theft. \nUnfortunately, under current law, restitution for identity theft \nvictims is only available to recover the direct financial costs \nincurred by victims, such as recovering funds for unauthorized credit \ncard charges. But, many identity theft victims incur other, indirect \ncosts, such as lost wages due to time taken off from work to resolve \ncredit disputes. Our bill amends the Federal criminal code to clarify \nthat restitution orders in identity theft cases may include a recovery \nof these kinds of indirect costs, so that identity theft victims can be \nmade whole.\n  Second, to address the more sophisticated and complex identity theft \ncrimes committed in today's digital era, our bill also expands the \nscope of the Federal identity theft statutes so that the law keeps up \nwith the ingenuity of today's identity thieves. The bill expands the \ndefinition of ``aggravated identity theft'' under existing law, to \ninclude the crime of ``conspiracy'' to commit any of the crimes defined \nas aggravated identity theft in the criminal code. The bill also adds \nthree new crimes--passing counterfeit securities, mail theft, and tax \nfraud--to the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft. \nIn order to better deter this kind of criminal activity, the bill \nsignificantly increases the criminal penalties for these crimes.\n  In addition, our bill addresses several growing and disturbing trends \nin the area of cyber crime. To address the increasing number of \ncomputer hacking crimes that involve computers located within the same \nstate, the bill eliminates the jurisdictional requirement that a \ncomputer's information must be stolen through an interstate or foreign \ncommunication in order to federally prosecute this crime. Our bill also \naddresses the growing problem of the malicious use of spyware to steal \nsensitive personal information, by amending the criminal code to \neliminate the requirement that the loss resulting from the damage to a \nvictim's computer must exceed $5,000 in order to federally prosecute \nthis offense.\n  Our bill also addresses the increasing number of cyber attacks on \nmultiple computers, by making it a felony to employ spyware or \nkeyloggers to damage ten or more computers, regardless of the aggregate \namount of damage caused. By making this crime a felony, the bill \nensures that the most egregious identity thieves will not escape with \nminimal punishment under Federal cyber crime laws.\n  Lastly, our bill strengthens the protections for American businesses \nwhich are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves. Because \nin today's digital economy, cyber-criminals often seek to extort money \nfrom American businesses without explicitly threatening to shut down or \notherwise cause damage to a company computer, our bill amends the \nFederal criminal code to expressly cover extortion plots that do not \ninvolve a specific threat to damage a computer. The current law does \nnot reach this kind of bad conduct; but, our bill corrects this \nshortcoming by adding two new causes of action under the cyber \nextortion statute, threatening to obtain or release information from a \nprotected computer and demanding money in relation to a protected \ncomputer, so that this bad conduct can be federally prosecuted. In \naddition, because a business as well as an individual can be a prime \ntarget for identity theft, our bill also closes several gaps in the \nfederal identity theft and the aggravated identity theft statutes, so \nthat identity thieves who steal sensitive information belonging to a \nsmall business or a corporation may also be prosecuted under these \nlaws.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of \nJustice in crafting this criminal legislation and the Leahy-Specter \nIdentity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act has the strong support \nof the Department of Justice, the Secret Service and the Federal \nprosecutors and investigators who are on the front lines of the battle \nagainst identity theft and other cyber crimes. The bill is also \nsupported by the business community and consumer groups.\n  Enacting good, bipartisan legislation to combat identity theft and to \nprotect American consumers should be one of the Senate's top \nlegislative priorities. Senator Specter and I are deeply committed to \nbringing long overdue data privacy protections to the American people. \nI hope that all Members of the Senate will join with us in supporting \nthis important privacy legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I seek recognition today to discuss the \nIdentity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2007, which I am \nintroducing with Senator Leahy.\n  In 2006, some 8.4 million Americans became victims to identity theft. \nVictims are often left with a bad credit report and must spend months \nand even years regaining their financial health. In the meantime, \nvictims have difficulty getting credit, obtaining loans, renting \napartments, and even getting hired. On a national level, experts \nestimate that identity theft costs the U.S. economy $49.3 billion last \nyear and costs each victim an average of $617.\n  Identity thieves frequently acquire a person's existing credit \naccount information and then purchase products and services using \neither the actual credit card or simply the account number and \nexpiration date. They also use Social Security numbers and other \nidentifying information to open new accounts in a person's name. \nIdentity thieves frequently obtain both existing account information \nand the information needed to open new accounts electronically--either \nby gaining unauthorized access to a computer or by fraudulently \ninducing victims to provide such information.\n  The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act will provide \nFederal prosecutors with new tools to combat identity theft.\n  First, the bill will expand Federal computer fraud statutes to cover \nbusiness organizations. Identity thieves frequently impersonate \nbusinesses in order to steal sensitive personal information from \nconsumers. However, current law only provides for prosecution of \nidentity theft perpetrated against an individual.\n  Under the bill, prosecutors will be able to go after identity thieves \neven when the computer they use to steal information is located in the \nsame State as the victim's computer. Under current law, Federal courts \nonly have jurisdiction if the thief uses an interstate communication to \naccess the victim's computer.\n  The bill will make it a crime to threaten to steal or release \ninformation from a computer. Under current law, prosecutors can only \nbring extortion charges against those who threaten to shut down or \ndamage a computer.\n  The bill will make it a crime to use malicious ``spyware'' to damage \na computer, regardless of the amount of damage. Under current law, \ndamage to a victim's computer must exceed $5,000 before a prosecutor \ncan bring charges.\n  The bill will also increase the penalties Federal prosecutors can \nseek for identity theft.\n  The bill will enable prosecutors to seek enhanced penalties where a \nviolation of the Federal computer fraud statutes includes conspiracy.\n  Prosecutors also will be able to seek enhanced penalties where a \nviolation of the Federal computer fraud statutes involves passing \ncounterfeit securities, mail theft, and tax fraud.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the bill will enable Federal \nprosecutors to seek restitution for the time and money that victims \nspend restoring their credit. The impact of identity theft is not \nlimited to direct financial loss. Victims frequently spend significant \namounts of time fixing or monitoring credit reports and disputing \ncharges with individual creditors. The Federal Trade Commission has \nreported that victims spend an average of 30 hours trying to resolve \nidentity theft-related issues with banks, credit agencies, and other \ninstitutions. According to the FTC, a total of 297 million hours were \nexpended in 1 year by victims trying to deal with the impact of \nidentity theft.\n  The Criminal Code currently allows prosecutors to seek restitution \nfor the direct financial losses that victims experience. However, the \ncode does not expressly permit prosecutors to obtain restitution for \nthe time and money victims spend resolving the problems that arise as a \nresult of identity theft. The Identity Theft Enforcement and \nRestitution Act of 2007 will allow prosecutors to seek restitution from \na criminal defendant for the time and resources victims spend trying to \nrepair their credit. The bill will require judges to determine the \namount of time reasonably spent and the value of the victim's time.\n  Many of these provisions were included in the recommendations of the \nPresident's Identity Theft Task Force. These changes were recommended \nby the agency responsible for prosecuting identity theft, the Justice \nDepartment. I expect broad bipartisan support for this bill, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 2171. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish \na uniform set of customer service and consumer protection requirements \nfor providers of wireless telecommunications services; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \nbring important consumer protections to millions of wireless telephone \ncustomers across the country. The Uniform Wireless Consumer Protection\n\n[[Page S12941]]\n\nAct requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish uniform \nnational customer service and consumer protection rules for wireless \ncustomers that are both timely and necessary. My bill is identical to \nlanguage approved with bipartisan support by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee during the 109th Congress.\n  In 1993, through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Congress \nlimited State and local regulatory authority on wireless carriers to \nhelp the fledgling industry establish itself in the communications \narena. That decision has helped to drive today's market of 240 million \nwireless customers in the U.S. Today, carrying a wireless telephone, a \nBlackBerry, or some other kind of wireless device has become part of \nthe fabric of many peoples' lives. Wireless technology has become a \ncommonplace communication option, and an increasing number of Americans \nhave replaced their landline telephone in favor of a purely mobile \ntelephone service.\n  While we have accomplished the goal of growing the wireless industry, \nwe have yet to establish a uniform set of customer service and consumer \nprotection requirements. Now is the time to finish the job we started \nin 1993 by enacting a national framework that will drive a new era of \nconsumer-friendly wireless services.\n  This national consumer framework is not without challenges. The \nability of wireless to travel beyond State boundaries tests our \ncustomary approaches to customer service and consumer protection \nstandards at the state and local level. But nothing in this bill should \nbe misconstrued as a statement against consumer obligations by State \nand local governments. As a former Attorney General of Arkansas, I feel \nvery strongly about the inimitable ability of State and local \ngovernments to oversee and enforce consumer protections. State and \nlocal governments are unmatched in their function to provide effective \nprotection and enforcement, and final rules must recognize and require \na strong role for states in wireless consumer protection.\n  In addition, my colleagues Senator Klobuchar and Senator Rockefeller \nhave introduced a bill, S. 2033, the Cell Phone Consumer Empowerment \nAct of 2007, that shares the same goal of protecting wireless \nconsumers, and I look forward to working with them. Uniform wireless \nconsumer protection rules must be comprehensive and address a broad \nrange of issues, including disclosures of contract terms and \nconditions, service-area maps, trail periods and early termination \nfees. We also need to weigh the benefits and the burdens of government \nfees and taxes, as well as the costs of compliance with government \nregulations on wireless services.\n  I know my constituents want to be assured of their consumer \nprotections when they buy and use wireless service, wherever they go \nand wherever they use their wireless phones. This bill begins an \nimportant debate on building uniform, comprehensive rules that provide \na fair, transparent and quality wireless service to consumers across \nthe Nation. While there is much work to be done in achieving a balance \nof rules that truly work for consumers, there is a clear need for a \nfederal wireless regulatory framework. I am confident that we can reach \nthis goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2172. A bill to impose sanctions on officials of the State Peace \nand Development Council in Burma, to prohibit the importation of gems \nand hardwoods from Burma, to support democracy in Burma, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the world has reacted with horror and \nrevulsion at the Burmese junta's recent brutal crackdown against \npeaceful demonstrators. In crushing the Saffron Revolution, killing \nhundreds and jailing thousands, including countless Buddhist monks, the \njunta has left no doubt about its blatant disregard for basic human \ndecency. We, as Americans, stand on the side of freedom, not fear; of \npeace, not violence; and of the millions in Burma who aspire to a \nbetter life, not those who would keep them isolated and oppressed.\n  Our response must go beyond statements of condemnation, and the time \nto act is now. That is why today I am introducing the Saffron \nRevolution Support Act of 2007 in the U.S. Senate. This legislation \nimposes meaningful and effective punitive action against the cruel, \nthuggish, and illegitimate Burmese government. We must not sit idly by \nwhile the junta continues to deprive the Burmese people of their \nfundamental human rights.\n  This legislation would impose targeted sanctions against Burmese \nofficials who played a direct role in the violent repression of \npeaceful political dissent, and also against those who provide, or have \nprovided, substantial political and economic support for the junta. \nThese individuals would be subject to a visa ban and a ban on business \ndealings with any United States entity or person. This legislation \nwould also close a loophole that exists in current U.S. import policy \nthat allows imports of Burmese gems and hardwoods, which together add \ntens of millions of dollars to the junta's coffers. It would eliminate \nthe remaining U.S. energy investment in Burma's gas sector and \nsignificantly increase U.S. Government support for democracy in Burma.\n  Specifically, the Saffron Revolution Support Act of 2007: states that \nit is the policy of the United States to condemn the Burmese junta's \ncontinued repressions, support the democratic aspirations of the \nBurmese people, provide support to aid a democratic transition in \nBurma, and hold accountable those individuals responsible for the \nongoing repression; imposes targeted financial sanctions against \nBurmese officials who played a direct role in the violent repression of \npeaceful political dissent, and also against those who provide, or have \nprovided, substantial political and economic support for the junta \ngovernment; imposes a visa ban on these individuals; prohibits the \nimportation of Burmese gems and hardwoods, including materials that are \nmined or harvested in Burma but shaped, cut, or assembled in other \ncountries not subject to current U.S. sanctions; prohibits investment \nin Burma by U.S. companies, including investment agreements reached \nprior to the imposition of the May 20, 1997 sanctions; permits the \nPresident to terminate sanctions once the Government of Burma has: \nunconditionally released all political prisoners, including Aung San \nSuu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy; entered \ninto a substantive dialogue with democratic forces on a transition to \ndemocratic government under the rule of law; allowed humanitarian \naccess to populations affected by armed conflict in all regions of \nBurma; authorizes $20 million for FY 2008 and FY 2009 in aid to \ndemocracy activists in Burma, for the expansion of radio and television \nbroadcasting into Burma, and for support to individuals and groups \ncompiling evidence of the junta's crimes; expresses the sense of \nCongress that the Director of National Intelligence should target \nintelligence resources to identify those responsible for the crackdown \nand for other human rights abuses; authorizes the Secretary of State to \nfund the establishment of an independent, searchable, Internet database \nthat would compile evidence of human rights abuses in Burma, permitting \nincreased international research aimed at holding human rights abusers \naccountable; requires a report by the Secretary of State on \ninternational sources of military aid to the Burmese regime.\n  The next phase of political life in Burma has begun. The junta's \nthugs cannot forever postpone the blossoming of freedom and democracy \nwithin its nation's borders. By enacting the Saffron Revolution Support \nAct of 2007, the Congress can help ensure that they do not. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12941-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12941-S12942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 347--DESIGNATING MAY 2008 AS ``NATIONAL BE BEAR AWARE \n                    AND WILDLIFE STEWARDSHIP MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Tester) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 348) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of Red Ribbon Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nthat commemorates the Annual Red Ribbon Campaign. I am honored to again \nseek the Senate's continuing support and recognition of Red Ribbon \nWeek, which is October 23 through October 31.\n  In 1985, Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered in the \nline of duty by drug traffickers. Shortly after Agent Camarena's death, \nCongressman Duncan Hunter and high school friend Henry Lozano launched \n``Camarena Clubs'' in the agent's hometown of Calexico, CA. In honor of \nAgent Camarena, hundreds of club members wore red ribbons and pledged \nto lead drug-free lives. The campaign quickly gained statewide and then \nnational prominence. In 1988, what is now the National Family \nPartnership organized the first National Red Ribbon Week, an 8-day \nevent proclaimed by the U.S. Congress and chaired by then-President and \nMrs. Reagan.\n  This campaign is now the oldest and largest drug prevention program \nin the\n\n[[Page S12944]]\n\nNation, reaching millions of youth through Red Ribbon Week events. Red \nRibbon Week memorializes Agent Camarena, and all those who have lost \ntheir lives in the war on drugs, by educating young people about the \ndangers of drug abuse, promoting drug-free activities, and supporting \neveryone who has stood strong against illicit drugs. The red ribbon \nthat we will wear during Red Ribbon Week is a symbol of zero tolerance \nfor illegal drug use and our commitment to help people, especially \nchildren, make the right life decisions.\n  In Alaska, Red Ribbon Week is a statewide celebration involving \nthousands of school children and other supporters. On October 22, the \nMunicipality of Anchorage, in conjunction with the Alaska Red Ribbon \nCoalition and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Alaska, will host a Red \nRibbon Week kickoff. The Red Ribbon Coalition is comprised of the \nAnchorage School District, the Alaska State Troopers, the U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and the U.S. Department of Justice. In \naddition, the Alaska National Guard and 43 Boys and Girls Clubs across \nAlaska will help other Alaskan communities celebrate Red Ribbon Week \nthroughout the State.\n  As people across the country stand together against drugs, I thank my \ncolleagues for joining me in what will hopefully be a continuation of \nthe tradition of congressional support and recognition of Red Ribbon \nWeek.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 348) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 348\n\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to \n     commemorate the service of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, an 11-\n     year special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who \n     was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 while engaged in the \n     battle against illicit drugs;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been nationally \n     recognized since 1988 to preserve Special Agent Camarena's \n     memory and further the cause for which he gave his life, and \n     is now the oldest and largest drug prevention program in the \n     Nation, reaching millions of young people each year during \n     Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Governors and Attorneys General of the States, \n     the National Family Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and more than 100 other \n     organizations throughout the United States annually celebrate \n     Red Ribbon Week during the period of October 23 through \n     October 31;\n       Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the \n     creation of drug-free communities through drug prevention \n     efforts, education, parental involvement, and community-wide \n     support;\n       Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the \n     Nation faces in securing a safe and healthy future for our \n     families;\n       Whereas drug and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic \n     violence and sexual assault, and place the lives of children \n     at risk;\n       Whereas, although public awareness of illicit drug use is \n     increasing, emerging drug threats and growing epidemics such \n     as the abuse of prescription medication--the second most \n     abused drug by youth, methamphetamine, and inhalants demand \n     attention;\n       Whereas drug dealers are specifically targeting children by \n     marketing illicit drugs that mimic the appearance and names \n     of well known brand-name candies and foods; and\n       Whereas parents, youths, schools, businesses, law \n     enforcement agencies, religious institutions, service \n     organizations, senior citizens, medical and military \n     personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the \n     United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and \n     displaying red ribbons during this week-long celebration: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week;\n       (2) encourages children and teens to choose to live drug-\n     free lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to promote \n     the creation of drug-free communities and to participate in \n     drug prevention activities to show support for healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/16/senate-section/article/S12944-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2007\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.
