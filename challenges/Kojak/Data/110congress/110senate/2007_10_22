Mr. President, I am so pleased the Presiding Officer is the \njunior Senator from the State of Virginia. I don't believe there is a \nSenator during these last 9 months who has added more structure to the \nIraq debate than the Senator from Virginia. I say that because today I \nreceived a call from the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, Mr. Nussle, who said: I am going to send you the rest of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for the war in Iraq. I said: Thank you \nvery much.\n  We are now being asked to appropriate another $200 billion for 2008 \nfor the war in Iraq. Another $200 billion. That is $200 billion on top \nof the $450 billion in the Defense appropriations bill. That is $650 \nbillion--none of it paid for. The entire war in Iraq has been paid for \nwith borrowed money. We are borrowing money from China, India, Saudi \nArabia, Japan, and Mexico to finance this war.\n  When we sent a bipartisan--and I mean bipartisan--children's health\n\n[[Page S13170]]\n\ncare bill to the President, it was paid for. It was bipartisan. We had \nsome of the most conservative Members of the Senate supporting the \nChildren's Health Initiative. Senator Grassley from Iowa, Senator Hatch \nfrom Utah were the leaders, two of the leaders in moving this forward, \na bill to provide health care for kids.\n  It was so important when this bill passed 10 years ago on a \nbipartisan basis, children's health. Why did it pass? Because we found \nthere were children who did not qualify for Medicaid. The poorest of \nthe poor get Medicaid. We found there were a number of children whose \nparents didn't make much money--100 percent of poverty, 200 percent of \npoverty. Therefore, we passed a bill for these children who had fallen \nthrough the cracks so they would be able to have some health insurance. \nDid it cover all children? No. But it covered a lot of the children who \nneeded help. By the time 10 years had gone by, 6\\1/2\\ million children \nwere covered.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation that passed here \nwould provide for another 4.4 million children, for a total of 10 \nmillion children who would qualify for this program. Ninety-two percent \nof the children were on this program when the President vetoed it. \nNinety-two percent of them were 200 percent above poverty. How much is \nthat? It is debatable how much it is but about $35,000. How would \nparents with two children pay for health insurance? The average cost of \nhealth insurance for a family of 4 is $1,500 a month, $18,000 a year \nfor health insurance for their children. When they only make $35,000 a \nyear, half of their income would go for health insurance. There would \nbe no money left for groceries. Also, they have to pay taxes, fuel \ncosts, a place to live. So this is the group of people whom Congress \ndecided to help.\n  What did the President and his people do? They came back and said it \nis a socialized medicine program. I don't know what that was supposed \nto mean, because the program is private insurance. The States issue the \namount of money they have to health insurance companies, and the kids \nwho are covered are privately insured there. The President is so far \noff base. He and his people also said one of the Congressmen from \nNevada agreed with the President, and he couldn't support this because \nit helped illegal aliens. That is factually baseless, meaning not 1 \npercent of that statement is correct. In fact, in the legislation that \nwas vetoed by the President, a child who is an immigrant would have to \nhave been legally in the United States for 5 years before they \nqualified. Therefore, the program would not even cover legal \nimmigrants, unless they have been here 5 years. It was totally paid \nfor, unlike the Iraq war. It was all paid for.\n  Because of the President's hard-heartedness, in the State of Nevada, \nfar more than 100,000 will be eliminated from the program.\n  The first elected job I had in the State of Nevada was for a county \nhospital, an indigent hospital, frankly. One of the problems we had was \nchildren who were uninsured. It is still that way. It is still that \nway. This is a program that would allow children who are sick or \ninjured to go to a hospital--that hospital, the one where I was, now \nthe University Medical Center--and the children's bills would be paid \nfor by an insurance company. If not, those children who have no \ninsurance come to the facility, and who pays for that? You do. I do. \nEverybody in this room pays for it, because their health insurance \ncosts more money because of indigent care. Taxes are raised to take \ncare of indigents' health care. Insurance premiums are raised to take \ncare of all this. It affects us all. It is a very poor quality of care.\n  The President had the audacity to say not long ago that everybody has \ninsurance, in effect. They can go to an emergency room if they are \nsick. The most inadequate care is administered in emergency rooms \nbecause it is not set up to be the family physician.\n  Every dime of the money for the Children's Health Initiative was paid \nfor. It is no wonder the American people are frustrated. We have been \nfighting for America's priorities while the President continues \ninvesting only in his failed war strategy, and he wants us to come up \nwith another $200 billion and sign off on it. That is what he said \ntoday. He gave his press statement today and he said: Those people who \nwon't sign off on this bill immediately are not for the troops in Iraq. \nIsn't this getting to be a little old? Pretty soon we will be \napproaching the sixth year of this.\n  This war is costing the American people three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars, money borrowed from other countries. This is so even as his \nown Pentagon leadership is now on record saying our ground forces are \nstretched dangerously thin because of the current Iraq strategy. GEN \nCasey told Congress very recently:\n\n       The Army is out of balance and the current demand for our \n     forces exceeds the sustainable supply. We are consumed with \n     meeting the demands of the current fight and are unable to \n     provide ready forces as rapidly as necessary for other \n     potential contingencies.\n\n  This is the man who is in charge of the Army, the Secretary of the \nArmy. He takes care of the Army. He is the commander of the Army. I \ndon't remember the title; I have lost it momentarily. But he is the guy \nin charge. He certainly should know. The Iraq war is leaving us less \nsecure and unprepared to fight an effective war on terror and spawning \nthe unexpected. And the unexpected can come at any time. That is the \nworld in which we live. President Bush should not expect Congress to \nrubberstamp this latest supplemental request. We will not do that, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  In the coming weeks, we will hold it up to the light of day and fight \nfor the redeployment and change in strategy that is long overdue.\n  I wish to comment on FISA, which has gotten so much attention. We \nwill continue to stand up for the American people. We will continue to \ndo the best we can to revise and improve the FISA bill. It is important \nthat we do that. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is so \nimportant. It has been good for this country for many decades. We need \nto update that. We all agree it is important to improve the temporary \nsurveillance law the President signed in August by enacting new \nlegislation that provides strong intelligence tools to fight terrorism \nwhile protecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens. There is no \ncontradiction between security and liberty. We can fight terrorism \nwithout compromising liberty and the values embedded in our \nConstitution.\n  Last Thursday, Senator Rockefeller and the Intelligence Committee, on \na bipartisan basis with Senator Bond, took a step toward improving the \nflawed surveillance law the President signed in August. I appreciate \nthe hard work of Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond and the \nmembers of the committee in seeking to address the complex issues that \nare at stake.\n  In the coming days, other Senators will examine in great detail the \nwork of the Intelligence Committee. I am sure other Senators will weigh \nin with ideas for defining and improving the legislative efforts, so \nthat all Americans can have high confidence in the effectiveness and \nconstitutionality of our intelligence tools. In particular, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has shared jurisdiction over the FISA law and is \ngoing to mark up the Intelligence Committee bill. The Judiciary \nCommittee has an important role to make sure the final product protects \nthe constitutionally and the legally sound basis that the Intelligence \nCommittee sought.\n  Mr. President, I believe the administration has chosen again to \nstonewall Congress from finding the information and documents needed \nfor Congress to properly consider this legislation. Remember, the \nIntelligence Committee said we are not going to deal with immunity \nuntil we look at those documents. They were able to look at the \ndocuments with nothing preconceived. They had the opportunity to look \nat those with no--I have talked to Senator Rockefeller, and there was \nno agreement between the administration and the Intelligence Committee \nas to what would happen if they looked at those documents.\n  Here is why I am so disturbed. The White House said, on October 19, \nthrough their advocate, Dana Perino--the question was asked:\n\n       I'm wondering if, in general terms, you can describe those \n     documents and perhaps lay out who else in Congress he may \n     allow to see them?\n\n  ``He'' meaning the President.\n  Here is what she said:\n\n\n[[Page S13171]]\n\n\n       The Senate Intelligence Committee . . . had showed a \n     willingness to want to include in their legislation \n     retroactive liability protection for companies that were \n     alleged to have helped the United States in the days after 9/\n     11. Because they were willing to do that, we were willing to \n     show them some of the documents they asked to see.\n\n  Mr. President, Jay Rockefeller told me within the past hour that \nthere was no preconceived agreement at all. They wanted to see the \ndocument to find out what they should do legislatively.\n  She says:\n\n       But to the extent of anyone else being able to see the \n     documents, I think we will wait and see who else is willing \n     to include that provision in the bill.\n\n  I want the record to be very clear that the Judiciary Committee \nshould be able to see those documents. How else can they make a \njudgment as to what they should do legislatively? They should not have \nto make some deal with the White House that ``we will let you look at \nthese, but we will write the legislation for you.'' That is wrong. I \nthink it is very clear that the House committees of jurisdiction should \nalso see those documents. It is absolutely wrong for the White House to \nsay, I repeat, that they will let you look at these, but only if you \nwill agree to sign this legislation or you give your approval of the \nlegislation.\n  We can't do that.\n  On Friday, the White House Press Secretary said the key documents \nwould be held out to the congressional committees as a prize for anyone \nwilling to commit to a specific legislative path. That is an insult to \nthe American people and to Congress.\n  I repeat in the most emphatic terms that the administration must turn \nover these documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the \nrelevant House committees to do their business as they must, and they \nmust do so immediately.\n\n  We believe this administration should move forward quickly. I would \nlike to do it before Thanksgiving. Why do I want to do that? This \nlegislation which came out of the Intelligence Committee is good. It \nstrengthens our national security. It provides the Intelligence \nCommittee the tools it needs to go after foreign terrorists and other \nthreats to the American security.\n  Does this mean the Judiciary Committee cannot improve the \nlegislation? I am confident that perhaps they can. Is the Intelligence \nCommittee's work the know-all and do-all? No. That is why we had joint \nreferral. But it is a good piece of legislation. It gives better \nprotection for America and increases the role of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. Two, it requires court approval to \ntarget U.S. persons overseas. Three, it explicitly prohibits targeting \nany person reasonably believed to be in the United States. Four, it \neliminates ambiguous language on warrantless domestic searches. Five, \nit states the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and \ninterception of domestic communications may be conducted.\n  Also, just as important, other than those five points, it increases \noversight and accountability by expanding the requirements in the \nsemiannual report submitted to the congressional Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees on intelligence collecting that is authorized by \nthe act. It also requires the head of elements of the Intelligence \nCommittee acting under their authority to conduct yearly audits of \nintelligence collection. Third, it requires the inspectors general of \nthe Department of Justice and the Intelligence Committee to review the \nuse of the new authority with respect to references to U.S. persons' \nidentities and communications. And it grants limited immunity from \npotential liability to any telecommunications company that may have \nassisted the Government in the aftermath of September 11. That is why \nit is so vitally important that the Judiciary Committee and the \nrespective House committees see what the Intelligence Committee saw \nwithout any preconceived arrangements by the White House. Five, it sets \nforth the procedures so that the Federal courts can review an attorney \ngeneral certification to determine whether the electronic communication \nservice provider acted within specific orders and in accordance with \nthe certification as directly prescribed by statute. Finally, it sets a \n6-year sunset to allow Congress to evaluate the new authority to be \ncarried out, should any of this be changed. That is why we have joint \nreferral, to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at this.\n  The Intelligence Committee has worked hard to come up with what \nshould be the final legislation that comes to the floor. Finally, the \nHouse passes legislation, and we work it out in conference.\n  We want to move forward. It is important to do that. We acknowledge \nthat. I think it is so wrong that the White House is saying: You can do \nthis but only as we tell you how it can be written; otherwise, we are \nnot going to show you the documents\n  That is defenseless on the part of the White House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13171-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

OAKES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, I had a long talk with Mara \nWilliams, the wife of former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge James Oakes. \nJim, who had served as Vermont's attorney general, as our Federal \ndistrict judge, and with distinction as chief judge of the Second \nCircuit, had died the previous weekend at the age of 83.\n  Mara told me how the family had been with Jim a few days before he \ndied, and we then talked about the legacy he left.\n  I spoke of knowing Jim for 40 years, and how I, and my family of \nlifelong Democrats, had voted for him for attorney general and had \nhoped he might be our Governor. As it turned out, the country was far \nbetter off having him on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and would \nhave been even better off had he been elevated to the Supreme Court, a \nposition he would have held with great distinction.\n  We all knew of Jim's legal mind and great ability, his dedication to \npublic service, his wonderful sense of humor, and his love for his \nfamily, but I knew him especially as a man with a great and good \nconscience.\n  Jim Oakes epitomized the role of judge as the protector of our \nfundamental rights. A decade ago he noted that he was a person who \n``still believe[d] that a federal judge can make a difference and--in \ncases of extreme necessity where basic rights are being infringed--\nshould make a difference when the rest of our political structure bogs \ndown.'' This appreciation for the role of judicial independence is \nsomething we must admire and remember.\n  We worked together when he was attorney general and I was State's \nattorney, and I particularly remember one very difficult and tragic \nmurder case where we were able to forge an unprecedented use of a grand \njury to bring about justice when it looked like that would not have \nbeen possible. We talked about that as recently as a couple of years \nago, but then, with Jim, we could pick up a conversation from where we \nhad left off 6 months before when we had last seen each other.\n  Fran Lynggaard Hansen quoted his eldest daughter, Cynthia Meketa, as \nsaying:\n\n       He had a very high intellect, but he was never a snob. He \n     had ups and downs in his\n\n[[Page S13172]]\n\n     early life and always identified with everybody, the cashier \n     at the bank, the guy at the market, the man working at the \n     dump. . . . But that was who he was, kind, generous to people \n     who needed a helping hand. He was a sentimental softie and \n     loved to be a mentor to people, especially his law clerks, \n     shepherding their careers along.\n\n  My good friend, Judge Garvan Murtha, said:\n\n       He was never afraid to stand up for the rights for others \n     and to name what was wrong. He was a brilliant, caring, funny \n     man and appreciative of people. . . . He was a very wise man. \n     . . . In the Pentagon Papers case, he was dissenting, so he \n     ended up on the wrong side of the Court of Appeals, but the \n     Supreme Court ended up agreeing with him.\n\n  His daughter Betsy Oakes said:\n\n       I think everyone who loved and admired my father will want \n     to carry on his tremendous spirit of social justice.\n\n  Mara tells me of the love all the family had for Jim--and I know the \nlove he had for her, his three children, four stepchildren, \ngrandchildren, and his brother.\n  Adam Liptak wrote of Judge Oakes in the New York Times, and I ask \nunanimous consent that his article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 16, 2007]\n\n       James L.

Nixon and yet \n     quickly became one of its leading liberal voices, died on \n     Saturday in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. He was 83.\n       His death was reported by his wife, Mara Williams Oakes, \n     who said it followed a brief illness.\n       Judge Oakes served for 36 years on the court, the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He was its \n     chief judge from 1988 to 1992.\n       Scholarly and gregarious, Judge Oakes insisted in his \n     decisions, speeches and writings that judges should never shy \n     away from protecting fundamental rights.\n       He had little patience, he wrote in a 1997 article in The \n     Columbia Law Review, for politicians who attacked such \n     rulings as improper activism. Historic moments, he added, \n     sometimes required judges to act ``when the rest of our \n     political structure bogs down.''\n       In this sense, he was, he wrote, ``old-fashioned--fashioned \n     from the thirties of the Great Depression, the forties of war \n     and the Holocaust and fascism, the fifties of the cold war \n     and McCarthyism and Little Rock, and the sixties of the civil \n     rights movement, the assassinations and the would-be Great \n     Society.''\n       James Lowell Oakes was born in Springfield, Ill., on Feb. \n     21, 1924.\n       After graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Law \n     School, Mr. Oakes served as a law clerk to Harrie B. Chase, a \n     Vermont judge who sat on the court that Mr. Oakes would one \n     day join.\n       Mr. Oakes then spent two decades practicing law and working \n     in the state government in Vermont. In the 1960s, he served \n     for four years in the State Senate and two as the state \n     attorney general. President Nixon made him a federal district \n     judge in Vermont in 1970 and elevated him to the appeals \n     court in 1971.\n       But Judge Oakes was not proud of the connection. In the \n     years after the Watergate scandal, he used adhesive tape to \n     cover the signatures of President Nixon and Attorney General \n     John N. Mitchell on the judicial commission that hung in his \n     chambers, one of his former clerks, Paul M. Smith, recalled.\n       Judge Oakes's name soon became synonymous in some circles \n     with liberal jurisprudence. In 1981, he attracted the \n     attention of a young lawyer in the Reagan administration \n     named John G. Roberts Jr. Mr. Roberts, who is now the chief \n     justice of the United States, told his superiors, according \n     to The Washington Post, that a civil rights policy he \n     advocated was reasonable because ``even such an extreme \n     liberal'' as Judge Oakes had approved it.\n       The Second Circuit is based in Manhattan, and it hears \n     appeals from New York, Connecticut and Vermont. Judge Oakes's \n     chambers were in Brattleboro, Vt., and he visited New York to \n     hear arguments and to confer with his colleagues. After his \n     service as chief judge ended in 1992, he assumed senior \n     status, a sort of semi-retirement.\n       Besides his wife, of Brattleboro, survivors include a \n     brother, John D. F. Oakes of Wayne, Pa.; three children from \n     an earlier marriage, Cynthia O. Meketa of Bonsall, Calif., \n     Elizabeth H. Oakes of Baltimore, and James L. Oakes of \n     Fairfield, Conn.; and six grandchildren.\n       In both his judicial and scholarly work, Judge Oakes \n     advocated environmental protections, procedural rights for \n     people accused of crimes, free speech, open government and \n     limits on intellectual property laws.\n       Among the rulings he was proudest of, his law former clerks \n     said, were a 1980 decision upholding regulations barring sex \n     discrimination in education, a 1987 decision applying the \n     principle of one-person-one-vote to New York City's Board of \n     Estimate, and a 2000 decision allowing illegal immigrants to \n     challenge deportation orders in court. All three decisions \n     were affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Oakes especially prized the Supreme Court's \n     vindication of his 1971 dissent in the Pentagon Papers case, \n     two of his former clerks, Kathleen M. Sullivan and William \n     Treanor, wrote in The New York Law Journal in March. The \n     majority in the Second Circuit had blocked the publication of \n     the papers, a secret history of the Vietnam War obtained by \n     The New York Times. The Supreme Court reversed that decision.\n       ``The press should not be regarded only as a check on \n     inefficient or dishonest government,'' Judge Oakes said in a \n     1982 lecture on the legacy of the Pentagon Papers case. ``It \n     is important that it also be viewed as a powerful vehicle for \n     the effective functioning of a government that by definition \n     is democratic in nature.'' That required, he said, a near-\n     absolute ban on prior restraints on publication of news \n     articles.\n       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a statement yesterday \n     that Judge Oakes was the ``model of what a great judge should \n     be--learned in the law, but ever mindful of the people law \n     exists to service.''\n       Judge Oakes could be prescient. He dissented from a 1979 \n     decision endorsing the use of an anonymous jury in an \n     organized crime trial. The decision, he said, was ``without \n     precedent in the history of Anglo-American jurisprudence'' \n     and ``strikes a Vermont judge as bizarre, almost Kafka-\n     esque.''\n       He added, correctly, as it turned out, that other courts \n     would follow the precedent as surely as ``a flock of sea \n     gulls follows a lobster boat.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3043, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3043) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2008, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin/Specter amendment No. 3325, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Vitter amendment No. 3328 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     provide a limitation on funds with respect to preventing the \n     importation by individuals of prescription drugs from Canada.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 3335 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     increase funding for the State Heart Disease and Stroke \n     Prevention Program of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 3345 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     require that the Secretary of Labor report to Congress \n     regarding jobs lost and created as a result of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement.\n       Menendez amendment No. 3347 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     provide funding for the activities under the Patient \n     Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of \n     2005.\n       Ensign amendment No. 3342 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     prohibit the use of funds to administer Social Security \n     benefit payments under a totalization agreement with Mexico.\n       Ensign amendment No. 3352 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     prohibit the use of funds to process claims based on illegal \n     work for purposes of receiving Social Security benefits.\n       Lautenberg/Snowe amendment No. 3350 (to amendment No. \n     3325), to prohibit the use of funds to provide abstinence \n     education that includes information that is medically \n     inaccurate.\n       Roberts amendment No. 3365 (to amendment No. 3325), to fund \n     the small business child care grant program.\n       Reed amendment No. 3360 (to amendment No. 3325), to provide \n     funding for the trauma and emergency medical services \n     programs administered through the Health Resources and \n     Services Administration.\n       Allard amendment No. 3369 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     reduce the total amount appropriated to any program that is \n     rated ineffective by the Office of Management and Budget \n     through the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART).\n       Coburn amendment No. 3358 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     require Congress to provide health care for all children in \n     the U.S. before funding special interest pork projects.\n\n[[Page S13173]]\n\n       Brown/Webb amendment No. 3361 (to amendment No. 3325), to \n     provide information to schools relating to the prevention of \n     violent events and other crisis situations.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as you stated, we are back on the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education appropriations bill. We had a good \n2 days last week on it and amendments were disposed of.\n  We now have a whole series of pending amendments. Right now, Senator \nSpecter and I have been working, our staffs have been working, to try \nto get these amendments cleared. That work is continuing.\n  As the leader said, we will have votes today starting at 5:30. We \nhave two amendments. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nvote on these two amendments at 5:30, one following the other.\n  That would be the Allard amendment No. 3369, and the Dorgan amendment \nNo. 3335, as modified by amendment No. 3445. So we would go to those \ntwo amendments in order at 5:30.\n  But I want to make it clear that if we do not reach an agreement on a \nwhole host of other amendments that are pending, we could roll into a \nwhole series of votes.\n  I want to read those off so people know what they are. First, there \nis the amendment by Senator Vitter, No. 3328, dealing with importation \nof drugs from Canada; there is a Dorgan amendment, No. 3345, relating \nto the NAFTA trade agreement; there is the Senator Menendez amendment, \nNo. 3347, providing funding for the Patient Navigator Program; an \namendment by Senator Ensign, No. 3342, dealing with Social Security \nbenefit payments with Mexico; there is a Senator Ensign amendment, No. \n3352, again dealing with Social Security benefits and illegal workers; \nthere is a Lautenberg/Snowe amendment, No. 3350, to prohibit the use of \nfunds dealing with abstinence education; there is a Senator Roberts \namendment, No. 3365, to fund the Small Business Child Care Grant \nProgram; Senator Reed's amendment No. 3360 providing funding for trauma \nin emergency medical services programs; there is a Coburn amendment, \nNo. 3358, that would end all earmarks before every kid in America has \nhealth care; then there is the Brown-Webb amendment, No. 3361, \nproviding information to schools relating to the prevention of violent \nevents and other crisis situations.\n  So all of those amendments are pending. I mean, they are at the desk, \nthey are pending, and can be called up.\n  Quite frankly, as the chairman and floor manager, if we don't reach \nagreement on them, it is my intention that we roll over into those \nvotes tonight.\n  Again, with the concurrence of my ranking member, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5:30 the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to \nthe Allard amendment No. 3369; then when that is disposed of, a vote on \nor in relation to the Dorgan amendment No. 3335, as modified by \namendment 3445; further I ask that there be a 2-minute period of time \nbefore each amendment for debate on both sides; and furthermore, I ask \nunanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be allowed prior to \nthe vote on either one of those two amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We will proceed to vote at 5:30 on those two amendments. \nThen we will have to see whether we can work out clearance on some of \nthese other amendments so we won't have any other votes tonight. But if \nwe don't, we will have to roll into a whole series of votes this \nevening. We have to do this, if we want to finish by noon tomorrow. \nBoth leaders on Thursday made a commitment that we would finish this \nbill by Tuesday at noon. If we are going to do that, I see no way other \nthan having votes tonight or getting the sides to agree on the \nacceptance of these amendments.\n  Senator Specter and I have agreed on a number of these amendments to \nget them worked out, but they are being held up in other places. I \nunderstand that. That is the privilege of any Senator. But hopefully, \nwe can get this worked out, and we won't have to have that many \namendments this evening.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nthe work he has done, and our staffs, bringing the bill to this \nposture. We are within striking distance of concluding it. As Senator \nHarkin has outlined, there is a commitment to finish by noon tomorrow. \nThe managers have been on the floor since shortly after 3, when under \nprevious arrangement this bill was called up, and there are no other \nSenators present now. I know Senator Harkin would join me in urging \nSenators to come to the floor. Anybody who wants to debate an amendment \nought to come to the floor promptly. We will find as the hour of 5:30 \napproaches, Senators will come in when we are about ready to vote, when \nthere is not any time to debate change. Senators will want to find \ntime. Now is the time for Senators to come to the floor who want to \ndebate.\n  I also supplement what Senator Harkin said to this effect: There are \na number of amendments, as the chairman has stated, that have been \ncleared. Some Senators have raised objections. It is their right to \nraise objections, but as frequently happens, once there is discussion, \narrangements can be worked out to clear them. It is our view, Senator \nHarkin's and mine, buttressed by staff negotiations, that these matters \ncan be cleared. But they will take some time. We do not want to get \ninto a situation where at 5:50 tonight after the first vote, there is \nlengthy consideration as to what we are going to be doing at that time. \nThe practice has been to have a single vote on Monday evenings at 5:30. \nWe have two votes lined up, and we know many Senators will have other \ncommitments, which is customary for Monday evening. But they cannot be \nfulfilled unless we conclude the business of the Senate, at least \nmoving along so that we have within striking distance the prospect of \nconcluding the bill by noon tomorrow.\n  Senators who have any debate or who have lodged objections to any \npending amendments should come to the floor now so they can be heard. \nIf they don't, we won't be in a position to consider their objections \nat a later time and still move the bill through to completion by noon \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, I concur with \nwhat Senator Specter said. The list of amendments I read is the list of \namendments that is pending at the desk that we could call up to vote \non. We could do that this evening. There is a bunch of other amendments \nthat Senators have said they are going to offer that we have on our \nlist but they haven't been offered yet. Senator Specter is absolutely \nright, Senators could find themselves in a crunch where there is no \ntime left to offer these amendments by noon tomorrow. So if they want \nto get their amendments considered, now is a good time. They could get \nrecognized right away.\n  I may have misstated something earlier in my unanimous consent \nrequest. I want to be clear that I asked unanimous consent that the \nDorgan amendment 3335 be modified by 3445.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a)  In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $3,000,000 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     to make grants under the State Heart Disease and Stroke \n     Prevention Program.\n        (b) Amounts made available under this Act for consulting \n     services for the Department of Labor, the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education \n     shall be further reduced on a pro rata basis by the \n     percentage necessary to decrease the overall amount of such \n     spending by $3,000,000.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May the record show that the only two Senators on the \nfloor are the two managers. Again, we renew our request, anybody who \nhas any debate they want to offer, amendments they want to offer, or \nobjections they want to raise to any pending amendments ought to come \nto the floor promptly.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S13174]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3369\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my understanding at 5:30 this \nevening we are going to have a vote on my amendment, the Allard \namendment No. 3369. I wish to take a few moments to review with my \ncolleagues the amendment, and then I understand before we have the vote \nI can briefly describe the amendment again.\n  The Office of Management and Budget reviews Federal spending programs \nwith a nonpartisan analysis to determine what taxpayers are receiving \nas far as the value of the taxpayers' dollars is concerned. This \nprogram is called the Program Assessment Rating Tool or PART. They \nutilize the same procedures that business executives use frequently to \ndetermine whether their company is meeting specific goals.\n  In this particular instance, the Congress has directed the agencies \nto put in place a similar system where they set up goals and objectives \nand then determine through that process whether the program is \n``effective,'' ``moderately effective,'' ``adequate,'' ``the results \nare not demonstrated''--they have not made the effort yet--or the last \ncategory would be ``ineffective.''\n  Well, a small percentage of programs receive an ``ineffective'' \nrating. Programs receiving this rating are not, according to OMB, using \nyour tax dollars effectively. As they elaborate on the PART Web site at \n``expectmore.gov'':\n\n       Ineffective programs have been unable to achieve results \n     due to a lack of clarity regarding the program's purpose or \n     goals, poor management, or some other significant weakness.\n\n  Now, my amendment cuts 10 percent of the funding under this bill for \nprograms labeled ``ineffective'' under the OMB PART program and \ntransfers the funding to an account previously established to pay down \nthe national debt.\n  This amendment is supported and scored by the National Taxpayers \nUnion and Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  We are not ending any programs or zeroing out any agencies. All we \nare doing is taking one dollar in ten from programs that cannot justify \ntheir effectiveness and using it to begin to address our over $9 \ntrillion national debt.\n  I understand many people have fond thoughts for some of these \nprograms, but fond thoughts and good intentions do not equal good \ngovernment. I am not one to make sweeping statements, but I think I can \nsay with some certainty that the vote total on this amendment will \nstand as a rough proxy for what percentage of the Senate is committed \nto fiscal discipline.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment. I \nbelieve it is a commonsense amendment to a problem we need to address. \nWe wish to make sure our taxpayer dollars are being used in a way that \ncan be described as effective. That is the ideal situation.\n  Certainly those programs that are classified as ``ineffective'' you \nhave to question. Even though there has been a mission drawn out that \nmay be somewhat appealing, when you get right down into the workings of \nthe agency and nothing much is happening to accomplish the goals and \nobjectives the Congress had in mind at the time it passed the \nlegislation, those particular programs rated as ``ineffective'' is \nwhere my particular amendment is targeted. I think this is a \ncommonsense amendment that brings some fiscal sanity to the process. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in voting for the amendment when we vote \non it at 5:30 this evening.\n  So, Mr. President, having said that, I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3391, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending amendment and call up amendment 3391 and that it \nbe modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3391, as modified, to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     waive the provisions of section 1877(g) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395nn(g)) for Sumter Regional \n     Hospital in Americas Georgia to provide financial support \n     needed to maintain a medical staff and community physicians \n     in the area: Provided, That the aggregate amount of such \n     financial support to all physicians does not exceed $750,000: \n     Provided further, That all payments made under this section \n     are made prior to June 1, 2008, and are disclosed to the \n     Secretary not later than 30 days after such financial support \n     is provided.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a little over an hour ago, Senator \nHarkin, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, and I urged \nSenators who wanted to debate amendments to come to the floor or \nSenators who had objections to pending amendments to come to the floor \nto utilize the time before the 5:30 vote.\n  The managers, Senator Harkin and I, have been on the floor \ncontinuously since shortly after 3 p.m., when the bill was called back \nto the floor for consideration, and we know from practice, regrettably, \nthat when the vote starts at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. or about 5:45 or 10 \nminutes to 6, people will want floor time and have a great deal to say, \nand then we will be unable to accommodate all of the Senators who want \nto act on the bill. Senator Harkin outlined at the outset the two votes \nwhich will begin at 5:30 and said that there was the prospect of \nsubstantial additional voting tonight, if we were unable to clarify \nwhere we stand, because of our target to conclude this bill by noon \ntomorrow, which is the target established by the leaders and by the \nmanagers of this bill.\n  So at this point, at 4:50, I would renew the request that Senators \nwho want to debate, who want to take up any action on the bill, or want \nto discuss any of the pending amendments where objections have been \nlodged, come to the floor now while we have the time to transact that \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on the floor \nseeking recognition--in fact, in the absence of any other Senator on \nthe floor--Senator Harkin is in the cloakroom ready to come to the \nfloor to transact business if any Senator wants to do so, but in the \nabsence of any such Senator, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3345\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I have offered, and it \nis pending, I believe. It may well have been set aside; nonetheless, it \nis pending to the underlying bill. It is the simplest of amendments. It \nis amendment No. 3345, to be modified by amendment No. 3429, and it is \na request of the Department of Labor to do a study which is fairly \ninnocuous.\n  Senators Brown, Stabenow, and Casey and I--also, I ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senator Sanders as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13175]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. With this amendment, I am requiring the Labor Department \nto perform a study to determine the number and the types of jobs that \nwere lost by the North American Free Trade Agreement. That agreement \nwas done a long while ago, but we are now in the process of considering \nadditional trade agreements--one with Peru, one with Panama, one with \nSouth Korea, and one with Colombia. As we bring another group of free-\ntrade agreements--so-called free-trade agreements--to the floor of the \nSenate, I would like to remind our colleagues there is very little \ninformation about what has happened to previous trade agreements except \nthat we know they didn't work out very well, and so we are going to do \nmore of the same.\n  NAFTA, for example--the North American Free Trade Agreement--at the \ntime we did it, we had a modest trade deficit with Canada. Now that has \nturned into a very large trade deficit with Canada. At the time we did \nNAFTA, we had a modest surplus, a very small surplus in trade with \nMexico. Now we have turned that into a very large trade deficit with \nMexico. So we are moving in exactly the wrong direction. Despite that, \nwe still have folks who huff and puff here about the need to do more of \nthe same.\n  I want there to be a study that talks about what are the types of \njobs we have lost as a result of these trade agreements--how many jobs \nhave we lost, in what sectors have we lost those jobs.\n  On October 4 in the Wall Street Journal, this month, the Wall Street \nJournal said: ``Republicans grow skeptical on free trade.'' It was talk \nabout Republicans, but actually the skepticism among non-Republicans is \ngreater. It turns out the dissatisfaction with our trade strategy is \nbipartisan. The poll found that 59 percent of polled Republican voters \nagreed with the following statement:\n\n       Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy, because \n     imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made \n     goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced potentially \n     unsafe products.\n\n  It is not surprising that people are concerned about this free trade \nstrategy. Free trade is a mantra, a moniker that doesn't mean very \nmuch. I like trade. I am for plenty of trade. I come from a State that \nproduces a lot of agricultural product, and we need to find a foreign \nhome for more than half of what we produce, so I don't come to the \nfloor of the Senate saying let's not trade. I say let's do trade \nagreements that are good for this country, not bad for this country.\n  We passed the North American Free Trade Agreement and we were told--\nby the way, this is an agreement that started under George Bush I, it \nwas completed by President Clinton. I opposed President Clinton and \nGeorge Bush I, President Bush. But we were told that if we completed \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, we would have 200,000 \nnew American jobs created in this country as a result. Two economists, \nGary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott--Hufbauer/Schott they called the \nstudy--said, actually, 170,000 new jobs in a couple of years. The \nsupporters of this trade agreement rounded it up to 200,000 new jobs.\n  Let me tell you what has happened since that time. I told you we \nturned a very modest trade surplus with Mexico, about $1.5 billion, \ninto a very large trade deficit, now somewhere around $60 or $70 \nbillion a year.\n  We have a little program in the Labor Department that requires \ncompanies to certify jobs that are lost because the jobs went to \nMexico. Then you get trade adjustment assistance for the workers. So \nwhat we know is 412,000 U.S. jobs have been certified as lost because \nof NAFTA under one program at the Department of Labor.\n  In the 10 years after NAFTA had been approved, I commissioned a study \nfrom the Congressional Research Service, and they identified the top \n100 companies that laid off U.S. workers as a result of NAFTA during \nthat first 10 years. To come up with that, they turned to the \nDepartment of Labor. They have this Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram. It says these top 100 companies accounted for 201,000 jobs \nthey certified were lost due to NAFTA. If you look at all the \ncompanies, that is 412,000 jobs.\n  Let's look at this list, a few of the names. We passed NAFTA--\nHufbauer/Schott--all the political supporters, including those in the \nSenate, thumbing their suspenders, talking about what a wonderful deal \nthis is going to be for the United States, knowing nobody who wears a \nblue suit in this Chamber is going to lose their job. It will be \nsomebody else.\n  Let's look at what happens. Levi Strauss, 15,676 jobs lost due to \nNAFTA. Does that mean people aren't wearing Levis? No, you can find \nsome. Go outside the door, you can find Levis. They are still buying \nthem. You can find places where they are selling them, a popular \nAmerican jean. Except you will not find a pair of Levis made in this \ncountry. That is gone, 15,676--that is a big number.\n  What about just one of them? What about one person--follow that \nperson home from work one day, and that person had to tell their \nspouse: You know what, I lost my job today.\n  The spouse says: What happened?\n  I don't know, I have done a good job, I worked for them for 15 years. \nBut they told me I lost my job. They are moving the job to Mexico.\n  Why?\n  Because I make too much money, that is why. I get paid $6, $8, $10, \n$11 an hour, and that is way too much money. You can hire people for \nmuch less money than that in Mexico, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri \nLanka.\n  Kraft Foods is on this list. Kraft Foods decided they were going to \nmove their Fig Newton cookies to Mexico, Monterrey, Mexico. If somebody \nsays to you someday: Let's go out for some Mexican food, go to the \nstore and buy some Fig Newton cookies. That is Mexican food.\n  All those folks who made Fig Newton cookies in New Jersey, they say \nsome of them had to shovel fig paste with a scoop shovel, but they made \ntoo much money in New Jersey. Is there a better scoop shovel in Mexico \nor is there somebody who will shovel that fig paste for much less money \nper hour? Or is there some natural fig advantage in Mexico? Probably \nnot. It is that Kraft, similar to Levis, decided: this trade agreement \ngives us the opportunity to move these jobs to Mexico.\n  Fruit of the Loom--5,352 U.S. workers in Texas alone. Have people \nstopped wearing underwear? I don't think so. People still wear \nunderwear. They just don't wear underwear made in this country. Fruit \nof the Loom is gone, and I suppose there are people who made a career \nout of Fruit of the Loom and probably enjoyed it. Maybe their neighbors \nkidded them a little bit: you work down at the Fruit of the Loom place. \nBut I bet they enjoyed those careers. But they are gone because those \njobs are moved in search of cheap labor.\n  Barbie playhouses that Mattel made in a Kentucky plant, they shifted \nthat factory to Mexico.\n  The list goes on and on. You can see the list here, the corporations \nthat certify to the Department of Labor that we moved our jobs. These \ncompanies moved the jobs as a result of the NAFTA trade agreement.\n  My feeling about trade agreements is this. When you sign a trade \nagreement with another country, it ought to be mutually beneficial to \nus and them. I came from a meeting 5 minutes ago about the issue of \nautomobiles--nothing to do with trade, it had to do with CAFE \nstandards, better gas mileage for vehicles. Somebody was talking about \nwe are going to have Chinese cars coming into this country. We are \ngoing to see an import of cars into this country because China is \nramping up a very aggressive automobile export industry, and we will \nvery soon see small, efficient cars on the streets of this country \ncoming from China.\n  Guess what. We did a trade agreement with China a while back, a \nbilateral agreement. Here is what we agreed to, with China, a country \nwe have a giant trade deficit with--$230 billion a year. We said this: \nChina, when you sell your cars in the United States, we will impose \na 2.5 percent tariff on your cars. And, by the way, we agree that when \nwe sell U.S. cars, U.S. cars made in the United States, in China, you \ncan impose a 25-percent tariff. So a country we have a huge trade \nimbalance with, the biggest in human history, we said to them: it is OK \nfor you to impose a tariff that is 10 times higher than we would impose \non bilateral automobile trade.\n\n[[Page S13176]]\n\n  It doesn't make any sense. In my judgment, it undermines our \ncountry's economic interests and it undermines our country's jobs. Yet \nthis country does that.\n  We are going to have, as a group of bills on the floor, Peru, \nColombia, Panama, South Korea. Among that group of bills, the free \ntrade agreements have already been done, will be South Korea. Let me \nmention automobiles in South Korea. Last year, they shipped us close to \n700,000 cars, put them on ships and sent them to this country to be \nsold in America and 700,000 cars made in Korea sent here to be sold to \nAmerican customers. We were able to send 5,000 American cars to South \nKorea. Why the imbalance, 700,000 this way, 5,000 that way? Because \nthat is the way South Korea wants it; 99 percent of the cars on the \nstreets in South Korea are made in South Korea and that is the way they \nwant it. They don't want our cars sold in South Korea, they want the \njobs there, they want to make the cars there and sell them there. Why \nwould our country allow that to be the case?\n  This agreement that is going to be brought to the Senate, the trade \nagreement with South Korea, does not address that issue.\n  I could, and I have, spoken at great length about trade on a wide \nrange of issues. But at some point we need to reconcile what we are \ndoing with these agreements and we need to stop this bad habit of \nnegotiating bad agreements for this country. We don't know who \nnegotiates this. But the person who said to China it is OK for you to \nimpose a 10 times higher tariff on U.S. cars than we would impose on \nChinese cars, that person obviously doesn't understand whom he or she \nis working for. I have threatened, from time to time, that these trade \nnegotiators should go out and negotiate--in secret, presumably, on \nbehalf of our country, should begin to wear jerseys such as they wear \nin the Olympics, so occasionally they could look down and try to \nremember for whom they work. These trade agreements undermine this \ncountry's basic economic strength.\n  People say it is fine these jobs migrate.\n  It is not fine. A country without a strong, vibrant manufacturing \nbase is not destined to long be a world economic power, and we have to \nunderstand that. I am not talking about protectionism or building \nwalls, I am talking about trade, and plenty of it, but trade in \ncircumstances where the rules are fair and where this country insists \non fair rules.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Harkin, the chairman of the committee, \nis here and perhaps is about to make a presentation. I do wish to say I \nhave filed this amendment. It is the most innocuous. It says let's at \nleast go back and take a snapshot of this one trade agreement, NAFTA, \nand find out what happened. What happened with jobs? How many did we \nlose? What kind? Where from? But apparently even this is controversial.\n  Why? Because maybe we will learn something. Maybe we will learn that \nthese one-way trade agreements are not in this country's interests and \nthat we ought to be smart, shrewd, and tough negotiators, standing up \nfor our country's economic interests, standing up for our jobs.\n  One final point. In a century we lifted this country's standards; \nexpanded the middle class. We said you have to have a safe workplace. \nYou have to have child labor laws, minimum wages, the right to \norganize--a whole series of rules that lifted America. Now we are \nsaying let's compete with others and allow them to diminish those \nstandards. I am not very interested in doing that.\n  I know the people who made Huffy bicycles couldn't compete for 20 or \n30 cents an hour. They made $11 in Ohio. They all lost their jobs \nbecause they couldn't compete with people who made bicycles for 20 or \n30 cents an hour, so every Huffy bicycle is made in China. None are \nmade in Ohio. I know you can't compete with that, but I don't think \nthat should be the standard of competition because I think by its \nnature it diminishes economic opportunity in this country.\n  I am going to ask, if we can't clear this amendment, that we have a \nvote on this amendment. I appreciate the work the chairman of the \nsubcommittee has done. I support his bill and am pleased to speak in \nfavor of the bill, generally, which I have done on a previous occasion. \nMy hope is he will support the amendment I have offered as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for always being on \nthe side of American workers and American jobs. I assure him he will \nhave my support on the amendment. We do not have it cleared yet. We may \nhave to have a vote on it. But if that is so, perhaps that could be one \nof the votes we have tonight, if we don't get an agreement on it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3369\n\n  I wish to take the time--we will be voting at 5:30. As I said, we \nwill be voting on the first one, which will be the Allard amendment, \namendment No. 3369. I thought I would take a few minutes to talk about \nthe amendment.\n  It sounds simple. You cut funds for programs that the Bush \nadministration has concluded are ineffective, using what is called the \nProgram Assessment Rating Tool--PART--then use these savings to reduce \nthe debt. We are all for making sure taxpayers' dollars are spent well \nand responsibly, but let's take a look at what this amendment really \nmeans.\n  First, we have to have some background on PART, the Program \nAssessment Rating Tool. It is intended to help assess the management \nand performance of individual programs. So it is not just a question of \nwhether the program works, it also evaluates whether Congress has \ndesigned the program in a clear manner and whether Federal agencies do \na good job managing the program. So programs evaluated under PART fall \ninto one of five categories: They are effective, moderately effective, \nadequate, ineffective or results not determined.\n  The last category means there was not enough information about it to \nmake a decision.\n  The Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, would only cut programs that \nare rated ineffective and take that money and apply it to the deficit. \nIt sounds good. Why should you ever support an ineffective program?\n  First of all, let's take a look at what PART means. What is PART and \nhow is it used? This is what the President's own budget documents say \nabout PART:\n\n       Ratings do not result in automatic decisions about funding.\n       Clearly, over time, funding should be targeted to programs \n     that can prove they achieve measurable results. In some \n     cases, a PART rating of ``ineffective'' or ``results not \n     demonstrated'' may suggest that greater funding is necessary \n     to overcome identified shortcomings, while a funding decrease \n     may be proposed for a program rated ``effective'' if it is \n     not a priority or has completed its mission.\n\n  This is the President's budget. I say: Read it. It says: Sometimes if \nyou have an ``ineffective'' rating, maybe you ought to have greater \nfunding for it to overcome some shortcomings, rather than if you have \nan effective program that may be getting funded, maybe it should be \ndone away with because either it is not a priority or has completed its \nmission.\n  In other words, the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado, \nMr. Allard, is counter to the idea behind creating the PART process. It \nwas not intended as a club on an ``ineffective'' program, or it was \ndesigned to assess the impact of programs, identify steps that could be \ntaken to improve them.\n  Now, that is not my only problem with this misguided amendment. I am \nconcerned about the important programs Americans need that would be \nundermined by his amendment. Make no mistake about it, a vote for \nSenator Allard is a vote against the programs you see listed on this \nsecond chart. A vote for Senator Allard's amendment says we should undo \nthe fiscal mess created by the Bush administration policy of tax cuts \nfor the millionaires and the war in Iraq by reducing funding for \nprograms that help some students prepare for college, provide \nunemployed low-income seniors with income, retrain workers who lose \ntheir jobs due to foreign trade.\n  Now, here are some of the programs that would lose 10 percent of the \nfunding in the bill if the Allard amendment were adopted. The TRIO \nUpward Bound Program is funded at $315 million in\n\n[[Page S13177]]\n\nthe Senate bill. There are 900 sites throughout the country, including \n8 sites and over 700 students in the State of Colorado, I say to the \noccupant of the chair.\n  Here is what the Bush budget had to say about this program. This is a \nquote from the Bush budget:\n\n       The program received an ineffective PART rating when \n     assessed in 2002, in part, because the program evaluation \n     showed that the program did not overall increase the \n     proportion of participants who enrolled in college. However, \n     the program was found to have a positive impact for higher \n     risk students for whom the evaluation findings revealed that \n     Upward Bound increased 4-year college enrollment rates. In \n     response to this finding, the Department of Education \n     established a priority for the 2006 competition that required \n     projects to ensure that at least 30 percent of participants \n     were higher risk students. Given the improved targeting, \n     continued funding is warranted.\n\n  In other words--I better watch myself, I am saying nice things about \nthe administration--basically what they did is they actually \nimplemented the PART program correctly. They looked at it, they said, \nokay, it got an ineffective rating. Why? Well, because, they said, \noverall it did not show that it increased 4-year college participation.\n  But when they looked at the subset of the higher risk students, they \nsaid: It increased the college participation. So here is what we will \ndo. We will require projects to ensure that at least 30 percent of the \nparticipants are higher risk students. That is how you use this tool. \nYou do not use it as a club to get rid of it, I say to my friend from \nColorado.\n  The President's own budget says the program is worthwhile. Look at \nthe Perkins Career and Technical Education State Grants. It is funded \nat $1.2 billion. That is last year's level. We did not increase it. \nLast year, the Congress reauthorized and strengthened the program, and \nthe Senate passed it by unanimous consent. In the House of \nRepresentatives there was only one vote against it. Here is what the \nBush budget said:\n\n       The Perkins Act incorporates several important changes that \n     strengthen the program's accountability provisions and \n     provides opportunities to improve the program's performance.\n\n  Then there is the Community Service Employment for Older Americans. \nWe had funded it at last year's level. This provides part-time \ncommunity service opportunities paid at minimum wage for unemployed \nlow-income persons.\n  The Health Professions Program: Now, this is interesting. We put in \n$357 million this year. The Allard amendment would cut it by $35.7 \nmillion. This is the category that includes almost all health training \nin America: nurse training programs, training in primary care medicine, \ndentistry programs. All of these would take a cut.\n  Then there is trade adjustment assistance: $888.7 million in this \nbill, last year's level, same thing the President requested. Again, \nthis provides income support and retraining services to workers who \nlose their jobs due to foreign trade. Approximately 120,000 Americans \nare eligible each year, but only about 80,000 actually receive \nservices.\n  Again, if we adopt the Allard amendment for the TRIO program at an \naverage cost of $5,000 a student, we would cut 6,300 students out of \nthe TRIO program.\n  For trade adjustment assistance, at about $12,000 per person, that \nmeans a loss of services to 7,400 workers who have lost their jobs and \nwant to get retrained.\n  For the Community Service Employment Program, $5,932 for older \nworkers--a modest amount every year to an older person--means a loss of \nsupport for 8,142 low-income seniors.\n  The Allard amendment on its face, you look at it and say: Well, he is \ncutting 10 percent from those programs rated ineffective. So you want \nto think: Well, gee, why would I support an ineffective program? No one \nwants to support ineffective programs. But, again, I refer to the first \nchart. I repeat again, you have to understand what PART is; that is, \nthe Program Assessment Rating Tool, and how it is used. I will read \nagain from the President's own budget.\n\n       PART ratings do not result in automatic decisions about \n     funding.\n\n  Well, the Allard amendment would be an automatic decision about \ncutting 10 percent. Clearly, over time, funding should be targeted at \nprograms that can prove they achieve measurable results. I say to my \nfriend from Colorado, it says:\n\n       In some cases, a PART rating of ``ineffective'' or \n     ``results not demonstrated'' may suggest that greater funding \n     is necessary in order to overcome identified shortcomings, \n     while a funding decrease may be proposed for a program rated \n     ``effective'' if it is not a priority or has completed its \n     mission.\n\n  So there may be effective programs that are rated as ``effective'' \nthat probably ought to be cut. I am sure the administration and OMB are \nprobably doing that, because they have either completed their mission \nor it is not a priority.\n  On the other hand, there may be some of those rated ``ineffective'' \nas mentioned in the TRIO program, rated as ineffective. When they \nlooked at the overall score, they said: Well, it is effective if you \nlook at higher risk students. So they carved it out and said: Thirty \npercent has to go to higher risk students. Then they requested the \ncontinued funding for it.\n  I say to my friend from Colorado, I understand his desire. Everybody \nwants to cut down on something that is ineffective. But I do think that \nif the Senator were to read and understand completely what that Program \nAssessment Rating Tool does, he might agree with the President's own \nwords on his budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments the Senator from \nIowa was making. I was not elected to this body--I do not think the \nSenator from Iowa was either--to make easy votes. This can be a \ndifficult vote. There are programs on there that I support, I support \nwholeheartedly, but I want them to be effective. How can I go back to \nmy taxpayers in the State of Colorado and say: Well, we are spending \nbillions of dollars on this program, but it is ineffective. It is not \nmeasuring up to the standards which most businesses would be expected \nto measure up to for performance, or maybe other agencies are going to \nmeasure up to for performance.\n  I do not know how else to get the attention of the bureaucracy except \nto deal with them where they pay attention. That is their pocketbooks, \ntheir budget. I think when we have an ineffective program, we are not \ndoing our jobs as Senators if we do not figure out a way to bring \naccountability to the program.\n  Now, this is a modest attempt to try to bring some accountability. We \ndo not eliminate any programs. We do a reduction on a few programs that \nare listed as ``ineffective.''\n  In the business world, they use the same process that OMB puts in \nplace. This is not a partisan process. You know, you referred to \nPresident Bush's actions on it. It may be a Democratic President 3 \nyears from now. He is going to be dealing with the same problems this \nPresident is dealing with, that he has programs out there that simply \nare not measuring up.\n  So let me get back to what the standard business world does. They \nlook at a program and say: Well, look, we are spending a certain amount \nof money, and it is not performing. Because it is not performing, we \nhave either got to redo the program, which is an option the Congress \ncan look at, or we eliminate it altogether, or we create some other \nkind of modification that is going to make it accountable to the \nstockholders of that company.\n  The stockholders in this case are the taxpayers of the country. They \nare the ones putting money in this program. They are the ones who \nexpect the program to do what it says, for what it is set up to do. \nThis is a program that has been in place for 10 years. It is not a new \nprogram.\n  The agencies have had plenty of time to respond and react to this \nparticular effort. I would credit those agencies or programs that are \nlisted as ineffective for at least having tried to comply with the law.\n  There is another group there I did not address. There are those where \nresults have not been demonstrated. They are sort of thumbing their \nnose at the Congress and saying: Heck, we are not even going to bother \nto set up any goals and objectives for our program. We are going to let \nit run on auto. In some cases they have a legitimate reason for doing \nthat, but I do\n\n[[Page S13178]]\n\nthink the Congress does need to look at those programs that are \nineffective and make some judgments. Now, if the Senator from Iowa has \na better suggestion on how we may bring accountability to the agencies, \nI would be glad to hear what it is.\n  I think a modest reduction in their budget will send a message to \nthem that you have got to get your act in order, and then hopefully, as \nwe go down through the years, they will begin to understand that it is \nthe Congress that controls the purse strings, and you need to get your \nact in order; we need to have accountability in the program.\n  I think this is a commonsense amendment. It is being supported by \nCitizens Against Government Waste. The National Taxpayers Union is \nsupporting it. I have sat down with groups on how it is we can bring \nforward effective, efficient Government.\n  We do not want programs out there that make all of these grandiose \nclaims but then do not deliver. They waste taxpayers' dollars in the \nprocess. So this is what this amendment is trying to address. I ask my \ncolleagues to support me in this effort. It is a modest amendment. It \nis something that I think can make a difference.\n  If you want the legislative branch to have a little power over the \nexecutive branch through the purse strings, this is the way to do it. \nAgain, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I listened to my friend from \nColorado, but maybe the right amendment would be to go after the \nProgram Assessment Rating Tool, because as it says: Some of the \nprograms that are rated ineffective actually may need more money.\n  I will give the Senator one example. A couple of years ago, a school \nthat I know very well here in Washington, DC, called Gallaudet \nUniversity--it is the university for the deaf here in America, premier \ncollege in the world, as a matter of fact--got an ``ineffective'' \nrating. That got me pretty upset until I started looking at it, finding \nout why it was ineffective. Now, if we had cut their funding by 10 \npercent, they never would have become effective. But because we got \nthem in, and the committee did its job--and that is what the \ncommittee's function is for; if there is something that is ineffective, \nthat is why we have committees.\n  Call them up, ask them what is happening. Make them explain why it \nhas an ``ineffective,'' why it was demonstrated ``no results,'' and \nthen let the committee do its work. That is what we did with Gallaudet. \nWe could have had a 10-percent cut there, and they never would have \nbecome effective. They just needed better guidance and better \ndirection. That is what the committee structure does. That is why we \nhave the executive branch overseeing these things. That is the better \nway to approach it than this kind of sledgehammer approach.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If I may respond, it is not a sledgehammer approach. It \nis a mild little push to try to improve the program. I agree, some \nprograms can be improved if we increase appropriations, and that is \nwhat we need to do. But maybe to get their attention, to get things \nmoving in the right direction, maybe we need to start out with a \nreduction in spending. This is a commonsense program. We can argue \nabout it. I have never been in any committees where they talked about \nit in this way. I think it needs to be talked about more, and that is \nwhy I am introducing the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is why we have the Appropriations Committee. Yes, we \ndo call them up, and we do look into these matters. But it is not this \nkind of heavyhanded approach that is going to cut programs that \nactually have taken steps, such as the Upward Bound Program, to be more \neffective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5:30 having arrived, the question \nis on agreeing to the Allard amendment, with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be permitted to do that at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3347, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the vote \nsequence previously agreed to, the Dorgan amendment, No. 3335, as \nmodified, be removed from the agreement and the Menendez amendment, No. \n3347, be substituted and the amendment be modified with the text of \namendment No. 3428, and that the Senate then vote in relation to the \nMenendez amendment, No. 3347, as modified, following the disposition of \nthe Allard amendment, and that all other provisions of the previous \norder remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the Allard \namendment, No. 3369.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: I understand there is 2 minutes, \nif the Senator wants it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to take a minute to briefly explain the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Allard amendment is a commonsense amendment. It looks \nat those programs that are rated as ineffective by the Office of \nManagement and Budget. It is a nonpartisan process. It was set up by \nthe Congress more than 10 years ago. It is time the Congress expect \nsome accountability in that program itself. One can look on \nexpectmore.gov which lists the agencies that are performing and those \nthat are not. Some of these programs are my favorite programs. I voted \nfor them and support them. But we have to bring accountability so that \nwhen we are supporting a program, it actually does what it says it is \ngoing to do; that all the money doesn't go to the bureaucracy and none \nof it gets to the beneficiaries. We are trying to bring some \naccountability to this process. That is the reason for the amendment.\n  My hope is that the Senate will vote for this in strong numbers so we \ncan send a message to agencies that they need to begin to get their act \nin order, those that are rated as ineffective. We need to, in the \ncommittee process, refer to this rating. Let's put them on record in \ncommittee meetings to hold them accountable for their programs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a heavyhanded club approach. \nAlready we know that sometimes programs are rated ineffective, as the \nPresident's own budget says, and actually need more funding. Some of \nthose rated ``effective'' probably ought to have their funding cut. But \nthe Senator from Colorado says we are just going to cut all these \nprograms across the board that are rated ``ineffective.''\n  As I pointed out, Gallaudet College in Washington, DC, probably the \nfinest university for the deaf in the world--not probably, it is--\nsomehow got an ``ineffective'' rating. They changed things. Now they \nhave an ``effective'' rating. Had they been cut 10 percent, they never \nwould have been able to get ``effective'' again. This is not the proper \nway to do things. This is something for committees to handle and for \nthe executive branch. I know the Senator from Colorado has well-meaning \nintentions, but they are misdirected and misguided because the Program \nAssessment Rating Tool is not the kind of instrument the Senator is \nenvisioning with his amendment.\n  I yield back whatever time I have. I move to table the Allard \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing \nto the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nObama) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

We are \non a glidepath to finish this legislation by 12:30 tomorrow, so \neveryone is going to have to cooperate and get things done.

There will now be 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Menendez amendment, as modified.\n  Who yields time?\n  Senators will please take their conversations off the floor. The \nSenate is not in order. Will the Senate please come to order so we may \nhear the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHutchison be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wanted to thank Senators Harkin and \nSpecter for their leadership on the bill and their strong support of \nthis amendment, which is to put $8 million in the\n\n[[Page S13180]]\n\nPatient Navigator and Chronic Disease Prevention Act. It is strongly \nsupported by a letter that was issued by the American Cancer Society, \nthe Leukemia Lymphoma Society, the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers, the National Medical Association, the National Patient \nAdvocate Foundation, and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation.\n  What they say in their letter sums it up in its totality. It says: \nImproving the health of America as a whole depends significantly on our \nability to improve health outcomes for the uninsured, those who live in \nrural areas, minorities--\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Senator from \nWest Virginia is correct. Will the Senators please take their \nconversations off the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the American Cancer Society and all of \nthese other organizations tell us that this amendment will help \nindividuals who are in rural communities, minorities, and other \nmedically underserved populations who suffer from a disproportionate \nburden of cancer, navigate the health care system, create more positive \noutcomes, save money, and save lives. That is why we urge all of our \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time in \nopposition?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Everybody wants to \nknow if there will be more votes tonight. We don't know yet. We are \ntrying to work out amendments with the other side. We have been \ninstructed by the leadership to finish this bill by 12:30 tomorrow. We \nstill have a lot of amendments pending. We are trying to work them \nthrough. Depending on the progress within the next half hour or so, we \nwill know whether we need to have more votes tonight.\n  There are a lot of amendments pending. If somehow we can get these \noffered tonight and stacked for votes tomorrow, we might be able to do \nthat. If not, we may have to have votes further tonight. I have been \ninstructed by my leader to continue in that vein. So I cannot say yet \nif we are going to have more votes tonight. It depends on how many can \nbe accepted on both sides. We will know shortly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be recognized for 10 \nminutes to speak about the fires in California; that upon the end of \nher presentation, the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin, be recognized \nfor 5 minutes for the purpose of offering an amendment; that at the end \nof that 5 minutes, the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be \nrecognized for 5 minutes to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin and my colleagues. \nMany of them have come up to Senator Feinstein and myself tonight and \nhave expressed their concern about the fires that are raging out of \ncontrol in our State, home to 37 million people, very dangerous fires, \nkind of a perfect storm of extremely high temperatures, very low \nhumidity, and Santa Ana winds which gust up to hurricane-type winds, \nsometimes as high as 50, 60 miles an hour, with the average about 35 \nmiles an hour.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have heavy hearts as we talk with our \nGovernor and our mayors. They are conveying to us that this is very \nserious because our firefighters are at a huge disadvantage because of \nthe unpredictability of the winds. We don't know from one moment to the \nnext whether the fires will turn on these firefighters. Last year was a \nvery tough year for us in California. We had some horrific experiences, \nand we lost firefighters. We are not going to repeat that situation. We \nhave to make sure we save lives, that we get people out of their homes. \nAt this point, I can say people appear to be cooperating with the \nauthorities. The most important point is we care about each other and \nwe save lives.\n  There are now more than a dozen wildfires burning, again, all being \nfanned by these hot Santa Ana winds, raging from as far south as the \nMexican border to as far north as Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. \nGovernor Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency in seven \ncounties--Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, \nSanta Barbara, and Ventura. More than 250,000 people are evacuated in \nSan Diego County alone, where blazes have torched more than 100,000 \nacres. Senator Feinstein and I spoke with Mayor Sanders today, and he \ntold us that one condominium complex has burned with 400 units.\n  Mayor Sanders warns we have tough times ahead. There are walls of \nflames 100 to 200 feet high. There are fires popping up everywhere, \nwith eight separate fires burning in that region. More than a dozen \npeople are being treated at the UC San Diego Medical Center Regional \nBurn Center for smoke inhalation and burns, including four firefighters \nwho are seriously injured. One individual we know of has lost his life \nin San Diego.\n  Our firefighters deserve our prayers, our help, and our thoughts, as \ndo all the people in the southern California region. We have to \nremember that they go out there and do everything they are trained to \ndo, and the last thing they think about is themselves. Yet and still, \nwe have been trying for years to pass the Healthy Firefighters Act to \nfollow these firefighters who work in these horrific situations, and \nsome of them have absolutely no health insurance. We are trying to \nprotect them and follow them so we can make sure that in future years, \nthey are not plagued from the smoke inhalation.\n  I wish to show a picture. I hope my colleagues will take a look at \nit. San Diego, this is one photo. We can see, if we look closely, the \nfirefighters. From where they are getting any oxygen is hard to know. \nThey are literally in the fires of hell right there.\n  Then in Santa Clarita, more than 25,000 acres have burned and \napproximately 800 homes have been evacuated. I will show another \npicture. We can see the fire in the hills threatening the homes. Eight \nhundred homes have been evacuated in this region.\n  Most of my colleagues have seen the reports of Malibu. More than \n2,400 acres have burned. We can get a sense of what is happening there. \nThis is a photo of a beach. This is the water, the Pacific Ocean. You \ncannot see in front of you the fires, the smoke, the wind blowing the \nsand. I was in southern California. I left this morning, and yesterday \nI was out in the Santa Anas.\n  To give my colleagues a sense of what it is like, the winds are so \nstrong in the desert areas and in the beach areas that you can taste \nthe grit of the sand in your mouth and feel it in your eyes and \ncertainly in your lungs.\n  In Malibu, more than 2,400 acres burned. Several homes and structures \nhave been destroyed, including the Malibu Presbyterian Church. My \nunderstanding is the church was able to remove computers and some other \nitems they desperately needed, but that building is gone. The Pacific \nCoast Highway remains closed, and the evacuations continue as we speak.\n  Again, thousands of our brave firefighters are frantically working in \nconjunction with the California department of forestry and the U.S. \nForest Service, the California Highway Patrol, the U.S. Border Patrol, \nand FEMA to contain these fires. I thank all the dedicated Federal \nworkforce who have joined in this effort. They deserve our prayers and \nsupport as well.\n  People are escaping with only the clothes on their backs. Families \nhave no time to gather anything as they flee from the inferno that \nengulfs everything it touches.\n  This is only the most recent information. As I speak, these fires \nrage on. The Governor says they don't expect a diminution of these \nSanta Ana winds until at best tomorrow afternoon, maybe Wednesday. We \npray these winds stop their fierce blowing.\n  We need to make sure our communities have the resources they need \nnow. California cannot fight this battle alone. I mentioned the \nagencies that are out there already helping. I know the equipment is \nbeing given as we speak.\n  The Governor has declared a disaster in seven counties, and as soon \nas he asks the President for a Federal declaration, I know President \nBush will act swiftly. There are certain areas where we have to work \ntogether where there cannot be an inch of distance between us.\n  As I stand here, I look over at my friend, Senator Landrieu, and I \nsee the compassion in her face because she is still working night and \nday, 24/7 to make sure her State is whole again. I, again, pledge to \nher--she knows I will be there with her every step of the way.\n  So these are the times when we in this Senate have to cross over \nparty lines, and we do, to make sure we make life livable for people \nwho have lost, in some cases, everything--everything material. Again, I \nwant to say the most important point is we save lives.\n  I ask for an additional 1 minute, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this isn't just a fight to contain \nwildfires. This is a fight to save lives. This is a fight to save \nschools and homes and businesses. Again, I thank all the firefighters, \nthe local officials, the volunteers, my own staff who is out there \nworking. I thank the President and FEMA and all the Federal workers.\n  Right now we must contain these fires. Right now we must save lives. \nRight now we must provide shelter and hope for those displaced.\n  I again thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have \ncome up to me or have come up to Senator Feinstein and said to us: \nPlease let us know what we can do. We will be calling on our \ncolleagues. We know they care very much about the 37 million people of \nmy State, and a large proportion of them in southern California being \nimpacted by these fires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3400 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment so I may call up amendment No. 3400.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself, Mr. \n     Smith, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3400 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide support to Iraqis and Afghans who arrive in the \n        United States under the Special Immigrant Visa program)\n\n       On page 126, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 521.  Iraqi and Afghan aliens granted special \n     immigrant status under section 101(a)(27) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)) shall be eligible \n     for resettlement assistance, entitlement programs, and other \n     benefits available to refugees admitted under section 207 of \n     such Act (8 U.S.C. 1157) for a period not to exceed 6 months.\n\n\n[[Page S13182]]\n\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Senators Smith, Lieberman, Durbin and I \noffer this amendment to grant Iraqi and Afghan special immigrant visa \nholders 6 months of eligibility for resettlement assistance when they \narrive here in the United States.\n  The United States currently provides up to 500 special immigrant \nvisas, SIVs, to translators from Iraq and Afghanistan. To be eligible \nfor an SIV, an individual from either of those two countries must: (1) \nfaithfully serve as a translator with the U.S. military or chief of \nmission for at least a year and (2) be recommended to the program by a \ngeneral, flag officer, or chief of mission. Visas are also issued for \nthe spouse and dependent children of the SIV applicant.\n  According to the Department of State, the U.S. issued 823 special \nimmigrant visas to Iraqis this year. This included 432 visas for \nprincipal applicants and 391 visas for family members.\n  As a matter of course, immigrants who come to the United States \nthrough the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, including Iraqis and \nAfghans, are eligible for travel loans to help them get to the United \nStates and for resettlement assistance once they arrive here. As a \nmatter of course, the Federal Government tries to ensure that refugees \nare able to make the transition to a productive life in the United \nStates by providing preliminary housing; school enrollment; and job \ntraining assistance.\n  In spite of their service to our country, however, individuals from \nIraq and Afghanistan who come here on Special Immigrant Visas receive \nno help with travel or readjustment.\n  The U.S. Government does not keep track of how many of the 823 Iraqis \nadmitted into this program actually have been able to travel to the \nUnited States. Experts believe that many translators with SIVs are \nstill trapped in the region because they cannot afford the cost of the \nSIV fees and the plane tickets, especially if they are bringing members \nof their immediate family.\n  Like refugees, many Iraqi and Afghan special immigrants face \nhardships that make it difficult to immediately adapt to their new \nhome. Many have been forced to leave their homes and all their personal \nwealth in Iraq. Many have been forced to pay ransoms or have been \nrobbed by criminals while fleeing the country. Moreover, while \ntranslators are paid well by Iraqi standards, that compensation doesn't \namount to much for people trying to live in the United States.\n  U.S. soldiers are paying for the plane tickets of their Iraqi \ninterpreters out of their own pockets and acting as hosts and social \nworkers for the individuals and families they are unofficially \n``sponsoring'' when they arrive here in the U.S. This puts a heavy \nstrain on our soldiers attempting to make their own tough readjustment \nto life back home.\n  Special immigrant translators have no past experience obtaining work \npermits, Social Security numbers, bank accounts, and all the other \ndocuments and necessities of everyday life in this country. While \nspecial immigrant translators have valuable job skills, they often need \nfurther training and assistance with job placement.\n  So Senator Smith and I have introduced this amendment to make these \nspecial immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan eligible for 6 months-- of \nresettlement assistance. They have been the eyes and ears of our \nmilitary, and they have saved so many American lives. They now have a \ntarget on their back because of their service to our country, and we \nneed to protect them by granting them safe refuge in the United States. \nFrankly, I don't know how we could justify doing any less for people \nforced to flee their homes and their country because they have been \nhelping us. This is just for 6 months--just enough to get them on their \nfeet.\n  I would note that the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, has estimated \nthat the amendment would have no effect on direct spending under \ncurrent law.\n  The Iraqis and Afghans admitted under the special immigrant visa \nprogram have risked their lives to serve the United States. Without the \nassistance my amendment offers, they may remain trapped in the region \nor they may face a tougher time than is necessary or right adjusting to \nU.S. society. My amendment is a helping hand to people who have helped \nus. It's a way to repay them for their service by helping them to get \nhere and begin living safe and productive lives in America. We have a \nstrong obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis and Afghans who have \nworked so bravely with us--and have often paid a terrible price for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3446 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk--I want \nto clarify it has actually been filed--amendment No. 3446.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is at the desk.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to call it up for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside and the clerk will report.\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment without \nprejudice to the rights of all Senators.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. LANDRIEU] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3446 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, line 10, strike the colon and insert:\n       Provided further, That, no less than 25% of the new grants \n     under the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling program, \n     shall be awarded to local education agencies that demonstrate \n     a need for additional counseling services due to the impact \n     of a federally declared major disaster or emergency.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, first let me say I wish to be added as a \ncosponsor to Senator Cardin's amendment. I was very taken by his \npresentation about the responsibility that we do have, and it has been \non my mind, actually, for several weeks about our allies and support \nstaff in Afghanistan and Iraq, so I want the clerk to note that I wish \nto be a cosponsor to the Cardin amendment.\n  But I rise to speak about an amendment I am offering, and I have had \nsome very good advice and counsel on this amendment from several \nmembers of the committee, and I will speak about the amendment as if it \nis modified, because Senator Kennedy suggested I might make some \nchanges to it.\n  As you may remember, last week the Senate was very helpful in \nreinstating one mental health program that had been cut, I think very \ninappropriately, and it couldn't have been at a worse time for us in \nthe gulf coast. It was an outstanding model program. Last week the \nSenate adopted my amendment to reinstate a child's health program that \nLSU had been running for 4 years, because after Katrina and Rita hit, \nit was literally the only child counseling program in the metropolitan \narea. That has already been done.\n  Tonight I come to the floor to try to help again in the same area of \nmental health. We have crafted this amendment so that it has no impact \non the underlying bill because what it does, basically, is set a \ncompetitive preference. This is not a set-aside but a competitive \npreference for programs within the already existing and already funded \nschool-based mental health program. That has been well established and \nwell run for many years.\n  My amendment, with the Kennedy modification, simply says that the \nDepartment should look out in the country, and if there are areas where \na disaster has been declared, they would give a competitive preference \nto those areas and to those schools in giving out these grants for \ncounseling.\n  I cannot even begin to express the heroic efforts of our schools--\npublic schools, private schools, and parochial schools--and the things \nsome principals, teachers, faith-based organizations, and foundations \nhave done to help rebuild hundreds of schools that were destroyed. We \nfound, in our disaster--and of course we are learning a lot from the \nlessons learned in the disasters of Katrina and Rita, but one thing I \nknow for sure, and I don't need a survey or anybody else to tell me \nabout it because, as you know, I have been following it pretty closely, \nis that\n\n[[Page S13183]]\n\nthe first thing parents and a community want back, basically, is their \nschools.\n  After a whole neighborhood is destroyed, or large parts of a city, no \nmatter how large or how small, in order to get back to normal, parents \nfirst have to get their children safe and into a school. So we noticed \nright after Katrina-Rita, with 300,000 children looking for a place to \ngo to school on Monday morning, there was a great struggle underway for \nparents to start to stabilize their family situation by getting their \nchildren back in school. Even if the family had no home, even if the \nfather or mother had no job, even if they couldn't locate the \ngrandparents, they were first thinking about where can our children go \nto school on that Monday morning.\n  Imagine the children coming into schools--and I could tell you so \nmany stories, extraordinary stories of teachers and schools and \nprincipals who opened their arms to children who came in and who had \nbeen traumatized from not only, of course, losing their own home, but \nsome of the children swam out of water, some children, unfortunately, \nsaw many people die in the disaster, and some had losses in their own \nimmediate families. So I don't think I have to explain the need and the \nimportance of mental health counseling.\n  That is what this bill does. Senator Harkin has been a phenomenal \nsupporter of this program. I think he actually helped to create it. \nAgain, I am not asking for any new money to be added. I am not even \nasking for a set-aside for any of the programs in the gulf coast. I am \nsimply saying as we look to the future to fund these programs that we \ngive a competitive preference, if you will, for schools that find \nthemselves in disaster areas.\n  Senator Boxer spoke for 10 minutes on the crisis underway in Southern \nCalifornia. Imagine the trauma some of these children are going to be \ndealing with over the next months and years trying to rebuild in those \ncommunities, or if their home was completely destroyed by fire. These \ndisasters, by their very nature, cluster in certain communities. So you \nmight have a group of schools where 90 percent of the children lost \ntheir homes, or a large proportion of children might have lost someone \nin their family in a disaster. So it makes common sense for us to be a \nlittle more sensitive to these mega disasters, and that is what my \namendment does. So I offer it now. I don't know if it can be accepted \nby voice vote. I am happy for it to be voted on at any time. If \neverything else is in order, I will leave the rest to the managers.\n  While I am waiting on some documents in another matter, let me say a \nfew more things about this. The funds would be divided between four \ngrantees to leverage funds for mental health services, as I said, to \nthe schools. The schools play a central role after a communitywide \ntraumatic event. Schools are a very important site for delivering \nmental health services. Schools are often best situated to recognize \nimmediate mental disorders. School-based mental health services lead to \nincreased academic achievement, decreased attention problems and \ndisciplinary issues, and reduce special education referrals.\n  The national average, unfortunately, as we know--and I think we need \nmore resources in this area--is 476 students for every 1 counselor. The \nrecommended ratio in our schools is 250 to 1. So imagine in the \ndevastated areas along the gulf coast and in other places, such as in \nKansas, where Senator Pat Roberts experienced a great tornado disaster \nin a much smaller community, but it was pretty much a complete \ndestruction of a town in Kansas; or as Senator Boxer is experiencing \nright now in Southern California, this amendment would look forward. \nAgain, it would not add anything to the budget, but I think it would \ngive us an opportunity to give some appropriate competitive preference \nto these children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to announce to all Senators there \nwill be no more votes tonight. But I must say there are a lot of \namendments floating around that have not been offered, and we do have \nsome that are pending. We are working on those right now, and shortly--\nI hope within the next few minutes--I will be propounding a unanimous \nconsent request that when we come in at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning we \nwill have a list of amendments that we will be voting on.\n  So I say to Senators, if you have an amendment that is floating \naround out there, and we have a list of them, and you want it offered, \nI would suggest you better get over here tonight and do it, because \nonce we start the votes in the morning at 10 o'clock--and hopefully we \nwill reach unanimous consent with the other side on that, as I said, in \na few minutes--that is going to chew up a lot of the clock. And since \nan agreement has been reached that we would finish by 12:30 tomorrow, \nthat means if you have an amendment to be offered, you are going to get \nsqueezed tomorrow morning. We may have to have one of those kind of \nagreements where you get 1 minute to speak, and you can offer your \namendment, but it is going to be pretty hard to get an amendment in \ntomorrow morning.\n  I have to say to Senators, if you have an amendment that you feel \nstrongly about and you want to have offered, you better get over here \nthis evening. Because tomorrow morning the traffic is going to be \npretty crowded around 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, while we wait to work out some other matters, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3427, as Modified; 3379, as Modified; 3344, as \n              Modified; 3361 to Amendment No. 3325 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are making progress. I have some amendments that can \nbe cleared. First I have to send some modifications to the desk.\n  I send to the desk a modification to Cornyn amendment No. 3427, a \nmodification to another Cornyn amendment, No. 3379, and a modification \nto Baucus amendment No. 3344.\n  I now ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3361 by Senator \nBrown; amendment No. 3427 by Senator Cornyn, as modified; amendment No. \n3379 by Senator Cornyn, as modified; and amendment No. 3344 by Senator \nBaucus, as modified, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the foregoing amendments \nare proposed en bloc, considered en bloc, and agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendment (No. 3361) was agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3427, 3379, and 3344), as modified, were agreed \nto, as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3427, as modified\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, we have worked through four more \namendments. We are still working on others. Hopefully, soon we will \nhave a unanimous consent proposal for tomorrow morning and linking up \nthe votes beginning at 10 o'clock.\n  I say to Senators, if anyone out there has an amendment, there is no \none on the floor. If anyone has an amendment they want to have offered, \nyou would be well advised to do it tonight or you may not be able to do \nit tomorrow.\n\n\n                     SANTA SUSANA FIELD LABORATORY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith Senators Harkin and Specter concerning my amendment to the \nunderlying bill, amendment 3403, which would provide compensation to \nqualifying individuals injured in the course of employment at the Santa \nSusana Field Laboratory in California. This amendment mirrors \nlegislation I introduced in July to correct longstanding injustices to \nthese nuclear workers and their families. Because of the revenue impact \nof this amendment, I have chosen not to call it up at this time. \nHowever, the plight of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees \ndeserves mention as we debate this important bill.\n  In 1999, Congress approved the Energy Employee Occupational \nCompensation Program to provide a $150,000 payment and medical benefits \nto workers who developed serious illnesses as a result of their work \nfor the Department of Energy. The program has been plagued by slow \nprocessing times and roundly criticized by the families struggling to \nreceive compensation for the deaths of loved ones.\n  I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to expand the Special \nExposure Cohort to include qualifying Santa Susana Field Laboratory \nemployees. This would allow eligible claims to be compensated without \nthe completion of a radiation dose reconstruction or determination of \nthe probability of causation. I would like to ask Senator Harkin the \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies, and Senator Specter, the \nranking member of this subcommittee, whether they agree with me that \nCongress should expand the Special Exposure Cohort so that the claims \nof qualifying individuals can processed more efficiently?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe it is important to compensate workers who have \nsuffered as a result of their employment with the Department of Energy, \nand although the Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program \nprovides a process for compensating these victims, this process is \noften far too burdensome.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with the senior Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees played a \nsignificant role in keeping our Nation secure during the Cold War era. \nFor example, many of these workers were instrumental in developing our \nnuclear weapons program. Unfortunately, many workers were not aware of \nthe hazards at their workplace. Remarkably, no preventative equipment \nlike respirators, gloves, or body suits was provided to workers.\n  Currently, over 600 claims for compensation have been filed by Santa \nSusana Field Lab workers. Ninety percent of those have been denied due \nto a lack of documentation or their inability to prove that they meet \nexposure thresholds. Santa Susana Field Lab workers and their families \nare faced with the burden of having to reconstruct exposure scenarios \nthat existed nearly 40 years ago, in most cases with no records or \ndocumentation.\n  My amendment would cut the redtape by amending section 3621 of the \nEnergy Employee Occupational Compensation Program Act of 2000 to treat \nemployees of Santa Susana Field Laboratory as members of the Special \nExposure Cohort. Individuals would be eligible for benefits if they \nworked at Santa Susana Field Lab for a total of 250 days and developed \na serious illness that is known to be a result of exposure to radiation \nor other toxins at the Lab before January 1, 2006.\n  Employees who contracted specified cancers from exposure to radiation \nwould receive at least $150,000, and employees exposed to toxic \nchemicals would receive $250,000. Additionally, my amendment would \nallow previously denied Santa Susana Field Lab claimants under the \nEnergy Employee Occupational Compensation Program Act of 2000 the \nopportunity to reapply for compensation and medical benefits.\n  This is a matter that this body needs to address before it is too \nlate. Do the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee agree?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the remarks of the senior Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleagues for their support. It is my \nhope that the Senate will soon address this matter so Santa Susana \nField Laboratory workers and their families can finally receive the \ncompensation they deserve.\n\n\n                                  COPD\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my distinguished friend and colleague from \nArkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and I rise to engage our colleague from Iowa \nChairman Harkin and our colleague from Pennsylvania in a colloquy.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a pressing health concern \nfacing the American public--COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, or COPD, is a growing public health threat in America. It is \nthe fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. and is a major source of \nserious long-term disability. COPD kills more than 120,000 Americans \neach year--an average of one every 4 minutes.\n  Despite these alarming statistics, the United States does not have a \ncoordinated approach to tracking COPD morbidity and mortality trends, \nidentifying people at risk for COPD and ensuring they are evaluated by \ntheir physicians, and educating the public about the causes and \nsymptoms of COPD.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Crapo for his remarks. I agree that COPD \nis an important health threat facing the American public. In part that \nis why Senator Specter and I have fought hard to increase funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention to address COPD and other pressing public health issues. \nSince 2003, the year after the NIH doubling was complete, funding into \nresearch on COPD has continued to increase by $13 million at the \nNational Institutes of Health. The bill before us, our Senate Labor-HHS \nbill includes a $4.4 million increase for the CDC to work with at least \nseven additional States in fiscal year 2008 on preventing heart disease \nand stroke. I am very proud of these increases and I thank my colleague \nSenator Specter for helping to make them possible.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the chairman for his thoughtfulness and \ndedication and would like to recognize the leadership of my colleague \nfrom Idaho on this important issue. I share Senator Crapo's concern \nthat COPD is a growing and largely unrecognized health problem in \nAmerica. Today more than 12 million Americans are diagnosed with COPD, \nand research published by the CDC suggests that an additional 12 \nmillion Americans have undiagnosed COPD. That is 12 million Americans \nwho have a debilitating and lethal disease but don't know it.\n  Equally alarming is the impact COPD is having on women. For several \nyears, COPD was largely considered a disease of men. However, in 2000, \nthe mortality rate for women for COPD exceeded that of men. Today, COPD \nis an equal opportunity killer.\n  I too am concerned that despite these statistics, the U.S. does not \nhave a coordinated public health strategy to address COPD. Senator \nCrapo and I would like to urge the CDC to begin developing a COPD \nresponse plan.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for her consideration \nand I assure her that I will work with her and Senator Crapo to ensure \nthat the CDC is responsive to their concerns.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate Senator Lincoln and Senator Crapo for \ncontinuing to advocate on this important issue. I too will work with \nChairman\n\n[[Page S13185]]\n\nHarkin to ensure CDC is responsive to this issue and begins developing \na national plan to address COPD.\n\n\n                   low income home energy assistance\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleagues, \nSenator Harkin and Senator Specter, in a colloquy on the Fiscal Year \n2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their work on \nthis bill. The bill restores cuts proposed in the President's budget \nwhile balancing many important national priorities. The President's \nproposed budget request of $141 billion for the programs funded by this \nbill is clearly inadequate and I am glad the Committee on \nAppropriations allocated additional funding to this bill. However, even \nwith this additional funding, I recognize the difficult budget \nconstraints facing the subcommittee as it tries to reverse previous \nfunding cuts to important education, labor, and health and human \nservice programs.\n  One program particularly important to working Americans families and \nseniors is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. I \nknow the chairman and ranking member are strong supporters of this \nprogram. Studies have shown that energy insecurity affects the health, \nnutrition, and learning of children. LIHEAP provides vital assistance \nto families, disabled individuals, and seniors so they don't have to \nchoose between eating and paying an energy bill. With utility shutoffs \nand arrears on the rise, we cannot afford to support the President's \ncut of $379 million to the program. In my home State, utility shutoffs \nfor nonpayment are at their highest level in 10 years. The State's data \nshows that through August, there were 20,326 shutoffs for the year. If \nthis is not bad enough, the Energy Information Administration's Winter \nOutlooks estimates that the average household will spend $891 to heat \nwith natural gas this winter and a family heating with oil can expect \nto spend $1,785 this winter. We need to increase LIHEAP funding, not \ncut it as proposed in the President's budget. I want to thank the \nchairman and ranking member for restoring funding to the Fiscal Year \n2007 level, but it is my hope that in conference we will be able to \nraise LIHEAP funding to $2.662 billion, the level provided in the \nHouse.\n  I would also like to bring another issue to your attention. The House \nbill contains report language that would direct the national center for \npublic health informatics to continue to fund the establishment of a \nnationwide database of contact information for practicing physicians. \nIn the event of a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or a pandemic, \nFederal agencies and State and local health departments could use this \ndatabase to contact physicians to request their help. In my State of \nRhode Island, the Rhode Island Medical Board participated in the pilot \nproject of this program. Based on the success of that pilot project, I \nsupport its expansion nationwide. I hope that in conference, we can \nkeep this House report language.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for \nsharing his views with me on LIHEAP and the national center for public \nhealth informatics.\n  We are facing a real crisis in Iowa and across the Nation. Last year \nin Iowa the average LIHEAP benefit was reduced by 30 percent. With \nrecord energy costs projected for this winter, many Iowa families are \nworried about how they will pay their heating bills. No family should \nhave to choose between paying an energy bill and putting food on the \ntable for their children. For this reason I look forward to working \nwith my colleague to increase funding for the LIHEAP program in \nconference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the LIHEAP program benefits many families \nand seniors in Pennsylvania. It provides a vital safety net for these \nhouseholds so they do not have to make the choice between prescription \ndrugs and heat, or paying a grocery bill or energy bill. I look forward \nto working with Chairman Harkin and Senator Reed on increasing funding \nfor this program in conference.\n\n\n                              GME Program\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank everyone for all their work \nin putting this bill together. I fully appreciate the significant \nchallenges that Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter face in \nbalancing spending priorities with limited resources. I want to thank \nthem for restoring $99 million in funding for the Children's Hospital \nGME program. Unfortunately, that level is still almost $200 million \nbelow last year's level.\n  CHGME is a valuable investment. It made it possible for children's \nhospitals to sustain and expand their teaching programs without having \nto sacrifice their commitments to clinical care for all children and \nresearch to improve children's care. These hospitals are major safety \nnet providers of inpatient and community-based ambulatory care for low-\nincome children and--as most of us know--the hospitals we depend on to \ncare for seriously and chronically ill children.\n  Spending has grown less than 4 percent over 5 years since the program \nwas fully funded. Congress reauthorized the program with overwhelming \nbipartisan support last year and set a new funding level at $330 \nmillion, which is based on continuing equity with Medicare GME. The \nHouse Labor-HHS appropriations bill funds the program at the $307 \nmillion level, which I hope we can achieve in conference.\n  I know that both the chairman and the ranking member are strong \nsupporters of this program, and it is my hope that we will be able to \nwork together to secure the House number in conference.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I join Senator Bond in his recognition of the \nchallenges that Labor-HHS appropriations presents, and I sincerely \nappreciate the continued efforts of my colleagues to emphasize the \nimportance of increased funding for CHGME. I support an increase in \nfunding for CHGME to $307 million, and I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for their support in trying to increase funding in conference.\n  The number of children throughout our country is rapidly increasing, \nand we must provide the necessary funding to train pediatricians and \npediatric subspecialists at a pace that reflects the child population \ngrowth. For example, from 2000 to 2006, the number of children in my \nhome State of Texas increased by an astounding 501,800, and the \nprojected increase of children in Texas from 2006 to 2010 is over \n346,000. CHGME funding helps provide access to pediatric medical \nservices and ensures the needs of children are addressed with \nspecialized health care.\n  CHGME is essential to ensuring that pediatricians and pediatric \nsubspecialists in cardiology, emergency care, gastroenterology and \nother fields receive the necessary medical training to provide the best \nlevel of care to our children. In Texas, 60 percent of pediatric \nresidents and 84 percent of pediatric subspecialists are trained at \nchildren's hospitals, and CHGME funding supports children's hospitals. \nWithout this funding, we risk facing a national decline and ultimate \nshortage in the number of physicians that have received the specialized \ntraining to treat our smallest and youngest patients.\n  I support an increase in funding because CHGME strengthens each \nState's ability to retain pediatricians after completion of the \nresidency program. Of the residents and fellows trained by CHGME \nhospitals, nearly 60 percent remain to practice in the State in which \nthey completed their pediatric residency. In some States, this \npercentage is even higher.\n  Texas and the Nation depend heavily on children's hospitals to care \nfor critically and seriously ill children, as well as the low-income \nchildren in their communities. Increasing CHGME funding is an \ninvestment in children's health. For these reasons, I proudly join my \ncolleagues in emphasizing the importance of this issue, and I hope we \ncan increase the funding for CHGME when we conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the \nChildren's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Program, known by many \nas CHGME.\n  Medicare is the only provider of graduate medical education funding, \nbut because children's hospitals care for the young not the elderly, \nthey are unable to access funding provided by Medicare. To correct the \ndisparity of\n\n[[Page S13186]]\n\nFederal support between adult teaching hospitals and freestanding \nchildren's teaching hospitals, Congress created the Children's \nHospitals Graduate Medical Education Program in 1999.\n  CHGME allows our Nation's independent children's hospitals to train \nmany of the pediatricians American children visit each day as well as \nalmost all of the pediatric sub-specialists who care for our Nation's \nmost fragile children. And through stabilizing pediatric education, \nCHGME has also advanced the patient care and research missions of some \nof the Nation's most trusted hospitals for children. Without this \nFederal assistance, these hospitals might be forced to sacrifice a part \nof their critical missions.\n  In the current fiscal year, the program is funded at $297 million. I \nam proud to say that that over $30 million of those funds--more than 10 \npercent of the total--has supported the training of pediatricians and \npediatric specialists at six outstanding children's hospitals in Ohio. \nBut more must be done, and I urge my colleagues to provide $307 million \nfor this program in fiscal year 2008.\n  In our country today there is a shortage in virtually every \nsubspecialty of pediatrics. So it is noteworthy that the CHGME has led \nto the creation of fellowship programs to train pediatric specialists \nin areas of need such as pediatric endocrinology, surgical critical \ncare, pediatric neurology, and child abuse and neglect--to name just a \nfew.\n  The CHGME Program needs to be maintained as a sustainable and \nreliable source of funding for children's hospitals across the Nation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank Senator Bond, Senator Hutchison, and Senator \nVoinovich. As I said in committee, I am committed to providing an \nincreased level of funding for Children's Hospitals GME in conference. \nThe children's hospitals in Pennsylvania exemplify everything they have \nsaid. They have been both regional and national leaders in centers of \nexcellence in pediatric care and pediatric research--while meeting the \nneeds of vulnerable and low income children across our State. Their \nteaching programs are an integral part of all they do--in providing \nservices and making sure that children have the doctors they need.\n  My colleagues may not realize the continuing shortages in pediatric \nspecialty care--which is centered in these institutions--or the waiting \nperiods that all children and families face for nonemergency specialty \ncare. CHGME has provided a cost effective and valuable program in \nproviding enormous assistance to these children's hospitals and their \nability to continue services and teaching. Most importantly, it \ndirectly benefits children's health care.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Children's Hospitals GME provides freestanding children's \nhospitals with the same support for graduate medical education that all \nother teaching hospitals receive through Medicare--as my colleagues \nhave said. In Iowa, we don't have freestanding children's hospitals--\ninstead our children's hospitals are part of larger systems or \ninstitutions. Yet I have heard from our hospitals and pediatricians \nabout the workforce shortages they face and how important this program \nis in making sure the children of my State get the best care possible. \nFor that reason, I join Senator Specter in our commitment to working \ntoward a higher level of funding for this program.\n\n\n            funding for the Organ Donation and Recovery Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Harkin and Ranking \nMember Specter for putting together a funding bill for the Departments \nof Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education that reflects our \nNation's priorities making college more affordable, increasing our \ninvestment in medical research at the National Institutes of Health, \nrestoring funding for critical rural health programs, and increasing \nour investment in a number of proven education programs.\n  I was pleased that the bill includes a $2 million increase for the \nDivision of Transplantation at the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration to implement the Organ Donation and Recovery Act. There \nare currently more than 97,000 Americans on the organ transplant \nwaiting list. Unfortunately, nearly 6,000 people on the list die every \nyear while waiting for a transplant.\n  More than two-thirds of those on the waiting list suffer from end \nstage renal disease and are in need of a kidney transplant. The good \nnews is that patients with end stage renal disease who require a kidney \ntransplant no longer need to wait for a kidney from a deceased donor or \nfrom a blood relative. Advances in medical science now make it possible \nfor friends and spouses to donate a kidney to a patient in need. The $2 \nmillion increase provided in the bill for the Organ Donation and \nRecovery Act will help increase the number of donations from living \ndonors by reimbursing travel and subsistence expenses for donors who \ncould not otherwise afford to donate.\n  This modest investment will save lives. It also makes economic sense. \nPatients with end stage renal disease require dialysis, which is \ncovered by Medicare. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, Medicare spends about $55,000 per patient per year for \ndialysis. On average, patients with end stage renal disease wait four \nyears before receiving a kidney transplant. This means that every \nkidney donation made from a living donor has the potential to reduce \nthe number of people on the waiting list and save the government as \nmuch as $220,000.\n  I hope the chairman and ranking member will continue to support this \nimportant program in conference and support maintaining the Senate \nfunding level.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I share the Senator's support for organ donation, and I \nthank my friend from North Dakota for his leadership on this issue. \nThis program is a smart investment and one that I will work to sustain \nin conference. By helping pay the travel and subsistence costs of \ndonors who could not otherwise afford to donate, we will save lives and \nreduce the number of people on the organ transplant waiting list.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I also strongly support efforts to increase the number \nof organ donors and will work to maintain this funding in conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senators' support, and I look forward to \nworking with them to support this program and other initiatives to \nincrease the number of organ donors.\n\n\n                                OBESITY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as you know, the rate of obesity, \nparticularly in children, has reached epidemic proportions across our \ncountry. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nmore than 60 percent of children between the ages of 9 and 13 do not \nparticipate in any organized physical activity outside of school hours.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the concerns raised by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Since the 1970s, the percentage of obesity has more than \ndoubled for preschool children ages 2-5 years and adolescents aged 12-\n19 years, and more than tripled for children aged 6-11 years. As you \nknow, I have a particular interest in fighting the obesity epidemic and \nhave been very supportive of programs that increase physical activity \nand good nutrition, especially in children. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention reported in 2000 that only 8 percent of \nelementary schools, 6.4 percent of middle/junior high schools and 5.8 \npercent of senior high schools offer daily physical education for the \nentire school year for students in all grades of the school.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is doing \nsignificant work in this area, and I urge the Director to increase \nawareness in the area of obesity and work cooperatively with \norganizations that are researching, testing and developing innovative \napproaches to get children more physically active.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the recommendation from my colleague from \nPennsylvania. Experts predict that the current generation of children \ncould be the first in history to live shorter lives than their parents' \ngeneration. To fight this public health epidemic, it is going to take \ncollaboration and partnership amongst all levels of government, \ncommunity organizations, and businesses.\n\n\n             Teacher Quality Enhancement Partnership Grants\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin. I appreciate his efforts, \nas chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, on the appropriations bill before us today. I commend \nhis continual\n\n[[Page S13187]]\n\nefforts over the years to expand educational opportunities and to \nprovide adequate funding and resources for all students.\n  The most important resource a school can offer is good teaching, \nwhich necessitates bringing more quality teachers into our classrooms, \nand making certain that when we recruit and prepare good teachers, we \ndo so in a way that best ensures their success. This means providing \nthem adequate preparation and ongoing support, especially in those \npivotal first years in the classroom.\n  And so, I am grateful for the work of Senator Harkin in our \ncollaborative and bipartisan efforts on the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, to strengthen provisions to realign the \nteacher enhancement partnership grants in the Higher Education \nAmendments with what we know works best in preparing teachers. We must \nrecruit the best talents to become teachers, and we must work to \nprovide adequate preparation and support, so that when talented \nindividuals become teachers, they are successful and want to stay in \nthe classroom. Research shows that new teachers are often less \neffective than teachers with even a few years of experience. But recent \nexperience also shows that good preparation programs can accelerate the \nrate at which novice teachers become effective.\n  We must help new teachers get the preparation and mentoring they \nneed. Teacher preparation too seldom provides the opportunity to learn \nunder the guidance of expert mentors working in schools that \neffectively serve high-need students. Most new teachers lack this type \nof support, and so leave the profession before they experience the \nrewards of the profession. One effective way to provide such \npreparation is through teaching residency programs, which are \nestablished in partnerships among colleges or universities, school \ndistricts, and other community partners. It is essential that we \nprovide support for such partnerships.\n  Even as colleges realize the effectiveness of mentoring and induction \nin preparing teachers, and in working with high-needs school districts \nto tailor programs to prepare prospective teachers for the challenges \nthey will face, it is regrettable that the President proposed \neliminating support for the partnership grants that fund these needed \nand innovative approaches. I commend the Senator from Iowa for working \nto safeguard funding at $28.5 million, a level that ensures at least \nthat current partnership grants can continue. But this level of funding \nis less than half of what was available last year, and $11.5 million \nbelow what our colleagues in the House proposed. It is clearly \ninadequate for encouraging the types of partnerships, such as \nresidencies, that are developing at several sites across the country. \nSo I hope the Senator from Iowa can continue his efforts to make sure \nthat teachers get the training they need, and can meet the funding \nlevel proposed by our colleagues in the House.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Illinois, as \nwell as his work in championing partnerships, such as teacher \nresidencies, on the HELP Committee. I realize the importance of having \na quality teacher in every classroom. I know that too many students in \nhigh-need schools, both in cities and in rural areas, are sometimes \ntaught by inadequately prepared teachers. These teachers are asked to \ntake on challenges that can be discouraging, or even overwhelming. And \nso we lose too many teachers, often before we find out how good they \ncould become.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for recognizing what we have done \nto avoid the elimination of funding for these partnership programs. \nWhen this bill goes to conference, I look forward to working with my \ncolleague from Illinois, and I will continue to try to increase the \nlevel of funding available for colleges and universities to partner, in \nnew ways, to improve teacher preparation. Bringing more quality \nteachers into classrooms is a priority for me, and I agree with the \nSenator from Illinois that it is important to find resources to support \neffective programs to better prepare and to better support teachers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues for raising this issue, and agree \nto try to help support teacher preparation, using methods that are \nshown to be effective. We all recognize the importance of teacher \nquality, and I will continue to work with my colleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I commend the work of the Senator from Iowa, and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, in working to ensure that funding for \neducation continues to be a priority. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with them on this important issue.\n\n\n                  Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and ranking member Mr. \nSpecter from Pennsylvania. I appreciate their continued efforts to \nensure fair allocation of funding for the health programs outlined in \nthe bill before us. I also understand the difficulties in making these \ndeterminations. However, the recent recalls of child products have \nhighlighted the continued threat of lead poisoning to children, and I \nbelieve that child lead poisoning prevention activities at the Centers \nfor Disease Control would benefit dramatically from increased funding.\n  Lead is highly toxic, especially to young children. It can harm a \nchild's brain, kidneys, bone marrow, and other organs. At high levels, \nlead can cause coma, convulsions, and death. The National Academy of \nSciences has reported that comparatively low levels of lead exposure \nare harmful. Even low levels of lead found in blood of infants, \nchildren, and pregnant women have been associated with impaired \ncognitive function, behavior difficulties, fetal organ development, and \nother problems. In addition, low levels of lead in children's blood can \ncause reduced intelligence, impaired hearing and reduced stature.\n  In the past 6 months, millions of products, primarily children's \ntoys, have been recalled due to potentially harmful levels of lead. \nThese sources of lead exposure are in addition to dangers of lead \npoisoning that already exist in the home from lead-based paints and \nlead plumbing. It is my belief that we should do more to support \nprograms that target reduction of lead exposure and toxicity.\n  Towards that end, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nthrough the National Center for Environmental Health has created the \nChildhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. The CLPPP plays a major \nrole in the Federal interagency mission to eliminate childhood lead \npoisoning by 2010. The efforts put forth by the CLPPP include \nassistance in completing and implementing a Federal strategic plan to \neliminate nonessential uses of lead in consumer items and to support \nState and local efforts to identify and treat children exposed to lead.\n  I thank the chairman for the increased funding this bill provides for \nthe National Center for Environmental Health, and I hope he will work \nin conference to provide an increase for the CLPPP.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I share the concerns of my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Obama, about lead poisoning in children. Despite the \nconsiderable progress made over the past few decades, much work remains \nto be done to protect our Nation's children. I am encouraged that the \nCDC is developing a hand-held lead screening device that will help to \nincrease testing in underserved communities, who are especially at high \nrisk for lead poisoning. This effort and other initiatives at CDC merit \ngreater support and I will do my best in conference to increase funding \nfor this important work.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with the comments made by my distinguished \ncolleague, Chairman Harkin.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I commend the chairman and ranking member on their work \nand congratulate them on passage of this bill. We all agree that every \nchild with lead poisoning is a preventable and needless tragedy, and I \nlook forward to working with both of them to identify additional funds \nfor the CLPPP during conference.\n\n\n                     public charter school funding\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate all of Chairman Harkin's \nefforts in bringing this bill forward and thank him for his continued \nsupport of the Nation's public schools, including charter schools, \nwhich increase the academic achievement of our Nation's most low-income \nstudents. Unfortunately, the committee did not provide\n\n[[Page S13188]]\n\nenough funding for public charter schools.\n  Charter schools are public schools created by teachers, parents, and \nother community stakeholders to educate students of all backgrounds and \neducational abilities. In exchange for greater accountability for \nstudent achievement, these schools are free from many local and State \nregulations. This flexibility and accountability has allowed \nindividuals with nontraditional backgrounds to create cultures that \nhave made charter schools top academic performers often in some of the \nNation's largest urban centers. Because of this unique approach to \neducation, demand for these schools has been remarkable over the last \ndecade. In New Orleans, charters schools have been an engine of our \nschool systems rebirth. For the 2006-2007 school year almost 60 percent \nof New Orleans' public schools students were enrolled in charter \nschools, the largest market share of any city in the country. Charter \nschools are not a panacea, but they are a tremendously valuable piece \nof education reform, and we should be cautiously optimistic about their \npotential to help close the achievement gap. In my State, charter \nschools have come in and filled the intense need we faced following the \nhurricanes of 2006.\n  As the chairman knows, I have filed an amendment to restore funds to \nthe Credit Enhancement Program. I understand the chairman is not in a \nposition to be able to support that amendment at this time. Before I \nwithdraw my amendment, I hope that the chairman will commit to support \nas much funding as possible for Public Charter Schools.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I join the Senior Senator from Louisiana in asking \nChairman Harkin and Senator Specter to provide as much funding as \npossible for public charter schools.\n  One of my last official acts as U.S. Secretary of Education in 1992 \nwas to write a letter to every school superintendent in America urging \nthem to create charter schools. I saw these charter schools as ways to \nremove burdensome rules, regulations, and overhead so that teachers \ncould have more opportunities to use their good judgment to help \nchildren and so parents could have more choices of schools.\n  Today, there are over 4,000 charter schools serving more than 1.15 \nmillion students in 40 States and the District of Columbia. Over half \nof these schools report having waiting lists, averaging 166 students.\n  I am pleased that 12 charter schools have opened in Tennessee since \npassage of the State's charter school law in 2002. Ten of these charter \nschools are located in Memphis, where they enjoy critical support from \nlocal school officials, dedicated private partners, and philanthropic \norganizations.\n  Charter schools play a unique role in public education by offering \nstudents a variety of options to meet their different learning needs \nand styles. They vary in specific mission and focus but not in their \ncommitment to excellence and preparing students to succeed. In return \nfor autonomy and freedom from burdensome regulations and policies, they \naccept strict accountability for academic and fiscal success. If \ncharter schools fail to educate their students well and meet the goals \nof their charters, they are closed.\n  I expect that we will see charter schools continue to expand across \nthe Nation as word of their success spreads. Five years ago, the \nPresident signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, which contains \nseveral programs that support charter school development and provides \nschool districts with the option of converting low-performing schools \ninto charter schools.\n  It is my hope that the leadership of the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations subcommittee can look at every possible option, in \nconsultation with the House, to support as much funding as possible for \nthis worthy program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Louisiana and \nTennessee for their interest in this matter and for their request. Yes, \nI agree to support as much funding as possible for public charter \nschools.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this bill is about making sure families \nhave access to health care and children get a good education. It \nsupports cutting-edge research, helps build a skilled workforce, and \nensures that crucial services are in reach for people who most need \nthem. Most important, it gives Americans hope that their Government is \nworking for them.\n  These programs help every family and every community. They are \npriorities for me. I know they are priorities back home. So I want to \nthank Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their leadership and \nimportant work on this bipartisan bill.\n  These programs should be priorities for this administration too. \nUnfortunately, President Bush has threatened to veto this legislation. \nHe opposes this bill it because it represents an increase over his \nrequested budget. He says it is ``irresponsible and excessive.'' Yet \nthe $9 billion increase over the President's request represents a \nfraction of the $190 billion in emergency spending he wants this year \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan. It is less than the $10 billion he spends in \nIraq in one month alone. As the President has waged war overseas, our \neducation, job training, and health systems have been left to cope with \nunfunded mandates and empty promises. That--not this bill--is what is \n``irresponsible and excessive.'' This bill simply restores some of the \nmoney the President cut and takes a modest step forward after years of \ngoing in the wrong direction.\n  Among other things, this bill boosts American competitiveness by \ninvesting $4.8 billion in job training and career- and technical-\neducation when the President would have cut these programs by more than \n$1 billion. It adds $1 billion to expand critical research at the \nNational Institutes of Health, reversing years of stagnant budgets. And \nit strengthens education and health care by providing money for Head \nStart, school improvement, and community health centers.\n  This bill recognizes how important access to quality health care is \nfor working families. While the President's budget neglected the \nuninsured and those with limited access to health care, the Senate bill \ninvests an additional $250 million over the President's request in the \ncommunity health center program. This will help those families get \nmedical care without having to seek it in the emergency room. We have \nall heard stories about how overburdened emergency rooms are by \npatients who seek care there because they don't have health insurance \nor are underinsured. But access to a doctor can prevent a child's \nearache from turning into a serious infection, and it can make sure a \nfather gets screening and preventive care so that he doesn't develop a \nserious and expensive form of cancer.\n  This bill also makes investments in another critical health care \nconcern--making sure we have enough doctors and nurses and other health \ncare professionals. Last week, I heard about it again in roundtables I \nheld across the State.\n  This bill provides $357 million for the Health Professions and \nNursing Programs to recruit and hire new health care professionals--\nthat is $242 million over the President's proposal. Of this, $169 \nmillion is for nursing education. That is $20 million over last year's \nlevel. Our nurses are the front line of care in hospitals and nursing \nhomes. This will help address the serious nursing shortage we already \nface.\n\n  It is also important that we provide opportunities and encouragement \nfor students who want to go into nursing so that we can replace these \nretiring caregivers and meet the increasing demand for nursing care. I \napplaud the committee for recognizing this looming concern, and I \nrepeat that the time to invest in our health care system is now--before \nthese problems become an urgent issue. We can't afford to wait.\n  This bill also supports our scientists and our biotech industry by \nfunding landmark research. The President's budget would have eliminated \nhundreds of research grants from the National Institutes of Health--\nmoney that could lead to cures or treatments for cancer, MS, and \ndiabetes, among other diseases. This is on top of years of inadequate \nfunding for NIH. The Senate bill adds $1 billion for NIH funding \nnationally.\n  This allows scientists at prestigious universities--including the \nUniversity of Washington--to continue their innovative medical and \nbiotech research. It also will provide hope for people with serious \ndiseases--hope that they won't\n\n[[Page S13189]]\n\nhave if this research is cut off because of lack of funding.\n  We have heard the President say that education is one of his top \npriorities. That is why it is so frustrating to me that he is \nthreatening to veto this bill. I am committed to ensuring Federal funds \nare there to help build and improve our Nation's schools. Strong \nschools make strong communities. We want everyone in this country to \nhave a promising future and a promising job--and education is how you \nget there.\n  The Senate bill supports increased funding for Pell grants that help \nkids afford college when they might not otherwise have had a chance to \nget a college degree. It increases funding for school improvement by \n$500 million. It sends $1 billion in badly needed money to help schools \nin low-income communities raise children's achievement levels and \nprovide more opportunities for learning. And it reverses the \nPresident's proposed $100 million cut to Head Start.\n  As a mom, a former preschool teacher, and school board president, I \nsaw firsthand that giving kids a boost early on can pay off in the \nfuture. Reaching kids early makes them more likely to graduate and \nsucceed. This isn't frivolous spending. The money we spend on education \ntoday will help children grow into better educated, better prepared \nworkers.\n  Providing Americans with the skills they need to excel in the global \neconomy while keeping them safe on the job are very basic needs that \nevery working family has the right to expect from their Government. \nThat is why I continue to be baffled by the administration's lack of \ncommitment to workers in our Nation. With strong bipartisan support for \nthis bill, the Senate is proud to stand with working families and \nsupport the priorities that shape their daily lives.\n  When I travel around my home State of Washington, employers tell me \nthey are desperate to find workers with the skills they need to grow \ntheir businesses. And we have thousands of people on waiting lists \nhoping to get trained for these family-wage jobs. Yet for the last 7 \nyears, the President has proposed hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncuts for job-training programs, shutting the door to millions of \ndislocated workers, youth and disadvantaged adults who deserve to share \nin the American dream.\n\n  Under his watch, worker safety on the job has also been put at risk. \nWith OSHA's lack of enforcement, workers are unprotected. And today's \nminers continue to work under an administration that values voluntary \ncompliance above safety and enforcement. This is the wrong direction \nfor working families and the wrong priority for America.\n  How do we begin to solve it? Well, one thing is clear--it isn't by \ncutting $1 billion dollars in job training funds at a critical time in \nour economic growth, as the President has proposed, nor is it by \nproposing hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to job training \nprograms, as he has one over the last 7 years. This bill rejects the \nPresident's misguided cuts and goes to great lengths to maintain a \nviable workforce and training system. If we want our local businesses \nand our Nation to be competitive in the global economy, we must make \nskills training for every worker a national priority. This bill does \nthat.\n  For some here in the Senate, this might be an abstract debate about \nFederal funding. But this debate is about real people. It is about 30 \nkids in a classroom and a teacher struggling to make sure they succeed. \nIt is about hardworking parents searching for a way to get health care \nfor their families when it isn't provided by their employers. And it is \nabout workers who need training that will help them get a job that pays \nenough to support a family.\n  When I travel around Washington State, people tell me they want hope \nand change. Whether it is the war in Iraq or gas prices or access to \nhealth insurance--people feel a real weight on their shoulders. They \nare looking for a light at the end of the tunnel, and by vetoing these \nimportant bills--and failing to invest in the health, safety, and \neconomic future of all Americans--the President keeps putting out that \nlight.\n  Mr. President, in this bill, we are investing more than $7 billion \nover last year in the future of our country. I urge all my colleagues \nto support this legislation on behalf of the millions of American \nchildren and families who would benefit.\n  And I hope the President is listening.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of H.R. 3043 tomorrow, Senator Enzi be \nrecognized to call up amendment No. 3437 and there be 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the \nuse or yielding back of time, the amendment be temporarily set aside, \nand Senator DeMint be recognized to call up amendment No. 3387, and \nthere be 20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the amendment \nbe temporarily set aside, and the Senate then resume the Roberts \namendment No. 3365, and there be 10 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate resume consideration of the Coburn amendment No. 3358, \nand there be 20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled prior \nto a vote; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nreturn to the Enzi amendment and vote in relation to the amendment; \nthat upon disposition of that amendment, the Senate resume the DeMint \namendment and vote in relation to the amendment; that upon disposition \nof the DeMint amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nRoberts amendment; that upon disposition of that amendment, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Coburn amendment No. 3358; that \nthere be 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote, equally divided and \ncontrolled, with no amendments in order to any of the amendments \ncovered in this agreement prior to the vote; and that after the first \nvote, the vote time be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, Mr. President, this ends our business for this \nevening, so that when the Senate comes in tomorrow morning, we will \nhave four amendments that will take about an hour, and then there will \nbe four votes that will start. They will be stacked votes, and they \nwill then take place 1 hour after we come in.\n  Again, I say that if we come in at 10 in the morning and this takes \nan hour and then we vote on four amendments, that will take us just \nabout to the noon hour, and we are supposed to finish by 12:30. So I \nsay again, if Senators have amendments, it looks as if they may be \ngetting crowded out, unless they get over here in a hurry.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13189-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I want to take a moment to reflect on \nthe life and service of SSG Eric Thomas Duckworth of the 759th Military \nPolice Battalion, 89th Military Police Brigade, stationed at Fort \nCarson, CO. Sergeant Duckworth was killed when a bomb detonated near \nhis vehicle as he was leading a convoy through Baghdad. He was 26 years \nold--a father, a son, a husband, and a proud soldier.\n  Sergeant Duckworth grew up in Plano, TX, an active young man with \ndreams of serving his country. He played baseball and football in high \nschool and, in the time not devoted to studies and athletics, devoted \nhimself to the ROTC. It was clear from an\n\n[[Page S13190]]\n\nearly age that Eric was a leader among his peers; in ROTC he was \nquickly selected to a leadership role and to represent his high school \nat a national ROTC council.\n  True to his dreams, Eric joined the Army just a few days after his \n1999 graduation from high school. After serving in the military, Eric \naimed to find a career in law enforcement. From what his family says of \nhim and from what I know from having worked with peace officers as \nColorado's attorney general, he would have been a great fit in any \npolice department. He was selfless, hard working, and friendly. He did \nhis job with a smile and a laugh.\n  He was also an experienced and steady military police officer who was \ndeeply committed to helping bring peace and security to a war-torn \ncountry. He was the type of American soldier who GEN Douglas MacArthur \nregaled in a 1962 address to West Point soldiers for their selfless \nsacrifices and for their unflinching devotion to the protection of our \nNation. ``Duty, honor, country,'' MacArthur told the young soldiers, \n``Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, \nwhat you can be, what you will be.''\n  These three words have been the creed of generation after generation \nof American soldiers. They help us understand the courage and fortitude \nthat allow men like Eric Duckworth to serve two tours of duty thousands \nof miles from his family, to live in constant peril, and to shoulder \nthe responsibility for keeping his soldiers safe while securing a \nbrighter future for Iraqi citizens.\n  Duty, honor, country. ``The code which those words perpetuate,'' said \nGeneral MacArthur, ``embraces the highest moral law and will stand the \ntest of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the things that \nare right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The \nsoldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act \nof religious training--sacrifice . . . However hard the incidents of \nwar may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his \nlife for his country is the noblest development of mankind.''\n  SSG Eric Thomas Duckworth thoroughly embodied this creed: he donned \nthe soldier's uniform at his first opportunity, he led his men on the \nbattlefield, and he both offered and gave his life in service to his \ncountry. His is a debt we cannot repay.\n  To Sergeant Duckworth's wife Sonya, to his children Michael, Madison, \nand Kaylynn, to his brother Andrew, and to his parents Michael and Ila, \nI cannot imagine the pain that you must feel. I can only hope that in \ntime your grief will be salved by the pride you must feel for his \ndevotion to his country and his love for his family. Eric was a man of \ncourage, dignity, and selflessness. As he lies in rest at Arlington \nNational Cemetery, amid the thousands of crosses of America's fallen \nheroes, may you know that his sacrifice will never be forgotten, his \nlegacy always honored.\n\n\n                 Sergeant First Class Rocky H. Herrera\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate one of Utah's \nfallen sons, SFC Rocky H. Herrera of Salt Lake City, UT. Sergeant \nHerrera was a member of the 585th Pipeline Company, 864th Engineer \nCombat Battalion. On August 28, 2007, he lost his life through injuries \nreceived from the detonation of an improvised explosive device.\n  Sergeant Herrera's last act was a measure full of the love and \ndevotion he had for his fellow soldiers. Sergeant Herrera's battalion \nwas building a bridge when a suicide bomber drove a vehicle carrying an \nexplosive device headed toward them. I have been reliably informed that \njust prior to the explosion Sergeant Herrera placed his body between \nthe vehicle and his men to protect the lives of his beloved soldiers.\n  In addition to this act of bravery, Sergeant Herrera has always \ndedicated his life to the preservation of freedom. In 1986, Sergeant \nHerrera joined the Army Reserve and served as a crane operator. A \ndecade later he proudly joined the full time force.\n  In addition to the two tours he served in Iraq, he was also deployed \nto Bosnia, South Korea, and Honduras. In each assignment he excelled \nand was accordingly promoted to such vital assignments as a squad \nleader and a drill instructor.\n  Recently, Sergeant Herrera's life was blessed by the birth of his \ngranddaughter Kylie. The sergeant has left behind his wife Traci, as \nwell as two daughters and two sons. One of Sergeant Herrera's sons, \nMatt, remembers his dad always spent as much time with the family as he \ncould.\n  I will pray for Sergeant Herrera's family and remember their \nsacrifice of their husband, father, and grandfather.\n\n\n                      Specialist Jason N. Marchand\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also rise today to pay tribute to one of \nUtah's fallen soldiers. SPC Jason N. Marchand was a member of the 2nd \nCavalry Regiment and at the time of his death was deployed as part of a \n2-week field tour north of Baghdad.\n  Specialist Marchand's told his family that he joined the Army to \nprotect his family and friends. Before his deployment to Iraq, \nSpecialist Marchand spent the previous year and a half in Germany, \nwhich his mother said he loved.\n  Specialist Marchand was born on April 8, 1981, in Salt Lake City, UT, \nto his parents Debbie Parsons and William Marchand, M.D. Specialist \nMarchand had a special relationship with his family. His mother stated \nthey were open enough to share anything with one another.\n  Specialist Marchand leaves behind a wife and a 6-year-old daughter, \nSavannah. At the funeral of Specialist Marchand, Savannah said that she \nwanted to release some balloons for her father. She wanted them to fly \nup to heaven to be with him there.\n  Specialist Marchand is a fine example of an honorable U.S. soldier. I \nam grateful for brave individuals like Specialist Marchand who give \ntheir life to create a brighter future for their family, friends, and \nNation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                        sergeant jason lantieri\n\n Mr. DODD. Madam President. I rise to fulfill again my most \npainful obligation as Senator: to mark the life of another young \nConnecticut man who died in our country's service. SGT Jason Lantieri \nwas killed this month in Iraq.\n  Sergeant Lantieri's life was, up to the last moment, a story of \nmoving success. At the age of 11, he was a troubled child from a broken \nhome, lost in the foster care system. But two caring foster parents \nhelped to transform him: Jon and Kathy Miller, of Killingworth, who \ntook Jason into their home and became a new mother and father to him. \n``We just decided to go and ask if he could become part of our \nfamily,'' Kathy Miller recalled. It wasn't long before Jason was \nsucceeding in school, serving on the student council, and competing in \nthree sports. In his obituary, the Hartford Courant called it ``a life \nredeemed.''\n  Sergeant Lantieri went on to earn a business degree, but, like so \nmany energetic young men before him, signed up with the Army for a \nchance at travel and adventure. By all accounts, he had his wish, from \nAlaska to Europe to Iraq with a transportation unit in the 25th \nInfantry Division. Still, with all those who choose to serve in this \ntime of war, Sergeant Lantieri knew that wearing his country's uniform \nmeant risking his life. A video posted on his Web page shows how he \nconfronted danger with a sardonic sense of humor: Below footage of an \nexplosion in the desert, his caption reads, ``Just another day at the \noffice.''\n  In a war zone, death can come in any daily routine. Its constant \npresence means that in war there is no routine and that is just another \nsacrifice soldiers make for our sake. Last week, a transportation \naccident crushed Jason between two vehicles. He was 25.\n  The two strangers he came to call Mom and Dad have a last record of \nhis voice--a call from Iraq on their answering machine. The message is \nstill there, and I imagine it always will be. They also have the \nmilitary photos that show Jason in his uniform and beret, with a firm, \nunsmiling face. ``I hardly recognize that person,'' said Kathy Miller. \n``That's just a little piece of Jason. It's not the whole picture of \nwho he is.''\n  She remembers his class-clowning, his toughness on the soccer field, \nand his mischieviousness playing with her grandchildren--qualities that \naren't in the picture.\n  The tragedy is that Sergeant Lantieri has lost his whole life; the\n\n[[Page S13191]]\n\nclass clown and the grown foster son are dead along with the soldier. \nWe can only answer that tragedy with grief and with gratitude, pledging \nto remember his rich life in its entirety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13191-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RETIREMENT OF JAMES A. (JIM) SHERIDAN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, an Idahoan with the distinction, \namong other things, of being the oldest fire lookout in the Nation at \nage 89 retired from that important post and from the Federal Government \nin September. James A. ``Jim'' Sheridan concluded a long and dedicated \ncareer that began, at age 53, what could be called a second career in \n1971, when he joined the Bureau of Land Management as a seasonal \nsurveyor. In 1976, Jim became a fire prevention patrolman, and, at age \n67, became the Mount Harrison seasonal lookout in the Sawtooth National \nForest Minidoka Ranger District. Over the past 22 years, Jim has \nprovided a fire prevention message to no fewer than 35,000 national \nforest visitors.\n  As a lifelong rancher and 36-year veteran of Government service in \nthe second half of his life, Jim has captured the secret to staying \nyoung--that of knowing you are never too old to start something new. \nJim's life is a wonderful example of the fact that success comes as the \nresult of hard work. Idahoans who visited the Sawtooths were both safer \nand better educated about our rugged and beautiful natural resources as \na result of Jim's dedication and efforts. I wish Jim and his family \nwell on his retirement, and I thank him for his service to our Nation \nand to Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13191-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FORT UNION NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would like to honor and give \nspecial attention to New Mexico's Fort Union National Monument in Mora \nCounty. Located in the Mora Valley between the Santa Fe and Sangre de \nCristo mountains, Fort Union established in 1851, dates back to New \nMexico's territorial days, protecting the area's inhabitants and trade \nroutes.\n  This year Fort Union has initiated a new effort called ``The New \nMexico Volunteers Living History Program.'' Volunteers in this program \nwill depict the Hispanic soldiers of the 1st New Mexico Volunteers, who \nwere enlisted and stationed at Fort Union during the Civil War. One of \nthe current volunteers is a direct descendent of the 1st New Mexico \nVolunteers. With some training and drilling, Fort Union hopes to begin \npresenting living history programs depicting the 1st New Mexico \nVolunteers in early spring next year at Fort Union as well as other \nlocal venues. Fort Union has also reinstated nighttime candlelight \ntours, and also hopes to provide a public venue for night sky viewing \nwhile partnering with local colleges and universities to interpret the \nskies, and be used as a classroom venue complementing science \ncurriculums.\n  I am proud of the work being done at Fort Union to reach out to the \ncommunity and provide a glimpse of our historic past. The upcoming \nactivities at Fort Union remind us of our rich history in New Mexico, \nand I commend the staff at the Fort for their efforts and their hard \nwork to further integrate the unique history of the Fort into the \nsurrounding area and expand their role as a resource for local students \nand residents. I look forward to the advancement of this program in the \nmonths to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13191-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING EDWARD KOREN\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today I acknowledge a Vermont \nartist who is widely recognized and widely loved, Edward Koren.\n  This year the Vermont Council on the Arts is bestowing its Governor's \nAward for Excellence in the Arts on this renowned graphic artist.\n  Mr. Koren carries on the long tradition of artists who publish their \nwork in the mass media, using the techniques of drawing to comment on \nthe lives that men and women lead. His distinguished 19th century \nantecedents include Honore Daumier in France and Thomas Nast in the \nUnited States. Edward Koren is a cartoonist of the first order, having \npublished more than 900 of his works in The New Yorker. His cartoons \nhave appeared in other publications as well, ranging from The Nation, \nto the New York Times.\n  His work is remarkably distinctive, often focusing on shaggy figures \nengaged in everyday affairs. Their shaggy, hairy features are a \npersonal signature; they embody the way he uses lines, the way his pen \nmoves on paper. To see one of his cartoons on a page is to recognize \nit, instantly, as a ``Koren,'' even before one knows its subject or \nreads the accompanying words or his name at the bottom of the cartoon.\n  Koren examines people in the midst of everyday life, revealing that \nhe understands that reality consists not of something invented by \nmovies or policy analysts but rather what we encounter every day. He is \na satirist of pretension, and deftly explores the neuroses of our \ntimes. Koren is a great chronicler of what the poet Wallace Stevens \ncalled ``the malady of the quotidian.''\n  David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, recently told the Burlington \nFree Press that ``Ed Koren is one of the great original voices of \ncartooning . . .. I love his work, always have.''\n  Edward Koren's work has been widely recognized by museums as well as \nthe media which so often publish his cartoons. His work is in the Swann \nCollection at the Library of Congress, and also in the permanent \ncollections of the Fogg Museum at Harvard, the Princeton University \nMuseum, and the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University.\n  Mr. Koren and his wife Curtis live in central Vermont. He long ago \nmoved to our State for reasons he articulated recently:\n\n       I was captivated intensely by Vermont. There was a deep \n     sense of community. I kept thinking, this is unusual in this \n     society, this country. I had never come across this kind of \n     closely compacted community. I was fleeing huge, giant-scaled \n     cities without a real cohesive sense of place and connection. \n     It turned out I was a country guy.\n\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. Koren is a captain of the Brookfield, VT, \nVolunteer Fire Department.\n  He is well deserving of the honor of receiving the Governor's Award \nfor Excellence in the Arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13191-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING HARRY LEE\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the passing \nthis month of Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish, LA. Sheriff Harry \nLee died of leukemia on October 1, and I would like to make a few \nremarks on his success and his contributions to the area.\n  Sheriff Harry Lee was elected in 1979, beating longtime incumbent \nAlwynn Cronvich and serving more than six terms until his death. He was \none of the most popular, well-known politicians in the greater New \nOrleans area. Throughout his career, Sheriff Harry Lee devoted his life \nto fighting crime.\n  It is perhaps Sheriff Harry Lee's colorful attitude that made him so \nbeloved. While we often disagreed on many issues, I have a great \nrespect and admiration for what Sheriff Harry Lee accomplished in his \nlong tenure. Harry was a wonderful, gutsy, larger-than-life figure who \nalways did what he thought was right. Whether I was agreeing with him \non crime-fighting issues or disagreeing with him over Edwin Edwards, I \nalways knew he was leading with his passions and loyalties.\n  Thus, today, I rise to honor sheriff Harry Lee that people may honor \nand remember him for his devotion to the State of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13191-5", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13191-S13192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO EXPAND THE \nSCOPE OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA, AS \n  RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON OCTOBER 19, 2007--PM 29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C.\n\n[[Page S13192]]\n\n1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive \nOrder (the ``Order'') that expands the scope of the national emergency \ndeclared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997, and takes additional \nsteps with respect to that national emergency.\n  In 1997, the United States put in place a prohibition on new \ninvestment in Burma in response to the Government of Burma's large-\nscale repression of the democratic opposition in that country. On July \n28, 2003, those sanctions were expanded by steps taken in Executive \nOrder 13310, which contained prohibitions implementing sections 3 and 4 \nof the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-61) \nand supplemented that Act with additional restrictions. I have now \ndetermined that the Government of Burma's continued repression of the \ndemocratic opposition in Burma, manifested most recently in the violent \nresponse to peaceful demonstrations, the commission of human rights \nabuses related to political repression, and engagement in public \ncorruption, including by diverting or misusing Burmese public assets or \nby misusing public authority, warrant an expansion of the existing \nsanctions.\n  The order incorporates existing designation criteria set forth in \nExecutive Order 13310, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to designate any person \ndetermined to be a senior official of the Government of Burma, the \nState Peace and Development Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and \nDevelopment Association of Burma, or any successor entity to any of the \nforegoing. The order blocks the property and interests in property in \nthe United States of persons listed in the Annex to the order and \nprovides additional criteria for designations of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of \nState, to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human rights \nabuses related to political repression in Burma; to be engaged, or to \nhave engaged, in activities facilitating public corruption by senior \nofficials of the Government of Burma; to have materially assisted, \nsponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technical \nsupport for, or goods or services in support of, the Government of \nBurma, the State Peace and Development Council of Burma, the Union \nSolidarity and Development Association of Burma, any successor entity \nto any of the foregoing, any senior official of any of the foregoing, \nor any person whose property and interests in property are blocked \npursuant to Executive Order 13310 or section 1(b) (i)-(v) of the order; \nto be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for \nor on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310 or \nsection 1(b)(i)-(v) of the order; or to be a spouse or dependent child \nof any person whose property and interests in property are blocked \npursuant to the order or Executive Order 13310.\n  The order leaves in place the existing prohibitions on new \ninvestment, the exportation or reexportation to Burma of financial \nservices, and the importation of any article that is a product of \nBurma, which were put into effect in Executive Order 13047 and \nExecutive Order 13310.\n  I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including \nthe promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers \ngranted to the President by IEEPA and section 4 of the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act of 2003 as may be necessary to carry out the purposes \nof the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                      George W.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 2213. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to improve \nprevention, investigation, and prosecution of cyber-crime, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2213, the \nCyber-Crime Act of 2007. I am joined in this effort by my colleague and \ngood friend Senator Biden. This bipartisan legislation makes important, \nappropriate and necessary changes to federal law relating to computer \nfraud.\n  Continuous innovation in technology provides remarkable benefits to \nindividuals throughout the world. In the United States, the integration \nof computer networks has allowed for increased efficiency of American \nbusinesses and provided greater access to\n\n[[Page S13195]]\n\nservices and information for individuals. The ability of individuals \nand businesses to store vast amounts of data on computer networks has \nled to innumerable advantages including increased productivity and \nfinancial savings.\n  However, these same networks have proven to be prime targets for \ncriminals seeking to utilize malicious computer code for illicit gain. \nCriminals are using viruses to exploit technological weaknesses in \ncomputer networks. These collections of compromised computers are \ncalled ``botnets'', and serve as zombie networks which can be remotely \ncontrolled by an attacker and used for numerous crimes, including \nidentity theft and attacks on critical computer systems. Botnets can \nconsist of hundreds of thousands of computers, and most victims are \nunaware their computer equipment has been compromised. An underground \nmarket has developed for these botnets, as criminals are renting these \ncompromised networks to carry out different types of attacks. Botnets \nhave the ability to grow exponentially and the potential damage from \nthese networks grows accordingly.\n  Botnets pose a tremendous threat to our national infrastructure, \neconomy, and security. Portions of the federal law relating to computer \ncrime, written in a pre-Internet era, are inadequate and leave several \nunaddressed loopholes in our criminal code. For example, under current \nfederal law a creator of a botnet can only be charged if the financial \nloss to one or more persons during one year passes a certain dollar \nthreshold. It can be very difficult to put a price tag on the losses \nexperienced by computer users, as it is not easy to calculate how much \nmoney an individual's time is worth in terms diverted from work or in \ntrying to fix a malicious bot. In addition, it is possible for a \ncriminal to create large botnets that can be utilized for future denial \nof service attacks and other violations, and still not violate this \nsection of law.\n  In order to address this, the legislation we offer today modifies the \nFederal criminal code by criminalizing willful damage to 10 or more \ncomputers in any one year period. This change will allow the \nprosecution of criminals who covertly install malicious bots on \nprotected computers with the purposes of making a botnet.\n  Also, S. 2213, will make other necessary changes to the Federal code, \nincluding expanding the definition of cyber extortion, and permit law \nenforcement seizure of computer equipment and other property used to \nperpetrate computer crimes. As well, the bill includes a directive to \nthe U.S. Sentencing Commission to consider many highly relevant factors \nin its review of appropriate sentences for cyber crime.\n  All of the changes contemplated by this legislation, if aggressively \nenforced by law enforcement, will have a positive impact on our \nsecurity. In this information age, it will not take long for potential \ncriminals to hear about the new tools available to law enforcement \npersonnel and many will be deterred from perpetrating illegal activity \nover the Internet.\n  As criminals continue to adapt their tactics to exploit technological \nchanges and loopholes in the law, it is imperative that Congress pass \nlegislation that allows Federal law enforcement to maintain vigorous \nand tireless efforts in the investigation of cyber crime activity. I am \nconfidant that this legislation, once enacted, will provide for the \ntools needed to pursue those who choose to inflict such harm to our \nsociety.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2214. A bill to establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nas an independent agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nEmergency Management Advancement Act of 2007, a bill to establish the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as an independent agency. \nAfter a series of winter storms and summer flooding caused extensive \ndamage in Oklahoma, the State encountered problems with FEMA as they \nsought disaster assistant due to the levels of bureaucracy and a lack \nof communication. When other natural disasters struck Oklahoma prior to \nthe placement of FEMA under Homeland Security, the State did not \nencounter the same bureaucratic delays and other problems. Therefore, I \nsupport making FEMA an independent agency again in an effort to grant \nFEMA more autonomy by removing that added layer of bureaucracy. \nAdditionally, after Oklahoma experienced troubles establishing an \naccurate incident period for the 2007 summer flooding, I have also \nincluded in my bill language stating that the administrator should give \ndeference to State documentation when determining disaster incident \nperiods.\n  Oklahoma first encountered problems with FEMA and lack of \ncommunication and information when wildfires ravaged the state in 2005 \nand 2006. These devastating wildfires swept through the entire state \nleading to declarations for Public Assistance, Individual Assistance \nand hazard mitigation funding. All 77 counties in the State of Oklahoma \nqualified for Public Assistance while all counties were also eligible \nto apply for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. These wildfires were \nwide spread and deadly to my State.\n  More recently, Oklahoma encountered severe winter storms with \ndevastating results in January 2007. These storms led to prolonged loss \nof power and extensive building damage for many of my constituents. In \nMuskogee County alone, an estimated 16,000 power company customers \nexperienced loss of electricity for days at time with temperatures \nremaining below freezing.\n  This summer, Oklahoma was hit by heavy rain, tornadoes, and flooding \nfrom May through September. The State made a number of disaster \ndeclarations during these periods. While I appreciate these \ndeclarations and aid, the process it took the state to get to this \npoint was filled with unnecessary difficulty. Oklahoma particularly \nstruggled with FEMA on the dates of the incident periods which is why I \nhave included language in my bill to give deference to the State's \ndocumentation regarding the dates of such incidents. It makes sense \nthat the State would be the one to have the most accurate information \navailable regarding the disasters and the cause.\n  I believe this is an extremely important bill that will free FEMA \nfrom additional levels of bureaucracy and allow it to work in a more \neffective manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \nestablish the Protective Security Advisor Program Office; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to introduce a bill that would \nformally establish and enhance the Protective Security Advisor Program \nOffice within the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The PSA program, which operates under the DHS Office of \nInfrastructure Protection, has proven its worth on many occasions. For \nexample, when the Interstate 35-W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed in \nAugust of this year, PSAs provided valuable support to the Minnesota \nDepartment of Public Safety, providing assessments of infrastructure \nimpacts relating to emergency services, postal and shipping operations, \npublic transit, fuel deliveries, public utilities, and rail operations.\n  DHS has deployed more than 70 PSAs in major metropolitan areas around \nthe country. These are skilled and savvy people, averaging more than 20 \nyears of law-enforcement, military, or counter-terror experience. They \nregularly interact and develop working relationships with Government \nagencies at all levels and with private-sector entities, and they can \nbe among the first on the scene when disaster strikes.\n  Critical infrastructure is not, however, confined to large urban \nareas. Yet, 10 States--Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, \nNorth Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming--do not \nhave a resident PSA dedicated to serving the interests and protecting \nthe citizens of those States.\n  The bill I introduce today will enhance our national preparedness, \nresponse capability, and security by providing a minimum Protective \nSecurity Advisor presence in every State, while preserving the risk-\nbased principle that provides extra coverage in areas of dense \npopulation or concentrated critical infrastructure.\n\n  The bill will also enhance the PSA program by providing for 10 \nsupervisory PSAs for regional coordination and management, and by \nauthorizing additional PSAs at DHS headquarters. These headquarters \nPSAs will help manage participation in training and exercises, PSA \ntraining and certification programs, and day-to-day operations that \nhelp our Nation prevent, respond to, and limit the consequences of \nterrorist attacks and natural disasters.\n  This bill also will advance the goals of the National Infrastructure \nProtection Plan. It will promote governmental and private-sector \nefforts to assess risks to and vulnerabilities of critical \ninfrastructure, help stakeholders share information and coordinate \nactivities, assist with multi-jurisdictional planning, and provide \ncounsel to any designated Principal Federal Official when a joint field \noffice must be established.\n  State emergency managers recognize the importance of this \nlegislation. The Maine Emergency Management Agency has already provided \na letter of support. Its bipartisan list of cosponsors--Senators Pryor, \nSununu, Johnson, Coleman, Biden, Thune, Enzi, and Carper--includes \nthree other members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. These \nfacts attest to the bill's merit.\n  Mr. President, 300 million Americans live in a society that depends \non a complex and tightly interrelated network of critical \ninfrastructure and services including food supply, finance, energy, \nsanitation, transport, and communications.\n  The DHS Protective Security Advisors have demonstrated that they are \na critical element of our homeland-security defenses. This bill will \nexpand their numbers, extend their coverage, strengthen their \norganization, and make all of us safer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Salazar, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Burr, Mr. Coburn, and \n        Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S.J. Res. 22. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services relating to Medicare coverage \nfor the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents in cancer and related \nneoplastic conditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a joint resolution \nto disapprove of the Medicare National Coverage Decision on cancer care \nannounced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on July 30, \n2007. I am taking this action out of concern for America's seniors who \nare afflicted with cancer, a terrible disease that affects thousands of \nMedicare beneficiaries each year.\n  At the outset, I want to make very clear that Congress should not \nwantonly second-guess the scientific processes at CMS. The National \nCoverage Decision process is a very important component of the agency's \ngovernance of the Medicare program and its mission to protect the \nsafety of beneficiaries. The agency makes several National Coverage \nDecisions each year that are implemented without any congressional \ninvolvement. Several more coverage determinations are made by regional \nMedicare carriers at the local level. When scientific evidence supports \ndoing so, CMS clearly has authority to limit Medicare coverage for \ndrugs and other medical products and services to an extent less than \nthe Food and Drug Administration label would otherwise allow. In fact, \nI am working on a proposal that may provide more clinical evidence to \nguide CMS in making these decisions.\n  There are some rare occasions, however, when CMS makes a decision \nthat intrudes on the clinical judgment of doctors without the support \nof scientific evidence, prompting virtually unanimous opposition from \nthe clinicians who treat the patients whose care is at stake. In these \ncases, I believe that Congress not only may but must intervene. This \nNational Coverage Decision regarding the use of erythropoiesis-\nstimulating agents, or ESAs, for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and \ncancer-related conditions is precisely such an instance.\n  Mr. President, when a cancer patient receives an ESA, the goal is not \nto manage a person's hemoglobin back to the level of a healthy, non-\nanemic person. That is because there can be health risks associated \nwith raising the hemoglobin to such a level through ESA use. The FDA \nlabel makes it clear that patients may only be administered enough of \nan ESA to avoid a transfusion, and that ESAs should never be used to \nbring a patient's hemoglobin level above 12 grams per deciliter. So \nthere can be risks when a patient does not get enough of an ESA, \nincluding severe anemia and the need for blood transfusions. And there \nare\n\n[[Page S13201]]\n\nrisks when a patient gets too much of an ESA. The FDA label establishes \nparameters to guard against under-utilization and over-utilization of \nthese products.\n  Now let us compare the FDA label with the National Coverage Decision \nannounced by CMS. The National Coverage Decision limits ESA treatment \nto hemoglobin levels less than 10 grams per deciliter. This cap fails \nto recognize the natural fluctuations in a patient's hemoglobin. This \ncap is simply incongruous with the FDA label, which recommends that \npatients should not be treated over 12. I should note that the FDA \nlabel was recently changed, with the addition of new ``black box'' \nwarnings and recent safety information. If the FDA believes that \nscientific evidence warrants changing the label yet again, then clearly \nMedicare should not cover treatments that are not consistent with that \nnew label.\n\n  Furthermore, there are other aspects of the CMS National Coverage \nDecision that are contrary to accepted standards of care and scientific \nevidence. CMS imposed 4-week dose limitations that are not based on the \nclinical needs of patients. The FDA labels allow ESAs to be \nadministered three times a week, every week, every 2 weeks, or every 3 \nweeks. Also, for patients who are slow to respond to ESAs or do not \nrespond, CMS has created a one-time dose escalation rule of 25 percent \nof the initial ESA dose. This limitation is contrary to FDA-approved \ndosing instructions. For instance, the FDA approved labeling allows \ndoubling the dose for some regimens.\n  Mr. President, over the past months, I have seen an outpouring of \nconcern with this National Coverage Decision by patients, providers, \nand the professional scientific community for many reasons. The \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology, the world's leading professional \norganization representing physicians of all oncology subspecialties who \ncare for cancer patients, wrote this to CMS:\n\n       Under the new CMS policy, a patient's hemoglobin could \n     repeatedly fall below 10 following termination of coverage at \n     the end of 4-week periods. This consequence would be \n     inconsistent with the FDA-approved labeling, which, as noted \n     above, states that ESA dosing should be titrated to the \n     individual patient to maintain the hemoglobin level. . . . We \n     strongly urge CMS to reconsider these restrictions in light \n     of the concerns detailed above.\n       The current NCD does not allow for interpretation \n     consistent with clinical practice, national guidelines, or \n     the FDA-approved labels in this area. This reopening [of the \n     National Coverage Decision] should occur as soon as possible \n     to avoid continued confusion and uncertainty [for] both \n     physicians and patients. Until these issues are clarified, we \n     also strongly recommend that CMS delay the effective date for \n     the entire NCD.\n\n  The American Society of Hematology, the leading clinical authority on \ndisorders affecting the blood, bone marrow, and the immunologic, \nhemostatic, and vascular systems, has stated:\n\n       Consequently, the clinical scenario that is problematic is \n     when a patient's hemoglobin goes above 10 g/dL after 4 weeks \n     of treatment because the physician would then need to \n     discontinue the ESA treatment entirely. This is of concern \n     because some patients might then drop below 10 g/dL \n     justifying a renewal of the ESA treatment and leading to a \n     `roller coaster' of treatment potentially involving stopping \n     and starting ESA treatment several times. This is extremely \n     difficult for both the patient and the physician.\n\n  The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society wrote this in a recent letter to \nCMS:\n\n       As a reimbursement authority, CMS and the Medicare program \n     it administers should be guided by science and data in order \n     to achieve the best result for cancer patients. Accordingly, \n     CMS should defer to the expertise of FDA and of the academic \n     scientists who contribute to the ASCO/ASH guidelines.\n\n  Additionally, I share the concerns of many in the oncology community \nwho worry about exposing seniors to the avoidable safety risks of blood \ntransfusions, as well as the effect of this policy on our nation's \nblood supply. It has been clearly documented that certain areas of the \ncountry are already at risk of running out of their blood supply or \nhave ongoing shortages. Some areas have 24 hours worth of blood left \nbefore they completely run out. According to the 2006 Nationwide Blood \nCollection and Utilization Survey, the number of transfusions of red \nblood cells in 2004 was nearly equivalent to the number of units \ncollected. This policy, which patients are already telling us are \nforcing them into transfusion units, could put in jeopardy a U.S. blood \nsupply that is already fragile and stretched thin.\n  The American Red Cross has indicated in their guidelines that \ntransfusions are not appropriate for chemotherapy patients when \nalternative treatments are available:\n\n       Red blood cells should not be used to treat anemia that can \n     be corrected with a non-transfusion therapy such as iron or \n     recombinant erythropoietin.\n\n  To my great concern, the CMS National Coverage Decision responds to \nthis vital issue with the following:\n\n       The concern about the adequacy of the nation's blood supply \n     is not a relevant factor for consideration in this national \n     coverage determination. Our focus is whether the use of ESA \n     is reasonable and necessary to treat a particular illness.\n\n  The sole purpose for using ESAs, as stated on the FDA label, is to \navoid a blood transfusion. But CMS has decided that this issue is not \nrelevant to a decision regarding the coverage of ESAs. Well, I can \nguarantee you that it is important to the patients who will now be \nforced to seek transfusions as a result of CMS' shortsighted decision.\n  Congress continues to demonstrate that it shares the concerns of \npatients and the clinical community about the new CMS policy and the \ndetrimental effect that it could have on patient care. Earlier this \nsummer, prior to the CMS issuance of the final National Coverage \nDecision, 52 Senators and 235 Members of the House of Representatives \nwrote to CMS expressing an overwhelmingly bipartisan, bicameral concern \nwith the CMS policy. CMS, however, ignored these concerns and issued a \nfinal National Coverage Decision on July 30 that was even more onerous \nthan the one proposed.\n  On September 4, the Senate sent a strong message of dissatisfaction \nwhen we passed S. Res. 305, without one Senator objecting. S. Res. 305 \ncalled on CMS to immediately reconsider the National Coverage Decision. \nBut CMS has refused to reopen the National Coverage Decision and work \nwith the clinical community to develop an appropriate patient-centered \npolicy that is consistent with scientific evidence.\n  Because CMS has repeatedly ignored our concerns, we now are forced to \ntake legislative action that compels CMS to change this flawed policy. \nThat is why today I am asking my Colleagues to support this resolution \nof disapproval.\n  Let me tell you what this resolution does not do. This resolution \ndoes not replace the medical judgment of CMS or the FDA with that of \nCongress. This resolution does not ignore the safety concerns of ESAs \nused when a patient's hemoglobins are above the FDA label. Finally, \nthis resolution does not reject the notion of any National Coverage \nDecision related to ESAs. This resolution simply asks CMS to go back to \nthe drawing board. It compels CMS to work with the oncology community--\nthe experts and clinicians and patients--to come up with a policy that \nis based on scientific evidence and that the community can support, or \nat least understand. That is why I ask my Colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate will have an \nopportunity to consider and adopt the DREAM Act. I have, again, \ncosponsored Senator Durbin's initiative along with Senators Lugar and \nHagel and urge all Senators to join us in proceeding to consideration \nof S.2205, the latest version of the Development, Relief, and Education \nfor Alien Minors Act.\n  The DREAM Act was first introduced in 2001, during the 107th \nCongress. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill with \nbipartisan support in 2002 and, again, in 2003 during the 108th \nCongress. When the Senate Judiciary Committee took up comprehensive \nimmigration reform in 2006 during the 109th Congress, the DREAM Act was \nadopted by voice vote as an amendment to the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill reported by the Judiciary Committee, and it was included in \nthe comprehensive immigration reform measure that the Senate ultimately \npassed in 2006. Senator Durbin worked hard to have the DREAM Act \nincluded in the bill the Senate took up this past summer. I hope the \nspirit of bipartisanship that has been evident throughout this bill's \nhistory in the Senate can carry it to final passage this year.\n  The bill sets the right tone and policy. It seeks to enhance \neducational opportunities for thousands of young people who wish to \nenter college, but who are prevented from doing so due to circumstances \nover which they have little control. We should send the clear signal \nthat the Senate majority is committed to doing what it can to move \npositive immigration reforms forward. It makes good sense to invest in \nour future by enhancing educational opportunities for our Nation's \nyoung people.\n  Children brought to the United States by their parents or guardians\n\n[[Page S13203]]\n\noccupy a unique position in our society. They are technically illegal \nin status, but the Supreme Court has determined that these children are \nnot responsible for the actions of their parents for purposes of \nelementary and secondary public education, recognizing that we disserve \nourselves when we discriminate against them. The DREAM Act builds upon \nthe rationale underlying the Supreme Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe \nin the interest of strengthening our Nation's future. It builds upon \nthe American dream.\n  Upon graduation from high school, thousands of talented young people \nfind themselves without the legal status to obtain aid to attend \ncollege. The DREAM Act would give currently undocumented eligible young \npeople the conditional legal status they need to allow them to obtain \nassistance to attend college or to join our military and eventually to \nobtain permanent legal residency and citizenship. Those who would \nbenefit from the DREAM Act are young people we should be encouraging to \nfollow their dreams. The status quo, in which our policies create \nbarriers to advancement for so many young people who yearn to achieve \nand contribute, works to the disadvantage of the United States. Rather \nthan barring young people from entering the American mainstream, we \nshould strengthen our Nation's future through increased participation \nin higher education and in the military.\n  As the Senate prepares to take up the DREAM Act, I hope that those \nwho opposed comprehensive immigration reform will pause to consider the \nvery real benefits the DREAM Act will bring. Let the Senate do the \nright thing, endorse the DREAM Act and reinforce the American dream for \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/22/senate-section/article/S13203-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 2201\n\n  Mr. REID.
