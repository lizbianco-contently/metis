Mr. President, I thought it was important to point out to \nthe Senate and to the country what we have accomplished during this 6 \nmonths that we have been in session. We have had some hurdles to go \nthrough, and as a result of that, it has taken a little longer than we \nwanted on most everything, but we have made some significant \naccomplishments, and I think the Senate should talk about the \naccomplishments we have made.\n  Democrats can't take credit for all this work that has been done \nbecause everything that passed took Republican votes also. So I think \nwe, as a Senate, should be able to talk about what we have \naccomplished.\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\n  We have passed the minimum wage bill, which is now law. We passed a \nbalanced budget, which also has in it the restoration of pay as you go. \nWe passed a continuing resolution. Remember, when we came here, there \nhad been no funding preparations made for after February 1, so we had \nto do that, and we did. We worked on approving the appointment of U.S. \nattorneys. That passed on a bipartisan basis.\n  We worked to make sure there was equipment for Guard and Reserves \nthat was appropriate for those people serving in Iraq. We worked hard \nto push Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, and now they are in \ntheatre. We passed health care legislation for the veterans, and we \nprovided military medicine that was over and above what the President \nrequested.\n  We basically full funded the Katrina disaster, which was something \nthat was long overdue. We provided health insurance for children. And I \nwould say, without question, this was as much pushed by Republicans as \nDemocrats--the $600 million that will fund many programs in an adequate \nfashion until the 1st of October, which would not have been the case \notherwise.\n  We provided $1 billion for homeland security, something we had been \nworking on for a long time. This will allow the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to provide more security at our train stations and on our \nrails and to do some things we have not been doing at airports.\n  For 3 years, we have been trying to get agriculture disaster relief \npassed. We were able to do that. Again, clearly bipartisan. Western \nwildfire relief is important. For example, in the State of Nevada, more \nthan a million acres have burned.\n  We have had many hearings dealing with the conduct of the war. We \nhave had only two things that have been vetoed. One was the emergency \nsupplemental with timelines, and the other is--I don't know if the \nPresident has vetoed it yet. I didn't check with my staff before I came \nhere. But I know we sent the President the stem cell bill yesterday, \nand I am told he is going to veto that.\n  We have a number of things that are in progress. We expect to be able \nto do the ethics and lobbying reform in the near future, hopefully \nwithin a matter of the next week or 10 days.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommendations, Senators Lieberman and Collins \nhave been working hard on that with their House counterparts. That is \nbasically done. We have security at the U.S. courts. I have spoken to \nthe House yesterday and they are going to move on that, so that can be \ncompleted with the conference because we passed it over here.\n  Reauthorization of FDA, we have done that here. I think that should \nbe able to be conferenced quite soon.\n  WRDA, Senators Boxer and Inhofe are working on that very hard. We \nexpect that conference to take place without a lot of heartburn. And \nthe competitiveness legislation. I spoke with the Speaker last evening. \nThey have a bill they have already passed. We have passed one. We \nshould be able to do that--again, clearly a bipartisan bill.\n  We have a number of things we tried to move on and were unable to do \nso because procedurally we couldn't get to them, even though we tried. \nOne was to change the Medicare prescription drug law on negotiation and \nallow Medicare to do that. We wanted to do intelligence authorization. \nWe were prevented from being able to get it on the floor because of a \nfilibuster. Immigration reform is a work in progress. Perhaps in the \nnext few days we will have a pathway to get that completed.\n  I have had some good conversations this morning with both Democrats \nand Republicans on that issue, and the Republican leader and I hope we \ncan sit down and talk about that when he has a proposal he can give. I \nunderstand that could come as early as today or tomorrow.\n  We have on the Senate Floor now an energy bill--again, totally \nbipartisan. Everything that is in the bill that is on the Senate Floor \nhas been bipartisan. So I hope we can move forward on that and complete \nthat.\n  As I indicated, we need to start, before we leave here, the Defense \nauthorization bill. I hope we can do that.\n  So we have done a lot. A lot of times you hear little bits and pieces \nof what we have done. I have not covered everything, but I have touched \non most everything we have been able to do this year, and I think it is \nsomething that we should feel good about.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to thank our majority \nleader for his effort. He read a list in the last few moments that goes \nthrough quite quickly a whole list of things that have required an \nextraordinary amount of effort to be able to accomplish, and I wish to \nthank him personally.\n  This has not been an easy 6 months. I think our friends on the other \nside of the aisle have wished to slow things down, with procedural \nmotions over and over again, to even go to a bill, and to see the \nleader's patience and determination and perseverance has been \nextraordinary.\n  I am very proud of the fact, when we compare our first 6 months to \nthe 6 months in previous Congresses, that this gentleman has been a \ntask master. He has kept his nose to the grindstone and has kept us \nfocused on things that matter to the American people, from the war in \nIraq and bringing that to the forefront, to having hearings where we \nhave asked for accountability and attempted to change the direction on \nthe war, as well as to things we in Michigan are desperately caring \nabout every day, in terms of our economy and our quality of life.\n  So I wish to thank the leader personally for all he has done and will \ncontinue to do. I know that with all of us working together, we are \nchanging the direction of this Congress and working very hard to \naddress the things that people care about every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7574-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate takes up energy today. Let \nme say at the outset the proposed bill has some good provisions and it \nhas some troubling ones. What most concerns Republicans are the issues \nit doesn't address at all.\n  Everyone agrees energy independence is a top priority. America \nimports nearly 60 percent of its oil, much of it from dangerous and \nunstable countries that do not have our best interests at heart. Yet \nthe bill on the floor does nothing to increase domestic production of \noil and gas--absolutely nothing. If energy independence is truly a \npriority, we will increase domestic production of oil and gas, period.\n  Increasing production at home will lead to greater independence and \nit will lead to lower gas prices. The average price of gas has gone \nfrom $2.20 to $3.15 a gallon since the Democrats took over the Senate. \nIt is in danger of going up even more if this bill is not amended. We \nknow gas prices go up as supply goes down. Yet this bill, as written, \ndoes nothing either to increase domestic supply or refinery capacity \nand, thus, drive down gas prices.\n  Liberals in Congress have historically blocked both these efforts. \nBut with the price of gas where it is, this annual gift to the \nenvironmental lobby is a luxury we can no longer afford. If we are \nserious about gas prices, we will increase both domestic production and \nrefining capacity. This bill, as written, does nothing to address \neither; therefore, nothing to lower gas prices.\n  Republicans will be offering amendments that will fill the gaps and \ngive Members a chance to do something about energy independence and \nout-of-control gas prices. Yesterday, Senator Inhofe offered an \namendment to increase refinery capacity, and Republicans will soon have \na chance to vote on his proposal.\n  I also appreciate Senator Bunning's hard work on coal to liquids, \nwhich is poised to become a major industry in Kentucky. This technology \nis one of the more promising alternative fuels we know of. Its addition \nto the market is one more way Republicans are proposing to lower fuel \nprices.\n  We will also debate fuel economy standards, and that is appropriate. \nWe\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\nshould do all we can to increase fuel efficiency of our cars and our \ntrucks. But we have to do it in a way that is realistic and that \ndoesn't cost thousands of autoworkers, in places such as Louisville, \nBowling Green, and Georgetown, KY, and countless other communities \nacross the country, literally eliminating their work.\n  Every summer, our good friends on the other side dust off the old \nclass warfare playbook and blame our gas prices on cigar-chomping oil \nexecutives. Look, price gouging is wrong. If it is found, it should be \npunished. But the other side has called countless hearings to try to \npin down big oil on price gouging and they haven't come up with the \ngoods yet. It is time to put away the playbook and do something that \ncan help Americans who are suffering every day from high gas prices.\n  Republicans are eager to move forward on this energy legislation. We \nare acutely aware of the dangers associated with our dependence on \nforeign sources of oil. But we can address all of these dangers \nresponsibly, and we should start with the most immediate concern, which \nis gas prices. Increasing refinery capacity and domestic production \nshould be our goal in this debate. After all, the purpose of an energy \nbill is to reduce the cost of energy and that is what Republicans \nintend to do.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7575-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is pretty clear, as we survey the \nlandscape around our great country, what has happened to manufacturing \njobs and what has happened to our economy. Over and over, in my State \nof Ohio, I know, and Senator Stabenow's State of Michigan, we have seen \nhuge job losses, especially in manufacturing. In my State, since 2000, \nOhio has lost 1,800 manufacturing companies, more than 200,000 jobs \nwith average wages of $48,000, according to the Northeast Ohio Campaign \nfor American Manufacturing. We also know that American workers, when it \nis a level playing field, can outcompete workers, can outcompete small \nbusinesses, can outcompete companies all over the world--when there is \na level playing field.\n  Last week, Senator Stabenow and others participated in a \nmanufacturing summit. She brought leaders of small businesses and large \nmanufacturers to the Nation's Capitol with labor leaders and other \npeople who care about manufacturing. We discussed how we remain \ncompetitive, how we shape trade policies to help not hurt our small- \nand medium-sized manufacturers. At that summit, an Ohio businessman \nnamed John Colm walked up to me with a stack of fliers. They were \nauction notices. He had received 47 of them in the last 4 months. These \nnotices were for ``going out of business'' sales; they were companies \nselling off assets, in essence cannibalizing their companies, selling \ntheir machinery at rock-bottom prices--all that this manufacturing \ncrisis has done to small manufacturers and large manufacturers but \nespecially small companies in our communities.\n  We also know how U.S. trade policy has failed American business, \nespecially small business, especially small manufacturers. We know the \nyear I first ran for Congress, in 1992, we had a trade deficit in this \ncountry of $38 billion. Today our trade deficit, whether you count \nservices or not, exceeds either $700 billion or $800 billion--from $38 \nbillion to $700 billion to $800 billion in a decade and a half. Our \ntrade deficit with China went from low double digits a decade and a \nhalf ago to somewhere in the vicinity of $250 billion today.\n  President Bush, Sr., the first President Bush, said for every $1 \nbillion in trade deficit, it costs a country somewhere in the vicinity \nof 13,000 jobs. You do the math and you figure how many jobs we have \nlost, in part, because of our trade policy.\n  The response of the administration is: Let's do more of these trade \nagreements. We have already had NAFTA, we have already had PNTR with \nChina, we have already had CAFTA and Singapore and Chile and Morocco \nand Jordan; let's do more, let's do a trade agreement with Panama, \nlet's do one with Peru, let's do one with Colombia, let's do one with \nSouth Korea. The fact is, this trade policy is the wrong direction for \nour country.\n  In elections last fall, where Senator Stabenow, who has been a leader \non trade and manufacturing, was reelected with a huge margin in a State \nthat has been devastated by bad trade policies; in my State, and \nSenator Webb's, Senator Sanders', Senator Tester's, the Presiding \nOfficer's, and Senator Cardin's--in all of our States, the voters spoke \nloudly and clearly that our trade policy has failed our middle class. \nOur trade policy has failed small business. Our trade policy has failed \nour communities. When a company shuts down with 300 workers in \nSteubenville or Lima or Dayton or Finley--when a company shuts down, it \ndevastates a community. It means schoolteachers are laid off, police \nand firefighters are laid off. It means people are not as safe in their \ncommunities as their economy deteriorates.\n  I will close and turn the podium over to Senator Stabenow with a \nbrief mention of energy. Senator Reid, the majority leader, spoke about \nenergy. He spoke about Democratic accomplishments today and talked \nabout the energy bill coming up. I wish to illustrate, for a moment, \nhow energy policy can matter and make a difference in manufacturing. At \nOberlin College, a community not too far from where I live, between \nCleveland and Toledo, on the campus of Oberlin College is located the \nlargest building on any college campus in America that is fully powered \nby solar energy. When speaking to David Orr, the professor who helped \nraise the money to build this building, he told me the solar panels \nthat power this building at Oberlin College--a whole roof, a large \nexpanse of roof or solar panels--they were bought in Germany and Japan \nbecause we don't make enough of them. Go west of there, where the \nUniversity of Toledo is doing some of the best wind turbine research in \nthe country. Yet we are not building the turbines and the components \nand the solar panels and solar cells in this country. This Energy bill \nwe will discuss today, this week and next week, coupled with a real \nmanufacturing policy as Senator Stabenow has articulated over the last \nseveral years, can mean more good-paying industrial manufacturing jobs \nin our country, can help to stabilize energy prices, and can make a \ndifference in rebuilding the middle class in Ohio, Michigan, North \nDakota--all over this country.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Stabenow and thank her for her \nleadership.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, thank you to my colleague from Ohio. It \nis so wonderful to have this strong voice, a leader in the House of \nRepresentatives on trade and manufacturing and all the issues that \naffect middle-class families and to now have Senator Brown joining us \nin the Senate. It is such a benefit for all of us who care deeply about \nkeeping the middle class in this country, about making sure we move \nforward with a 21st century manufacturing strategy that works for our \ncountry in a global economy. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nwords and also join with him and with our wonderful colleague from \nNorth Dakota who has been such a champion on issues of fair trade.\n  First, I will start by reinforcing what has been happening to \nmanufacturing in the last 6\\1/2\\ years. In this country, we have lost \nover 3 million manufacturing jobs. Why should we care about 3 million \njobs that people raised their kids on, sent them to college--middle-\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nclass families with good jobs, good incomes, with health care, with \npensions? These are the jobs that have created the middle class of this \ncountry. That is not rhetoric. That is a fact.\n  These are those kinds of jobs, even though they are different. This \nis not your father's factory. These are new, advanced technology \nmanufacturing jobs now that are being created. But in the future these \nare needed if we are going to keep the middle class of this country. \nThat is why we are on the floor of the Senate, to express deep concern \nabout the incredibly poor judgment and lack of attention coming from \nthis administration and coming, in general, from those all together \nmaking policy that relates to trade and how we compete in a global \neconomy.\n  We have to pay attention before it is too late, before we lose our \neconomic competitiveness in a global economy, our ability to make \nthings.\n  I believe any economy is based on the ability to make things and grow \nthings and add value to that. We have to have a strong, vibrant \nmanufacturing economy in order to be able to move forward and compete \naround the globe now.\n  We did hold a manufacturing summit, I think the first of its kind in \nthe Senate, last week. I was very proud that Senator Reid, our leader, \nenthusiastically supported us bringing together 70 different CEOs and \nhigh-ranking manufacturing leaders, as well as those representing their \nlabor force, their unions, to come together and talk about what has \nhappened in manufacturing and how we in the Senate can be supportive of \nkeeping manufacturing competitive--a level playing field, which is all \nwe are asking for in a global economy.\n  We heard some desperate pleas for us to pay attention to what is \ngoing on. Over and over again these CEO's talked with us about the fact \nthat in a global economy, now competing with nonmarket economies such \nas China, they in fact are not competing with companies, they are \ncompeting with countries. We go out in the marketplace. There are rules \nrequired of our companies to be able to put a plant in another country \nor have local content in China with auto suppliers. You can't send it \nin and do business with China. You have to make the product there. \nTheir country owns part of the business or provides great incentives, \nthrough a variety of other policies. Yet we are not paying attention. \nUnfortunately, this administration has not gotten what is happening \nwhen we talk about currency manipulation and counterfeiting and all the \nother policy issues that have put our companies at a disadvantage.\n  We are happy to export in a global economy. We wish to export our \nproducts, not our jobs. Right now we are exporting too many of our \njobs.\n  What is the reality? When China went into the WTO in 2001, we were \ntold two things: our trade deficit would go down and that our jobs \nwould go up. Unfortunately, the facts are exactly the opposite; a $83 \nbillion trade deficit with China. Last year that number skyrocketed to \n$288 billion, from $83 billion to $288 billion. It is certainly not \ngoing down. We have seen the Economic Policy Institute release a study \n2 weeks ago that revealed 1.8 million jobs have been displaced through \ntrade with China alone since they entered the World Trade Organization. \nThey promised they would follow the rules. That is part of how you \nbecome part of the WTO. We were told: Support them so they can become a \npart of this international organization, where they will be required to \nfollow the same rules as everybody else. They have not and we have \nlost, with China alone, 1.8 million good-paying, middle-class jobs.\n  It is now time to say enough is enough. In fact, 11 agreements have \nbeen completed since this administration, new trade agreements. Yet to \nenforce the agreements, the money has actually gone down by 17 percent. \nThere is no willingness to understand what is going on.\n  In the counterfeiting business, we have a $12 billion counterfeit \nauto parts industry alone. What does that mean? These are auto parts \ncoming in that do not meet our safety standards. The brakes may look \nthe same, but if you go to a shelf and say I want this one because it \nis cheaper and put it in your car, it doesn't meet safety regulations. \nWhat happens when you are driving with your kids in the car? These are \nserious issues for what happens when auto parts are brought in, in a \ncounterfeit manner.\n  Now, $12 billion worth of counterfeit auto parts have come in. In \nfact, in the last 5 years, we have lost 250,000 jobs in America because \nof that, and we have seen six of our Nation's largest auto suppliers go \ninto bankruptcy. This is no accident. We don't have a policy. We \npassed, here, a counterfeit policy to strengthen our counterfeiting \nlaws and the administration doesn't even use those. They have turned a \nblind eye. We have lost 250,000 jobs. We have seen our largest auto \nsuppliers going into bankruptcy--Delphi, Dana Corp., Collins & Aikman, \nFederal-Mogul, Tower Automotive, and Dura Automotive.\n  Our job is to fight for our businesses that are competing in a global \neconomy where other countries are not following the rules.\n  Let me give one other example, and I will be happy to turn to my \ncolleague from North Dakota, the issue of currency manipulation. When \nwe say currency manipulation, most people's eyes glaze over. What does \nthat mean? Because a country such as China or Japan, when it comes to \nthe auto industry, purposely keeps their currency down in value, they \nget a discount on the exchange rate when they bring their product into \nthis country. In China, for instance, again, where we look at an auto \npart, the same auto parts that are being pirated, snuck into America or \nthey are stealing the patents and making them illegally in China--if \nthey actually bring them in, they also, on top of everything else, get \na discount. They can sell the same auto part, the same bolt for $60 \nthat we sell for $100 here, a $40 difference.\n  When you add that up, that is a $40 discount. On top of that, they \nare not paying health care the way we structure it. We are the only \nindustrialized country that puts that on the backs of our businesses.\n  They are following a whole different set of rules. Their wages are \ndramatically lower. When we say to our auto suppliers or we say to our \nfurniture makers or we say to others: Why can't you compete in a global \neconomy, well, Mr. President, the manufacturers who joined us last \nweek, and the great manufacturers in Michigan I go home and speak with \nevery single weekend are saying: Look around you. We are competitive. \nWe can be competitive. We are productive, but we have to have a Federal \nGovernment that partners with us so we have a level playing field on \nwhich to operate. Don't let the other team go down to the 20-yard line \ntoward the goal. Put us both on the 50, have the level playing field, \nand we will compete with anybody and American ingenuity and hard work \nwill win. That is what fair trade policies are all about.\n  I yield now to my colleague from North Dakota who comes to the floor \nevery day speaking out on these issues and who has been a powerful \nvoice for American workers and free trade.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleagues for \ntheir strong voice on trade.\n  I note this morning in the Washington Post that they have written one \nmore ``don't confuse us with the facts'' editorial on trade. It is a \ncreed that we see often in this newspaper. And this one is under the \nguise of criticizing Senator Clinton for saying that she opposes the \nUnited States-Korea Free Trade Agreement.\n  In fact, let me read a part of the article. It says: If ratified, \nthis Korean free-trade agreement, would be the most far-reaching trade \nagreement since the pact with Mexico and Canada.\n  Oh, really? Well, the pact with Mexico, we actually negotiated that \nwhen we had a trade surplus with Mexico. We have turned that into a $60 \nbillion-a-year deficit. The trade with Canada, we had a small deficit \nwith Canada. We have turned it into a giant deficit.\n  So if the Washington Post compares this with the NAFTA and the Mexico \nand Canada trade pacts, they ought to go back and look at the facts.\n  But let me just say, if they choose to applaud this trade agreement \nas the\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\nideal of what trade agreements ought to be like, I think they have \nchosen the wrong tent pole.\n  Here is what is happening with trade. This is what the Washington \nPost is supporting: an avalanche of red ink, dramatic trade deficits, \nwhich means we have shipped American jobs overseas. I believe we have \nbegun to undermine this country's economy.\n  With respect to automobile trade and Korea and this agreement, let me \nsay we have already negotiated two agreements with Korea in the 1990s. \nThey have not abided by either of them. They say: Yes, yes, yes. They \nsign up for the agreement, and they do not do anything with respect to \nthe enforcement.\n  Here is what we have with Korea. Last year, they sent us 730,000 \nKorean cars to be sold in the United States. Guess what. We were able \nto sell 4,000 cars in Korea. Let me say that again. They shipped \n730,000 cars to be sold here. We were able to sell 4,000 cars in Korea.\n  Fair trade? I don't think so. Ninety-nine percent of the cars driving \non the streets of Korea are Korean-made because that is the way they \nwant it. That is the way they will keep it. Go read the story about the \nDodge Dakota pickup that we tried to sell in Korea, and how the Korean \ngovernment blocked that. You will know all you need to know about Korea \nauto trade.\n  So when the Washington Post criticizes Senator Clinton for standing \nup for this country's economic interests, I think it is a curious kind \nof thing for the Washington Post to do.\n  This issue of trade is about jobs, real jobs. And the people who have \nthose jobs are the people who know about second shifts, second jobs, \nsecond mortgages. They are American workers trying to make a go of it \nin a global economy, supported by the Washington Post, that puts \ndownward pressure on their wages, and says let's sign up for any trade \nagreement, even if it is unfair to this country's economic interests.\n  A group of us proposed that we do benchmarks with trade agreements. \nLet's find out whether there is the kind of benchmark and \naccountability that will meet the test of progress on the other side \nwith respect to trade agreements. But this administration opposes that \nas well.\n  The reason I wanted to take the floor today was to talk about the \nKorean free-trade agreement. We could talk about most others, as well, \nbut the editorial this morning criticizing Senator Clinton is \nunbelievable, and deals with the Korean deal.\n  This is the weakest possible point the Washington Post could make, or \nthose who support these trade agreements could make. The Koreans send \nus 700,000 cars. They will allow only 4,000 of ours into their \nmarketplace. That is fair trade? So they say, let's sign up for a third \nagreement with them. How many bitter lessons do we have to learn? What \nabout accountability? What about benchmarks? Why won't this \nadministration agree to benchmarks on trade agreements so that we can \nsee whether we really are standing up for this country's economic \ninterests?\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, it is not just the Washington Post but \nso many others here I think are experiencing a triumph of hope over \nreal experience when they support trade agreements that we know to be \nbad agreements from this country's economic standpoint.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7577-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7577-S7579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as a member of the Energy Committee, I \nknow a tremendous amount of work has been put into making this a strong \nenergy package that will help us achieve energy self-reliance, lower \ngas prices, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Under Democratic leadership, we are headed into a new cleaner, \ngreener, and more affordable energy future, one where we do not seek to \ntreat our addiction to oil by drilling for yet more oil in the Arctic \nor off the east coast. This bill represents a bold step forward toward \nan economy that is based upon energy efficiency and renewable rather \nthan fossil fuels.\n  I do believe, however, that there are a few key amendments that will \nmake this good bill even better. The most important of these is \nChairman Bingaman's renewable portfolio standard amendment, requiring \nthat 15 percent of the Nation's electricity be produced from renewable \nsources by 2020. This forward-thinking provision is a declaration that \nour country is ready to be a renewable energy leader.\n  I often hear in the Halls of Congress that energy is a regional \nissue. If you represent a cold State, you probably support one set of \npolicies; if your State grows corn or drills for oil, you support other \npolicies.\n  I understand the passionate advocacy one must undertake on behalf of \none's home State. But energy can no longer be viewed as a parochial \nissue that only affects local interests. We in the Senate have a \nresponsibility to ensure that our local interests do not jeopardize the \nNation's interests as a whole, nor can we stand in the way of this \ngreat Nation becoming a global leader on what has become a global \nissue.\n  For most of the past two centuries, this country has been blessed \nwith an abundant supply of domestic energy, bountiful enough to provide \nus with all of the heat and power we have needed. But for the last 40 \nyears we have increasingly had to look abroad to secure supplies of \noil. This quest to feed our seemingly insatiable appetite for oil has \nunquestionably shaped our foreign policy.\n  We pay the price for our oil habit when a corrupt regime such as Iran \nfeels emboldened to threaten its neighbors with nuclear weapons, and do \nso with impunity because their access to oil makes it possible for them \nto buy influence around the globe.\n  As New York Times columnist Tom Friedman has pointed out, it is not a \ncoincidence that when oil was $20 a barrel, both Russia and Iran \nlaunched internal reform programs to increase democratic participation. \nAs the price of oil has soared past $70 a barrel, both of those \ncountries have reversed course and used their burgeoning treasuries to \nstifle dissent and roll back democratic progress.\n  The same story can be told across the world, from the corrupt royal \ngovernments and pseudo-theocracies of the Middle East, to the iron-\nfisted dictators who hold sway in the former Soviet countries in \nCentral Asia, to the petro-populism of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Many \nof the countries that sit on the largest reserves of oil are the same \ncountries that are now resisting reform and creating global \ninstability.\n  If the story of the 20th century was of a tidal wave of democracy \nsweeping across the globe, the emerging story of the 21st century is of \nthat wave being swallowed underneath a floor of crude. As long as there \nare tyrants who have the lucky fortune to sit on top of massive oil \nreserves and prop up their regimes through huge petroleum profits, \nthere will be no reform. Finding alternatives to oil is a key to \ndemocratic, economic, and social reform in much of the world.\n  In response to this energy security challenge, some of my friends and \ncolleagues will undoubtedly advocate Federal support for efforts to \nsupport a liquid fuel from coal. They point out that we have an \nabundant supply of coal, that we are the ``Saudi Arabia'' of coal. This \nline of thought ignores the threat of global warming.\n  The lifecycle emissions of liquid fuel made from coal are over twice \nthat of gasoline. If we substitute oil for coal, a fuel that releases \neven more greenhouse gasses than oil, we are setting our planet up for \ndisaster. Global warming is happening. It is caused by human \nactivities. It is threatening our very existence.\n  Recently, the New Jersey Research and Policy Center catalogued the \nimpacts of global warming in my State over the next century. If we do \nnot act quickly and decisively, Cape May Beach will erode between 160 \nto 500 feet inland. The Holland Tunnel will be forced to close due to \nrepeated floods. Heat-related deaths in our cities will rise fivefold, \nand flooding along the Delaware River will cause millions of dollars in \nproperty damage.\n  Similar devastating impacts will be seen all over the world. Floods \nwill require the evacuation of millions in India and Bangladesh. East \nAsia will experience increased water shortages. Central Africa will see \never worsening\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\ndrought conditions. Warmer ocean surface temperatures will lead to \nstronger hurricanes and cyclones.\n\n  In order to address our energy challenges, we must keep these \nworldwide impacts in mind, but that does not mean we should not act \nlocally to achieve our national goals. Just this past weekend, the \nWashington Post ran an article with the headline, ``Cities Take Lead on \nEnvironment As Debate Drags at Federal Level.''\n  The article detailed the actions that mayors have taken to fill the \nvoid left by the President's lack of leadership on climate change. \nHundreds of mayors have created energy efficiency projects, promoted \nrenewable energy, and vowed to meet the greenhouse gas reductions laid \nout in the Kyoto Protocol.\n  To foster this local spirit in our cities to tackle climate change, \nI, along with Senator Sanders, have included a provision in this bill \nto create an energy and environmental block grant program. This program \nwill allow cities and counties to get Federal grants to make their \nbuildings more efficient, create new renewable energy projects, and \ncontinue their leadership in reducing U.S. carbon emissions.\n  Mr. President, not only does the Clean Energy Act of 2007 lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions and help us achieve energy self-reliance, but \nthe bill also promises to reduce prices at the pump. First, the bill \ncreates real competition for oil by increasing the production of \nrenewable biofuels from 8.5 billion gallons per year in 2008 to 36 \nbillion gallons per year by 2022.\n  Second, the bill lowers the demand for oil by requiring the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration to achieve a nationwide fleet \nfuel economy of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 for passenger cars and \nlight trucks.\n  Third, the bill expands the Federal research into plug-in hybrid \ntechnology so that electricity can compete against liquid fuels as a \npower source for our vehicles.\n  Finally, by cracking down on price gouging, the bill will ensure that \noil companies cannot drive up costs without justification. For too long \ncompanies have been allowed to squeeze motorists for record profits \nwithout economic justification. This bill will make oil markets more \ntransparent and institute tougher civil and criminal penalties for \nmarket manipulation.\n  Taken together, these measures will create more supply, put downward \npressure on demand, and create a more competitive marketplace. In turn, \nthis will lead to drastically lower prices for all drivers.\n  Mr. President, in closing, each of us comes to the Senate as a \nrepresentative of our respective State, but our responsibilities do not \nend at our State's borders. As national leaders, we also have a \nresponsibility to come together and address issues such as our global \nenergy challenges.\n  When it comes to these issues, whether it is national security or \nglobal climate change, we must rise above local interests and show \nnational leadership. Then, and only then will we be able to effect \nchange that benefits consumers, improves our energy security, and \nestablishes the United States as a leader in the fight against global \nwarming.\n  I salute Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici in this effort. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the very important \nbill before us. Like the Senator from New Jersey, I serve on the Energy \nCommittee. It has been my pleasure to work with the chairman and \nranking member to discuss the problems we have in our country and the \nState of Florida with energy, the fact that it is such an essential \ningredient in our daily lives. It needs more help. It needs reform, and \nCongress needs to address it.\n  As we move forward in shaping the policies that guide our Nation in \nsecuring domestic, stable, and affordable sources of energy, we must \nremember that everything we do here will have a direct impact on every \nAmerican who drives a car, turns on a light, or takes a sip of water. \nGas prices are hovering around historic highs. Energy bills are \nclimbing. Over the last 5 months, gas prices have risen almost 50 \npercent. That is the one place where all Americans have to, at some \npoint during the week, make a stop, as with the grocery store. If \nprices have gone up 50 percent over the last 5 months, imagine what \nthat does to a family on a budget trying to make ends meet, trying to \nsend children to school, trying to live on a fixed income--retire, \nperhaps--members of our military. This cuts across all people evenly. \nEnergy bills are climbing for all Americans. There is increased concern \nover the impact our energy production has on our environment, and \nrightly so.\n  I am glad we are talking about this important issue because it is a \nvehicle we can use to address all three of these pressing concerns. But \nin this bill, there are areas where we can do more, areas we can \nimprove to help shape the long-term outlook for domestic energy \nproduction.\n  In the area of gas prices, this bill does nothing to remove the \nbarriers to refineries. Total U.S. demand for oil is about 22 million \nbarrels per day. Right now, we have domestic refinery capacity here in \nthe United States to produce about 17 million barrels a day. That means \nwe have to import at least 5 million barrels of refined products every \nday just to meet our current deficit. But the problem is, our needs are \ngrowing and refinery capacity is static or shrinking. We need more \nrefineries and more refinery capacity. But the fact is, we have not \nbuilt a refinery in the United States in 30 years because of burdensome \noverregulation.\n  Under the current system, there is no incentive for companies to take \nthe risk or make the investment in a process that in all likelihood \nwill result in rejection. This is something this bill should address. \nWe know the problem. We know the solution. All we need now is a \ncommitment to do something about it. Until we address the refinery \ncapacity and petroleum infrastructure problems, there will be no relief \nfor this problem, for the ever-rising prices of gasoline for American \nconsumers at the pump. Until we address refinery capacity, this bill \nwill not be complete.\n  This bill attempts to address supposed price gouging at the pump. I \nthink I speak for all my colleagues when I say we oppose price gouging \nand we should encourage vigorous prosecution of unscrupulous business \npractices. We should do all we can to see it doesn't happen and those \nwho engage in that are punished. But study after study and \ninvestigation after investigation have shown that widespread price \ngouging is not happening. That is not the problem. After the \ndevastating hurricanes of 2005, I joined my colleagues on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee to ask the Federal Trade Commission if \nthere was any sort of collusion among the oil and gas industry to drive \nup prices. Once again, the FTC found no evidence of price gouging or of \ncollusion.\n  Until we address the capacity of our refineries to produce more gas, \nthe supply will be limited. Basic economics says if demand is high and \nsupply is low, you are going to pay a premium at the pump. Gas prices \nare hurting Americans. We are looking at historic highs. Pick up a gas \npump and open your wallet. Does this bill address that? No. This \ndoesn't add any more production. This doesn't reduce inefficiencies. \nInstead, this bill mandates alternative fuels without removing cost \nbarriers. We will still have a 54-cents-a-gallon tariff on Brazilian \nethanol. That is fuel which could be flowing today in Florida and \nthroughout our country. That is fuel which could increase supply, \nreduce the price at the pump, and have an impact on prices tomorrow. It \nis part of what this bill should address. We need to look at whether, \nin fact, it is prudent, at a time when we are trying to increase \nethanol consumption, for us to put a tax on the import of ethanol from \nBrazil.\n  Another area of this bill where we could make improvements is by \nadding incentives to promote the production of nuclear energy. If we \nare looking for a clean, reliable, stable, and affordable energy \nsupply, look no further than nuclear energy. In my State, we have five \nnuclear units generating roughly 15 percent of our energy needs. We \nneed more of that kind of power generation. In the time since we \nordered our last nuclear reactor in the 1970s, France has embraced \nnuclear energy. Now their country is 80 percent nuclear. They get it. \nThey are using it. They are recycling the waste to generate even more\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\npower. If we are looking for a renewable, clean, and stable source of \nenergy, there is one. But instead of promoting nuclear energy, this \nbill is silent. Instead of giving Floridians relief from the costs \nassociated with storing the waste at our facilities, we are faced with \nmounting bills.\n  Florida ratepayers have already paid $1.2 billion to move waste to \nYucca Mountain, but it currently remains stored in Florida. It is \nsitting at the powerplants. This money, intended to store nuclear waste \nin Nevada, is costing Floridians money every month in every electric \nbill. It is costing us the money that should have been spent on \nproducing more energy, on finding ways of bringing down the costs.\n  Under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we were supposed to be \nsending this waste to Yucca Mountain starting in 1998. We have let \npolitics prevent us from embracing the promise of nuclear power. If we \nare serious about promoting the production of clean energy, we had \nbetter do what we promised Florida ratepayers and others around the \nNation, that we open the central repository in Nevada.\n  We have enough coal to meet our energy needs for 200 years, and very \nlittle in this bill addresses that fact. States such as Kentucky, \nMontana, and Wyoming are rich in resources and ready to bring those \nresources to meet our growing fuel demands. As a Senator from Florida, \nI would much rather be digging for coal in Montana or Kentucky than \ndrilling for oil on the beaches of Florida.\n  The Bingaman 15 percent RPS amendment is one of the amendments I \nencourage my colleagues to oppose. For Florida ratepayers who have \nembraced nuclear energy as a way to help reduce pollution, by 2030, the \nBingaman amendment will have a cost of $21 billion. I don't know how \nmany people in Florida think their energy bills are too low, but I \ncan't imagine that they are willing to start subsidizing wind farms in \nNorth Dakota. Florida property taxes are already sky high. Our property \ntaxes, our insurance costs are even higher. The last thing Floridians \nwant is a $21 billion increase in their power bill. Break that down, \nand that is a rate increase of about $2,500 per household. That is more \nthan a year's tuition at the University of Florida. That is more than a \nfamily on a fixed income might spend in a year for any type of \nrecreational activity. Florida doesn't have the resources or the \ncapacity to meet the arbitrary definitions or demands of the Bingaman \namendment. We will take a big financial hit if it passes.\n\n  In the next 10 years, Florida's energy demands are expected to grow \n60 percent. We need reliable, affordable, abundant, clean-burning \nenergy to meet our demands. Disincentives like the renewable portfolio \nstandard amendment don't provide power to the State of Florida. They \ndon't help Florida meet its needs for seniors, veterans, working \nfamilies, and those on fixed incomes.\n  This bill regulates and mandates, but where is the bill streamlining? \nWhere is the redtape being reduced? Where are the incentives for States \nsuch as Florida to build upon those power sources which we have already \nfound to be clean and successful?\n  A bright future for America and our economy depends on energy. We \nneed it to run our homes, computers, cars, our entire way of life. \nRight now, we have a reliance on foreign sources of energy that is \nunhealthy. To get away from foreign sources of energy, we need to make \nthe hard decisions today to give us a better tomorrow. That is \ncertainly the case with our energy policy. Domestic solutions include \nnuclear, clean coal, biofuels, increased production of oil and natural \ngas. Obviously, conservation needs to be a cornerstone of what we do.\n  In Florida, we rejected oil and natural gas drilling off our coast in \nfavor of pursuing alternatives, including expanding production in some \nof the deepest regions of the Outer Continental Shelf, opening 8.3 \nmillion acres for production. We are also studying new sources of \nenergy. We are making great strides in biofuels research and \ndevelopment. We are working through public and private partnerships to \nharness the power of cellulosic ethanol and find ways to more \nefficiently turn orange rinds and sugar cane into energy. These are the \nideas. These are the innovations we need to pursue in our natural \nenergy policy. We need to reward States that are pursuing smart \nstrategies. We need to stay away from penalizing those that don't have \nthe resources to meet arbitrary and unrealistic benchmarks. We need an \nenergy policy for the long haul.\n  I am hopeful we can do that, but we still have a lot more work to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7579-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7579-S7580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I listened to the conversation that has gone \non this morning. I have to say I am a little bit disappointed in some \nof the negative comments about our country. I always thought you had to \nbe an ultimate optimist to serve in this body. Things go slowly, which \nis probably fortunate, but we just can't keep trying to make ourselves \nlook better by running down our country. I often remind people that I \nam not aware of anybody trying to get out of our country, but from the \npast 2 weeks' discussion, I know there are a lot of people trying to \nget in.\n  I will cite an article from the Wall Street Journal of Wednesday, May \n23, 2007, that says, ``The Poor Get Richer.'' It reads:\n\n       It's been a rough week for John Edwards, and now comes more \n     bad news for his ``two Americas'' campaign theme. A new study \n     by the Congressional Budget Office says the poor have been \n     getting less poor. On average, CBO found that low-wage \n     households with children had incomes after inflation that \n     were more than one-third higher in 2005 than in 1991.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2007]\n\n                          The Poor Get Richer\n\n       It's been a rough week for John Edwards, and now come more \n     bad news for his ``two Americas'' campaign theme. A new study \n     by the Congressional Budget Office says the poor have been \n     getting less poor. On average, CBO found that low-wage \n     households with children had incomes after inflation that \n     were more than one-third higher in 2005 than in 1991.\n       The CBO results don't fit the prevailing media stereotype \n     of the U.S. economy as a richer take all affair--which may \n     explain why you haven't read about them. Among all families \n     with children, the poorest fifth had the fastest overall \n     earnings growth over the 15 years measured. (See the nearby \n     chart.) The poorest even had higher earnings growth than the \n     richest 20%. The earnings of these poor households are about \n     80% higher today than in the early 1990s.\n       What happened? CBO says the main causes of this low-income \n     earnings surge have been a combination of welfare reform, \n     expansion of the earned income tax credit and wage gains from \n     a tight labor market, especially in the late stages of the \n     1990s expansion. Though cash welfare fell as a share of \n     overall income (which includes government benefits), earnings \n     from work climbed sharply as the 1996 welfare reform pushed \n     at least one family breadwinner into the job market.\n       Earnings growth tapered off as the economy slowed in the \n     early part of this decade, but earnings for low-income \n     families have still nearly doubled in the years since welfare \n     reform became law. Some two million welfare mothers have left \n     the dole for jobs since the mid-1990s. Far from being a \n     disaster for the poor, as most on the left claimed when it \n     was debated, welfare reform has proven to be a boon.\n       The report also rebuts the claim, fashionable in some \n     precincts on CNN, that the middle class is losing ground. The \n     median family with children saw an 18% rise in earnings from \n     the early 1990s through 2005. That's $8,500 more purchasing \n     power after inflation. The wealthiest fifth made a 55% gain \n     in earnings, but the key point is that every class saw \n     significant gains in income.\n       There's a lot of income mobility in America, so comparing \n     poor families today with the poor families of l0 years ago \n     can be misleading because they're not the same families. \n     Every year hundreds of thousands of new immigrants and the \n     young enter the workforce at ``poor'' income levels. But the \n     CBO study found that, with the exception of chronically poor \n     families who have no breadwinner, low-income job holders are \n     climbing the income ladder.\n       When CBO examined surveys of the same poor families over a \n     two year period, 2001-2003, it found that ``the average \n     income for those households increased by nearly 45%.'' That's \n     especially impressive considering that those were two of the \n     weakest years for economic growth across the 15 years of the \n     larger study.\n       One argument was whether welfare reform would help or hurt \n     households headed by women. Well, CBO finds that female-\n     headed poor households saw their incomes double from 1991 to \n     2005, and the percentage of that\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\n     income coming from a paycheck rose to more than a half from \n     one-third. The percentage coming from traditional cash \n     welfare fell to 7% from 42%. Poor households get more money \n     from the earned income tax credit, but the advantage of that \n     income-supplement program is that recipients have to work to \n     get the benefit.\n       The poor took an earnings dip when the economy went into \n     recession at the end of the Clinton era, but data from other \n     government reports indicate that incomes are again starting \n     to rise faster than inflation as labor markets tighten and \n     the current economic expansion rolls forward.\n       It's probably asking way too much for this dose of economic \n     reality to slow down the class envy lobby in Washington. But \n     it's worth a try.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Another article I refer to is from Denver's Rocky Mountain \nNews for April 9, 2007, ``Not bad for a much-maligned economy.'' We \nkeep talking about how bad the economy is. Well, it isn't bad.\n\n       Just when your mind may have been grappling with the \n     disturbing news that Circuit City stores had fired 3,400 of \n     their highest-paid hourly salespeople--not to trim the \n     workforce, as you might expect, but to replace those let go \n     with lower-paid workers--along comes the Labor Department \n     with equally startling news, but of a positive bent.\n       In March, the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs; the \n     unemployment rate declined again, to 4.4 percent; and average \n     hourly and weekly earnings advanced, with weekly income up \n     4.4 percent . . .\n\n  The article goes on to read:\n\n       But after six years of fairly steady economic growth \n     despite a costly war, Katrina, a housing slump and other body \n     blows, fair-minded people should at least entertain the \n     possibility that current policies must be getting something \n     right.\n\n  It ends by saying:\n\n       After all, what exactly is it about the March economic \n     figures that [you] don't like?\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, Apr. 9, 2007]\n\n                  Not Bad for a Much-Maligned Economy\n\n       Just when your mind may have been grappling with the \n     disturbing news that Circuit City stores had fired 3,400 of \n     their highest-paid hourly salespeople--not to trim the \n     workforce, as you might expect, but to replace those let go \n     with lower-paid workers--along comes the Labor Department \n     with equally startling news, but of a positive bent.\n       In March, the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs; the \n     unemployment rate declined again, to 4.4 percent; and average \n     hourly and weekly earnings advanced, with weekly income up \n     4.4 percent on an annual basis.\n       In other words, amid all of the economic anxiety fueled by \n     globalization, immigration and the relentless rhetoric about \n     a growing class divide in the United States, the actual \n     performance of the American economy remains fairly \n     remarkable.\n       We're not suggesting that the popular worries are baseless. \n     Globalization involves winners and losers; immigration puts \n     pressure on wages (at least on the lower end); and the rich \n     have indeed been getting richer at a faster rate than the \n     rest of us.\n       Even some of the popular resentments--such as over the \n     steep trajectory of CEO pay--are hardly without merit.\n       But after six years of fairly steady economic growth \n     despite a costly war, Katrina, a housing slump and other body \n     blows, fair-minded people should at least entertain the \n     possibility that current policies must be getting something \n     right.\n       The burden of proof, indeed, should be on those who want to \n     raise taxes, reverse advances in free trade, and micromanage \n     businesses with a slew of new regulations affecting \n     compensation, benefits and employment conditions.\n       After all, what exactly is it about the March economic \n     figures that they don't like?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7580-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7580-S7582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what I really came to address is an issue of \nutmost importance to the American people. When I visit my home State \nand read the mail I receive from constituents, I am consistently \nreminded of the fact that we are seeing record-high energy prices. High \nenergy prices affect almost every American. They affect the parent who \ndrives his or her kids to school. They affect the college student who \nwants to make it home for the weekend. They affect Members of the \nSenate as we travel to and from our States. But we have to be careful \nwith what we do. A lot of the time, something that we think is going to \nbe a positive move turns out to be a negative.\n  I refer to a Wall Street Journal article of May 16, 2007. It is \ntitled ``Green But Unclean.'' It reads:\n\n       Remember those water-saving toilets that Congress mandated \n     a few years back? Yes, the ones that frequently clog and \n     don't flush, causing many Americans to resort to buying high-\n     performance, black-marketed potties in Canada and sneaking \n     them into their homes like smugglers. Well, get set for \n     Washington's latest brainstorm.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2007]\n\n                           Green But Unclean\n\n       Remember those water-saving toilets that Congress mandated \n     a few years back? Yes, the ones that frequently clog and \n     don't flush, causing many Americans to resort to buying high-\n     performance black-market potties in Canada and sneaking them \n     into their homes like smugglers. Well, get set for \n     Washington's latest brainstorm: $800 washers that don't \n     really clean.\n       The June issue of Consumer Reports states that ``Not so \n     long ago you could count on most washers to get your clothes \n     clean. Not anymore. . .'' The magazine tested the new washers \n     and found that ``Some left our stain-soaked swatches nearly \n     as dirty as they were before washing.''\n       The cause of this dirty laundry is a regulation issued in \n     the waning days of the Clinton Administration mandating that \n     washers use 35% less energy by 2007. Regulators claimed at \n     the time that this would save money and energy without \n     sacrificing performance. That's what they always say. But, \n     according to Consumer Reports, the new top-loading washers \n     ``had some of the lowest scores we've seen in years.''\n       Don't expect apologies from Congress or the green activists \n     who promoted these mandates. We are living in one of those \n     eras where all Americans are supposed to bow before the gods \n     of energy conservation, even if it means walking around with \n     dirty underwear. One irony is that because the new machines \n     clean so poorly, consumers will often have to rewash clothes, \n     which could well offset energy savings from the mandates. Not \n     to mention the use of extra detergent. But no matter: \n     Crusades like these are about pure green intentions, not the \n     impure actual results.\n       And this is just the beginning. President Bush's \n     endorsement of more immediate auto-mileage standards this \n     week is the latest sign that we are returning to the era when \n     the environment is used as the political justification to \n     promote a new wave of government regulation.\n       Members of Congress and state legislatures are proposing \n     new government edicts forcing Americans to use new and more \n     energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs instead of the \n     conventional incandescent bulbs that many people prefer. \n     Apparently Americans aren't wise enough to make up their own \n     minds, as technology adapts and prices of the new bulbs fall.\n       Once upon a time liberals said government should stay out \n     of the bedroom; at the current rate, that will be the only \n     room in the house where Uncle Sam won't be telling us how to \n     live.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Price increases are for a number of reasons, but the \nsimplest explanation is that we lack the supply to meet the demand for \nenergy. At the same time, prices decrease when we see strong supplies \nthat are capable of meeting the demand that exists.\n  We have to be careful that we reduce the demand--and that is what \npart of this bill does--but we also have to figure out a way to \nincrease the supply. I am a little disappointed in what the bill does \nwith that.\n  On June 12, 2007, there was an article in the Casper Star-Tribune. \nThe title is ``Official warns of energy crisis; Growth in demand for \nelectricity in West exceeds generation capacity.'' Of course, for years \nwe have been hearing about rolling brownouts in California and even \nblackouts in part of the country.\n  It says:\n\n       Construction of new electrical generation in the West is \n     projected to grow by 6 percent, while demand for electricity \n     is projected to increase by 19 percent over the next 10 \n     years, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\n  FERC Commissioner Suedeen Kelly, speaking on her own behalf, said the \nsituation is nothing short of a crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Casper Star-Tribune, June 12, 2007]\n\n                    Official Warns of Energy Crisis\n\n                         (By Dustin Bleizeffer)\n\n       Deadwood, S.D.--Construction of new electrical generation \n     in the West is projected to grow by 6 percent, while demand \n     for electricity is projected to increase by 19 percent over \n     the next 10 years, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission.\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\n       FERC commissioner Suedeen Kelly, speaking on her own \n     behalf, said the situation is nothing short of a crisis.\n       ``There's not enough time to build our way out,'' Kelly \n     told the Western Governors' Association here Monday.\n       Kelly said Western states must band together to \n     aggressively seek energy efficiency, noting that even small \n     load reductions during peak usage times have proven to save \n     millions of dollars. In addition to efficiency, Kelly said, \n     Western states must immediately launch a massive and \n     coordinated construction effort to link rural renewable \n     energy and clean coal resources to high-load centers.\n       She commended the Western Governors' Association for its \n     efforts toward those goals, but cautioned that the process is \n     going to be expensive--both financially and politically. The \n     political cost is that some government entity--whether state \n     or federal--is going to have to force power lines into \n     someone's backyard.\n       States retain authority over siting power lines and related \n     facilities--an endowment the federal government doesn't seem \n     to envy, according to Kelly. Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal \n     suggested this is one area where the federal government could \n     be useful. Freudenthal's idea: Perhaps FERC could play some \n     sort of ``convenor'' role to ``legitimize'' siting authority.\n       ``The governor feels really what the state can do is set \n     the stage and make the case that transmission is important,'' \n     Freudenthal spokeswoman Cara Eastwood said. ``It's a complex \n     issue, and it's a challenging issue that has to be overcome \n     in some way.''\n       Individual states can invite FERC to participate without \n     relinquishing siting authority, Kelly said. She said open co-\n     operation is key to dealing with the energy crisis, so \n     Westerners are going to have to accept ``small environmental \n     footprints'' to reduce the overall environmental footprint \n     across the nation.\n       ``We are no longer flying solo with our electricity supply \n     and demand,'' Kelly said. ``We are dependent on each other--\n     even more dependent on each other if we want to (develop) our \n     renewable and clean coal'' resources.\n       Kelly said the energy shortfall will likely reveal itself \n     this summer, noting that meteorologists project hot \n     temperatures across the nation.\n       ``We can correctly call this a crisis,'' Kelly said. ``We \n     don't have enough time to build generation to meet increased \n     demand this summer.''\n\n  Mr. ENZI. As prices continue to escalate, some would say we are in an \nenergy crisis. We are at a point where we continue to see the global \ndemand for energy increasing as countries such as China and India \ndevelop. At the same time, the demand increases, the Democratic \nCongress is not taking the steps to increase our domestic supply. Some \nof the policies we are seeing will have a detrimental effect on that \nsupply.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included a number of important \nincentives for the domestic exploration of many new natural resource \nsupplies. It aided in the production of affordable domestic energy. We \nare now seeing a number of proposals from the other side to repeal \nthese important provisions.\n  In the 109th Congress, we attempted to pass important legislation to \nstreamline the bureaucratic process that made it impossible to build an \nentirely new refinery, and that is what has been happening for the last \n30 years. That legislation was repeatedly blocked at the expense of the \nAmerican people, who continue to suffer as refiners struggle to keep \npace through expansion. Supply and demand--you can buy the oil, but \nunless the oil becomes gasoline, you cannot use it, and unless it is in \nenough of a quantity of gasoline and enough of a supply, the price will \ngo up. It will provide complications.\n  Since November, gasoline prices have increased almost 50 percent. The \nprice of gas averaged $2.20 a gallon at the last election. Now the \naverage is $3.15 a gallon. Part of that is the cost of a barrel of oil, \nbut more of that is a reflection on the future and how unstable some of \nthe world situations are. That is what fluctuates the price of a barrel \nof oil.\n  But the price at the pump is affected by the number of refineries we \nhave and the number of regulations Congress puts on the gasoline we \nuse. We saw a spike last month in the price of gasoline. That is the \npoint at which the refineries had to shut down some of their production \nin order to change over to the requirements we put on for the summer \nfuel. When that happens, there is less supply, and prices go up. Since \nthe changeover has been made, prices have come down slightly.\n  These are not positive trends and, unfortunately, there is nothing to \nindicate the Senate will be acting in a way to increase supply and \nimprove the price of energy for the American people.\n  My State of Wyoming is an energy-producing State. We produce about a \nthird of the Nation's coal. We produce a million tons of coal a day. We \nalso have large natural gas fields. We are the only State in the Nation \nthat is showing an increasing supply of natural gas. We also produce \nsome oil. We have a significant amount of wind power. We have uranium. \nBecause of a lot of Sun, I am seeing an increasing amount of solar \npower with each visit to Wyoming.\n  We have a diversified energy portfolio. We have an energy portfolio \nthat recognizes that coal is the Nation's most abundant resource. In \nfact, my county has more Btu's in coal than Saudi Arabia has in oil. \nOur energy portfolio recognizes you can produce natural gas in an \nenvironmentally efficient manner. At the same time, our State's \nportfolio recognizes there is an increasingly important place for wind \nand other renewable resources. We are trying to do them all, but we \ncannot neglect the one we have the most of.\n  The policies on the other side of the aisle do not reflect this need \nfor diversity. While they talk about the need to reduce our dependence \non foreign energy sources, they repeatedly block efforts to produce our \ndomestic resources. As they talk about the need to lower prices for \nconsumers, they advocate policies that will make it more expensive to \nproduce energy. As they talk about the need to increase our Nation's \nenergy security, they vote against policies that will increase the use \nof our Nation's most abundant domestic energy source.\n  We are currently debating an energy bill. I want to commend Chairman \nBingaman and Ranking Member Domenici for their work on this \nlegislation. There is no question there are some positive provisions in \nthe legislation. I do appreciate that it actually came through \ncommittee. I have not seen a bill that has just been brought to the \nfloor, such as the immigration bill, that has ever made it through the \nprocess. So this one has a chance of making it through, and I am glad \nfor that. The legislation will help develop biofuels technologies which \nwill allow us to displace some of our Nation's traditional energy \nsupply.\n  However, the legislation has many flaws, most clearly illustrated by \nthe decision of Senate Democrats to block efforts by members of the \nEnergy Committee who worked to incentivize a technology that can truly \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign sources. That technology is \nknown as coal-to-liquids, and it is the process of turning our Nation's \nmost abundant energy source--coal--into liquid fuels--incentives \ninstead of stopping the process.\n  Coal-to-liquids technology is not new. The technology has been around \nsince the 1940s, and there is no question it will be used today in a \nmuch better way than even in the 1940s. It would be used in the \ntransportation markets, which is our biggest difficulty.\n  It can be transported in pipelines that currently exist. And, because \nit comes from coal--our Nation's most abundant energy source--it can be \nproduced at home by American workers.\n  Coal-to-liquids plants are being developed in China. They are being \ndeveloped in other major industrialized nations, but they are not being \ndeveloped in the United States. I am concerned that, as we sit on the \nsidelines, other nations will take advantage of our inaction and our \neconomy will suffer.\n  The amendment offered by Senators Thomas and Bunning that was blocked \nin the Energy Committee offered a tremendous opportunity to move coal-\nto-liquids forward. It was a tremendous opportunity to place more of \nour energy security in the hands of Americans and to take it out of the \nhands of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and other oil barons who seek to do \neconomic harm to the United States. Unfortunately, on a party-line \nvote, that effort was blocked and instead of debating a more \ncomprehensive energy bill, we are debating one with a glaring weakness.\n  In addition to the decision to keep coal-to-liquids language out of \nthe legislation, I am concerned that a number of other sections \nincluded in the bill make for good talking points, but not for good \nsolutions. Although I understand and sympathize with the problems that \nhigh energy prices create for\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nfamilies, creating a federal price gouging law is not the answer. The \nauthority already exists for investigations into price gouging, and I \nam concerned that price gouging is simply a code word for ``price \ncontrols.'' Such a policy failed in the past and will fail in the \nfuture.\n  I also have concerns about the sections of the legislation that \nincrease corporate average fuel economy standards, and I have concerns \nthat this bill does nothing to address our lack of domestic energy \nproduction in areas where production is possible and environmentally \nresponsible.\n  We are in a situation where our Nation's energy supply does not meet \nour Nation's energy demand, and, while we must work to reduce our \nconsumption, we should also work to produce as much energy domestically \nas is possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of America's \nenergy security, and I wish to speak a moment about the bill that is \nbefore us and talk about some of the pluses it brings into our debate \nand also talk about some additions I think are very necessary.\n  I am very excited that the Energy Committee, which I am on, has \npassed out to this body a bill that talks about increasing the ability \nof our country to rely upon alternative fuels. I think we have set some \nvery good goals in that area. I believe that is an excellent start to \ncause us to be less dependent on petroleum, to be far more dependent on \nbiofuels in our country.\n  I know the State of Tennessee, which I proudly represent, will be a \nbig part of making sure that happens. As a matter of fact, our State is \nworking to make sure we are a substantial part of our country's goal in \nmeeting these objectives.\n  I know cellulosic research is taking place in Tennessee and \nthroughout the country, which will benefit all Americans in the \nprocess, as we take the pressure off corn-based ethanol, which is a big \npart of what we are doing in our country. I am so thrilled for the corn \nfarmers and others across America who are playing a part in our energy \nfuture, but I know that cellulosic is going to be a big part of what we \nneed to do to even increase our country's ability to produce \nalternative fuels.\n  I also know this bill we are contemplating does a great deal to focus \non carbon capture and storage. It also allows our country to actually \nassess the various caverns throughout our country to really look at how \nmuch storage capacity our country has as it relates to storing \nCO2 emissions in order to make sure we do no further damage \nto our environment.\n  I know this bill also really focuses on energy efficiency standards--\nsomething all Americans need to embrace. Certainly, the Federal \nGovernment needs to be a leader in that area, and this bill certainly \ncontemplates that.\n  But let me say this: In a rush to do this--and I am, again, thrilled \nwe have a bipartisan effort underway--I think we need not lose sight of \nthe fact that overall our goal should be to certainly make sure \nwhatever we do with energy policy raises the gross domestic product of \nour country over time, so these young people who are here as pages \ntoday have a future that is even brighter than it is today, that what \nwe do certainly causes our country to have energy security so we are \nnot dependent on regimes around the world that are not friendly to our \ncountry, and that whatever we do causes us to be environmental \nstewards, that we do not damage our country.\n  I want to tell you that I had the great privilege of spending time in \nEurope 2 weeks ago, looking at some of the energy policies some of our \nfriends and allies have put in place. While on one hand I admire \ngreatly their effort to do less damage to the environment, sometimes \nthere are adverse consequences to what occurs. I think what we have \nseen over the short term is a greater dependence on fuel sources that \nwill cause them to be in some ways more dependent on regimes that could \nnot in some ways be friendly to their future.\n  I think we need to keep these things in balance. So while we look at \nalternative fuels that are going to be friendly to our environment and \ncause us to be less dependent on those that are not, I think we ought \nto also focus heavily, in this bill, on increased production. Here in \nAmerica, we need to do our best to boost fuel supply by increased \nproduction. We need to increase our refining capacity. We really have \nnot had major increases in refining capacity in this country since the \n1970s. There are additions that are taking place.\n  I know many people are talking about the high price of gasoline. \nCertainly, one of the reasons for that is our country has a limited \nability to actually refine petroleum in a way we can use it in our \nvehicles. That is something we as a country need to aggressively \npursue.\n  The other thing we need to do in this bill--and I plan to offer an \namendment to deal with this issue. In some ways, in this bill, in \nfocusing on alternative fuels, we are trying to pick winners and \nlosers. We are saying certain types of ethanol are the types of \nalternative fuels we need to be pursuing and those only. What I would \nlike to do is add--and what I will do through an amendment, and \nhopefully, it will pass this body--is to cause the Senate to actually \nset standards, standards that cause fuels to be environmentally \nfriendly, to emit less carbon, to emit less other types of pollutants, \nand at the same time be fuel efficient, to provide the amount of \nenergy, if you will, that really meets the standards these other fuels \ndo. So we hope to broaden that definition so the Senate itself is not \ndefining specific fuels.\n  We have tremendous capabilities in our country through \nentrepreneurship. We have tremendous capabilities through coal-to-\nliquid technology that we can do in an environmentally friendly way. We \nhave other types of technologies that are being developed. I think we \nas a country should set goals and standards and let entrepreneurs and \nthe business community help fill the void to cause our country to be \nenergy secure, to cause our country to help grow the GDP, and to cause \nour country to make sure what we do causes us to be environmentally \nfriendly.\n  So we will be putting forth that amendment. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in helping us broaden these definitions so we can harness the \nvery best we have in our country.\n  I yield my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7582-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 6, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to reduce our Nation's dependency on \n     foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative \n     energy resources, promoting new emerging energy technologies, \n     developing greater efficiency, and creating a Strategic \n     Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in \n     alternative energy, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 1502, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 1505 (to amendment No. 1502), to \n     improve domestic fuels security.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1505\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:45 \na.m. shall be for debate on amendment No. 1505, offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Inhofe, I yield \nmyself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to talk about the Inhofe amendment, \nwhich would increase the possibility that we could have increased \nrefining in the United States. Refining of oil\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\nproduces more gasoline, and more gasoline will bring down the price of \ngasoline.\n  We can't have a serious discussion about energy without discussing \nthe fact that it has been more than 30 years since the last oil \nrefinery was built in the United States. There has to be a reason for \nthat. Although a number of our Nation's refiners have worked on \nexpansions, they simply can't keep up with the growing demand.\n  It is clear that something is wrong with a permitting process when it \nis so burdensome it prevents the construction of that which is so vital \nto our Nation. Because energy fuels our economy, we need to stop with \nthe rhetoric and take some real action.\n  I have to tell my colleagues that I have faith in America. I have \nfaith in the young people of America. I have faith in the inventors in \nAmerica, who are of all ages. I am aware of a company in Sheridan, WY, \nnamed Big Horn Valve. They have been working on some refinery problems, \nincluding leaks in refineries, and they came up with a valve that \ndoesn't have a knob that you turn on the outside of the pipe. \nEverything is internal in the pipe, and it has a special venturi nozzle \nin there that doesn't take up the entire inside of the pipe but can \nstill flow as much oil as a flow pipe. The way it works is to turn it \noff magnetically; it twists and the two spots don't line up. Since it \nis completely internal to the pipe, there can be no leakage. It is just \none small solution to some of the problems that can be solved.\n  I would mention that with the National Institutes of Health, we have \nfaith in the inventiveness of people. We doubled the budget for \nresearch for the National Institutes of Health. I can tell my \ncolleagues that today we have 654 cancer treatments in clinical trials. \nThat is what happens when we incentivize people to come up with \nsolutions.\n  We need to do that with energy. We are in the midst of a huge energy \ncrisis. China recognizes it. China is buying every available fuel \nsource they can get their hands on. My colleagues probably saw where \nthey tried to buy a company in California. You have probably seen where \nthey bought supplies in Canada. They know the future of the economy is \nrequiring--requiring--energy, particularly fuel to transport things.\n  Senator Inhofe's amendment recognizes this fact, and it improves the \npermitting process for new refineries. It establishes an opt-in program \nfor State Governors, requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to \ncoordinate all necessary permits for construction or expansion of \nrefineries. It provides participating States with technical and \nfinancial resources to assist in permitting, and it establishes \ndeadlines for permit approval.\n  These vital changes will make it possible for new refineries to \nfinally be built. They make those changes in a way that is \nenvironmentally sound. Opponents of this legislation suggest that is \nnot the case and that environmental laws will be pushed aside. Those \nclaims are false. The Environmental Council of States, which represents \nState departments of environmental quality, clearly stated in a letter \nthat ``the Gas PRICE Act does not weaken environmental laws.'' That act \nis the one that is in Senator Inhofe's amendment.\n  In addition to this, the council, along with the National Association \nof Counties, acknowledged that the Gas PRICE Act streamlining \nprovisions are in compliance with State and local governments.\n  If this were the only positive section of the Gas PRICE Act, it would \nbe worthy of our support, but this legislation also addresses a second \naspect that I believe is missing from the underlying bill. That aspect \nis the incentivizing of coal-to-liquids technologies.\n  As drafted, the legislation does nothing to advance the development \nof coal-to-liquids plants. That is the overall bill, not the amendment. \nAs a member of the Senate Energy Committee, Senator Craig Thomas and \nJim Bunning worked hard to move this issue forward and offered an \namendment during the committee's consideration of the biofuels \nlegislation to set a blending requirement for coal-derived fuels at 21 \nbillion gallons for the year 2022. Is it possible? Absolutely. \nUnfortunately, this amendment failed by one vote, and so it wasn't \nincluded in the bill.\n  The Gas PRICE Act addresses this vital issue by requiring the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to establish a demonstration to assess \nthe use of Fischer-Tropsch, diesel and jet fuel, as an emission control \nstrategy. Furthermore, it provides incentives to the Economic \nDevelopment Administration to build coal-to-liquid refineries and \ncommercial scale cellulosic ethanol refineries at BRAC sites and on \nIndian land.\n\n  These important steps will help jump-start an industry that will help \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign energy barons. Coal is our \nNation's most abundant source. As I mentioned earlier, we have more \nBtu's in my county in Wyoming alone than all of Saudi Arabia. Using \ncoal to produce diesel and jet fuel will take our energy security out \nof the hands of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and others who seek to harm \nour economic interests and put it back in the hands of American \ncitizens.\n  I am pleased Senator Inhofe has offered this important amendment. It \naddresses two areas in which the legislation could be improved, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this approach.\n  The two areas are to make it possible to actually expand the number \nof refineries in the United States, and there are places in the United \nStates where those can be built, and safely built. I also think there \ncan be some inventions, such as I mentioned with Big Horn Valve, that \nwill make the refining process much more capable and also \nenvironmentally better. But unless we can get rid of that single \nconstruction of refineries, we are going to have shortages of gas twice \na year immediately, and more often in the future. I do have a lot of \nconfidence that there can be not only coal to liquids, but coal to \nliquids with a little bit of invention can be done even better than \nother kinds.\n  We need to worry about the natural gas supply for this country. A lot \nof States are placing a huge emphasis on natural gas as the cleanest \nfuel, and it is. But there is only one State that is producing more \nnatural gas than in previous years, and that is the State of Wyoming. \nThat will not go on forever. If we use it to produce electricity, we \nare going to run out of natural gas. So those people across the country \nwho are using natural gas to heat their homes should be particularly \nconcerned.\n  I know one company was looking at having some peaking power for Rapid \nCity, SD, and they were going to do it with natural gas. But the board \nof directors, as they looked at it, found out that the time they needed \nthe peaking power was in the middle of winter when it was cold because \npeople there use some electricity to heat with. But what they \ndiscovered was that the amount of natural gas to provide peaking power \nin winter in Rapid City would be an equivalent amount of gas to what \nthe whole city of Rapid City uses to heat homes during that same cold \nspell.\n  A lot of natural gas has to be used if it is used to produce \nelectricity. We can invent better ways to do that. We can come up with \ncoal to liquids. We can increase our refineries. I hope we will find \nways to encourage that rather than discourage that if we are going to \ntruly have an energy policy.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, could the Chair give us the \nparliamentary situation this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently in a quorum call being \nequally divided between the two sides.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is my understanding now there is how \nmuch time remaining until the vote on the Inhofe amendment?\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is at 11:45. The Senator's side has \napproximately 30 minutes remaining. The Republican side has \napproximately 21 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to debate this Inhofe amendment \nand, in the strongest possible terms, make a few points to my \ncolleagues.\n  When you strip it all away, this amendment is a giveaway--a giveaway \nto energy companies at a time when they have never had it so good, at a \ntime when they have never made so much money. The CEOs are making $37 \nmillion a year; $16 million a year; Exxon, a $39 billion profit--\nbillion-dollar profit; Shell, a $25 billion profit; BP, a $22 billion \nprofit; Conoco-Phillips, $15.6 billion; and Chevron, over $17 billion. \nThe CEO, Lee Raymond, of ExxonMobile, received a $400 million severance \ngift. Let me repeat that. One man received a $400 million severance \ngift, and the Inhofe amendment wants to give these people more. The \nInhofe amendment wants to give these people more, even after, in the \n2005 Energy bill, they already got their streamlined provisions. They \nalready got what they needed.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what the Inhofe amendment does. It gives to \nthose who have, and it gives to energy companies free public land--\npublic land that belongs to the taxpayers of America. It gives them \npreference to get free public lands. Not only do they get the land \nfree, but in the case of Indian land, they get 110 percent of their \ncosts reimbursed to them. This is what we are doing in an Energy bill \nthat is supposed to be good to consumers.\n  The underlying bill has many provisions in it. All those provisions \nare good for the American people, including fuel economy for our cars, \nsolar energy on the building of the Department of Energy. We hope we \nwill have a modest model project at the Capitol powerplant showing that \nwe can, in fact, reduce the carbon emissions of coal. These are \nall bipartisan amendments.\n\n  Senator Inhofe tried to get a similar amendment to the one he is now \nproposing through the committee. When he controlled the gavel, he \ncouldn't even get it out of the committee then, let alone now. So it \ngives to the oil companies, when they were taken care of in the Energy \nbill of 2005.\n  I am going to tell my colleagues what we did for them in 2005. The \n2005 Energy bill has a provision, which is section 392, that allows \nStates to request EPA to work with them and enter into an agreement \nunder which EPA and the State will identify steps, including timelines \nto streamline the consideration of Federal and State environmental \npermits for a new refinery. Interestingly, even though this legislation \nexists, EPA said before my committee in October--actually, it was \nbefore Senator Inhofe's committee because he was chair at that time--\nthat no State had asked EPA to use that provision of the law. So they \ngot a streamlined procedure in 2005. They never took advantage of it. \nNow, Senator Inhofe is giving them more streamlining procedures, and he \nis exempting these energy companies from every single environmental law \nthat was signed into law by Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents.\n  Let me tell my colleagues the laws that are waived in the Inhofe \namendment. I say to the American people: Listen to this because if ever \nwe have unanimity about what is important to do for the health of our \npeople, it is when Republican and Democratic Members of the Congress \nand Presidents sign these laws and pass these laws: The Clean Air Act, \nthe Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Those are a few examples of Federal laws which are cast asunder by \nthis amendment. Who gets the benefit? Not the American Lung \nAssociation, which might, in fact, put in substantial precautions that \nthe air is clean, but they give it to the most polluting industries in \nAmerica: the refining and oil industries.\n  Senator Inhofe will say: Oh, we let the States pass these laws. We \nsay they have to pass substantially equivalent laws. That is not \ndefined. Why on Earth waive the laws that are the cornerstone of \nAmerica's environmental protection under both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents? Why waive those laws? Do you think that little of America's \nfamilies?\n  In my State, 9,900 people die every year from lung-related disease. \nAnd let's talk about some of the chemicals these refineries give off.\n  In 2005, refineries emitted over 68 million pounds of toxic \nchemicals, 3.8 million pounds of known cancer-causing substances, 2.5 \nmillion pounds of toxins that damage the reproductive system, and 6.8 \nmillion pounds of toxins that harm the development of children.\n  In California, communities that border refineries and chemical plants \nhave high concentrations of childhood asthma. We should be working to \nmake the air cleaner, not worse.\n  Let me review what I have said so far. This amendment has a name, and \nI am going to read you the name of this amendment. The title of this \namendment is the Gas Petroleum Refinery Improvement and Community \nEmpowerment Act. I ask, how is a community empowered by this amendment? \nThe idea is to allow these new energy plants to go on Federal land that \nhas been surplused. In California, we have had a lot of these lands, \nand, by the way, some of them have been redeveloped in the most \nwonderful way. Everybody is equal. There are no winners and losers. \nHere we are picking a winner, and the winner is one of the most \npolluting industries in America. They get the land free, and the \ncommunity is left without anything. The Federal Government gets no \nmoney. That was the idea behind the Surplus Federal Lands Act. The \nFederal Government should get some money from the private sector. Oh, \nno, they get the land free, these energy companies. That is because \nthey are hurting so much. They are hurting so much that we are going to \ngive them the land free.\n  On Indian land, they get back 110 percent of their investment, so \nthey actually make money without a penny of cost. Whoever votes for \nthis amendment is voting for a giveaway of taxpayers' dollars. Whoever \nvotes for this amendment is voting for an open-ended cost that isn't \neven stated in the bill.\n  Look at the last page of the bill, ``such funds as may be required.'' \nWe know some of these energy plants will cost $4 billion for one plant. \nLet's say there are 100 pieces of Federal land that could be \nredeveloped. You do the math. We are busting the budget. You think the \nIraq war costs a lot? Take a look at this. And who does the money go \nto? The same people who are charging us in California close to $4 a \ngallon for gas.\n  So you can stand up here and talk about it all you want, but the \nbottom line is, this is, in many ways, a socialistic bill, socialism: \ngive away land to big business, give them the cost of the building, in \nsome cases 110 percent reimbursement, waive all of the Clean Air Act, \nthe Clean Water Act that protects the health and safety of our people, \nand who are the most vulnerable? Our moms and dads, our grandmas and \ngrandpas, our children. Just ``Katy bar the door'' with the money. No \nproblem. Oh, it is as if we are somehow in the black today when we have \ndeep deficits today.\n  What an amendment to bring to the floor from my friend--my good \nfriend--Senator Inhofe. A similar amendment went down in the committee \nwhen he had the gavel.\n  I say it is economic blackmail for communities that are losing a \nmilitary base. It chooses an energy project over any other project they \nmight want. I say to my colleagues, if they look at what these refiners \nare making, how well they are doing, we don't need to give them any \nmore incentives.\n  I want to tell my colleagues a story about my State. Shell Oil owned \na refinery in Bakersfield, CA. We all supported that refinery. It made \n2 percent of the gasoline for the cars in California. Shell Oil \nannounced they were shutting down the refinery. We begged them not to \nshut it down. Here is what they said to us in writing: We are losing \nmoney, and we are shutting it down because we can't find a buyer.\n  Lies, those were lies. How do I know that? Because we were fortunate \nenough to have an attorney general of California, at that time it was \nBill Lokyer, who saw the books. The refinery was making a lot of money. \nWe believe Shell Oil wanted to shut it down because they wanted to \nsqueeze the supply--squeeze the supply. Guess what\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nelse. When we caught them on that, they said: Oh, we are sorry, we made \na mistake; we still can't sell the refinery.\n  We found buyers for the refinery. The attorney general made sure they \nadvertised. They sold that refinery, and that refinery is up and \nrunning.\n  So we are going to give away to refineries, to energy companies in \nthis bill--this amendment is all they could ever dream for. They don't \nhave to pay attention to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, or the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. If my colleagues vote for this amendment, they \nare voting to open the checkbook to hundreds and hundreds of billions \nof dollars. It could be as high as a trillion dollars. Who knows how \nmany of these people will take advantage of this opportunity.\n  What do we get? We get sick kids because this will waive all these \nenvironmental protections. And they are giving away to those who have.\n  I want to read again the amount of money some of these executives \nhave made. Valero Energy, the top executive in 2005, William Greehey, \ntook home $95.2 million. This is one person, folks--$95.2 million. \nOccidental Petroleum chief Irani took home $81 million in 2006. Oh, \nthese poor people. Their businesses aren't doing good enough. We have \nto give them more. We have to make life easier for them.\n  What about the people who pay at the pump? That is why the underlying \nbill is so good because it has Maria Cantwell's antigouging law. By the \nway, the President has said he doesn't like the antigouging law. He \nmight have to veto this entire bill. That shows you where people stand \naround here. Republicans want to give away to the oil companies, to the \nrefiners, to the energy companies, and take away clean air protections \nfrom the people, take away land from the taxpayers, taxpayers' money to \nfund these projects. Count me out, and I hope count out the vast \nmajority of the people here.\n\n  You can put any face on it. One thing that gets me is how the \nRepublican side is supposed to be so fiscally responsible. Let's look \nat the last page of this amendment. They will tell you now how much \nthey are going to pay for this bill. It is on the last page of this \namendment. Here it is: ``Subtitle E--Authorization of Appropriations. \nThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to \ncarry out this'' amendment.\n  What does that mean? I already told my colleagues it costs $4 billion \nto build one of these energy plants--just one. It is 100 percent \nFederal pay on Indian land plus 10 percent on top of it, and 88 percent \nis the minimum number on Federal land that is not Indian land. You get \nthe land, you get the cost back to build the plant, you get to waive \nall the environmental laws, and you get a streamlined process, which \nthey already have the ability to get under the 2005 Energy bill.\n  This is a big kiss to the oil companies and the energy companies. \nThis is a major hug. It would be better if we took this up on \nValentine's Day. Well, count me out. I hope there is a resounding \n``no.'' We don't know the cost. It is not told in this amendment. We \ndon't know the impact on the people. It certainly is not told in this \namendment. It picks winners and losers on Federal land. It doesn't \nprotect our people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that the time be equally divided on that quorum \ncall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. We are not in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to speak, if I may, to the \namendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe. It is \nimportant that in this whole debate on the bill that we talk about the \nsolutions that are important to this country's independence today on \nforeign energy and the need to get away from that and become energy \nindependent and lessen our dependence on foreign energy and that we \nalso talk about actions we can take that will lower energy costs for \npeople in this country.\n  I appreciate the fact that the underlying bill has a number of \nprovisions in it that are good. There are provisions in the bill I will \nbe supporting. I have a series of amendments I will be offering that \nwill improve the availability of renewable energy in this country.\n  I also wish to speak in support of amendment No. 1505 because I \nbelieve fundamentally it would greatly improve our Nation's stagnant \noil refining industry, boost the development of coal-to-liquid \ntechnology, and accelerate the development of the next generation of \nbiofuels.\n  As to the underlying amendment talked about by my colleague from \nCalifornia, first, there are no mandates in this bill. These are things \nthe State can do. They can opt into this. Obviously, the incentives in \nthis amendment do not go to oil companies, they go to State and local \ngovernments.\n  Frankly, this is an important point, that this is directed to areas \nthat have been affected by base closures and also Indian reservations, \nwhich in my State are desperately in need of economic development. This \nis the type of economic development that will fit very well in a lot of \nplaces in South Dakota that qualify.\n  It is important this amendment be adopted. It does address a critical \nneed in this country, and that is for more refinery capacity and the \nneed in a lot of places, areas affected by base closure and Indian \nreservations, for economic development.\n  There are a lot of items this amendment would accomplish. It is \nimportant to point out that over the past 30 years, the petroleum \nindustry has not added a single new oil refinery in the United States. \nThe American public, I think, would find it startling that the largest \npetroleum consumer in the world hasn't seen one new refinery in the \npast three decades, which has created a devastating bottleneck in the \ndelivery of transportation fuels to American consumers.\n  Fortunately, the Senate has an opportunity through this amendment to \naddress that issue which is squeezing very hard the wallets of hard-\nworking Americans across the country.\n  Amendment No. 1505, which is pending before the Senate, would enact \nimportant measures to boost domestic refining capacity and provide \ncertainty for the industry and the public.\n  First, the amendment would set deadlines for refinery permit \napproval. For too long, proposed refinery projects have met slow deaths \ndue to endless delays in the bureaucratic permit process.\n  Second, this amendment would provide States with much needed \ntechnical and financial resources to assist in refinery permitting. The \nprocess of refinery siting is time-consuming, complicated, and \nfinancially straining on State budgets that are already stretched thin.\n  This amendment also protects States rights by giving individual \nStates the opportunity, as I said earlier, to opt in to a refinery \npermitting program. Contrary to what the opponents are saying, there \nare no mandates in this legislation. Participating States can \nvoluntarily request the Environmental Protection Agency to coordinate \nall permits for construction or expansion of a refinery.\n  The importance of expanding refinery capacity to provide affordable \nand reliable supplies of transportation fuel cannot be overstated. I \nwant to show a chart of something that was printed in BusinessWeek on \nMay 3, 2007. This is what they said:\n\n       Because of high costs and a lack of public support, \n     refiners haven't built an entirely new plant since 1976. \n     While they have been expanding existing plants, the industry \n     isn't keeping pace with growing demand.\n\n  I would also like to show another chart of something that was printed \nrecently in the Wall Street Journal, and it said this:\n\n       The causes of higher gas prices include $65 per barrel oil \n     caused by rising global demand and geopolitical tensions; a \n     record high U.S. gasoline consumption of 380 million gallons \n     a day; and refined gasoline shortages caused by Congressional \n     rules and mandates.\n\n  Now, my constituents know this problem firsthand. Inadequate refining\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\ncapacity has a real impact at the local level, and I will give just a \nlittle anecdotal evidence here from South Dakota.\n  For the past month and a half, several key gasoline terminals in my \nhome State of South Dakota were literally out of gasoline for multiple \ndays at a time. Widespread outages were reportedly caused by limited \nsupplies due to refinery shutdowns and routine repairs in other parts \nof the country. The ripple effects of this gasoline supply disruption \nwere felt throughout the entire eastern part of my State. As the pipes \nran dry and terminals emptied, gasoline wholesalers were forced to \ntravel great distances and manage logistical bottlenecks at the few \npipeline terminals with available refined product. In the meantime, \ngasoline prices soared at the retail level across South Dakota, and \nconsumers in my State were forced to pay more at the pump.\n  The recent events in South Dakota are a prime example of the need to \nincrease refining capacity in the United States. These events also \nunderscore the need to move beyond petroleum for our transportation \nfuel needs.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Inhofe moves our country toward \ngreater energy independence by providing Economic Development \nAdministration grants for infrastructure improvements to accommodate \ncellulosic ethanol refineries at Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission sites and Indian lands.\n  As my fellow Senators are all well aware, the underlying bill \nincludes a renewable fuels standard of 36 billion gallons by the year \n2022. In order to meet this goal, we need to enact policies that \ndramatically increase the development and production of cellulosic \nethanol.\n  By providing EDA grants that support cellulosic ethanol production in \ncommunities in need of economic development, amendment 1505 provides \ntargeted rural and economic development and places our biofuels \nindustry on course to reach the strengthened renewable fuels standard.\n  In addition to the EDA grants for cellulosic ethanol refinery \ndevelopment, this amendment includes a first-of-its-kind provision that \nmay greatly enhance private sector investment in renewable fuels. This \namendment will begin to assess our Nation's renewable reserves of \nbiomass cellulosic ethanol feedstocks so that the public and energy \ncompanies have a realistic understanding of total U.S. renewable \nreserves. Energy companies' stock prices rise and fall depending on \ntheir declared proven reserves. This process, which has been in place \nsince 1978, provides tremendous incentives for exploration, investment, \nand development of new sources of traditional hydrocarbons.\n  This straightforward amendment builds upon these proven market \nincentives by directing the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nresearch and report to Congress on the establishment of a renewable \nreserves classification system for cellulosic biofuels feedstocks in \nthe United States.\n  The idea of a renewable reserves classification system was first \ndiscussed during an Agriculture Energy Subcommittee hearing I held in \nBrookings, SD, earlier this year. An expert witness from Ceres, Inc., \nan industry leader in the development of transgenic switchgrass seed \nfor cellulosic ethanol production, testified that a standard means for \nmeasuring renewable reserves on a per-barrel-of-oil basis would greatly \nincentivize private sector investment in the next generation of \nadvanced biofuels.\n\n  The President of Ceres, Inc., Richard Hamilton, describes the \nrenewable classification system as:\n\n       An independent metric by which energy companies, and the \n     market, may measure renewable reserves in barrel-of-oil \n     equivalents just as they measure proved reserves today.\n\n  He continues by stating:\n\n       A renewable reserves classification system could well be \n     the catalyst America's traditional providers of liquid \n     transportation fuels require to invest in cellulosic biofuels \n     technology and may be the Federal Government's least \n     expensive way to hurry the cellulosic biofuels industry to \n     maturity.\n\n  Certainly a proposal that could result in such a dramatic advancement \nin our biofuels industry is worthy of consideration by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and is certainly worthy for inclusion in a bill \nthat calls for a historic increase in renewable fuels production. If we \nare serious about advanced biofuels production, we must consider \neffective approaches, such as the amendment offered today by my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, that would boost the production of advanced \nbiofuels.\n  This amendment is important because, as I said earlier, it addresses \na critical problem and shortage that we have in America today; that is, \na lack of refinery capacity. We need more capacity. Now, frankly, it \nwould be great if the folks I represent in South Dakota could get to \ntheir destinations by walking or riding bikes. Unfortunately, we have \nlong distances to cover in my State. We have to drive automobiles, and \nwe have to use fuel to power our automobiles. When you have a refinery \nproblem like we have in America today, that limits the amount of \ngasoline that can be shipped through the pipeline to destinations in my \nState, and that drives the cost of gasoline higher and higher. Because \nof that shortage and because the wholesalers have to go to distant \nplaces to get it, it adds to the cost of our economy, and that affects \nthe day-in and day-out lives of the people in my State of South Dakota \nand across this country who have to get to their destinations, whether \nit is to work or whether it is travel for recreation. The reality is \nthat we cannot continue to abide $3.50 or $4 a gallon for gasoline, and \nwe need to address what is causing that problem.\n  As I said earlier, I will be offering a number of amendments that \nwill increase and advance the production of biofuels energy in this \ncountry because I believe so profoundly in its importance as part of \nour energy supply. But this particular amendment is critical as well \nbecause it addresses a fundamental problem that exists in America \ntoday; that is, a lack of capacity, refinery capacity, to make sure \nenough gasoline is making it to its destination, to places even as \nremote as South Dakota, so that the people who drive across my State \ncan have access to affordable fuel to make sure they can get to the \nplaces they need to get to, and that the lack of affordable fuel does \nnot choke our economy by continuing to force us to pay these exorbitant \nprices for gasoline.\n  So I support the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, amendment \nNo. 1505, and I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to do so as well. \nIt is important for a lot of reasons--because it brings economic \ndevelopment to areas that really need economic development, those areas \nwhich have been affected by base closures and Indian reservations--and \nbecause my State desperately needs that form of economic development \nand job creation. So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would inquire as to the time remaining \non both sides, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 9 minutes \nremaining, and the Democratic side has approximately 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would like to go ahead and be \nrecognized for a few minutes, and I would ask that the Chair stop me \nwhen there is 5 minutes remaining. I would like to remind the other \nside that our protocol or system is that the author of the amendment \nshould conclude debate, so I would like to have the last 5 minutes.\n  First of all, I look at this and I listen to the arguments from the \njunior Senator from California and I hear the same things over and over \nagain. Last night, we debated this at some length. Every time, she \nwould make a statement, and we would respond to the statement.\n  Let me just put a chart up here. I think it is important for people \nto realize there are some choices. We are not willing to add to \nrefinery capacity here in the United States. We have here the refining \ncapacity and the growth of that refining capacity from other countries. \nWe have Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and \nVenezuela. It is bad enough we are dependent upon foreign sources for \nour ability to run this machine we call America, but these are not the \nkinds of countries you want to depend on. I am sure Chavez is not real \nexcited about\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\nhelping us refine our oil into something that can be used for \ntransportation.\n  I would like to cover a couple of the things the junior Senator from \nCalifornia has said, and I know what is going to happen: As soon as I \ndo this, she will come back and say the same things over again, because \nwe have heard these same arguments.\n  First of all, she says it is a disastrous amendment because it is a \ntaxpayer giveaway to the oil companies; we don't have to give away the \nstore to the oil companies. Well, the fact is that no money goes to any \noil companies or, in fact, to any corporations in any way whatsoever. \nThe only funding of the bill is financial and technical resources to a \nState or tribal department of environmental quality or funds to an \neconomically distressed community affected by BRAC.\n  Let us keep in mind, when we talk about BRAC and Indian tribes, we \nhave a lot of BRAC sites, and I can remember Members standing on the \nfloor saying, during the base realignment and closure process: They are \ngoing to be closing some of the military installations in my State. \nWell, what is a logical thing you can do to replace the economic loss \nof a closed facility? It is to put--if we can encourage the local \ncommunity to do it--a refinery there. You don't have to clean it up to \nthe same standards you would have to clean it up otherwise. It is a \nlogical thing. So those people who want coal-to-liquids and commercial-\nscale cellulosic ethanol facilities can have them.\n  It does authorize the EPA to initiate a new emissions control \ndemonstration project, but it doesn't offer the oil companies anything.\n  The lack of sufficient refinery capacity in the United States is why \nwe are experiencing high prices today. I think it is inconceivable that \nany Member of this body would come in and deny us, the United States, \nthe right to expand our refinery capacity to do something about the \nsupply problem we have and then turn around and say: Well, we don't \nwant to be dependent on foreign countries for our ability to run this \nmachine called America.\n  In this bill, in the underlying Energy bill, without this amendment, \nwe don't really address the problem today. We talk about the future, \nand we talk about conservation. This is good, and we want to do this. \nWe talk about standards for automobiles and all that. But people in my \nState of Oklahoma want to do something about the $3 a gallon for \ngasoline right now that is there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With that, I retain the remainder of my time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding there will be \nequal time taken from each side in this case, so I would invite the \nmajority to come in and make their remarks and would appreciate it; \notherwise, I would be denied my opportunity to close debate on my \namendment.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that during the quorum call, \nthe time be taken from the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my role as a Senator, I will object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I understand what is customary; I am \njust saying that we are entitled to close debate.\n  Apparently, the Senator from California is not going to allow me to \nclose debate. So let me just say for a few minutes here that I was \ngoing to go through every argument the Senator from California has \nmade.\n  For example, first of all, I already did the first one where she \ntalks about subsidizing oil companies. No corporation in America is \nbeing subsidized by this. She said also, we don't want to become a \nChina, where they do not care about the people and how they suffer. We \ndon't want to go there. Politicians are prone to hyperbole, but the \njunior Senator from California has reached a new level. Nowhere in this \nbill or any other I would consider would I seek to make the United \nStates similar to China.\n\n  By the way, talking about China, one of the problems we are having \nright now is that while we do not have the refining capacity, they do. \nWhile we are not building generating plants, they are. While we have \ngone 15 years without adding a new coal-fired generating plant in the \nUnited States, China is cranking out one every 3 days.\n  The argument that was made was American families who want their \nhealth protected do not want us to waive every single environmental law \nthat protects the quality of the air they breathe inside their bodies. \nThey also do not want to waive any single environmental law. We are not \ndoing that. We are not waiving any environmental laws with this bill.\n  Let me tell you something that is serious. I warn people right now, \nthis is going to be considered to be maybe the most significant vote in \nthe 2008 elections. For people to say we do not want America to have \nrefining capacity when we have a bill that will allow them to have the \nrefining capacity and increase the supply--the old theory of supply and \ndemand still works--those people who will vote against this will \nforfeit your right to complain about the dependency on foreign oil. \nThis is going to be a major, maybe the major campaign issue of the 2008 \ncycle.\n  I suggest we spent a lot of time on this bill. We do not have any \nmoney going to oil companies. We do allow the EDA to help communities \nthat want to set up refineries in their communities.\n  Let's keep in mind, this is not just oil refineries. We are talking \nabout oil refineries but also cellulosic biomass refineries, we are \ntalking about coal-to-liquid refineries--all refineries to give us the \navailability of fuels for the transportation this country needs.\n  If we do not have that, the price of gas at the pump is going to \ncontinue to go up. I suggest this is going to be the critical vote, in \nterms of energy, for this entire legislative session. It is going to \ncome back to haunt a lot of people in 2008. I know the Democrats are \ngenerally much more disciplined than the Republicans are. They will say \nyou have to vote against this amendment, make up things such as you are \nhelping oil companies, which you are not. Whatever the case is, the \nbottom line is they are going to be taking away our ability to increase \nthe supply of gasoline to run our cars within America. This will be a \nmajor issue in the 2008 campaigns. I encourage people to do something \nabout this problem and to vote for the Inhofe amendment expanding our \nrefining capacity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to use 3 minutes \nfrom the time of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly against \nthe Inhofe amendment. I do believe there are several substantial \nproblems with it. First of all, the underlying assumption is that the \nreason we do not have enough refining capacity in this country is we \ncannot find places to put refineries. That is not the reality. We have \nhad various hearings in the Energy Committee. The companies that are \nengaged in refining oil into gasoline and other products are not short \nof places to put those refineries. They look at a whole variety of \nissues--the economics in particular--to determine whether to build new \nrefineries or expand refining capacity. It is not a failure to have a \nBRAC military base or a failure to have an Indian reservation they can \nput these on.\n  The other thing is location. They need to locate refineries where the \npipelines are. They need to locate refineries where the demand is. \nClearly, that is not contemplated as part of this as well.\n  Another part that concerns me greatly is the notion that we would be \nmaking grants to support these projects which exceed the cost of the \nprojects. That strikes me as very unusual. In the underlying bill, we \ndo have some lien programs, where the Government will step in and \nguarantee 80 percent of the loan that is required to build a project, \nfor example. We do not have anything similar to the provisions that are \nin this bill, which say the Federal share\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nfor an EDA grant, under this program, shall be 80 percent of the \nproject cost, assuming that the project is not on Indian land, and it \nwill be 100 percent of the project cost if it is on Indian land, and, \nby the way, there can be an additional award in connection with the \ngrant to the recipient of an additional 10 percent on top of that.\n  How it benefits the American taxpayer to pay 110 percent of the cost \nof one of these refineries I cannot see. So I think the amendment is \nflawed in several respects.\n  Obviously, we all want to see additional refining capacity built. I \nthink what we need to be sure of is that the regulatory regime in place \nis such that it encourages and provides an incentive for the companies \nthat are in the refining business to build that additional refining \ncapacity. It is not efficient to say we, the Federal Government, are \ngoing to finance 100 percent of a project to an Indian tribe and they \nare going to go into the refining business; or we, the Federal \nGovernment, are going to provide 80 percent plus 10 percent, or 88 \npercent of the cost to some kind of local municipality and they are \ngoing to go into the refining business. That is not going to happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of Senator Boxer's time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak against this amendment. \nI have been listening to the debate. While I think it is very important \nwe move forward in our country on a new energy policy and new \ndirection, I think we must do so in a safe, responsible way. That is, \nwhatever we are doing, we need to keep our environmental laws and \nprocesses in place: the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Safe \nWater Act, the Conservation Resource and Recovery Act--all the things \nthat are very important to our country and to our environment.\n  I think we are hearing a lot about refinery and refinery capacity. It \nreminds me of the electricity crisis we had in the West, starting in \n2000-2001, when everybody blamed it on the fact the environmental laws \nstopped the ability to produce supply. When all was said and done, we \nfound out it wasn't that; in fact, it was actually the manipulation of \nsupply. So I think it is very important we move forward on new refinery \ncapacity. In fact, in the last several years, there have been almost \n140, either built or in the process of being built, new ethanol \nrefineries. So they have had no trouble moving ahead, planning new \neconomic development, job creation, and alternative fuel that is going \nto help deliver competition at the pump for fossil fuel.\n  In my State, a new biodiesel facility was undertaken and has been in \nthe development stages. I think they will actually be producing and \nexporting that product sometime this year. They are going to produce \n100 million gallons of biodiesel in this next year--20 years, 12 \nmonths. That is more capacity of biodiesel than was produced in the \nwhole United States from a variety of sources.\n  This is a very aggressive effort of building alternative fuel \nrefineries. Let's be honest, God only gave the United States 3 percent \nof the world's oil reserves, so the notion that somehow we are going to \ndrill our way with fossil fuel to get off this foreign oil addiction is \nnot going to happen. But we do not have to throw out our environmental \nlaws to produce alternative fuel. We are in the process of doing \nalternative fuel.\n  If someone wants to meet all the environmental standards and build a \nnew fossil fuel refinery, I am not opposed to that, but I want people \nto be aware that this is what is at the heart of this amendment, to \nthrow out these environmental values that everybody else in America \nwants to live by if they want to have economic development. Why should \nthe oil industry receive this particular privilege of waiving \nenvironmental statutes, just to have that benefit?\n  Let's keep in mind that alternative fuels are making those \ncommitments, meeting those environmental standards, and have produced \n140--either underway today or in the process, through the permit \nprocess--to develop 140 new alternative fuel refineries. That is \nprogress in America and we should keep going. But we do not need this \namendment to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 6 minutes equally divided for \ndebate, with Senator Inhofe controlling the final 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was confused about the time. If I may \nmake a parliamentary inquiry before my time proceeds: I thought I had 9 \nminutes left on my side; is that not the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator now has 6 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have 6 minutes. OK. I hear you.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding there was a unanimous consent \nagreement giving us 6 minutes equally divided, myself having the last \n3; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an additional 3 minutes for each \nside.\n  Mrs. BOXER. An additional 3, so I would have 6, you would have 3.\n  Mr. President, yesterday Senator Inhofe repeatedly quoted Senator \nFeinstein in a way that suggested she supports his amendment. He kept \nreiterating a statement she made about streamlining which had nothing \nto do with this amendment.\n  Senator Feinstein has told me she opposes the Inhofe amendment. I \nthink it is important that I make that point.\n  All you have to do is look at the title of this amendment: The Gas \nPetroleum Refiner Improvement and Community Empowerment Act. You ask \nyourself: OK. What are we giving the gas petroleum refiners that they \ndo not have right now, that they did not get in the 2005 Energy bill, \nwhen they got all kinds of streamlining and everything they wanted and \nall kinds of money and all kinds of grants and the rest?\n  This is a giveaway to the people who are gouging us at the pump. That \nis the first point. Yes, life will improve for gas petroleum refiners, \nwho have it very good.\n  Now, let's take the second part, the Community Empowerment Act. Your \ncommunities and mine and the communities in Washington State and, \nfrankly, in Oklahoma and all over this country, I believe those \ncommunities will be hurt by this bill because it says there will be a \ngiveaway to energy companies, a giveaway of taxpayer-owned land, former \nBRAC land, former federally owned lands that are now in the BRAC \nprocedure.\n  A lot of communities want to sell these lands. They want to use these \nlands for economic development. They have plans for these lands, and \nyet this particular project of building an energy plant would take \nprecedence over local control. It is Federal control from Washington.\n  I call this a socialistic amendment. Why do I say it is a socialistic \namendment? It gives these big companies free land, and then it pays for \nthe building of their energy plants. Can you imagine this? I see the \nchairman of the Budget Committee coming on the floor. I want to tell \nhim one thing about this amendment because yesterday he talked to us \nDemocrats in the Democratic caucus. I hope he doesn't mind if I say he \nreally told us to use caution on these amendments.\n  What are they going to cost? Let me read to my friends the last line \nof this amendment: There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \nare necessary to carry out this title and the amendments made. Now, we \nfound out today, by asking the industry, how much one of those plants \nwill cost.\n  The plant on Indian land--I know my friend is interested in that--\nwould be reimbursed or given or paid for 110 percent of the cost of the \nplant in Federal tax dollars, $4 billion; the cheapest, $3 billion. \nThat is one plant, not paid for here.\n  So I call it a socialistic amendment. You get the Federal taxpayer \nland, and then you get Federal taxpayer money to build your plant. And, \nby the way, all big environmental laws are waived. How does that help a \ncommunity, Mr.\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nPresident? Picking a winner, telling them that priority has to be given \nto these sorts of plants, and, by the way, in case communities were \nconcerned that the quality of the air might go down because they are \nnear a refinery, this bill conveniently takes care of that problem by \nwaiving the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  They say States can pass equivalent laws. But there is no reason that \nwe should do that in America today. We have one Clean Air Act, we have \none Safe Drinking Water Act, we have one Clean Water Act, and there is \na reason: Water travels, air travels.\n  Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents alike decided--and it \nreally started under Richard Nixon--that we must protect the air and \nthe water. This act gives everything away that taxpayers have, \nincluding the protection of clean air, including their funding.\n  Now, this particular vote is very important for people who care about \nclean air and clean water. I assume we all do. We all talk about it. We \nall say it is important. In my home State I lose in excess of 9,000 \npeople every year because of particulate matter. I will not allow--I \nsay this with all humility; it is not a show of power--something to get \nthrough this Senate that would, in essence, make the air worse, the \ndrinking water worse. I cannot let this go while taking dollars out of \nthe pockets of hard-working Americans, to give to whom? The biggest \nenergy companies in the country.\n  Let me read to you what some of these companies made in the last \ncouple of years: Exxon, $39 billion; Shell, $25 billion; BP, $22 \nbillion; Chevron, $17 billion; ConocoPhillips, $15.6 billion.\n  Some of these companies earned 21 percent more than the year before, \nand, by the way, the year before that they earned 40 percent more.\n  Let's take a look at what some of the executives have earned. I would \nask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let's not give more to these people who are gouging us at \nthe pump. Vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand that we have 3 minutes \nremaining to close debate on my amendment.\n  I have a hard time keeping a straight face when the Senator from \nCalifornia suggests I have a socialistic amendment. I would invite \nanyone who is entertaining any kind of joy in that statement to look at \nour record over the past many years. It is just humorous.\n  We have gone through listening to the same thing over and over and \nover again. We went through this yesterday for hours at a time. The \nSenator from California talks about subsidizing oil companies. Again, \nnot one cent goes to any oil company. If we want to empower cities and \ncommunities to be able to take care of problems, maybe an economic \nproblem that is due to the fact that they had to close a military base \nduring the base realignment and closing process, we should be in a \nposition to help.\n  I never stated that Senator Feinstein--with endorsing this bill, she \nwill be a good Democrat and oppose it with her junior Senator. I will \nsay this. She said she recognizes we have a serious problem about \nhaving a refining capacity in this country, and about--I will just read \nit to you from her own press release: Today I urged Governor \nSchwarzenegger to help streamline the refining permit process in an \neffort to relieve gas prices in the State.\n  All right. She says we have to relieve gas prices by streamlining the \nprocess. That is exactly what happens in this amendment. We want that \nto happen. For anyone to suggest that there is anything in here that \nwould hurt the environment, here we have the Environmental Council \nof States--that is all States--saying there is nothing in here that \nwill hurt the environment. It will actually help the environment.\n\n  The Senator also said the Clean Air Act is going to be damaged, when, \nin fact, the underlying bill has language that would take the fuels \nsystem out from under the EPA and the Clean Air Act and put it in the \nPresident's power.\n  So we have all of these letters. Here is another one from Ceres, a \nbig company in California that is a company that needs to have refining \ncapacity. They do not touch oil. It is all cellulosic bioethanol. They \nwant to have this capacity.\n  So the environmentalists, many of them are very much for this. It is \na very strong bill. It goes right back to the initial argument of \nsupply and demand. We have got some good things in this bill that are \ncoming up. It is not affecting today's supply. All of the production in \nthe world is fine, but we are not going to be able to do anything with \nthat production unless we are able to refine it. That is exactly what \nwe are talking about now.\n  I honestly believe every argument the Senator from California has put \nup we have responded to over and over and over again. She keeps coming \nback with the same argument.\n  I believe anyone who votes against the Inhofe amendment to the Energy \nbill should forfeit their right to complain about the dependency on \nforeign oil between now and the next election. I will say this also. I \nam glad to say this on the Senate floor because this way you cannot say \nwe did not tell you. This is going to be one of the major issues in the \nupcoming 2008 election as to whether you want to increase our refining \ncapacity to lower the price of gas in the United States of America. \nThis is a chance to do it. I urge you to support the Inhofe amendment \nto the Energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCornyn and Senator Hutchinson be added as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1519\n\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on an amendment \nwhich has been filed, amendment No. 1519, which has an impressive list \nof sponsors: Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley, Senator \nBiden, Senator Coburn, Senator Feingold, Senator Snowe, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Lieberman, Senator Schumer, Senator Sanders, and \nmyself.\n  The thrust of this amendment is to make the OPEC nations--which have \nconspired to limit production--subject to our antitrust laws. What we \nhave, simply stated, are a group of oil-producing nations, that get \ntogether that make agreements to limit production. Inevitably, by \nlimiting the production of oil, and thereby limiting supply, the price \ngoes up. The limited supply of oil is the major contributing factor to \nhigh gasoline prices. It is high time we acted on this matter.\n  The Judiciary Committee has approved this legislation on four \noccasions, most recently on May 22 of this year. In the 109th Congress, \nthe legislation was passed out of the Judiciary Committee in which I \nwas the chair, and it was included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nbut it did not survive conference.\n  Senator Kohl and I and the other sponsors intend to ask for a \nrollcall vote, which I think a substantial number of Senators will vote \nfor the amendment. I hate to predict things in this body, but I think \nthe vote will be substantial, and I think that ought to carry very \nsubstantial weight in conference.\n  The facts on the current price of gasoline are very troublesome. The \nhigh price of oil drives up other prices. The statistics are worth \nnoting with particularity. The price of crude oil reached $65 a barrel \nyesterday. Americans are paying an average of $3.06 for a gallon of \ngasoline. Consumers are paying more for products because American \ncompanies are paying more to run their factories, which require the \nconsumption of energy. Consumers are also paying more for products they \nbuy that have been shipped by train or truck from somewhere else. Plane \nfares, bus tickets, cab fares often include significant fuel \nsurcharges.\n\n  Economists have estimates that for every $10 increase in the price of \noil, our economic growth falls by a half a percent. Our economy grew \nonly by 0.6 percent in the first quarter of this year--the slowest \ngrowth rate since 2002. I believe a fair amount of that lag in economic \ngrowth can be attributed to the high price of oil.\n  For decades, the OPEC members have conspired to manipulate oil prices \nthrough production quotas that limit the number of barrels sold. OPEC \nagain appears to be poised to manipulate oil prices by limiting supply.\n  The Secretary General of OPEC, Abdullah al-Badri, recently threatened \nto cut investment in new oil production in response to plans announced \nby the United States and other Western countries to use more biofuels. \nHe warned that cutting investment in new production would cause oil \nprices to ``go through the roof.''\n  Well, we do not have to tolerate threats of that sort. We have the \nwherewithal to deal with this issue in a constructive way through the \nantitrust laws.\n  Regrettably, the history of litigation in this field has allowed OPEC \nnations to avoid antitrust liability by asserting the doctrine of \nsovereign immunity. In the decision of International Association of \nMachinists v. OPEC, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia held that OPEC activity was ``governmental activity'' rather \nthan ``commercial activity'' and therefore was not subject to the U.S. \nantitrust laws.\n  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal, \nholding that the ``act of state'' doctrine precluded the court from \nexercising jurisdiction in the case. The ``act of state'' doctrine \nprecludes a federal court from hearing a case that requires it to rule \non the legality of the sovereign acts of a foreign nation.\n  Well, those rulings are matters which can be changed by legislation. \nThe legislation to make this change, I submit, is fundamental and very \nmuch in our national interest and ought to be undertaken.\n  The lawsuits would have to be initiated, under our proposed \nlegislation, by the Department of Justice. As a result, the \nAdministration would provide a check on when to initiate a suit, \navoiding diplomatic disputes. But it is a fact we have deferred too \nlong to the practices of Saudi Arabia and practices of the OPEC oil \nnations out of fear of retribution, and we ought not to kowtow to them \nanymore.\n  The possibility of subjecting the OPEC nations to antitrust liability \nhas long been an interest of mine. I wrote to President Clinton on \nApril 11, 2000, urging the administration to file suit in the Federal \ncourt under the antitrust laws in an effort to overturn the previous \ndecisions, which I think were wrongly decided.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, then I wrote to President Bush on April \n25, 2001, with a similar request, that litigation be initiated by the \nadministration to hold OPEC nations liable under the antitrust laws.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the text of that letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have the authority to change the laws. We have a \nresponsibility to protect American consumers from these predatory \npractices, from these conspiracies in restraint of trade, these \ncartels. I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the legislation.\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\n  As I noted earlier, the amendment will be formally offered tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair, yield back the remainder of my time, and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2000.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the very serious problems \n     caused by the recent increase in oil prices, we know you will \n     share our view that we should explore every possible \n     alternative to stop OPEC and other oil-producing states from \n     entering into agreements to restrict oil production in order \n     to drive up the price of oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some considerable research, we suggest that serious \n     consideration be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC \n     and the nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based, perhaps, upon an advisory opinion under ``the \n     general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,'' \n     which includes prohibiting oil cartels from conspiring to \n     limit production and raise prices.\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       A case can be made that your Administration can sue OPEC in \n     Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. OPEC is \n     clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' in \n     violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration should consider suing OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a major \n     consumer of petroleum products and must now pay higher prices \n     for these products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp, 442 U.S. 330 \n     (1979), the Supreme Court held that the consumers who were \n     direct purchasers of certain hearing aides who alleged that \n     collusion among manufacturers had led to an increase in \n     prices had standing to sue those manufacturers under the \n     Clayton Act since ``a consumer deprived of money by reason of \n     allegedly anticompetitive conduct is injured in `property' \n     within the meaning of [the Clayton Act].'' Indirect \n     purchasers would appear to be precluded from suit, even in a \n     class action, under Illinois Brick v. Illinois 431 U.S. 720 \n     (1977), but this would not bar the United States Government, \n     as a direct purchaser, from having the requisite standing.\n       One potential obstacle to such a suit is whether the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides OPEC, a \n     group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity from suit \n     in U.S. courts. To date, there has been a ruling on this \n     issue in only one case. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the District \n     Court for the Central District of California held that the \n     nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in the \n     United States under the FSIA. We believe that this opinion \n     was wrongly decided and that other district courts, including \n     the D.C. District, can and should revisit the issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964):\n       It should be apparent that the greater the degree of \n     codification or consensus concerning a particular area of \n     international law, the more appropriate it is for the \n     judiciary to render decisions regarding it, since the courts \n     can then focus on the application of an agreed principle to \n     circumstances of fact rather than on the sensitive task of \n     establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national \n     interest or with international justice.\n       Since the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990's have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international \n     courts and tribunals. In addition, there is strong \n     evidence of an emerging consensus in international law \n     that price fixing by cartels violates such international \n     norms. Accordingly, a court choosing to apply the act of \n     state doctrine to a dispute with OPEC today may very well \n     reach a different conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached \n     almost twenty years ago.\n       You should also examine whether the anticompetitive conduct \n     of the international oil cartel is being effectuated by \n     private companies who are subject to the enforcement of U.S. \n     antitrust laws (for example, former state oil companies that \n     have now been privatized) rather than sovereign foreign \n     states. If such private oil companies are determined to in \n     fact be participating in the anticompetitive conduct of the \n     oil cartel, then we would urge that these companies be named \n     as defendants in an antitrust lawsuit in addition to the OPEC \n     members.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations,'' which includes prohibiting oil \n     cartels from conspiring to limit production and raise prices.\n       In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing a case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     U.N. Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction. In a number of \n     contexts, we have seen a greater respect for and adherence to \n     fundamental international principles and norms by the world \n     community. For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each of \n     these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights. For example, \n     as of December 1, 1999 the Yugoslavia tribunal alone had \n     handed down 91 public indictments.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. Recently, the exiled former dictator of Chad, \n     Hissene Habre, was indicted in Senegal on charges of torture \n     and barbarity stemming from his reign, where he allegedly \n     killed and tortured thousands. This case is similar to the \n     case brought against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet \n     by Spain on the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At \n     the request of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained \n     in London for months until an English court determined that \n     he was too ill to stand trial.\n       The emerging scope of international law was demonstrated in \n     an advisory opinion sought by the U.N. General Assembly in \n     1996 to declare illegal the use or threat to use nuclear \n     weapons. Such an issue would ordinarily be thought beyond the \n     scope of a judicial determination given the doctrines of \n     national sovereignty and the importance of nuclear weapons to \n     the defense of many nations. The ICJ ultimately ruled eight \n     to seven, however, that the use or threat to use nuclear \n     weapons ``would generally be contrary to the rules of \n     international law applicable in armed conflict, and in \n     particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law.'' \n     The fact that this issue was subject to a decision by the \n     ICJ, shows the rapidly expanding horizons of international \n     law.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus more on human rights than on economic \n     principles, there is one economic issue on which an \n     international consensus has emerged in recent years--the \n     illegitimacy of price fixing by cartels. For example, on \n     April 27, 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development issued an official ``Recommendation'' that all \n     twenty-nine member nations ``ensure that their competition \n     laws effectively halt and deter hard core cartels.'' The \n     recommendation defines ``hard core cartels'' as those which, \n     among other things, fix prices or establish output \n     restriction quotas. The Recommendation further instructs \n     member countries ``to cooperate with each other in enforcing \n     their laws against such cartels.''\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n       On October 9, 1998, eleven Western Hemisphere countries \n     held the first ``Antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all eleven \n     participants issued a joint communique in which they express \n     their intention ``to affirm their commitment to effective \n     enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly in \n     combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocation.'' The communique further expresses the intention \n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.'' One of the countries \n     participating in this communique, Venezuela, is a member of \n     OPEC.\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way. Consideration of such legal \n     action could provide an inducement to OPEC and other oil-\n     producing countries to raise production to head off such \n     litigation.\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Mike DeWine.\n     Strom Thurmond.\n     Joe Biden.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2001.\n     President George Walker Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the energy crisis and the \n     high prices of OPEC oil, we know you will share our view that \n     we must explore every possible alternative to stop OPEC and \n     other oil-producing states from entering into agreements to \n     restrict oil production in order to drive up the price of \n     oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some research, we suggest that serious consideration \n     be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC and the \n     nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.''\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       A strong case can be made that your Administration can sue \n     OPEC in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. OPEC \n     is clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' \n     in violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration has the power to sue OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a consumer of \n     petroleum products and must now pay higher prices for these \n     products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp, 442 U.S. 330 (1979), \n     the Supreme Court held that the consumers of certain hearing \n     aides who alleged that collusion among manufacturers had led \n     to an increase in prices had standing to sue those \n     manufacturers under the Clayton Act since ``a consumer \n     deprived of money by reason of allegedly anticompetitive \n     conduct is injured in `property' within the meaning of [the \n     Clayton Act].''\n       One issue that would be raised by such a suit is whether \n     the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides \n     OPEC, a group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity \n     from suit in U.S. courts. To date, only one Federal court, \n     the District Court for the Central District of California, \n     has reviewed this issue. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp 553 (1979), the Court held \n     that the nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in \n     the United States under the FSIA. We believe that this \n     opinion was wrongly decided and that other district courts, \n     including the D.C. District, can and should revisit the \n     issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco National de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964):\n       It should be apparent that the greater the degree of \n     codification or consensus concerning a particular area of \n     international law, the more appropriate it is for the \n     judiciary to render decisions regarding it, since the courts \n     can then focus on the application of an agreed principle to \n     circumstances of fact rather than on the sensitive task of \n     establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national \n     interest or with international justice.\n       Since the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990's have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international courts \n     and tribunals. In addition, there is strong evidence of an \n     emerging consensus in international law that price fixing by \n     cartels violates such international norms. Accordingly, a \n     court choosing to apply the act of state doctrine to a \n     dispute with OPEC today may very well reach a different \n     conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached almost twenty \n     years ago.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.''\n       In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     U.N. Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction. In a number of \n     contexts, we have seen a greater respect for and adherence to \n     fundamental international principles and norms by the world \n     community. For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each of \n     these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. The exiled former dictator of Chad, Hissene Habre, \n     was indicted in Senegal on charges of torture and barbarity \n     stemming from his reign, where he allegedly killed and \n     tortured thousands. This case is similar to the case brought \n     against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet by Spain on \n     the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At the request \n     of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained in London \n     for months until an English court determined that he was too \n     ill to stand trial.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus more on human rights than on economic \n     principles, there is one economic issue on which an \n     international consensus has emerged in recent years--the \n     illegitimacy of price fixing by cartels. For example, on \n     April 27, 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development issued an official ``Recommendation'' that all \n     twenty-nine member nations ``ensure that their competition \n     laws effectively halt and deter hard core cartels.'' The \n     recommendation defines ``hard core cartels'' as those which, \n     among other things, fix prices or establish output \n     restriction quotas. The Recommendation further instructs \n     member countries ``to cooperate with each other in enforcing \n     their laws against such cartels.''\n       On October 9, 1998, eleven Western Hemisphere countries \n     held the first ``Antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all eleven \n     participants issued a joint communique in which they express \n     their intention ``to affirm their commitment to effective \n     enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly in \n     combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocation.'' The communique further expresses the intention\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.''\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way.\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Strom Thurmond.\n     Mike DeWine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, energy is the lifeblood of our economy. It \nis fundamental to powering our homes, businesses, manufacturing, and \nthe transportation of goods and services that are vital to America and \nthe world economy. But the fossil fuels our country currently relies on \nare unsustainable. Our Nation's addiction to oil is threatening our \nnational security and dramatically changing the climate in which we \nlive.\n  Setting America on a course of greater energy self-reliance is one of \nthe most significant foreign policy, economic, and environmental \nchallenges we face as a Nation.\n  Senators Bingaman, Domenici, Inouye, and Stevens have put a great \ndeal of effort in developing this Energy bill, and it is an excellent \nfirst step. The bill will improve our Nation's energy efficiency, \nprotect consumers from price gouging, increase vehicle economy \nstandards, and decrease our reliance on oil, especially from unstable \nregions of the world.\n  President Bush admitted we are addicted to oil. But for the last 6 \nyears, neither he nor the Congress was willing to take real action to \nchange that fact. I commend Senator Harry Reid for bringing this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  For the first time in 30 years, the Senate is now poised to pass \nlegislation to increase vehicle fuel standards. I commend particularly \nSenators Feinstein and Durbin and Snowe for their work on this issue. I \nwas glad to be an original cosponsor of the ten-in-ten bill, which is \nthe basis of the bipartisan compromise in the legislation we are \nconsidering today.\n  The debate about fuel economy standards should be over. We have the \ntechnology to get well beyond 35 miles per gallon, and the American \npublic supports an increase in fuel efficiency standards. The time for \naction is long overdue, and I hope my colleagues will resist efforts to \nweaken these standards.\n  We have an opportunity to create a new energy future for the country. \nThat future would strengthen our national security by making us more \nself-reliant and slow the impacts of global warming on our climate by \ninvesting in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and biofuels. I do \nnot believe we can drill or mine our way to energy independence. \nIncreasing the importation of foreign oil and natural gas is not the \nanswer. Developing more nuclear power, given its price, legacy, cost, \nand safety threats, remains very problematic. Investing in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy is a win-win situation. These \ninvestments offer short-term and long-term solutions to strengthen our \nnational security by reducing our energy consumption and making us less \nreliant on oil from unstable regions of the world. It enhances our \neconomic competitiveness by creating American jobs in this new green \neconomy, and it will protect our environment by reducing our carbon \nfootprint.\n  Sixty percent of the oil consumed by Americans comes from abroad. \nWhile Canada and Mexico are our top suppliers, OPEC nations hold the \ncards in a global oil market, and a portion of the money we spend on \noil undoubtedly finds its way into the hands of unstable and unfriendly \nregimes. Two-thirds of the global oil reserves are in the Middle East, \nand more than 75 percent of global oil production is already in the \nhands of state-controlled oil companies. With growing global demand and \nlimited remaining oil supply, many countries, including our allies and \ntrading partners, will compete with us for finite oil supplies as their \nand our own economy rely more heavily on imports. This will inevitably \nstress the delicate balance that exists among national interests in the \nworld, and it gives oil-rich nations disproportionate leverage in the \ninternational arena. Al-Qaida and other terrorist networks have openly \ncalled for and carried out attacks on oil infrastructure because they \nknow oil is the economic lifeline of industrial economies, especially \nthe United States.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to shift the balance of power around \nthe globe that is dictated by oil. Our first step is to strengthen our \nnational security by increasing CAFE standards.\n  Raising fuel economy standards is an essential insurance policy \nagainst the risk of oil dependence and global warming, which pose vital \nthreats to our national security. Fuel economy standards have proven \neffective at reducing our demand for oil, but they have been stagnant \nfor more than a decade, despite advances in vehicle technology. The \nfact that our industrial competitors are increasing mileage standards \nunderscores how we have been lagging behind the world economy in terms \nof technology, in terms of applying that technology through increasing \nthe standards for automobiles in our country. Achieving a 35-mile-per-\ngallon fuel economy over the next decade, the equivalent of the 4-\npercent-a-year improvement called for by President Bush, is achievable. \nBeginning in 2011, this bill requires the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration to annually increase the nationwide average fleet \nfuel economy standards for cars and light trucks to achieve a standard \nof 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020. By 2020, the bill would reduce \nour Nation's oil dependence by approximately 1.3 million barrels per \nday, and in that year alone will save consumers $26 billion, and global \nwarming emissions will be reduced by over 200 million metric tons. \nThese savings will continue to increase each year, year after year.\n  This is the best investment we can have, I believe, in both national \nsecurity and improved environmental quality, not just for us but for \nthe world.\n  Strong mileage standards will also make us more competitive. \nAccording to the University of Michigan Transportation Research \nInstitute, U.S. automakers could increase revenues by $2 billion and \nsave between 15,000 and 35,000 jobs for autoworkers if we improve gas \nmileage. Higher fuel efficiency standards will help U.S. automobile \nmanufacturers to better compete in the global marketplaces. The \npricetag of our oil dependence is also not sustainable. According to a \nDepartment of Defense report:\n\n       The United States bears many costs associated with the \n     stability of the global oil market and infrastructure. The \n     cost--\n\n  According to this report--\n\n     of securing Persian Gulf sources alone comes to $44.4 billion \n     annually for the United States.\n\n  We are literally policing the world oil market for the benefit of the \nworld economy, with great cost in terms of dollars but also in terms of \nthe huge pressure on our military forces and their families.\n  We lose $25 billion from our economy every month, and oil imports now \naccount for nearly a third of the national trade deficit because of our \ndependence on oil. The economy is exposed to oil price shocks and \nsupply disruptions, and families are feeling the pinch of oil prices. \nHigh energy prices reduce consumer spending power and affect \nbusinesses' bottom lines.\n  Millions of petrodollars are being exported out of U.S. cities and \ncounties to pay for energy with a real effect on local economic \nvitality. In Rhode Island, my home State, gas prices have increased by \n$1.50 per gallon, an increase of 99 percent, since 2001. Households in \nRhode Island are paying $1,430 more per year for gasoline than in 2001. \nSo for the State economy, this means that families, businesses, and \nfarmers in Rhode Island will spend $52.4 million more on gasoline in \nJune 2007 than they spent in January 2001, and $600 million more will \nbe spent on gasoline this year than was spent in 2001, if prices remain \nat current levels. Rhode Island residents, farmers, and businesses are \non track to pay $1.2 billion for gasoline this year. That is an \nextraordinary drain on the economy of my State and on States throughout \nthis great Nation.\n\n  If we have a policy that increases CAFE standards and energy \nefficiency and makes sensible investments in renewable fuels, we will \nhave more funds\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nto invest in education, health care, public works, and business \ndevelopment. My State, like so many States, is struggling with a budget \nproblem, a huge State budget problem. Some of that can be attributed \ndirectly to the higher cost of fuels to run schools, to run buses, to \nrun the infrastructure of our State. We could take that money, save it, \nand invest it in education, in schools, and not simply ship it overseas \nthrough major international oil companies.\n  Energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that improve \ntechnologies for our homes, our businesses, and our vehicles must be \nthe ``first fuel'' in the race for secure, affordable, and clean \nenergy. Energy efficiency is the Nation's greatest energy resource. We \nnow save more energy each year from energy efficiency than we get from \nany single energy source, including oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear \npower. We need to use energy in a way that saves money. It is much \ncheaper to conserve energy and increase efficiency than to build \nfurther energy infrastructure in the country.\n  The Senate bill contains important provisions to support energy \nefficiency. First, it sets new energy benchmarks for appliances, \nincluding residential boilers, dishwashers, clothes washers, \nrefrigerators, dehumidifiers, and electric motors. These seem like very \nmundane, trivial items, but if we can make even small increases in \ntheir efficiency, it has a huge macroeconomic effect on our society in \nterms of demand for energy, and this legislation will help us do that \nand point us in that direction. According to the American Council for \nan Energy Efficient Economy, increasing these standards will give \nconsumers more than $12 billion in benefits, save more than 50 billion \nkilowatt-hours per year in electricity, or enough to power 4.8 million \ntypical American households. The bill also strengthens energy \nrequirements for the Federal Government. Today, the Federal Government \nspends more than $14 billion a year on energy. Increasing efficiency \nwill save energy and taxpayer dollars. That is something we have to \nbegin ourselves, leading by example at the Federal level.\n  The bill also increases the authorization level for the \nWeatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. The \nState Energy Program improves the energy efficiency of schools, \nhospitals, small businesses, farms, and industries to make our economy \nmore efficient.\n  The Weatherization Assistance Program helps low-income families, the \nelderly, and the disabled by improving energy efficiency of low-income \nhousing. Weatherization can cut energy bills by 20 to 40 percent in \neach assisted home. This represents savings that families can use to \npay for other necessities, while reducing the Nation's energy demand by \nthe equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil each year. It lowers our \nnational demand for energy, helps individual families, which is another \nwin-win program we must support more vigorously.\n  The program weatherizes approximately 100,000 homes each year. Since \nits inception, the program has weatherized over 5.6 million homes. \nWeatherization has also grown an energy efficiency industry for \nresidential housing that, according to the Department of Energy, \nemploys 8,000 people who work in low-income weatherization alone. This \nhas been a great success. Again, lowering the cost to families, \nlowering the national demand, and putting people to work is a good \nformula for our economy today.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2007 spending \nplan cut funding to the weatherization program, and the administration, \nunfortunately, has a situation in which efficiency funding has fallen \nalarmingly since 2002. Adjusting for inflation, funding for energy \nefficiency has been cut by one-third. We have to do better. In the face \nof soaring prices, in the face of international threats posed by oil \npowers, we are cutting programs that are efficient, effective, and help \nfamilies, and that is not only wrong, but it is terribly wrongheaded.\n  A strong renewable electricity standard is also needed to diversify \nour fuel supply, clean our air, and better protect our consumers from \nelectricity price shocks. I am glad to join Senator Bingaman in \nsupporting an amendment to the bill to require a 15-percent renewable \nelectricity standard by 2020. This amendment will promote domestically \nproduced clean energy, reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, reduce \nenergy costs for American consumers and businesses, and create American \njobs.\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a 15-percent RES \nwould save the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors $16.3 \nbillion in electricity and natural gas costs. These savings are \nparticularly critical for energy-intensive industries such as \nmanufacturing. The RES will also create jobs in manufacturing. A recent \nstudy by the Apollo Alliance and the Urban Habitat found that renewable \nelectricity creates American manufacturing, construction, and \nmaintenance jobs. For every megawatt of solar photovoltaic electricity \ngenerated, about 22 jobs are created, which is their projection. \nGeothermal energy creates 10.5 jobs per megawatt, and wind energy \ncreates 6.4 jobs per megawatt. American energy-intensive industries \nthat are saving $5 billion through 2023 will be more competitive in the \nglobal market. Using clean, domestically produced power will also help \nstabilize prices, allowing businesses to more accurately budget for \nenergy costs. This RES, the proposal of Senator Bingaman, will also \nlower U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 2 million tons per year \nby 2020.\n  Finally, the RES is important to our national security. In July 2006, \nthe National Security Task Force on Energy published a report \nrecommending several measures to improve energy security in the 21st \ncentury, including a national RES of 10 to 25 percent. Consumption of \nnatural gas is growing at a faster rate than for any other primary \nenergy source, and it is growing in all sectors of the economy. \nFamilies heat their homes with natural gas, businesses use natural gas \nto produce products, natural gas vehicles are becoming more common, and \npower producers generate cleaner energy with natural gas. Similar to \noil, demand is growing faster than available supplies can be delivered, \nand the tightening in supply and demand is resulting in dramatic price \nvolatility. One way to increase the natural gas supply in the United \nStates is through liquefied natural gas, known as LNG. Again, however, \nwe would do well to learn from our lessons with oil. One-third of the \nworld's proven reserves of natural gas are in the Middle East, nearly \ntwo-fifths are in Russia and its former satellites, and Nigeria and \nAlgeria also have significant reserves.\n  Political stability and terrorism are very real threats to these \ncountries being a reliable source for natural gas. Russia is trying to \ncreate an OPEC-style cartel for natural gas, which could manipulate \nnatural gas prices and supply, and that would be a very unfortunate \ndevelopment.\n  For over 30 years, through four different administrations, Americans \nhave been promised that our Government would end the national security \nthreat created by our dependence on foreign oil. As a country, we need \nto move in a new direction toward a clean and secure energy future. \nThis effort must include greater investment in energy efficiency, a \nstrong renewable electricity standard, and increased vehicle fuel \neconomy standards. Also, as we dramatically increase biofuel \nproduction, we must ensure that it does not cause harm to the \nenvironment and public health.\n  Energy security starts with using the fuels we have more efficiently. \nSmart energy use is a resource not vulnerable to terrorism or world \npolitics, and I think this legislation is a step forward for smart \nenergy use. I commend Chairman Bingaman for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to say a word this morning about a \ncolumn that was printed in the Washington Post this morning on the op-\ned page that was taking the majority leader of the Senate to task, and \ndoing so, I think, unfairly and certainly inaccurately.\n  The column criticizes the majority leader for saying the Senate's \ntime was ``too precious'' to expend on what would have been unlimited \ndebate on an unlimited number of Republican amendments to the \nimmigration bill.\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nThe intent of this column in the newspaper is to say that the majority \nleader was responsible for failing to allow consideration of the \nimmigration bill.\n  I don't know what Mr. Will, who wrote this column, was watching last \nweek. I know Paris Hilton was being taken back and forth between her \nhouse and the sheriff's office and court and jail, apparently, and the \ncountry must have been riveted on that story. But C-SPAN would have \navailed a columnist of a pretty good look at what the Senate was doing, \nand not just for last week but for 2 weeks the Senate dealt with the \nsubject of immigration.\n  I happen to come to a different conclusion on that subject than the \nmajority leader. I know who supports that legislation, and he has \nsupported that legislation. I watched the last day of consideration \nwhen the majority leader came to the floor and offered a proposal where \neach side would get four amendments. That was objected to. He then \nproposed that each side would get three amendments. That was objected \nto. Each side would get two amendments. That was objected to.\n  I don't have the foggiest idea why Mr. Will would write a column \nsuggesting somehow the majority leader was responsible for that not \ngoing forward after 2 full weeks of debate and being blocked in every \ncircumstance of having additional amendments considered.\n  But what brought me to the Senate floor is not my support of \nconsideration or further consideration of the immigration bill, but the \ncharge that the majority leader was somehow responsible for scuttling \nit. That is not the case, No. 1. And, No. 2, Mr. Will says in his \ncolumn that, in fact, it was taken off the floor in order to bring up \nlegislation that would quintuple the mandated use of corn-based \nethanol, apparently upset about the fact that we have an energy bill on \nthe floor at this point that would dramatically increase the use of \nbiofuels, corn-based ethanol and also cellulosic and other approaches \nbecause we believe we need to find somehow, some way, some point, \nsomeday to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  Over 60 percent of the oil we use in this country we obtain from \ntroubled parts of the world overseas--60 percent of it and it is \ngrowing: the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, Venezuela, Iraq, and the list goes \non. If tomorrow, God forbid, somehow that source of oil would be shut \noff to our economy, this economy, this American economy would be flat \non its back. We need to become less dependent on foreign sources of \noil. We use 70 percent of the oil we bring into this country in our \nvehicles. We run them through the carburetors and fuel injectors of our \nvehicles.\n  We are doing a lot with this legislation. We haven't had an increase \nin the efficiency standards for vehicles for 25 years, and the auto \ncompanies, I know, object to that. They objected to seatbelts. They \nobjected to airbags. They have given us better cupholders. They have \ngiven us better music systems. They have given us keyless entry. But \nthey haven't in 25 years given us greater efficiency, and they should. \nThat is in the bill.\n  We also increase the supply of alternative energy with renewable \nfuels called the biofuels, ethanol, corn-based ethanol; yes, cellulosic \nethanol, yes. If Mr. Will and others think that is irrelevant, they \nmiss the point. This country doesn't have a choice. We must find a \nroute to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  One approach, in my judgment, is to make the vehicles more efficient. \nAnother approach is to produce renewable fuels. I was the author of the \nonly standard that exists for renewable fuels, a 7.5-billion-gallon-a-\nyear standard. We did that 2 years ago. I think we are at 7.5 billion \ngallons already. We were hoping to get there by 2012. Now we have a \nbill that will take us to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels. As a \nmeasurement, we use 145 billion gallons of fuel a year. We want to go \nto 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels that we can grow in our farm \nfields, among other things.\n\n  It is easy to write a column, I guess. If the ink is inexpensive, you \ncan say anything you want. This is not an accurate reflection of two \nthings. No. 1, it is not an accurate reflection of the immigration \nbill, and it is not an accurate reflection, in my judgment, of the \nmerits of biofuels to extend America's energy supply.\n  While I am up, I want to make one more point. There are others who \ntalked about the amendment I offered to the immigration bill suggesting \nthat somehow it would have been responsible for killing the bill. I \nwant to describe it very briefly.\n  The immigration bill was put together in a room by a group of people \nwho said: Here is what we think we should do to deal with immigration. \nThe proposal was put together in a room by some 14 Senators, which \nmeant that 86 others were not involved. So the product was brought to \nthe floor of the Senate, and we were told: If you have a different \nidea, the group of 14 are going to oppose it. That group of 14, or \nwhatever it was, creating a grand compromise, they had a responsibility \nto oppose anything that the rest of the 86 Members of the Senate \nbelieved could add to or improve the bill.\n  Among other things, the bill provided a temporary worker provision \nwhich said there are millions of people outside this country--400,000 a \nyear originally, 2 years on, 1 year back to their home country, 2 years \nback, 1 year back to their home country, 2 years back a third time. My \ncolleague from New Mexico reduced that to 200,000 a year. But it was \nultimately the same circumstance. It would have been a massive number \nof new people who don't now live here who would have come in and taken \njobs in this country. I did not support that guest worker program. I \nbelieve at least we should sunset it after 5 years to evaluate the \nconsequences, what impact it has had on our country. Has it had an \nimpact of downward pressure on wages, which I think it will have, which \nI don't support? Has it had an impact of bringing in a lot of \nimmigrants who will not leave afterward and, therefore, be here without \nlegal authorization? If so, should we consider that issue and how to \ndeal with it?\n  I think these are very complicated issues, and the guest worker \nprogram should be sunsetted after 5 years. My amendment won by one \nvote, and then it was as if the sky was falling. This is going to kill \nthe bill, they say. I don't agree with that at all. I just don't agree.\n  As I have indicated many times, they brought that out here suggesting \nthat anything that was done that would change it would kill the bill. \nAgain, it is the argument we hear all the time: the lose thread on the \ncheap sweater; pull the thread, the arms fall off.\n  I come back to this point that I think the column today is unfair to \nthe majority leader. It unfairly suggests that he is the responsible \nparty for not moving forward on immigration. We spent 2 full weeks on \nimmigration. It wasn't incomplete because of anything the majority \nleader did. He is the one who brought it to the floor in the first \nplace.\n  Second, it is unfortunate--certainly well within the columnist's \nright, but unfortunate--to suggest that somehow renewable fuels cannot \nplay a significant part in this country's energy future. That is a \nsignificant part of this bill. Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, \nmyself, and many others have worked on renewable fuels for a long \nwhile. We set a standard that I think is going to be very exciting for \nthis country to meet, and I think it will reduce our dependence on \nforeign sources of oil, will make us much less dependent than we are \nnow, and I think it will advance this country's security and energy \ninterests.\n  I am pleased to be a part of that effort and support it and felt \nespecially that I ought to say a word in response to this column that I \nthink unfairly treats the issue of biofuels.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad pertaining to the introduction of S. 1605 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of bold action on \nenergy policy for this country. I am pleased and indebted to the \nchairman of the Energy Committee for his leadership. I think all of us \nknow our country faces serious energy challenges. The most pressing is \nthe fact that our Nation is far too dependent on foreign oil.\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n  For example, we currently import roughly 60 percent of the oil we \nconsume. You can see that in 2006, 60 percent of our oil came from \nimports; only 40 percent was domestic. Not only does this make us \nincreasingly dependent on the most unstable parts of the world, but it \nis also leading to a financial hemorrhage. It is leading us to spend \nhundreds of billions of dollars abroad that could otherwise be deployed \nhere at home.\n  Imported petroleum accounted for $272 billion of the U.S. trade \ndeficit over the last year, equal to 32 percent of our total trade \ndeficit--$272 billion that we spend in other countries that could have \nbeen spent here at home. Imagine the difference in this country's \neconomy if we were spending $270 billion in America securing energy \nhere instead of shipping it to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, \nNigeria, and all of the other countries from whom we buy foreign oil.\n  We know much of this oil is coming from the most unstable parts of \nthe world. That puts us at risk, not only at economic risk but at \nnational security risk. We must also recognize that other countries, \nespecially in the developing world, are going to consume growing \namounts of energy as well. In fact, the Energy Information \nAdministration projects world consumption of energy will increase 57 \npercent from 2004 to 2030.\n  This chart shows it well. This is the current consumption level. This \nis what they project by 2030--a 57-percent increase. This growth in \ndemand for energy will mean higher prices for energy, increased price \nvolatility in the markets for oil, natural gas, uranium, and coal as \ntransportation and refining networks are pushed to capacity. Unless we \nchange course, we will become even more dependent on foreign energy \nsources. In fact, we are told now that while we are 60 percent \ndependent, we are headed for 75 percent dependence if we fail to act. \nIn short, our addiction to foreign oil threatens our economic future \nand our national security. We need to take significant strides now to \ndevelop other sources of energy, ones we can rely on to be there in the \nfuture.\n  I have said many times to my colleagues, instead of continuing our \ndependence on the Middle East, we need to look to the Midwest for \nincreased energy supplies, because it is in the Midwest where we grow \nthe feedstocks for ethanol and biodiesel, things that reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Fortunately, the United States has the domestic resources and the \ningenuity to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and meet our energy \nchallenges. That is why I introduced the BOLD Act last year, Breaking \nOur Long-term Dependence. The BOLD Act would increase production of \nrenewable energy and alternatives fuels, offer incentives to reward \nfuel savings and energy efficiency, increase research and development \nfunding for new technologies, promote responsible development of \ndomestic fossil fuel resources, and facilitate expansion and upgrades \nto our Nation's electricity grid.\n  That is also one of the challenges facing us; we have gridlock on the \nenergy grid. When we produce additional energy in North Dakota, we \ncan't move it to the Chicago market because the capacity of the grid is \nfull--in Minnesota, in Wisconsin. So when we put on new capacity in \nNorth Dakota through wind power, for example, where we have \nextraordinary potential, we can't move it to the Chicago market where \nit is needed because the grid itself is gridlocked.\n  I am pleased the bill before us contains many of the provisions or \nsimilar provisions to what was in the BOLD Act I introduced last year. \nThe renewable fuels standard is an important step. My BOLD Act required \n30 billion gallons of renewable fuel use by 2025. This bill requires 36 \nbillion gallons by 2022. Renewable fuels have tremendous potential to \nreduce our imports. By relying more on domestic crops to produce \nethanol and biodiesel, we can reduce fuel prices, support economic \ndevelopment in rural areas, and improve our energy security.\n  This energy bill also takes steps to develop an infrastructure of \npipelines, rail lines, and trucks able to deliver increasing amounts of \nrenewable fuels to market. These steps will allow us to substitute \nhomegrown fuels for foreign oil, dramatically reducing our dependence \non imported oil.\n  Let me say that other countries have done this. Brazil is a perfect \nexample. You can see, in the green bars, that in 1973 we were 35 \npercent dependent on foreign oil. Today, we are 60 percent. Look at \nBrazil. Brazil, in 1973, was 80 percent dependent on foreign oil. They \nhave reduced that last year to 5 percent--a dramatic change. How have \nthey done it? They have done it by promoting ethanol and biodiesel and \nby promoting flexible fuel vehicles. That is a program for success.\n  Experts tell us the single most important thing we can do to reduce \nour reliance on foreign oil is to improve the efficiency of our cars \nand trucks. If our cars averaged 40 miles a gallon, we could save 2 to \n3 million barrels of oil a day. In the short term, we clearly need to \nincrease fuel efficiency. In the longer term, we need to develop \nalternative fuel technologies, such as plug-in hybrid and electric \ndrive vehicles. This bill helps advance a long-term solution to the \nproblem with research and development and demonstration programs for \nelectric drive transportation technology. The bill also includes loan \nguarantees for facilities for the manufacture of parts for fuel-\nefficient vehicles, including hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles.\n  We have abundant domestic sources of electricity, from a 250-year \nsupply of coal to rapidly developing renewable sources such as wind \nenergy. Let me say that my State is a leader in both. We have the \ngreatest wind energy potential in North Dakota of any State in the \nNation. I might add it is not because of our congressional delegation. \nNo, this is wind generated by a higher power.\n  I am glad I have been able to amuse the Chair.\n  North Dakota has those constant prevailing winds. Already, we have \nseen hundreds of millions of dollars invested in wind energy, but much \nmore could be done. And, of course, we have extraordinary deposits of \ncoal as well. By plugging into these sources of energy to fuel our \ntransportation sector, we can dramatically reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  This bill also establishes long overdue efficiency standards for \nconsumer appliances and industrial products, and promotes advanced \nlighting technologies that will cut down on a major source of our \nelectricity load.\n  Lastly, I am encouraged by the strong provisions in this bill to \nresearch, develop, and demonstrate our capacity to capture and store \ncarbon dioxide. The largest carbon sequestration project in the world \nis going on in North Dakota, where the coal gasification plant that is \nrun by Basin Electric--we call it the Dakota gasification plant--is \nshipping about half of the carbon dioxide it produces to Canada to \nrepressure the oil fields there. This is the largest carbon \nsequestration project in the world. We are proud of it. We are \ndemonstrating that this can be done, and that is a winner on every \ncount. It reduces carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and it repressures \noil fields in Canada to get more production so we are less reliant on \nmore unstable sources. This is crucial work if we are to find the best \nresponse to global climate change.\n  I look forward to taking up work in the Finance Committee next week \nto craft bold and thoughtful tax provisions to complement and expand \nupon the worthy objectives that are already in this bill. This bill \ntakes important steps to set us on a path toward energy independence. \nLet me say it will be many years before we reach that objective, but we \nmust act boldly now to take these initial steps.\n  I wish to especially commend and thank the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Bingaman, who has labored so hard and so long to \nproduce this legislation. Senator Bingaman has taken on some of the \ntoughest areas of energy policy. These are areas of real controversy, \nand he has taken them on with real leadership. We are proud of him.\n  Senator Bingaman, I thank you for the legislation you have brought to \nthe floor and for the effort you and your staff have put into this \nendeavor. It is important for our country. I believe, more broadly, it \nis important for the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota for his kind words and for his strong \nsupport for this legislation. He has been a leader on this whole set of \nenergy issues and proposed very strong legislation in the last Congress \non this very set of issues. We are hopefully moving ahead on some of \nthe policy recommendations and proposals he has made here in the Senate \nin the last year or two. I congratulate him on that and look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him.\n  We are now on what is called the renewable portfolio standard and the \nrenewable electricity standard amendment. This is an amendment I \noffered. Senator Domenici has now offered a second-degree amendment to \nit, which is really a substitute, which is really a very different \npiece of legislation than the amendment I offered.\n  I thought I would take a few minutes. I know Senator Domenici will be \nreturning to the floor here in a few minutes, and he will want to speak \non his proposed substitute amendment. I thought I would take a few \nminutes right now to describe the amendment I have offered on the \nrenewable portfolio standard.\n  In each of the last three Congresses, we passed a major energy bill \nin the Senate. In each of those energy bills, we have included a \nprovision to require that a certain percentage of the electricity sold \nby electric utilities throughout the Nation come from renewable energy \nsources. That is the nature of the amendment I am offering again today. \nThe Senate has approved this proposition again and again.\n  In the 107th Congress, we included such a portfolio standard. That is \nthe phrase which has been used historically to describe this amendment, \na portfolio standard. It is really an electricity standard or \nelectricity requirement on utilities. But in the 107th Congress, we \nincluded such a portfolio standard as part of the Energy bill, and \nstrong votes on the floor affirmed the Senate's determination that the \nstandard we proposed there should not be weakened.\n  In the 108th Congress, there was a letter signed by 53 Senators that \nwent to the chairs of the conference on the Energy bill. The Senate \nconferees went on to approve the portfolio standard and sent it on to \nthe House as part of our bill.\n  In the 109th Congress, the same thing happened.\n  In all three cases, the House conferees rejected the proposal that \nhad been passed by the Senate. Now we have an opportunity to renew our \nsupport for this proposal and to place it in a bill that hopefully can \ngarner strong bipartisan support and finally reach the President's \ndesk.\n  There are good reasons for the Senate to support this proposal. A \nstrong renewable portfolio standard is an essential component of any \ncomprehensive national energy policy. It is not just an important part \nof such a strategy but an essential component of such a strategy.\n  The benefits are clear. This portfolio standard would reduce our \ndependence on traditional polluting sources of electricity. It would \nreduce our dependence on foreign energy sources. It would reduce the \ngrowing pressure on natural gas as a fuel for the generation of \nelectricity. It would reduce the price of natural gas. It would create \nnew jobs. It would make a start on reducing our greenhouse gas \nemissions, and it would increase our energy security and enhance the \nreliability of the electricity grid. Those are some of the benefits.\n  Mr. President, I failed at the beginning of my comments to ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added as an original cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. This portfolio standard we have offered is a flexible, \nmarket-driven approach to achieving all of the goals I have enunciated \nhere and to do so at a negligible cost to consumers. The proposal would \nrequire retail sellers of electricity who sell more than 4 million \nmegawatt hours per year to provide 15 percent of that electricity from \nrenewable sources by the year 2020. The requirement would be ramped up. \nThere would be an increase in the requirement each year, in 3-year \nincrements to allow planning flexibility for those utilities.\n  The Secretary of Energy would be required to develop a system of \ncredit for renewable generation that could be traded or sold, again \nmaking the program easier to comply with. Utilities could use new or \nexisting generation to comply with the program or they could comply \nwith the program by buying credits from someone who has produced more \nrenewable energy than they were required to produce. New renewable \nproducers could receive the credits to trade or to sell.\n  Let me just summarize at this point and interject. The way we have \ndrafted this, the flexibility is that an electric utility can comply \nwith the requirement--the requirement being to ensure that 15 percent \nof the electricity they sell comes from renewable sources--in any of \nfour ways:\n\n  First, they can produce the electricity themselves. They could put in \na wind farm or a biomass facility or whatever and produce that energy \nfrom renewable sources themselves.\n  Second, they could buy that energy from someone else who is producing \nthat renewable energy.\n  Third, they could buy credits from someone who has produced more \nrenewable energy than they themselves are required to have in order to \nmeet their requirements under the law.\n  Fourth, there is a compliance fee that they could pay the Secretary \nof Energy if they are not able to do any of the previous three. That \nwould be at a rate of 2 cents per kilowatt-hour. So the cost of the \nprogram to utilities would be capped by allowing utilities to make this \nalternative compliance payment of 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is \nadjusted for inflation. As long as the difference between the cost of \nrenewable generation and the cost of other generation resources is less \nthan 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, the utility could buy or generate \nrenewables or buy credits in the open market. When it reaches or \nexceeds that 2-cent price, the cap would kick in.\n  We also would create a program from the alternative compliance \npayments so that, to the extent a utility chose to go ahead and just \npay the 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, those funds would go into a State \nprogram for development of renewable energy in that State.\n  Congress has tried before to spur the development of renewables. In \n1978, we passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. That bill \nrequired utilities to buy renewables if the generators could meet the \navoided cost of the utilities. Cogeneration--the combined use of heat \nand industrial processes for generation of electricity--was also \neligible. That program resulted in a huge growth in cogeneration. Over \nhalf of the new generation that came on line in this country during the \n1980s and the 1990s was from that resource. It did not, however, do \nmuch for renewable generation. These technologies have remained at \nabout 2 percent of total electricity supply for several decades now.\n  We have a chart here which makes that point. This chart depicts \nelectricity generation by fuel during the period 1970 projected through \n2025 in billions of kilowatt-hours.\n  You can see, from 1970 up to the current time, renewables is way down \ntoward the bottom. It is the second to the bottom line on that chart. \nThen it stays flat going forward, unless we pass this legislation. This \nlegislation is intended to change these lines on this chart. That is \nthe entire purpose of the legislation.\n  Critics of the program claim that the cost of this would be too much, \nthat States are already requiring development of renewables, and that \nsome areas do not have readily available renewable resources. My \nresponse is, I would point to a number of studies of this proposal that \nhave been done over the years.\n  In 2003, I asked the Energy Information Administration at the \nDepartment of Energy to look at the effect the proposed renewable \nstandard at that time would have had. They found that the standard \nwould result in 350 billion kilowatt-hours of renewable generation \nbeing constructed between 2008 and 2025; that is generation that would \nnot be constructed absent the passage of that provision. They found \nthat the cost would be minimal. The report indicated there would be an \nincrease in the cost of electricity by about one-tenth of a cent in \n2025 over projected costs. When combined with the reduction in natural \ngas prices which would\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\nbe caused by the renewable portfolio standard, the total aggregate cost \nto consumers on their energy bills was projected to be less than one-\ntwentieth of 1 percent.\n  In 2005, again I asked the Energy Information Administration to \nupdate the analysis, taking contemporary conditions into account. That \nupdate found that the portfolio standard we were proposing then would \ncause the prices of both electricity and natural gas to actually go \ndown, and the letter that outlines those results stated:\n\n       Cumulative residential expenses on electricity from 2005 to \n     2025 are $2.7 billion, that is 2/10th of a percent lower, \n     while cumulative residential expenditures on natural gas are \n     reduced by $2.9 billion, or one half of 1 percent. Cumulative \n     expenditures for natural gas and electricity by all end use \n     sectors taken together will decrease by $22.6, again, one-\n     half of 1 percent.\n\n  That report also indicates that generation of electricity from \nnatural gas would be 5 percent lower with the RPS than it would be \nwithout the RPS. It also projected that total electricity-sector \ncarbon-dioxide emissions would be reduced by 249 million metric tons \nrelative to the reference case.\n  This year, once again, I asked the Energy Information Administration \nto analyze the proposal we now have before the Senate. This analysis \nindicates that the renewable electricity standard or renewable \nportfolio standard would result in a tripling of generation from \nbiomass, a 50-percent increase in wind generation, and a 500-percent \nincrease in solar generation. The net expenditures for energy by \nconsumers are projected to increase by three-tenths of 1 percent, \nelectricity prices are projected to increase by nine-tenths of 1 \npercent, while natural gas prices are slated to fall.\n  The renewable electricity standard would also be expected to reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions by 6.7 percent, or 222 million metric tons in \n2030.\n  These projections are not as optimistic as those we got 2 years ago \nin the 2005 analysis. There are some different assumptions which they \nused which explain the different conclusions. The first assumption was \nthat the reference case projects a much greater expansion of coal \ngeneration than earlier projections. That was partly a result of the \nhigher natural gas price projected. Second, the study assumes tax \ncredits for renewables will, in fact, end next year, in 2008.\n  They are scheduled to expire next year. I think all or at least most \nMembers of the Senate believe we ought to extend those tax credits. I \nhope we do so as part of our amending of this bill on the Senate floor \nthis week and next week. I know the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley on the Finance Committee are working to develop a \npackage of tax extenders and provisions to expand the tax provisions \nthat are related to renewables.\n  Third, and perhaps most importantly, the study--this is the study the \nEnergy Information Administration did for us this year. The study does \nnot assume any controls on carbon emissions anytime in the next 13 \nyears. Frankly, I don't think that is a likely occurrence. I think this \nCongress and this Government is going to come to a responsible position \nwith regard to greenhouse gas emissions and there are going to be \nlimits on carbon emissions imposed in this country, as they have been \nimposed in many industrial countries around the world--the sooner the \nbetter, from my perspective. But certainly that is going to happen long \nbefore the end of the next 13 years.\n  The report acknowledges these assumptions but states that different \nassumptions would result in lower costs for the renewable electricity \nstandard. There is, of course, considerable uncertainty regarding the \nprojected baseline electricity mix. Actual implementation of future \npolicies to limit greenhouse gas emissions could lead to a larger role \nfor natural gas in the generation mix.\n  This is a quote from the report we received this year. It says:\n\n       In such a scenario----\n\n  That is where natural gas has a larger role in the generation mix----\n\n     the projected impact of the 15 percent renewable portfolio \n     standard proposal would move toward those identified in the \n     2005 analysis.\n\n  In the tax title that is being developed by the Finance Committee to \naccompany the bill, we are working to extend the production tax credit, \nto extend the investment tax credits that are available for renewables. \nWe are also going to do something, I believe, to try to encourage \nsequestering of carbon emissions.\n  I don't think anyone in this body believes Congress will fail to act \non this issue for the period of time that is built in for these \nassumptions. If we assume what we believe is going to happen, we are \nback with a projection of considerable consumer savings from the \nrenewable electricity standard, as we found in the 2005 report that \nthey did.\n  A recent report from Wood Mackenzie, which is a noted natural gas \nindustry analytic consulting firm, concluded that a 15-percent \nrenewable portfolio standard would result in a savings in variable \ncosts for electricity of $240 billion by 2026.\n  That is far more than offsetting the $134 billion increase in capital \nexpenditures. The study indicates that natural gas prices would be from \n16 to 23 percent lower in their projection by 2026 as a result of \nenactment of this provision. The study also projects that carbon \nemissions from the power sector would be 10 percent lower in 2026 as a \nresult of this.\n  A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that this \nproposal would result in $16.4 billion in savings to consumers on \nelectricity and natural gas bills. It also reported a 7-percent \nreduction in carbon emissions.\n  A number of other studies found positive results, even to the point \nof reducing overall energy costs. In 2005, we had a hearing in the \nenergy committee. Senator Domenici was chairing the committee at the \ntime. It was on the issue of generation portfolios. Dr. Ryan Weiser, of \nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, presented a report that \nsummarized the results of 15 studies of renewable portfolio standards, \nmuch like the one I am offering.\n  All these studies found that a portfolio standard would reduce \nnatural gas prices; 12 of the 15 studies projected a net reduction in \noverall energy bills for consumers as a result of the renewable \nportfolio standard. In other words, we can save natural gas, we can \nreduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly, and we can save money \nboth on electricity bills and on natural gas bills from making this \nmove that this proposal contemplates.\n  Many have argued that States are already implementing renewable \nportfolio standards so there is no need for a Federal program. It is \ntrue States have taken the lead in pushing for more renewable \ngeneration.\n  Twenty-three States currently have in development renewable \nrequirements. Almost all these standards are more aggressive than the \nFederal standard I am proposing in the amendment I have sent to the \ndesk. New Mexico requires 16.2 percent by 2020. California requires 20 \npercent by 2017. Maine requires 30 percent by 2000. Minnesota requires \n27.4 percent by 2025.\n  This will spur the growth of renewables in these regions. There is \none thing, however, that a State standard cannot do--it cannot drive a \nnational market for the technologies involved here. If some States have \nrenewable standards and others do not, it is impossible for a \nnational market to develop for renewable credits.\n\n  This credit trading system is the piece of our proposal that gives \nthe greatest flexibility for compliance. The credit trading system also \nhelps to reduce the cost of compliance by allowing credits for lower \ncost renewables from one region to be bought by utilities in another \nregion.\n  Some argue this is a cost shift from the regions without renewable \nresources to those that have renewable resources. I would argue it is a \nway to spread the cost to all who are, in fact, benefitting. If States \ndo not have or choose not to develop renewable resources, they still \nrealize very real benefits in lower natural gas prices, lower \nSO2 allowance costs, and low-cost carbon reductions. It is \nonly fair they share the slight increase in costs for generation of \nelectricity that, in fact, created the savings. The argument that many \nStates do not have, or many regions do not have renewable generation \nresources has been made. It is true the best wind, geothermal, and \nsolar resources are concentrated in the West.\n  The entire country has extensive biomass potential. As Maine and \nother Eastern States have shown, paper production and agricultural \nprocesses are\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\navailable everywhere. We have a chart that makes that point. It shows, \nup in the left-hand corner, biomass and biofuel resources; on the right \nside, solar insolation resources; geothermal resources on the left-hand \nside; and wind resources on the bottom right.\n  If Rhode Island and Pennsylvania and New Jersey and Maryland can \nimplement aggressive standards, then the standard we are calling for \ncan be implemented in all States. The chart from the Department of \nEnergy's National Renewable Energy Lab shows that virtually every State \nhas the biomass production potential to meet this target. Environmental \nbenefits are clear.\n  RPS would result, according to the Energy Information Administration, \nin a 6.7-percent reduction in carbon emissions in the year 2030. That \nis a reduction of 222 million tons in that area alone. RPS standards \nalso benefit the economy. It drives job growth. The Union of Concerned \nScientists says that wind turbine construction alone would result in \n43,000 new jobs per year, on average.\n  An additional 11,200 cumulative long-term jobs will result from \nsubsequent operations and maintenance. There is another study by the \nRegional Economics Application Laboratory for the Environment, \nEnvironmental Law and Policy Center, that found that over 68,000 jobs \nat 6.7 billion in economic output would result from the development of \nthe renewable energy capacity contemplated in this amendment.\n  According to the AFL-CIO, an estimated 8,092 jobs would be created \nover a 10-year period for installation and O on wind power in Nevada \nalone, and another 19,137 manufacturing jobs would be created. \nAgricultural interests have begun to be aware of the potential and have \nindicated their support.\n  Last month, the 21st Century Agricultural Policy Project, under the \nguidance of former Senators Bob Dole and Tom Daschle, issued a report. \nThat report made recommendations to sustain the Nation's farm sector. \nOne of the key recommendations was that Congress pass a Federal \nrenewable portfolio standard. I do have executive summaries of those \nreports. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So support for RPS is strong throughout the Nation. A \npoll recently by Melvin & Associates found that 70 percent of those \nsurveyed nationwide supported a 20-percent portfolio standard. That is \nnot what I am recommending. I am recommending 15 percent.\n  But these results were about the same in States as diverse as North \nDakota and Georgia and Missouri and Arizona. Environmental groups, from \nthe Sierra Club to the Natural Resources Defense Council, to the \nindustrial associations, to the renewable trade groups, to utilities \nhave all supported RPS. We recently received letters from a great many \norganizations.\n  Let me indicate what these letters are. First, we have a letter to \nSenators Reid, McConnell, Bingaman, and Domenici, signed by several \nhundred organizations indicating their strong support for this proposal \nthat I have put before the Senate today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Next I have a letter from Michael Wilson of FPL Group--\nhe is vice president for government affairs with FPL--saying: Please \nconsider this letter an endorsement in the renewable portfolio standard \namendment that you intend to offer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be included in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Next, a letter from the National Farmers Union directed \nto Senators Reid, McConnell, Domenici, and myself, saying: On behalf of \nthe farm, ranch and rural members of National Farmers Union, we are \nwriting to urge you to support inclusion of a strong national renewable \nportfolio standard in energy security legislation and oppose attempts \nto weaken that when the Senate considers this issue in the coming days.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Finally, I have a letter from the American Wind Energy \nAssociation indicating strong support for my amendment and concern and \nopposition to the proposed substitute amendment that Senator Domenici \nhas offered under the title: Clean Portfolio Standard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 5.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are moving ahead on this bill. This \nis an important part of the legislation. I think all Senators have \nknown this was intended to be offered as an amendment on the floor. I \nhave certainly indicated that repeatedly over recent weeks and even \nmonths. So as I say, it has been offered and passed in a somewhat \ndifferent forum, three previous Congresses in the Senate. I hope very \nmuch that we can proceed to a good debate on this proposal and on the \nproposal by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and then \nhave votes on those two proposals.\n  I know Senator Kerry also has a proposed second-degree amendment to \nraise the percentage requirement from 15 percent to 20 percent. He \nwould like to have a chance to have the Senate consider that proposal \nas well.\n  At this point, I think that gives a general overview of the amendment \nand the reasons why I think the Senate should support it. I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote for the amendment. I will also want to address \nSenator Domenici's amendment once he has had a chance to explain that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                21ST CENTURY AGRICULTURE POLICY PROJECT\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       America's farmers and ranchers face unprecedented \n     challenges and opportunities in the decades ahead. \n     Globalization, technological change, trade issues, federal \n     budget constraints, global warming, high energy costs, land-\n     development pressures, and increasing environmental and food \n     safety concerns are all likely to have a profound impact on \n     rural communities and on future prospects for sustaining a \n     prosperous and vibrant farm economy. At the same time, new \n     markets are opening to farmers that already are paying \n     enormous dividends. Investments in biofuels projects and wind \n     farms, as well as the generation of carbon credits, are \n     providing farmers and ranchers with new sources of income \n     that are transforming the rural American economy.\n       The 21st Century Agriculture Policy Project was motivated \n     by a recognition that rapidly changing landscape calls for a \n     more expansive and creative approach to national farm policy. \n     Sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy Center and chaired by the \n     two of us, who together have eight decades of experience at \n     the forefront of federal engagement with agriculture issues, \n     the Project was launched in March 2006. Its aim has been to \n     work directly with farmers, ranchers, and other stakeholders \n     to forge bipartisan consensus around a new agenda for U.S. \n     farm policy in the 21st century. It is our intent to put \n     forward a series of recommendations that, taken together, can \n     be implemented at a net savings to the federal government \n     compared with the current Farm Bill. Specifically, our \n     recommendations assume that increased demand for biofuels \n     under an expanded renewable fuel standard will produce \n     substantial savings in existing agriculture support programs, \n     including elimination of the direct payment program, less \n     reliance on countercyclical and loan deficiency payments, and \n     more reliance on the marketplace.\n       Programs to sustain the nation's agricultural sector must \n     necessarily evolve to reflect emerging budget pressures and \n     new economic realities, while also being responsive to the \n     larger concerns and interests of American taxpayers, \n     consumers, and utility ratepayers. Indeed, as taxpayers, \n     consumers, and ratepayers themselves, farmers and ranchers \n     are best served by well-designed policies that achieve \n     equitable outcomes, do so in a fiscally responsible \n     manner, and are carefully targeted to achieve maximum \n     societal benefits at the lowest possible cost. \n     Fortunately, the input gathered through this project from \n     farmers and researchers points to promising opportunities \n     for reforming current policies in ways that are responsive \n     to broader public-interest objectives without in any sense \n     diminishing the federal government's longstanding \n     commitment to an economically secure agricultural base. \n     The recommendations advanced here reflect the view that \n     strategic investments in developing new\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\n     market opportunities and in helping agricultural producers \n     gain a larger stake in high-value-added enterprises can \n     reduce farmers' need for current safety net programs in \n     ways that are less susceptible to political uncertainty \n     and international trade rules and that are revenue-\n     neutral, in terms of overall federal spending. Four \n     overarching themes connect these recommendations:\n       Securing a robust, economically vibrant future for American \n     agriculture in the 21st century requires a more expansive and \n     creative approach to farm policy. A continued federal \n     commitment to the financial security and stability of the \n     nation's farm community is essential at a time when \n     globalization, technological change, environmental concerns, \n     high energy costs, international pressure to cut traditional \n     subsidies, and continued urbanization all pose new challenges \n     for agriculture. To help farmers respond effectively while \n     continuing to undergird U.S. competitiveness, federal policy \n     must evolve to encompass a broader set of issues and \n     successfully leverage multiple synergies.\n       An emphasis on new markets and on increasing farmers' \n     equity share in value-added enterprises provides the best \n     foundation for expanding opportunity in rural communities. \n     Biofuels, renewable energy like wind power, carbon \n     sequestration, and habitat preservation for recreation and \n     hunting are just some examples of agriculture-related \n     activities that can significantly augment and diversify \n     future sources of income for America's farm families. \n     Targeted policies are needed to increase farmers' stakes in \n     the new wealth generated by these emerging markets.\n       Increasing the role of America's farms in energy production \n     can be achieved at a net savings to the federal budget \n     because increased demand for corn and other crops to serve \n     the rapidly growing alternative-fuels market will naturally \n     reduce outlays for traditional ``safety net'' programs. New \n     economic research suggests that explosive growth in ethanol \n     production will lead to higher prices not only for corn, but \n     also for soybeans and wheat, as acreage now in these crops is \n     shifted to corn. These market shifts are expected to \n     dramatically reduce countercyclical and loan deficiency \n     payments for certain crops, potentially freeing billions of \n     dollars each year for farm programs that have broad political \n     support and that generate promising, and ultimately more \n     self-sustaining, economic opportunities in the long run.\n       Federal action to establish a mandatory program to limit \n     greenhouse gas emissions is sensible and will provide \n     agricultural producers with significant new market \n     opportunities. The agriculture sector is in a unique position \n     to lead in--and benefit from--efforts to address climate \n     change. Expanded demand for biofuels is an obvious example, \n     but ranch and farm lands are also well-suited for future \n     development of renewable electricity sources (e.g., wind and \n     solar power) and carbon sequestration.\n\n\n                       summary of recommendations\n\n       Continue to provide economic stability through existing \n     countercyclical programs, while investing in market-based \n     opportunities for agriculture and addressing new sources of \n     financial insecurity through a permanent disaster program:\n       First, the core of the federal farm program must be a \n     strong countercyclical program based on the two \n     countercyclical elements of the current farm bill: (1) a \n     robust marketing loan program that treats all producers \n     equally and (2) a partially decoupled countercyclical \n     program. Individual farm benefits should be capped at \n     $250,000 per year and eligibility to obtain benefits through \n     more than one entity should be eliminated.\n       Second, Congress should eliminate the direct payment \n     program and redirect funds for this program--along with \n     savings generated by reduced countercyclical and LDP payments \n     for corn, wheat, and soybeans--to permanent disaster \n     assistance and promoting new income-generating opportunities \n     for farmers in markets such as biofuels, renewable \n     electricity, carbon sequestration, and conservation.\n       Third, Congress should establish a Value-Added Equity \n     Creation Program to provide farmers and ranchers with no-\n     interest revolving loans so that they can participate in \n     high-value agriculture-related business opportunities, such \n     as biofuels plants and wind projects. Producers should be \n     eligible to participate if their primary occupation is \n     farming and should be able to receive up to $100,000 in \n     interest-free loans for equity investments in qualifying \n     value-added enterprises (as certified by the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture (USDA)).\n       Finally, in recent years, Congress has frequently passed \n     annual emergency spending bills to provide agricultural \n     producers with disaster assistance. While these measures have \n     provided important relief to farmers and ranchers, they have \n     been ad hoc in nature and off budget. As a result, Congress \n     may decide to establish a permanent disaster assistance \n     program, administered by USDA, to provide ranchers and \n     farmers with assistance for clearly defined disaster \n     conditions. If so, we recommend that Congress replace the \n     current system of ad hoc off-budget emergency supplemental \n     spending bills, make the permanent disaster assistance \n     program on-budget as part of the Farm Bill, and include a \n     reasonable benefit cap of $250,000 per farm or ranch in any \n     single year. If a reasonable benefits cap is imposed, net \n     federal outlays for disaster assistance should be reduced \n     compared with the current off-budget approach.\n       To promote biomass-based alternative liquid fuels, Congress \n     should:\n       Expand and extend the recently-adopted renewable fuels \n     standard (RFS) to reach at least 10 billion gallons per year \n     by 2010, 30 billion gallons per year by 2020, and 60 billion \n     gallons per year by 2030, as proposed in bipartisan \n     legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate. This step would \n     lead to expansion of biofuels markets beyond the E-10 market \n     and spur new investment in the next generation of advanced \n     biofuels technologies, such as cellulosic ethanol.\n       Promote the use of higher blends of ethanol in the existing \n     fleet of automobiles by instructing the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to conduct analysis of the viability of \n     using higher blends of ethanol (including E-15, E-20, E-30, \n     and E-40) in the existing fleet of automobiles by January 1, \n     2009.\n       Extend the existing volumetric ethanol excise tax credit \n     (VEETC) to 2020 while simultaneously restructuring this \n     program in ways that account for expected growth in corn \n     ethanol production under an expanded national RFS. After the \n     current tax incentive authorization expires in 2010, Congress \n     should look for ways to ensure that the cost of the tax \n     credit--in the context of other policies and expected ethanol \n     production volumes--remains acceptable, while ensuring that \n     new and innovative biofuels project are provided the support \n     they need to be successful. Among the criteria that \n     Congress should use to design the post-2010 biofuels tax \n     credits are:\n       1. Limiting the overall cost of the tax incentives to the \n     government;\n       2. Encouraging expansion of the industry by ensuring that \n     investments in new plants and recently-built plants can be \n     fully amortized;\n       3. Rewarding energy-efficient and low-carbon emitting \n     technologies;\n       4. Ensuring that pioneering processes, such as those that \n     convert cellulosic feedstocks like corn stover and \n     switchgrass to ethanol, are economically competitive with \n     fossil fuels;\n       5. Encouraging farmer ownership of ethanol plants;\n       6. Balancing domestic tax credits with an import duty of \n     similar size, so that U.S. taxpayers do not subsidize ethanol \n     imports to the detriment of American producers.\n       Extend the small producer renewable fuels tax credit beyond \n     2008 for plants that are at least 40 percent locally-owned \n     and for cellulosic ethanol plants. Consolidate all cellulosic \n     biofuels loan guarantee programs into a single program at \n     USDA and establish an energy security trust fund to provide \n     consistent funding for that program. Successfully \n     commercializing the production of ethanol and other fuels \n     from cellulosic (i.e., woody or fibrous) plant materials \n     would dramatically expand the potential contribution of \n     biofuels in terms of displacing current petroleum use and \n     associated carbon emissions. Implementing many existing loan \n     guarantee programs through three separate federal agencies \n     makes little sense. USDA has considerable experience in \n     implementing loan guarantee programs and expertise in \n     evaluating biofuels projects through its Office of Energy. \n     Therefore, Congress should consolidate all federal biofuels \n     grant and loan guarantee programs at USDA and establish a \n     national energy security trust fund to provide at least $1 \n     billion per year in loan guarantees and grants to promote \n     necessary advances in production technology and bio-science.\n       Establish a demonstration cellulosic biofuels feedstock \n     program. Congress should establish a new set-aside program to \n     demonstrate how the cultivation and harvesting of cellulosic \n     feedstocks could be accomplished in an economically \n     attractive manner. Following the model of several existing \n     programs, the 2007 Farm Bill should provide a modest payment \n     to landowners who convert existing cropland to grow \n     cellulosic biofuel feedstocks for nearby cellulosic biofuels \n     plants in ways that improve wildlife habitat, reduce soil \n     erosion, and protect water quality. New lands to be set aside \n     under such a program should be capped at 500,000 acres for \n     the duration of the 2007 Farm Bill.\n       Establish policies to encourage a rapid increase in the \n     number of flexible fuel vehicles sold in the United States \n     and the installation of E-85 pumps and blender pumps at \n     gasoline stations. For example, we recommend extending the \n     existing tax credit for installing E-85 refueling stations \n     and redesigning it to provide relatively greater benefits in \n     the near-term to encourage more rapid deployment of E-85 \n     infrastructure. We also recommend clarifying that blender \n     pumps be eligible for the tax credit, since in the long run \n     it will make more sense to install blender pumps that are \n     capable of dispensing a range of ethanol blended fuels. \n     Congress also should consider more attractive expensing and \n     accelerated depreciation options to encourage installation of \n     E-85 and blender pumps in lieu of tax credits.\n       To promote renewable electricity production and other \n     renewable energy projects on farms and ranches, Congress \n     should:\n       Establish a national renewable portfolio standard (RPS) \n     along with complementary policies to promote maximum \n     development of cost-effective renewable energy potential on \n     agricultural lands. Such policies to promote renewable energy \n     have been adopted by 21 states and the District of Columbia \n     and Congress should now take action to adopt a\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\n     portfolio requirement at the federal level. Moreover, federal \n     policies to promote renewable energy should encourage the \n     siting of new projects on farm or ranch lands wherever \n     possible. Given that the use of these lands would be far \n     preferable to new development in wilderness areas and would \n     simultaneously provide important economic benefits for rural \n     communities, an appropriate policy goal would be to satisfy \n     at least two-thirds of a national RPS with renewable energy \n     production on agricultural lands. In addition, a federal RPS \n     should be designated to complement and not pre-empt any state \n     requirements (which may be more ambitious) and should apply \n     equally to all large retail electricity providers. (To \n     simplify implementation requirements and to address supply \n     and price concerns, it may be appropriate to exclude rural \n     electric coops and small municipal utilities.)\n       Expand and strengthen existing programs outside the Farm \n     Bill that promote renewable energy development and related \n     technology advances. To provide investment certainty, \n     existing renewable-energy production tax credits (PTCs) \n     should be extended for ten years and funding for related \n     research, development, demonstration, and early deployment \n     efforts should be increased. In addition, such programs \n     should be modified so that incentives can be taken against \n     non-passive income. The Community Renewable Energy Bonds \n     (CREBs) program should be extended and expanded, with a \n     substantial sum set aside for rural electric cooperatives and \n     municipal utilities.\n       Establish a Rural Community Renewable Energy Bonds program \n     to provide a federal incentive for local private investment \n     in renewable energy to complement the PTC and CREBs programs. \n     This new initiative would be limited to projects of not more \n     than 40 MW; where at least 49 percent of the project is \n     owned by entities resident within 200 miles of the project \n     site.\n       Expand the capacity of the existing federal power \n     administration transmission system. The federal power \n     marketing administrations (PMAs) own and manage a vast \n     network of existing power lines, which should be \n     substantially expanded to provide the additional capacity \n     needed to tap cost-effective renewable energy resources. \n     Congress should direct the federal power administrations to \n     pursue this objective under a structure in which non-\n     benefiting PMA customers do not shoulder the cost and \n     preference is given for system investments that maximize \n     promising opportunities for renewable energy development on \n     agricultural lands. Priority should be placed on the \n     expansion of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and \n     Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) transmission systems. \n     The PMAs also should be authorized and encouraged to enter \n     into partnerships with non-federal parties for the siting, \n     planning, and construction of transmission lines; the \n     participation of PMAs can streamline siting by avoiding \n     multiple state siting authorities.\n       The Department of Energy (DOE) should designate the \n     Heartland Transmission Corridors ``National Interest Electric \n     Transmission Corridors'' pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of \n     2005. Federal assistance in the form of an expanded role for \n     WAPA as a facilitator for planning and investment, and a 20 \n     percent matching investment from the federal government would \n     go a long way toward addressing cost and siting hurdles, \n     encouraging state cooperation, and ensuring that needed \n     transmission system enhancements are implemented.\n       Congress should authorize $1 billion per year for five \n     years to provide tax-exempt bonds for the construction of \n     transmission facilities (or the expansion of existing \n     facilities) where such construction or expansion is cost-\n     effective and offers substantial public policy benefits in \n     terms of facilitating the development of clean, domestic \n     renewable resources. Under such a program, loans would be \n     provided by eligible government entities to qualified private \n     entities seeking to finance eligible transmission \n     infrastructure. Such bonds would assure the availability of \n     financing for transmission at significantly lower cost than \n     presently available in the market. They could be used both \n     for new transmission and for upgrades to existing facilities \n     (for example, to address transmission constraints in west \n     Texas and Minnesota, where substantial wind development \n     opportunities exist, or to access renewable energy projects \n     anticipated as a result of the Rocky Mountain Area \n     Transmission Study (RMATS) in the Western Interconnect. In \n     addition, current private use restrictions applicable to \n     projects that receive tax-exempt bonds should be reviewed to \n     assess whether they create unnecessary additional hurdles to \n     investment.\n       Explore further opportunities for an expanded federal role \n     in directly facilitating the implementation of, and providing \n     resources for, investments to enhance grid capacity and to \n     promote a more efficient, seamless, and reliable transmission \n     system nationwide.\n       Reauthorize and expand USDA's Energy Audit and Renewable \n     Energy Development Program under Section 9005 of the 2002 \n     Farm Bill. This program to assist farmers, ranchers, and \n     rural small businesses in becoming more energy efficient and \n     in using renewable energy technology and resources has never \n     been funded. It should be reauthorized with a goal of \n     performing audits of 25 percent of all farms and ranches over \n     the time horizon covered by the next Farm Bill and funds \n     sufficient to achieve that goal should be appropriated in the \n     future.\n       Reauthorize and expand USDA's Rural Development Business \n     Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program (Section 9006 \n     of the 2002 Farm Bill). This program currently provides a \n     modest number of grants--$23 million per year--to support \n     renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects. Future \n     funding should be scaled up over the next 5 years to at least \n     $500 million per year and the program should be expanded to \n     enable participating agencies to provide grants for \n     feasibility studies and loan guarantees for project \n     development. As long as feasibility studies are accurately \n     performed, the cost to the federal government of providing \n     loan guarantees for up to 75 percent of project costs should \n     be fairly small. In addition, Congress should consider \n     modifying the program to (1) increase loan guarantees for \n     cellulosic ethanol facilities to at least $100 million per \n     project, and $25 million for other projects, (2) create a \n     rebate program to streamline the application process for \n     smaller, standardized projects by reducing the paperwork \n     burden, and (3) expand eligible applicants to include \n     agricultural operations in non-rural areas (such as \n     greenhouses) and schools.\n       To promote markets for carbon sequestration and other cost-\n     effective greenhouse-gas mitigation measures on farm and \n     ranch lands, Congress should:\n       Establish a national, mandatory, market-based program to \n     reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions that provides \n     substantial market opportunities for cost-effective carbon \n     sequestration on farm and ranch lands. Specifically, \n     agricultural producers should have the opportunity to \n     participate fully in the carbon markets that will be created \n     under a greenhouse gas trading program. To facilitate this \n     participation, priority must be given to establishing robust, \n     well-defined protocols for measuring and verifying carbon \n     reductions achieved through terrestrial sequestration.\n       Establish tax incentives, such as federal tax refunds for \n     local and state property taxes, for farmers and ranchers who \n     enroll land in a carbon trading program that works in tandem \n     with entities that buy, sell and trade carbon credits.\n       Direct USDA to work with other state and federal agencies \n     on continued economic and technical research on different \n     options for sequestering carbon and on better methods of \n     documenting sequestration for market participation.\n       To advance widely supported environmental habitat-\n     preservation, and open-space objectives while creating \n     additional income-generating opportunities for farmers and \n     maximizing potential business opportunities related to \n     hunting, fishing, and other forms of outdoor recreation, \n     Congress should:\n       Expand existing conservation programs:\n       1. Expand the Conservation Reserve Program at 40 million \n     acres;\n       2. Expand the Wetlands Reserve Program at 5 million acres, \n     with annual enrollment capped at 250,000 acres per year;\n       3. Expand the Grasslands Reserve Program at 5 million \n     acres, with annual enrollment capped at 500,000 acres per \n     year;\n       4. Increase funding for the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection \n     Program to at least $300 million per year.\n       5. Implement the Conservation Security Program on a \n     nationwide basis on all working lands.\n       Enact ``Open Fields Bill'' to provide $20 million per year \n     in federal funds to supplement state ``walk in'' programs \n     that give farmers and ranchers financial incentives to expand \n     public access to their lands.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Energy & Natural Resources Committee, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Ranking Member, Energy & Natural Resources Committee.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Bingaman and Domenici: As a \n     diverse group of corporations, manufacturers, electric \n     utilities, renewable energy developers, labor organizations, \n     farm groups, faith-based organizations and environmental \n     advocates, we are writing to urge the Senate to include a \n     national renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in energy \n     security legislation that may soon be considered by Congress. \n     An RPS is an essential component of a broader national energy \n     strategy, because it will held the nation to take full \n     advantage of the abundant domestic renewable resources \n     available for the generation of electricity.\n       An RPS is a market-based mechanism that requires electric \n     utilities to include a specific percentage of clean, \n     renewable energy in their generation portfolios, or to \n     purchase renewable energy credits from others. By \n     substantially increasing renewable electricity generation, \n     the RPS would enhance national energy security by \n     diversifying our sources of electric generation. At a time \n     when the United States is increasing energy imports, an RPS \n     would make America more energy self-reliant. The reduction in \n     the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity would also \n     limit fuel price volatility, which is important to both \n     industry and consumers. In fact, the U.S. Department of \n     Energy's own Energy Information Administration has found in \n     several studies that an RPS would actually cause natural gas \n     prices to decline.\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\n       Increasing the market share for renewable energy resources \n     would also have substantial environmental benefits. An RPS is \n     one of the most important and readily available approaches to \n     reducing greenhouse gases from the electricity generation \n     sector. In addition, an RPS also would help reduce \n     conventional pollutants including nitrogen oxide, sulfur \n     dioxide and mercury emissions.\n       Moreover, a national RPS will produce substantial economic \n     benefits. The additional investment in renewable electric \n     generation would create hundreds of thousands of well-paying \n     jobs. In addition, because many renewable resources are \n     located in remote areas, rural America will experience a \n     substantial economic boost.\n       We believe the time has come for Congress to move quickly \n     to enact national RPS legislation. The costs of inaction for \n     our environment, national security and economy are too high. \n     Although more than 20 states have adopted individual RPS \n     programs, the country will not realize the full potential for \n     renewable electricity without the adoption of a Federal \n     program to enhance the states' efforts.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n       GE, BP America, Inc., National Venture Capital Association, \n     Miasole, Wisconsin Power and Light, National Council of \n     Churches of Christ in the USA, Technet, APX, Inc., Alliant \n     Energy, Sempra Energy, Shell Wind Energy, Inc., Solar \n     Turbines, Inc., Business Council for Sustainable Energy, \n     Alliant Energy, Invenergy LLC, Owens Corning Composites \n     System Business, Leeco Steel, Clipper Wind Power, Inc., \n     Google, United Steelworkers, Edison International, Pacific \n     Gas & Electric, Union for Reform Judaism, GT Solar, PPM \n     Energy, Inc., Avista Utilities, Horizon Wind Energy, Enel NA, \n     D.H.

Our commitment to the environment is manifested by \n     FPL's diverse generation mix and by FPLE's largely renewable \n     energy portfolio. FPLE operates two of the largest solar \n     projects in the world, over 1,000 megawatts of hydroelectric \n     power, a number of geothermal projects and several biomass \n     plants. Additionally, FPLE is the world's largest generator \n     of wind power.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and \n     support your efforts to enact a fair and balanced RPS in \n     order to increase the amount of non-emitting electricity \n     generation in the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael M. Wilson,\n                             Vice President, Governmental Affairs.\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                                    June 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Energy & Natural Resources Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Ranking Member, Energy & Natural Resources Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Bingaman, and Domenici: On \n     behalf of the farm, ranch and rural members of National \n     Farmers Union (NFU), I am writing to urge you to support \n     inclusion of a strong national renewable portfolio standard \n     (RPS) in energy security legislation and oppose attempts to \n     weaken it when the Senate considers this issue in the coming \n     days.\n       Rural America has the greatest potential for generating \n     significant amounts of clean, renewable energy. A RPS that \n     ensures a growing percentage of electricity is produced from \n     renewable sources, like wind power, will provide long-term, \n     predictable demand that will allow the industry to attract \n     investment capital and rural America to harness wind energy \n     potential.\n       Passage of a robust RPS will significantly accelerate \n     efforts to enhance our energy security by diversifying our \n     sources of electricity and limiting our dependence on foreign \n     sources of energy. Additionally, a RPS would create new \n     economic opportunities in rural America. Local, community and \n     farmer-owned renewable energy development projects are key to \n     providing economic and social benefits, while providing an \n     economic base for further rural economic development. A \n     robust RPS would create hundreds of thousands of good paying \n     jobs, provide billions of dollars in new income to farmers \n     and ranchers and generate significant local tax revenues that \n     can be used to fund other important priorities.\n       NFU believes Congress should move quickly to enact national \n     RPS legislation and we urge you to support efforts to do so \n     during floor consideration of the Renewable Fuels, Consumer \n     Protection and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Tom Buis,\n                                                        President.\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n\n                             American Wind Energy Association,\n\n                                                    June 11, 2007.\n     Re Please Support Bingaman RPS Amendment, Oppose Domenici CPS \n         Amendment\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: As the full Senate begins consideration of \n     comprehensive energy legislation this week, the American Wind \n     Energy Association (AWEA) respectfully urges Senators to vote \n     in favor of the Bingaman renewable portfolio standard (RPS) \n     amendment and against the Domenici clean portfolio standard \n     (CPS) amendment.\n       In order for our nation to seriously address the challenges \n     of energy security and global climate change we need an \n     effective renewable electricity standard that will drive new \n     investment and job growth in the renewable energy sector. The \n     Bingaman RPS proposal\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\n     would assure crucial progress toward this vitally important \n     objective. Unfortunately, however, the Domenici CPS amendment \n     includes numerous exemptions and loopholes that would \n     undermine the effectiveness of the effort to promote \n     renewable energy.\n       A core weakness of the CPS proposal is its inclusion of \n     language that could allow virtually any form of electricity \n     generation to qualify as ``clean.'' The CPS amendment would \n     allow the Secretary of Energy to designate ``other clean \n     energy sources'' that could qualify for clean energy credits \n     without placing any parameters on such designations. In \n     addition, it is noteworthy that utilities would receive \n     credit for electricity generated from technology that \n     captures and stores carbon, but the amendment does not \n     specify that a utility must actually employ carbon capture \n     and storage to receive credits.\n       Also of concern is an important loophole in the CPS \n     amendment that would allow states to waive program \n     requirements. The CPS amendment would allow states with \n     existing requirements to opt out of the Federal requirements \n     based solely on the state's own determination that it has a \n     measure in place that is ``comparable to the overall goal'' \n     of the Federal program. This vague standard is not further \n     defined. In contrast, the Bingaman RPS proposal would not \n     interfere with the ability of utilities to comply with state \n     RPS programs. The state opt-out provision in the CPS proposal \n     would lead to substantially reduced renewable energy \n     investment and employment.\n       Our nation's citizens overwhelmingly support increasing the \n     generation of electricity from renewable sources like wind, \n     biomass and solar power. The Bingaman RPS amendment would \n     meet this demand and put our nation on a path that increases \n     the role of clean domestic energy in meeting our electricity \n     needs. We urge its enactment without the addition of \n     weakening changes such as those included in the Domenici CPS \n     amendment.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this vitally \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Randy Swisher,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senator Domenici will be to the Chamber in \na few moments and is preparing to speak to the second degree to the \nBingaman amendment the chairman has outlined. In doing so, I will touch \nfor a few moments on some of the differences between an RPS and a CPS \nand some of the value of broadening the portfolio Senator Bingaman is \ntalking about to create greater advantages nationwide for a larger \namount of clean energy.\n  There is no question that RPS, as we know it, invented in the mid-\n1990s as a concept, evolving now to 23 States having accepted some form \nof an RPS standard, has a very strong bias for wind and biomass. It is \nthere. We subsidize wind today. The letter the Senator introduced from \nthe wind industry is reflective of the phenomenal subsidy they get and \nthe advantage they get.\n  We create a market niche for them with an RPS, and then we subsidize \nthem. Frankly, I am for that. Wind energy and the more of it we can \nhave is the right energy, along with all other forms.\n  What the Senator did not say was the Southeast is dramatically \ndisadvantaged because they don't have wind. As a result, they have to \ngo buy or be taxed to offset the differences. That is unfair. Many of \nus believe it is unfair. We also believe RPS is not an obsolete \nstandard but an old one.\n  About 3 years ago, people looking at a broader portofolio of energy \nsaid: We ought to expand the standard. Today's mantra in energy, \nwhether it is the Senators from New Mexico or this Senator, who is one \nof the senior members of the Energy Committee, is: Clean. America will \nnot build new energy production unless it is clean. That is what RPS \nwas originally heading us toward--cleaner renewable energies. So why \nshouldn't we expand that portfolio from wind and bio to some additional \nnew forms--new nuclear, very clean; new hydro, yes, but limited; coal \nsequestration or carbon sequestration, clean; efficiencies, less use, \nless demand. Shouldn't they also be in this new portfolio? I say yes. \nAmerica, when they understand it, would say yes.\n  Right now there is a niche market, a very narrow one, for limited use \nin certain capacities and greater use in others. I see windmills coming \nup across my State today. Why? Because we have wind, and they are \nsubsidized. There is an advantage to do so. But you don't see windmills \ncoming up in Florida and other places in the South because there is not \nthe kind of prevailing winds that sustain a 25- to 30-percent \nproduction efficiency of these particular kinds of units.\n  Senator Domenici has just arrived. I will let him pick up the debate \nbecause he has led with this issue. I have been a supporter of it and \nhave helped develop this issue. I believe it is time we modernize, move \nto clean energy, and reward the utilities that produce clean energy. It \ndoes not disadvantage an RPS. It simply expands and modernizes it into \nthe concept of energy we are looking for today in the American energy \nportfolio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I apologize to Senator Bingaman for not \nhearing all of his speech. I was detained. They told me he had started. \nI thought they would tell me a few minutes before. I had to drive from \ndowntown. I apologize for that.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have been doing our best to remain bipartisan. \nBut on this issue, I can't do that. He will go his way and I will go \nmine. His amendment is on the bottom and my amendment is on top. I have \noffered mine as a second-degree amendment to his. My recollection of \nhow we do this, when time has run out, unless other arrangements are \nmade--and they could be--mine would go first.\n  I thank the cosponsors. Senator Craig has just told us that he is a \ncosponsor. He worked very hard. Clearly, you can see from the morning's \nwork that Senator Pete Domenici, ranking member of the committee, is \npretty lucky. He can step down and go out and leave things vacant for a \nlittle while, and the man behind me, Larry Craig, will soon take over. \nNo one will know anything was missed. If anything, they will figure \nthings got better. He is very good at it, and I thank him for all the \nhelp he has given me. Other cosponsors are Senators Bennett, Crapo, \nGraham, and Murkowski.\n  I am saying there is a far better way to reach the goals Senator \nBingaman wants, and we don't have to harm so many States in doing it. \nWhat we ought to know right up front is that you have to go ahead and \nchoose something. Senator Bingaman chose to put two or three things in \nhis. Before I am finished, I think I can convince you that everybody \nwho has looked at it says that in its application, it is predominantly \na wind amendment. It says a couple other things, but when you look at \nit as to what is done, I am safe in calling our battle a battle between \nwind in every State, forced upon them at the level of 15 percent of \nwhat their utilities use in energy. Every single State will have to \nhave that by a time certain, whether they can do it or not. If they \ncan't do it, they will be penalized.\n  I want to take a quick look at this map. Here is a map that shows \nwhat we are talking about. If you look at it, you see the United \nStates. You see the eastern seaboard is white. Then you see some inlets \nof water. Then you see it is white again. That means there is not \nenough wind in those areas to move the wind turbines enough for them to \nbe used to accomplish the goals of this bill. Then if you look out in \nthe western part, you see very big pieces of the West that are white, \nall the way through this white versus blue and dark blue. The white is \nwhat Senator Bingaman calls wind energy. It is clean, but it is wind. I \ndon't believe we should do it that way.\n  I have said, since you all want something, I am going to suggest that \nyou want clean--not his words, my words--a clean energy portfolio. If \nit is clean and available, you ought to put it in so they can use it. \nSo you will find that is what I have done. The clean energy portfolio \nstandard provides a comprehensive, technology-neutral program to ensure \nthat clean energy will make up for an ever-increasing portion of our \nNation's electricity operation. The clean portfolio standard requires \nelectric utilities to produce a set percentage of electricity \nfrom clean energy sources, ramping up to an enforceable goal of 20 \npercent by 2020. So it is 20 by 20, and it is a clean portfolio. Rather \nthan pick winners and losers--and I stress this--rather than pick \nwinners and losers between various clean technologies that are or will \nbe available in the future, the clean portfolio standard provides for \nall sources of clean energy--including solar, wind, geothermal, \nbiomass, landfill gas, hydropower, new nuclear power, and fuel\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\ncell quality--under the program. The clean portfolio also provides \ncredit for innovative technologies that will allow future traditional \nfuels to be burned in a way that captures and sequesters carbon \nemissions. We are going to do that. Somebody is going to make that \nbreakthrough.\n\n  Our bill provides that they can come in. Credit is further provided \nfor reductions in electricity usage from programs that provide \nefficiency and lower the amount of power that needs to be generated in \nthe first place.\n  Energy efficiency efforts such as demand response should be part of \nthe solution. Everybody tells us that demand response is a way that, by \nmanaging it properly, you can get a very significant savings.\n  Finally, since we have faith in American engineers, the clean \nportfolio standard encourages innovation by giving the Secretary of \nEnergy authority to provide credit for new clean technologies that may \njust be a twinkle in the inventor's eye but which may revolutionize the \nway we produce and use electricity. If that occurs during the time, \nclearly it should be permitted to come in. It doesn't have to be here \nyet. If it is invented in 5 years, we thank the Lord and put it in and \nuse it. We don't operate in stagnation and say: You are outside of our \nwindow. You are clean, but you don't come in. We don't give you credit. \nYou go on with that same old wind technology.\n  I am going to invite my friend from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, to \ncome down and share again with us what he thinks about what he calls a \nwind economy. I can't give that speech. I am not that good. But I sure \nlisten to him because I think he is right. I don't believe we want wind \nas the test of providing an alternate renewable in every State in the \nUnion, even if there is insufficient wind. And we don't want those \nStates paying fines because they can't come in. I don't think Senator \nBingaman wants to pull out the States--I don't know how many it would \nbe, 10, 12, 13--and say: We aren't going to do anything there. I think \nif he did, he couldn't call it national. But he certainly would gain a \nlot of support if it was fair. To make it fair, you cannot impose the \nsame regulated wind requirement on States that have no wind and then \nsay: Let's vote on this bill. The bill should not be voted on in that \nway. In fact, those States that have it that way ought to come down \nhere and say: We can't vote on this bill. It is so obviously wrong that \nwe should not do it.\n  Finally, since we have faith, we are going to expect innovation to be \noffered to the Secretary of Energy while the years run. That \ninnovation, if it produces something, will come to us and be put into \nthe package we are talking about that will start taking away white and \nturning it into blue because we put new technology into the area.\n  Unlike the RPS, the clean portfolio, the CPS, doesn't pick winners or \nlosers. Unlike the RPS, the clean portfolio standard recognizes that \nregional differences in resources and geography mean that we can't \ncreate a one-size-fits-all. That is what I believe. That is what I \nbelieve the Senate is going to say. Why pick a one-shoe-fits-all, when \nyou can't get it in. You can't get any foot in on the white up here in \nthe north because you can't get that much in the foot. You can't create \none that will put it in and still have essentially what is in the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Take a look at the chart from the National Renewable Lab. It shows \nwhere our Nation's wind resources are located. Wind has no application \nin the Southeast. The resources simply are not available in an entire \nregion of the country.\n  We cannot ignore the reality that utilities in some regions cannot \nmeet the RPS mandate with the limited resources permitted because they \nare located in regions that are not blessed with ample renewable \nresources.\n  Wind power is the clear winner under an RPS. Advocates of the Federal \nRPS call it the ``wind power legislation.'' They are right--the only \nway to reach a 15-percent requirement from the limited number of \nrenewable resources permitted under the Bingaman amendment is from wind \npower.\n  Wind is the clear winner in the RPS. This chart I have in the Chamber \nis based on an estimate prepared by Global Energy Decisions. As you can \nsee, wind will be used overwhelmingly to attempt to meet the RPS \nrequirement. The Union of Concerned Scientists concurs, estimating that \ntwo-thirds of the RPS requirements would likely be met by new wind \ngeneration. I have told you that already, that it would be almost all \nwind. Now I am telling you that scientific groups that analyzed it \nagree with what I said.\n  The Federal Government has supported wind power development since \n1992. I am not saying that is wrong. In fact, there will be much wind \nproduced under the Domenici amendment because much of the renewables \nwill be wind. It is that every State will not be required, and some \nwill not have any because they cannot produce any.\n  The Federal Government has been allowing a production tax credit \nsince we first adopted it in 1992. Since then, we have spent in excess \nof $2 billion on wind power development--from R, to the tax credit, \nto clean renewable energy bonds.\n  We have made a lot of progress in the past 15 years. In 2006, \ninstalled wind power capacity was 11,600 megawatts--enough to power 3 \nmillion homes. The wind industry continues to grow. With a good \nsubsidy, we continue to give it to them. An additional 3,000 megawatts \nis going to come on line by the end of 2007.\n  So we support wind power. Wind power is included in the clean \nportfolio standard I offer today.\n  What is interesting is--you have to think ahead with me--the Bingaman \nportfolio is almost all wind. How many years do we intend to support \nwind with a subsidy so that this system will work? Without wind, it \nwill not work. It seems like right now, without a subsidy, it will not \nwork. I do not know what the scientists working on it say. Will it soon \nnot need any subsidy? They may say the subsidy can start going away. Or \nhow many years will it be they will have to have it? That puts me to \nthinking whether you should have it at all.\n  Today, we have only Senator Bingaman's amendment and mine--both of \nthem. His has all wind, and we have some wind, so we are kind of \nadmitting we are going to keep it as long as we can and pay for it as \nlong as we can so we can have that kind of nationwide--or partially \nnationwide--program.\n  For the one I suggest, the clean one, obviously, we use less wind and \nwill still be clean, and no States will pay any fines, no States will \nbe given any slips that they are entitled to money in the future.\n  The clean portfolio standard results in more clean energy actually \nproduced. It is not watered down. The clean portfolio standard would \nimpose a 20-percent standard--a full one-third higher--yet the \nproponents of the RPS claimed this is a ``watered down'' program. What \nis their complaint? That we allow a greater number of resources to \nqualify for credits under this program?\n  It is true the clean portfolio standard allows the use of any \nnonemitting source of power: including expanded hydropower, new nuclear \npowerplants, fuel cells, clean coal technologies that capture and \nsequester carbon, and energy efficiency to meet the 20-percent \nstandard.\n  Thus, the clean portfolio standard allows the use of a greater \nvariety of technologies to meet a higher standard. The goal of this \namendment is to provide a greater amount of clean energy from a greater \ndiversity of energy sources. Obviously, the clean portfolio standard \ndoes this much better than the RPS proposal.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, the clean portfolio standard \nallows States that develop their own portfolio standards to opt out of \nthe Federal program. Some are trying to label this provision as a \nloophole. It is not. Instead, it is a recognition that States should be \nafforded the right to develop their own clean portfolio approaches \nwithout Federal interference. We should not penalize those States that \nalready have forged ahead by imposing an inconsistent Federal mandate.\n  The Federal RPS could cost billions. Here is an estimate prepared by \nGlobal Energy Decisions. GED estimates which States can and cannot \ncomply with a Federal RPS. As shown on the chart, the orange States do \nnot have the necessary renewable resources to comply with an RPS. The \nmajority of the States--27--will not be able to meet the mandate.\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\n  Let's look at this another way--by population. This pie chart I have \nin the Chamber represents those that will not be in compliance with a \n15-percent renewable portfolio standard. About two-thirds of the U.S. \npopulation--66 percent--will not be able to meet the new standard.\n  How will the States' inability to meet this new electricity mandate \nimpact consumers? It is going to cost billions.\n  I have another chart. According to the study prepared by Global \nEnergy Decisions, the cumulative costs to consumers to comply with the \nRPS is $175 billion. The States hit the hardest are those in the \nSoutheast without access to wind power; Florida, Georgia, North \nCarolina, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and South \nCarolina.\n  The EIA recently concluded a study on the 15-percent RPS mandate and \nfound it would cost consumers $21 billion. Obviously, that is still a \ntremendous cost to pass on to the consumer. However, the EIA has used \nsome questionable assumptions in its analysis that have been rejected \nnot only by the utility industry but by all 10 Southeastern public \nutility commissions--bipartisan watchdogs for the ratepayers.\n  With this amendment, we keep our eye on the ball. The true goal of \nthis legislation is an increase in the amount of electricity generated \nby clean technologies, reducing the emissions in our environment.\n  Our goal is not to promote one or two or three specific technologies \nover another. In fact, the only way to ensure that the cost to the \nconsumer is mitigated to the maximum extent is to avoid the temptation \nto pick winners and losers between technologies that all move us toward \none goal.\n  To limit the number of qualifying resources to a handful of existing \ntechnologies is to ignore the history of rapid acceleration of \nscientific and technological development in this country.\n\n  Do the sponsors of the RPS truly believe that innovation is dead? \nOnly a handful of existing technologies qualify under the RPS. This \nassumes there will be no breakthroughs in the way we produce \nelectricity for the next 23 years.\n  I believe the incentive of a clean portfolio standard, combined with \nenvironmental concerns and rising prices for traditional fuels, will \nproduce an ideal climate for technological innovation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is the best \nway to do it. We will have more to say during the afternoon.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank the Senate for the time I was \ngiven and for listening.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I shall not take a great deal of time. I \nsimply rise to express my support for the amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico. He has thought the matter through very \ncarefully and described, I think, a hopeful approach, one that \nrecognizes technology in the energy business is constantly changing, \nthat opportunities are arising that we may not even think of now.\n  One area where I have shown an interest is tidal energy, and we are \nin the infancy of finding out about that. We need to have an open-ended \nopportunity to find alternative energy sources.\n  So with that, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership \non this issue and am happy to be a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make a few comments in response \nto my colleague's statement and in opposition to his amendment, which \nhe has designated the clean energy portfolio standard. I think people \nneed to understand what his amendment provides, and let me try to \nexplain that.\n  This amendment purports to be significantly stronger than the 15-\npercent requirement I have proposed as part of the renewable portfolio \nstandard I have sent to the desk. It actually, though, accomplishes \nvery little in driving the development of new technologies for \nelectricity supply.\n  The amendment talks about a target of 20 percent clean energy \nresources by 2020, but when you look at it carefully, it is a recipe \nfor business as usual, given all the other things that are going on and \nin the planning stages.\n  There are various reasons why I say that. First of all, it is very \nclear from his amendment that existing nuclear power is subtracted from \nthe base against which the requirement is measured. Now, what does that \nmean? What that means is that instead of taking 100 percent, you say: \nOK. How much of our current electricity supply comes from nuclear \npower? About 20 percent. You subtract that, and you are then left with \nthe remaining 80 percent; and that remaining 80 percent is what he \ncalculates his 20 percent against. So, in fact, 20 percent of 80 \npercent gets you down to 16 percent--rather than a 20-percent \nrequirement.\n  He also has a provision in here that says incremental nuclear power \nis counted for full credit. Now, that means any new powerplant that is \nbuilt is new energy and helps to meet the requirement that would be \nimposed by his amendment. Let me say, first of all, I worked very \nclosely with Senator Domenici in supporting additional incentives and \nadditional supports--subsidies, in fact--for the nuclear energy \nindustry in the 2005 Energy bill we passed. We put a variety of things \ninto law to encourage the construction of new nuclear powerplants in \nthis country. We put in regulatory risk insurance. We put in a \nproduction tax credit, which I think was 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour \nfor the first 10 years you had one of these new nuclear powerplants in \nproduction. We extended the Price Anderson Act. We had loan guarantees \nfor the construction of new nuclear plants--the first six, I believe. \nWe had a substantial increase in funding for nuclear research and \ndevelopment, and we had a transfer to the Federal taxpayer of much of \nthe expenditure for safety and security that would otherwise have been \nborne by the industry.\n\n  So there are a lot of things in there to support the nuclear power \nindustry. I still believe those are very good provisions, and I am in \nno way backing away from those. But now my colleague has come to the \nfloor and said: OK, now let's give them another subsidy, another \nincentive to build nuclear power by including them as one of the ways \nyou would meet the requirement of this clean energy portfolio standard.\n  As I am sure anybody who was paying attention to our discussion \nyesterday would know, I believe Senator Domenici made this point very \nstrongly: Since we passed the 2005 bill, there has been a resurgence in \ninterest on the part of various companies that want to build new \nnuclear powerplants. I think there are some 30 letters of intent \ncurrently pending at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating that \ncompanies are looking seriously at filing applications for the \nconstruction of new powerplants. So the expectation is that we are \ngoing to have a lot of new nuclear powerplants constructed in this \ncountry over the next decade, and I, frankly, hope we do because I \nthink that is an essential part of meeting our energy needs. But we do \nnot need to further incentivize that by including them as part of a \nrenewable or a clean energy portfolio standard as the Domenici \namendment would have us do.\n  He talks about how the amendment I have offered is strictly a wind \ntype of incentive; it is a program to encourage construction of more \nwind energy.\n  That is directly contrary to what has been stated by the Energy \nInformation Administration. In their analysis, they concluded very \nclearly that wind energy would be expected, under this amendment I have \noffered, to increase 50 percent; that biomass energy production, \nelectricity production from biomass, which is already twice as large as \nenergy production from wind, would be expected to increase 300 percent \nrather than 50 percent, as is the case with wind; and that energy \nproduction from solar would be expected to increase 500 percent. So it \nis clear to me that this is not just a wind energy amendment I have \nproposed. Our amendment talks about meeting the requirements from solar \npower, from wind power, from geothermal power, from biomass power, from \nocean.\n  The Senator from Utah was just on the Senate floor talking about his \nsupport for the idea of energy from tidal waves. We have that included. \nThat is one of the new renewable energy\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nsources which we contemplate. Incremental hydro--so that if we have a \nhydroelectric facility and one wants to increase the amount of power \nfrom that facility, we count that against the requirement; landfill \ngases as well. So I think all of that is included, and all of it would \nbe increased significantly.\n  Let me also talk about the issue of subsidies. I went through a list \nof the various subsidies we provide in the 2005 bill for the nuclear \npower industry, and I support every one of those. I think that was the \nright thing to do. But let me just be clear that we have subsidies for \na great many types of energy sources, including tax deductions, loan \nguarantees, liability insurance, and provisions for leasing of public \nlands at below-market prices. Some, like the depletion allowance for \noil and gas, are permanent subsidies that are built into the Tax Code, \nand I am not suggesting they need to be repealed. I am just pointing \nout the largest subsidy--and I think any economist would make this \npoint and would agree with this point--the largest subsidy is an \ninvisible subsidy, the fact that the environmental impacts from use of \nfossil fuels are nowhere reflected in the cost of those energy sources. \nThat is what has caused our problem with greenhouse gas emissions. That \nis why--it does not cost anything to pump 100 tons of CO2 or \nother greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. There is no cost to the \nperson who is producing their energy for those fossil fuels. There is a \ncost to society, and we are beginning to understand what that cost is. \nBut the idea of a major impetus for the renewable portfolio standard I \nhave offered is that we would reduce dramatically these greenhouse gas \nemissions and provide incentives for the development of these other \ntechnologies. There are already incentives for the improvement in the \ndevelopment or improved use of nuclear power for energy production, \nand, as I say, I support those.\n  Let me also talk a little about this proposal that States can opt \nout. First, let me mention that the Secretary can add others. I think \nthat is a very major loophole, for us to essentially say to the \nSecretary of Energy: It is up to you; if you find something else that \nyou believe ought to be included in the way we meet essentially this 16 \npercent requirement, then add that in. I think the idea that States can \nopt out is unfortunate, indeed. Obviously, many States have chosen to \nput in place their own renewable portfolio standards. Nothing in my \namendment in any way overrides those States' proposals.\n  What we try to do with the proposal I put forward is to set a \nnational minimum. We say you should at least do this 15 percent. If you \nwant to do something else, have a go at it. If your laws provide for \nsomething else, then so much the better. But we do not say to States: \nYou can opt out of any Federal requirement. I think to do so \nessentially eliminates any coherence we might have in the system.\n  Let me conclude my comments at this point by saying that my own \nreading of the proposal Senator Domenici has made here as a second-\ndegree amendment to mine is that it really gets us to the worst of all \nlocations in the debate or in our deliberations on this issue. It is a \nFederal program that does not result in the generation of electricity \nfrom clean energy sources beyond what otherwise would be expected to \nhappen at any rate. But it does require utilities to go through very \nextensive efforts to track and buy and sell credits and comply with a \nregulatory regime. The Government would have to establish a credit-\ntrading scheme, a tracking system, a monitoring system, regulations for \nimplementation--a whole panoply of Government machinery--but they would \ndo so in order to achieve a result that could have been achieved \nwithout the implementation of the proposed amendments.\n  So I think it would be an unfortunate provision for us to adopt. I \nhope my colleagues will agree with that and will vote against the \nDomenici proposal and, of course, as I said earlier in the debate, a \nvote in favor of the one I propose.\n\n  Let me conclude with that. I know my colleague may wish to speak some \nmore, and I know there are others coming to the floor intending to \nspeak as well, and there may be additional opportunities for me to add \nto these comments as the afternoon progresses.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would say to Senator Bingaman that I \nhave nothing to say now for myself, but I did want to tell him there \nare a couple of Senators coming shortly. I know about the time they are \ncoming. I don't want to speak before they come, but if Senator Bingaman \nwants to proceed rapidly, we could do that. It will be 15 or 20 minutes \nbefore they arrive.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSnowe from Maine be added as a cosponsor to the underlying amendment I \nhave sent to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will speak for a few moments. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee is here and waiting for some charts to visit about the \nissue that is before us, RPS versus CPS standards, that drive the \nmarketplace toward cleaner fuels, renewable fuels, and a variety of \ndifferent packages.\n  A few moments ago, I mentioned, when the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, produced a letter from the American Wind Energy Association, \nthat in part I believe CPS, based on their point of view, had been \nsomewhat mischaracterized by that letter. Now, here is someone who \nsupports wind. The Senator from Idaho strongly supports wind. We see \nwindmills, large windmills, going up across Idaho. The Senator from \nTennessee would come out there and say: Oops, there goes the landscape. \nThere goes the vista. The Senator from Idaho is a little concerned \nabout that, too, because some of those beautiful high plateaus of Idaho \nare now being dotted with windmills.\n  At the same time, there is no question that wind remains a valuable \nsource, and we are subsidizing it and supporting it. But I don't think \nwe ought to bias the marketplace toward it entirely, and that is why \nyou now see a new standard offered as a second-degree amendment called \nCPS, clean portfolio standard.\n  When I say that, let me make the point that is important, that I \nthink is critical. The American Wind Energy Association, when they \nmischaracterized clean portfolio standard, did so in the following \nways: The proposed CPS clearly requires carbon capture and storage. \nThey say it does not. The word ``sequestration'' means carbon capture \nand storage, and you don't get a credit for it until you do it. I think \nthat is clear. I think that was a mischaracterization. CPS clearly \nstates that any additional clean technologies beyond already \nhighlighted would require the Secretary of Energy to determine, if they \napply through a rulemaking process. In other words, no easy rides and \nno opt-out.\n  We have 23 States that have some form of RPS, renewable portfolio \nstandard. They have done it on their own. The Senator from New Mexico \nmakes that point very clearly. There is a desire in our country today \nto move us toward renewables and a cleaner portfolio standard, but \nthere is no opt-out in CPS. They come to the Secretary, and the \nSecretary certifies that which they already have, if it fits within the \nportfolio that is being proposed as a CPS. There is no State opt-out in \nthat provision. CPS allows the States with existing clean portfolio \nprograms to certify.\n  I think that is a very important and necessary statement to make. I \ndon't\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nsee that as an opt-out, I see that as conforming, giving credits to, \nand causing those who have already taken the initiative not to be \npenalized. It is arguable that the RPS that is being proposed in the \nBingaman amendment would cause them to have to reshape or conform \nbecause they are all a little different or they couldn't gain as much \ncredit under an RPS as they could a CPS. But that we don't know. What \nwe do know is, no State opts out.\n  We are now talking about a Federal standard against a myriad of State \nstandards in which 23 States have already established some form of \nrenewable portfolio. There is no uniformity in that 23-State standard, \nso, as I said, it is very difficult to comply with the standard. CPS is \nflexible enough, that it will not allow States to opt out.\n  Deduct nukes from the base. By adding nuclear--new nuclear--we will \nhave a much broader portfolio than I think Senator Bingaman's RPS. \nAdding nuclear does not detract from the accomplishments of that bill. \nIt modernizes the bill. It brings us to where America's thoughts are \ntoday, not where America's clean thoughts started in the mid-1990s. \nLet's get modern.\n  Yes, there are a lot of interest groups that have vested interests in \nthe old standard. There are a lot of interest groups in this town and \naround the Nation that move very slowly. They move the body politics of \ntheir organizations slowly so they have to argue what was then instead \nof what is now. What is now in the minds of the average American who \nlooks at new technology is: Is it clean? And if it is clean, it is \nacceptable. If it isn't clean, it isn't.\n  Idaho is privileged at being right at the top of the States of the \nNation in nonemitting sources, clean air, and less carbon. We are very \nproud of that--Vermont and Idaho. Last year, Idaho, a State that has \nlargely accepted production in all forms, said no to a coal-fired \nplant. They said no because it wasn't as clean as they wanted it to be. \nBut if it were a plant that could sequester, if it were a plant that \nwere clean, and it was coal, why shouldn't it count today in a new \nstandard?\n  Why shouldn't the marketplace incentivize cleanliness--nonemitting \nsources--instead of the old nonemitting sources of the past--wind and \nbiomass? But biomass, under current technologies, emits some \nCO2. It is much cleaner than most, but depending on the \ntechnology involved, is not a perfect form, if you will, compared to \nwind. But it is renewable, so under that definition, while it is not as \nclean as we would like it to be, and it will be in the future because \nit is renewable, it fits into the old standard.\n  I think those are profound arguments that bring us to where we are \ntoday. And I would like to say to the American Wind Energy Association: \nYou are not disadvantaged under CPS, but you are not exclusive to the \nmarket. You have to share the riches of growth in a clean technology \nwith other forms as they come along. Yes, you will be subsidized, but \nyou will not have exclusivity.\n  I think for the West and for the marvelous open spaces and the vistas \nof the West, that is not all a bad idea. While I promote wind, and wind \nis now coming to Idaho, I don't think it ought to be exclusive in the \nmarket. As I have said before, and the maps have been shown, why \ndisadvantage the Southeast? Why say to the Southeast you have to go buy \nit because you can't produce it? Let's give them an opportunity to be \nas clean as everyone else wants to be by giving them the advantages of \nall that is necessary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nand colleague from Idaho. I would just direct a question to him and see \nif I am confused or he is confused, or just where the confusion lies. \nHe says there is not authority in the Domenici proposal, the clean \nenergy proposal; that there is not authority for a State to opt out. \nHere is the sentence on page 9 of that legislation. It says:\n\n       On submission by the Governor of a State to the Secretary--\n\n  That is the Secretary of Energy--\n\n     of a notification that the State has in effect, and is \n     enforcing, a State portfolio standard that substantially \n     contributes to the overall goals of the Federal clean \n     portfolio standard under this section, the State may elect \n     not to participate in the program under this section.\n\n  Now, that clearly states, as I understand it, that it is entirely up \nto the State whether it chooses to participate in the program or \nchooses not to participate in the program, and there is no discretion \non the part of the Secretary of Energy about it at all. There is no \ncertification required by the Secretary of Energy. There is no \nrequirement that the State program meet any particular standard other \nthan it contribute to the overall goals of the Federal standard.\n  To me, that means a State can opt out of the Federal program, unless \nI am misreading it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I can't argue whether the Senator is or is \nnot misreading. The intent is for the Secretary of DOE to certify that \nthe State meets those standards, and if the State meets the standard \nthat you and I would put forth, then why don't they have a chance to \nstand down for a time? It is a question of meeting the standard, not \nignoring the standard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Well, Mr. President, let me just reiterate that the \nclear language of the statute states if the State determines that it \nhas a ``portfolio standard that substantially contributes to the \noverall goals of the Federal clean portfolio standard, then the State \nmay elect not to participate in the program.''\n  To me, that is a clear opt-out for the State. There is no requirement \nthat anybody certify or anything else. If I were Governor of New \nMexico, I could type up a letter, send it off to the Secretary and say \nwe are opting out--include us out--and that clearly would let me out of \nthe program.\n  So I don't think the bill says what the Senator has indicated.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Well, if it doesn't, I am one who would change that. It is \nclearly not my intent, nor I believe the intent of CPS, to allow States \nto opt out. It is to broaden the portfolio standard, not to opt out \nbecause I think, with 23 States now moving in that direction, there is \na recognition of the value of some of this. If there needs to be a \ncorrection for your satisfaction as the chairman of the committee, I am \ncertainly one who is willing to make that. But it was my understanding \nand my reading of the language that the Secretary of DOE has the right \nto certify, and in certifying could allow based on the standard met an \nopt-out.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my \nfriend. I would just say he is describing a provision in an amendment \nthat is not before us. I want to point that out to my colleagues.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we obviously have a disagreement as to what \nis or is not. But I think we both agree on a principle that we have \njust talked about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think now would be a good time for a \nformer Governor to enter the discussion with my two distinguished \ncolleagues. I think the biggest compliment I have been paid in the \nshort time I have been a Senator was by some Washington insider who \nsaid, ``Well, the problem with Lamar is he hasn't gotten over being \nGovernor yet.''\n  I have said to my constituents in Tennessee, ``If I ever do, it is \ntime to bring me home.''\n  As I listened to the discussion between the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from Idaho, I was greatly encouraged by the discussion \nof the Senator from Idaho until the very last part. I think there \nshould be an opt-out. Why should there not be? What wisdom is there \nhere in Washington, DC that is not there in state and local government?\n  When I was in Tennessee, I thought I was at least as smart as the \nCongress of the United States. I woke up every day trying to do what \nwas best for my State. I fought for better schools, clean water, clean \nair, raising family incomes, paying teachers more. If I had to wait on \nWashington to do it, we would never have done it. I knew of a lot of \npeople who flew to Washington and suddenly got smart, but I didn't \nthink they were smarter than we were.\n  On issues of clean air, we Tennesseans, for example, feel like we \ncare about it a lot. I live right next to the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park. I grew up there. Five generations of my family are \nburied there. We have a great big clean-air problem.\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\n  I might say, both Senators from New Mexico are two of the very finest \nin our body in terms of their ability, intelligence, dedication, and \npurposes. I happen to have a little disagreement on this issue with \nSenator Bingaman from New Mexico, but let me go back to my point.\n  Growing up and living at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park makes me very aware of clean air and the need for it, \nwhich is why, 2 or 3 years ago, with Senator Carper, I began to work in \nthe Congress for stronger standards so we could do more in Tennessee. \nThat is why, as Governor of Tennessee, I pushed ahead for more and why, \nas a citizen of Tennessee, I went to the Tennessee Valley Authority and \nencouraged them to adopt standards that would get more of the sulfur \nout of the air and more of the nitrogen out of the air. That is why I \nhave encouraged the Governor of Tennessee to go further than the \nFederal Government is in getting mercury out of power plant emissions \ninto the air, 90 percent instead of 70 percent. That is why I have been \nmeeting with mayors and local county officials in Tennessee to clean \nthe air. We care about it in Tennessee.\n  It is not necessarily true that it takes wisdom from Washington to \ncause us to want to have clean air or carbon-free air. Witness the fact \nthat we are already on the honor roll of states leading the way in \nemissions-free electricity generation.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont, right in front of me, presiding. He \nshould be very proud of Vermont as his state is No. 1 in the country in \nterms of carbon-free emissions. Vermont generates its electricity from \nforms that are free of carbon emissions. I assume that among Senator \nBingaman's goals in the energy legislation before us is to encourage \ncarbon-free emissions so that we can deal with climate change. I happen \nto be one of those who believe climate change is a problem and that \nhuman beings are a big part of the problem. I am ready to help deal \nwith the problem.\n  But I think that we already are helping in Tennessee--that is my \npoint. In this case, we need Washington to recognize what States are \ndoing to solve this problem and not assume that a one-size-fits-all \nidea which might be good for New Mexico, or which might be good for \nNorth Dakota, also is good for Tennessee.\n  Tennessee is 16th in terms of carbon-free emissions. In other words, \nwe produce about 40 percent of our electricity today from nuclear power \nand from hydroelectric power. All forms of power have their issues. \nHydroelectric power means you dam up rivers. Some people don't like \nthat. I have some problems with that, too, sometimes. With nuclear \npower, we have to get rid of the waste, and we have not solved that \nproblem yet. But the one problem we have solved with hydro and nuclear \nis that they are clean in terms of emission--no carbon, no mercury, no \nsulfur, no nitrogen. That is 40 percent of the power in the Tennessee \nValley Authority region, and in the State of Tennessee.\n  I might say: I have a great idea. I am now in Washington. I am not \nGovernor anymore. I want to require everybody in America to have a 40-\npercent emissions-free energy standard, and the way they should do it \nis to have 33 percent nuclear power and 7 percent hydropower because \nthat is my idea. That is the way we do it. So, North Dakota, have at \nit, start building nuclear plants, start damming up whatever river you \nhave left. I have an idea. That is the way you should it.\n  I wouldn't say that because I believe in federalism. I believe that a \nlot of the best ideas come up from States toward the Federal \nGovernment. I have noticed how, over time, California has led the \ncountry in terms of clean air and clean water. I know Senator \nBingaman's bill would permit us to go further in some ways, but it does \nnot in other ways. What happens with the amendment from the Senator \nfrom New Mexico is this: Even though we are on the honor roll in \nTennessee, and getting better--I mean, not only did the TVA just reopen \nthe Unit 1 reactor at the Brown's Ferry Nuclear Plant, it is operating \ntoday at 100 percent capacity.\n  I will say a little more in a minute, if my colleagues will tolerate \nit.\n  The one wind farm we have in the whole Southeastern United States, \nthe Buffalo Mountain Project in Tennessee, operated 7 percent of the \ntime in August when we are all sitting on our porches, sweating and \nfanning ourselves and wanting our air-conditioners on, so wind energy \ndoesn't help us in our part of the country. So we are at 40 percent \nemissions-free electricity generation. So how about a 40-percent \nportfolio standard for the whole country, with 33 percent nuclear power \nand 7 percent hydropower?\n\n  That probably wouldn't be fair to North Dakota. It might not be fair \nto some other States that have, as the brown color indicates on this \nchart here, a good bit of wind. They can use wind. They like wind. They \ndon't mind having great big 300-, 400-, 500-foot white towers with \nflashing red lights you can see for 20 miles. If they want to see them, \nI guess that is their business. If they want them and it makes sense \nout there, fine. That is their State. But no more would I impose our \nformula for being clean on them than should they impose their formula \nfor being clean on us. That is the problem with the Bingaman amendment, \nI respectfully suggest.\n  Here we are on the honor roll for being clean. We are getting better. \nTVA is thinking we might open a second nuclear reactor, maybe a third \nnuclear reactor. Maybe within 10 years--which in energy-producing time \nis a short period of time--we would be up to 40 percent of nuclear \npower, 7 or 8 percent of hydropower, and we might be in favor of making \neverybody do a 47-percent renewable portfolio standard based on our \nformula. We hope by that time that biomass, which is permitted under \nthe amendment from Senator Bingaman, as I understand it, will increase \nin Tennessee. We have a great capacity, we believe, for biomass, \nespecially as fuel for cars.\n  The President of the University of Tennessee was here this morning--\nDr. Peterson--talking with me about a demonstration project they have, \nabout ethanol plants that are planned there. We are right in the center \nof the nation's population. We have a lot of land. We have a good \nagricultural base. Switchgrass could replace the tobacco income we used \nto have in Tennessee. We used to have 60,000 to 80,000 farms with a \nlittle independent income up in the mountains like you have in the \ngreat northern kingdom of Vermont. That would be great for us, so we \nhope biomass really works.\n  We like solar. I am the sponsor of the solar tax credit that passed \nCongress 2 years ago. It is not enough, but I sponsored it. I got an \naward from the solar industry for being for that renewable power. I \nalso worked with the Farm Bureau on renewable power called biomass. We \nhave the largest production plant for solar technology in America in \nMemphis in the Sharp plant, producing the solar panels you put on your \nroof. We hope all this works. We even hope there might be maybe a solar \nthermal steam plant someday. It is not there today.\n  TVA needs 31,000 or 32,000 megawatts of power every year to provide \nus with clean, reliable, inexpensive electricity, and the potential for \nsolar with the present technology, the TVA says, is less than a \nMegawatt. The solar industry would say it is more. What if it is five \ntimes more? What if it is 10 megawatts, or 20 megawatts? There is not \nsufficient potential in the next 10 years for solar and wind in the \nsoutheast--which I will show in a moment we have virtually none of--to \nmeet this idea.\n  So, what do we get to do? We get to pay a big tax, a great big tax. \nWhat good does the tax do us? It comes out of our pockets. We send it \nto Washington, and we never see it again. How much is it? It is $410 \nmillion a year, according to the Tennessee Valley Authority's \nscientists, to meet Senator Bingaman's 15 percent renewable portfolio \nstandard. That is real money. By the end of the ramp-up time in the \nBingaman amendment, which is the year 2020, it would cost, according to \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies Tennessee with \nelectricity, it would cost the ratepayers $410 million to do what, to \npay a tax to Washington, DC. It wouldn't clean our air. We are already \non the honor roll for emission-free electricity production. It would \njust increase our cost. In fact, that money might come from money we \nmight otherwise spend to clean our air.\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\n  But here is what we could do with $410 million. We could give away \n205 million $2 light bulbs and have the energy savings equivalent to \ntwo nuclear power reactors, or it would be the equivalent of 3,700 \ngreat big wind turbines that would stretch along all the scenic ridge \nlines in east Tennessee, and nobody would come to east Tennessee to \nvisit, to see our mountains. Most people who live there would go hide \nunder a rug so we wouldn't have to see these white towers with flashing \nred lights that you can see from 10 or 12 miles away instead of the \nmountains. We could pay the electric bill for every Tennessean for a \nmonth and a half each year with $410 million or we could purchase a new \nscrubber. We have some coal-fired powerplants. About 60 percent of our \nelectricity comes from coal. TVA has done a fairly good job of cleaning \nup the air with that, but they have a long way to go. Sulfur scrubbers \nare the main thing they need. They are very expensive, and we could put \na new one on every 9 months with $410 million cost per year. That is \nwhat we could better do with $410 million rather than send it up here \nto Washington, DC.\n  Here is a letter I got today from the mayor of Chattanooga, TN, \nHarold DePriest--not the mayor, president and chief executive officer \nof the power company in Chattanooga. I probably should let Senator \nCorker read this letter since he used to be the mayor in Chattanooga. \nBut he says:\n\n       The Bingaman amendment, if enacted into law, would have an \n     enormous adverse economic impact on our community. It would \n     result in a two-cent per kilowatt-hour tax on all electric \n     kilowatt hours that are used in the Chattanooga EPB service \n     area. We have projected the cost burden that will be imposed \n     upon those in our service area during the years 2010 through \n     2020. It appears the local government, local schools, the \n     universities, businesses and all citizens (including those in \n     fixed incomes and having a difficult financial time as it is) \n     will have to pay the additional sum of more than $133,000,000 \n     . . . over 10 years for their electrical service.\n\n  Those are the workers, and those are the businesses. When businesses \ncome to Tennessee--when Nissan comes or Saturn comes, when Eastman \nthinks about staying--what is one of the things they want to know? Can \nwe get reliable, low-cost electric power? Today, we can say yes.\n  Every time we add an unnecessary charge on that rate, we drive jobs \nout of Tennessee and we cause people who cannot afford their bills to \npay them.\n  I believe Senator Bingaman would say, and I will let him say it on \nhis own behalf, as we develop more renewable power or other forms of \npower--I am a big subscriber to this--we bring down the price of \nnatural gas. I helped introduce a bill called the Natural Gas Price \nReduction Act, and I worked with Senators Bingaman and Domenici to try \nto stimulate growth in other forms of power to bring down the price of \nnatural gas. So he is absolutely right. If we create new forms of \nenergy, we will have less reliance on natural gas, and we want less \nreliance on natural gas. We don't want to be using natural gas to make \nelectricity.\n  As we say often: It is like burning the antiques to make a fire. So \nhe is right about that. Why shouldn't we say but one other form is \nnuclear power. It is clean, it is reliable, and it is another form to \nconsider. And the more we have it, the less natural gas we have to use.\n  I also have a letter from Huntsville. This is in Alabama. I would not \nwant you to think I was only arguing on behalf of one State. \nHuntsville, Alabama. ``Dear Senator Shelby,'' in this case. The letter \ngoes on to talk about the severe penalties and the extra costs and the \nobjection they have to this new tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point \nthe two letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                          EPB,\n\n                                   Chattanooga, TN, June 13, 2007.\n     Re Energy Bill--S.B. 1419.\n\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: I am writing out of concern for the \n     citizens of the greater Chattanooga area who receive their \n     electrical service from the Chattanooga Electric Power Board \n     (``Chattanooga EPB''). We understand that debate is presently \n     taking place on Energy Bill, S.B. 1419. We also understand \n     that Senator Bingaman will propose an amendment to the Energy \n     Bill that will, in our opinion, have severe financial \n     consequences upon the citizens of the greater Chattanooga \n     area, who are served by Chattanooga EPB in Hamilton County, \n     and parts of Bradley, Marion, Sequatchie, and Bledsoe \n     Counties.\n       We at Chattanooga EPB are asking that you do everything in \n     your power to oppose the Bingaman Amendment, and to encourage \n     your fellow Senators to also vote ``no'' with you to defeat \n     it. We do not oppose energy conservation or the use of \n     renewable resources. But the Bingaman Amendment is not the \n     right way to get it done.\n       The Bingaman Amendment, if enacted into law, would have an \n     enormous adverse financial impact upon our community. It \n     would result in a two-cent per kilowatt-hour tax on all \n     electric kilowatt hours that are used in the Chattanooga EPB \n     service area. We have projected the cost burden that will be \n     imposed upon those in our service area during the years 2010 \n     through 2020. It appears that local government, local \n     schools, the universities, businesses, and all citizens \n     (including those in fixed incomes and have a difficult \n     financial time as it is) will have to pay the additional sum \n     of more than $133,000,000 (collectively as a group) over 10 \n     years for their electrical service.\n       The frustrating part of the Bingaman Amendment, if enacted \n     into law, will be the injustice imposed upon our community. \n     There are several states that are blessed with plentiful \n     resources of renewable energy. These states would receive \n     favorable treatment under Senator Bingaman's Amendment, \n     whereas we in Tennessee and the TVA Region would not. We here \n     do not have the same abundant renewable resources available \n     to us. In effect, we are penalized, and penalized \n     significantly, simply because of geography.\n       One reason that Chattanooga EPB is in such a difficult \n     situation under the Bingaman Amendment, as contrasted with \n     utilities in some other parts of the country, is that the \n     amendment is directed at utilities that have their own \n     generation. Because the Tennessee Valley Authority supplies \n     all requirements needed to for the Chattanooga EPB service \n     area, and has an all-requirements contract with Chattanooga \n     EPB, it is impossible for Chattanooga EPB to meet the \n     requirements of the Senator Bingaman's renewal portfolio \n     standard (``RPS'') amendment to S.B. 1419. Senator Bingaman's \n     Amendment requires that utilities such as Chattanooga EPB \n     obtain 15 percent of energy sales from new renewable sources \n     by the year 2020. While Senator Bingaman's Amendment does \n     allow an option for Chattanooga to buy renewal ``credits'' \n     from U.S. Department of Energy, it is at the two-cent per \n     kilowatt-hour rate in order to meet the RPS that the Bingaman \n     Amendment would dictate.\n       We would appreciate your exerting all efforts within your \n     power to defeat this horrific renewal energy ``tax''; and \n     that you oppose, argue against, vote against, and secure all \n     of the assistance that can be mustered from your fellow \n     Senators to see that this Amendment is not enacted into law.\n       I am available if there is any additional information that \n     we can supply to you in your efforts to help us.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Harold E. DePriest,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Huntsville Electric Utility Board,\n\n                                                    June 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shelby: The Senate is now debating an \n     amendment to the Energy Bill, specifically a Renewable \n     Portfolio Standard (RPS) Amendment. This amendment requires \n     all electric systems that sell more than 4 million megawatt \n     hours of energy a year to generate specific percentages of \n     their load profile from renewable resources. By 2010, \n     Huntsville Utilities would have to have 3.75% of its load \n     coming from renewable generation sources (solar, wind, etc.); \n     by 2013, 7.5% of the load from renewable generation; by 2017, \n     11.25% and by 2020, 15% of load coming from renewable \n     generation.\n       Huntsville Utilities is under a long-term, 100% contract \n     with TVA and is prevented by contract from developing its own \n     resources and from purchasing any form of energy supply from \n     any other power supply vendor. Further, Congress would have \n     to pass laws that would allow Huntsville Utilities to use the \n     TVA transmission system to bring in power from other power \n     supply vendors.\n       Severe penalties are levied for not meeting the Renewable \n     Portfolio Standard. Penalties to Huntsville in 2010 would be \n     $4.2 million; in 2013, $8.8 million; in 2017, $14.1 million, \n     and in 2020, $19.8 million.\n       Huntsville Utilities depends on TVA to provide renewable \n     energy resources, since it is prohibited from generating our \n     own energy, or purchasing energy from other power providers \n     by the TVA contract.\n       Penalties in 2010 of $4.2 million for not meeting the \n     standard are nothing more than a tax on the citizens of \n     Huntsville. Huntsville Utilities is being placed in a no-win \n     situation if this standard passes.\n       Huntsville Utilities is a public power system which is non-\n     profit and receives all of its energy resources from TVA, \n     which is a public power generation and transmission provider \n     to its 158 captive customers. Huntsville Utilities needs to \n     be exempted from the provisions of the Renewable Portfolio \n     Standards (RPS). TVA needs to be the provider of\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\n     these renewable energy resources to its customers.\n       TVA's hydro and nuclear generation systems need to be used \n     as a replacement for solar and wind, since hydro and nuclear \n     energy generation are non-polluting.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald W. Boles,\n                                                    Vice Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see some other Senators on the floor. \nI see Senator Domenici, Senator DeMint, and there are other Senators \nhere. But I want to wind up my comments in this way with a couple of \npictures to summarize the point.\n  It is a laudable goal to move us as rapidly as we can to renewable \nenergy. But we should allow the States to move in ways that fit those \nStates. So I think there should be an opt-out for States. I think \nTennessee should be able to say: We have a 40-percent clean power \nstandard, but it is nuclear and hydro. We are working hard on biomass. \nAs soon as we get that going, we will have 50 percent. But we do not \nhave sufficient wind resources not located in our scenic mountains. In \naddition, wind is enormously subsidized. We will be getting more to \nthat this year.\n  Let's put up this chart.\n  TVA looked all around for a place to locate the first and only \nutility scale wind energy project in the southeast. First they looked \ndown on Lookout Mountain. The people there spent 30 years restoring the \nnatural beauty to this historic location. They did not want to see a \n400-foot tower they could see from the whole area up there. So they \nfinally put it on Buffalo Mountain, which is also a beautiful place.\n  Here is what it looks like. They had hoped the wind would blow so \nthat it would produce 35 to 38 percent of the turbines rated capacity. \nIt operates 19 to 24 percent of the time; 7 percent in August. What \nmost people miss with wind power is you use it or lose it. So if the \nwind is not blowing, your air conditioner is off.\n  Even though you have these large wind towers all up and down every \nridge top in Tennessee, even if you had them, you would still need a \ndependable powerplant. Wind turbines do not replace your base load.\n  Here is what it looks like in West Virginia, which is north of us. It \nis a different point, but this makes strip mining look like a \ndecorative art. I mean this ruins, in my view, the tops of mountains.\n  Why would we insist on that with Federal requirements to have a State \nthat is already on the honor roll for clean power? There are other ways \nto do this rather than raise our rates, raise our taxes, drive jobs \naway, or ruin our landscape.\n  I appreciate the chance to talk about this. Wind already is highly \nsubsidized too. The best facts I have suggest we will be spending $11.5 \nbillion between 2007 and 2016, already obligated in taxpayers' money, \nto build these big wind turbines in Tennessee, which in Tennessee \noperate 7 percent of the time in August. They do not produce much power \neither. There are proposals on the Senate floor to extend the federal \nsubsidies for wind power.\n  So back to this wind project, TVA pays 6.5 cents for every kilowatt-\nhour produced by this wind project. The taxpayers pay them another 2.9 \ncents, in effect, for the production tax credit; that is 9.4 cents for \neach one here, and this would have the whole Southeast running around \nlooking for wind developers to buy further credits from. We should all \nretire from the Senate and go in the business, it looks like, if that \nis what we want to do.\n  But here is my main point, let's respect Federalism, let's honor \nthose States that are on the honor roll. Let's honor Senator Bingaman \nfor wanting to encourage renewable energy. But Senator Domenici, I \nwould respectfully say, has a better idea. He would allow new nuclear \npower, for example, to be a part of the mix.\n  My final comment would be this: As climate change has become more of \na concern, and people say we are going to have to deal with it in this \ngeneration, we have looked for ways to create large amounts of clean \nenergy. There are only two or three ways to do that.\n  The first is conservation and efficiency. We have barely scratched \nthe surface. But the second is nuclear power. Seventy percent of our \ncarbon-free electricity in America today is nuclear power. So why would \nwe exclude that from any standard that allegedly wants us to have \ncarbon-free energy? It does not make much sense to me.\n  I respectfully oppose the suggestion of the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman. I honor his service here. I honor his motives here. But I \nthink he has a solution looking for a problem. The problem is, we do \nnot have any wind in our part of the State, and a wind portfolio \nstandard simply does not work. It puts a big tax on us we do not need \nto pay, do not want to pay, does not do us any good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I yield 50 seconds of my time to \nSenator DeMint.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I will yield back to him \nimmediately.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you yield 30 seconds to me? Would that be \nacceptable to you?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Lamar Alexander, who \ngave about a 20-minute speech or 25, whatever it was, that I truly \ncommend you on your understanding of both the problem and the attempted \nsolutions here and the differences between the Bingaman amendment and \nmine. The way you present it is laudable. I thank you for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, quickly, I wish to make a request of the \nchairman. I understand the current amendment will not be finished until \ntomorrow. I wanted to get one amendment pending. I ask unanimous \nconsent to send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do object. I believe we need to \ncomplete action on the two pending amendments before we take up any \nother amendments or have other amendments pending. Obviously he can \nsend anything he wants to the desk, but as far as calling up any \namendment for consideration, I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I understand Senator Salazar is waiting \nhere. I will not be long. I appreciate his patience.\n  First, I associate myself with the words of the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander. I thought he did a fantastic job of outlining \nwhy this proposed renewable portfolio standard is not in the best \ninterests of the United States of America. I strongly oppose it because \nit has not taken into consideration the adverse effects on States that \ndepend heavily on coal, such as my home State of Ohio.\n  I also mention that we have looked at wind power for our utilities. \nIf they could use wind power they would be using it, because not only \nwould it be something that would be better taken by the citizens of \nOhio, but it also would associate them with being more green. They are \ninterested in doing that. But the fact is we do not have the \nenvironment for that to occur. So I think even though this proposal is \nwell intentioned, and I share his concern about reducing greenhouse \ngases, I believe his proposal will cause great economic distress for \nminimal benefit.\n  What we need to do when we are looking at these things is ask, what \nbenefit are we going to get out of it, and what are the costs? Figure \nit out. A one-size-fits-all Federal RPS mandate ignores the different \neconomic needs and resources of the individual States. There are \nsignificant regional differences in availability, despite renewable \nenergy resources.\n  Even among the States that have an RPS, all have chosen to add \ntechnologies that are not usually included in a Federal RPS. Because \nmany of the utilities will not be able to meet an RPS requirement \nthrough their own generation, they will be required to purchase \nrenewable energy credits from some other company. Thus, a nationwide \nRPS mandate will mean a massive wealth transfer from electric consumers \nto States with little or no renewable resources, such as Ohio, to the \nFederal Government or to States where renewables happen to be more \nabundant.\n  In my State of Ohio, we rely on coal. Eighty-eight percent of our \nelectric\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\ngeneration comes from coal. It is estimated that the proposal would \nincrease retail electricity prices by 4.3 percent, a total of a $12.8 \nbillion cost to consumers by 2030. The 4.3 percent may not seem like a \nhigh increase to many, but to a family of four on a fixed income, this \nis a huge increase. These families may have to make a decision between \npaying their winter heating bills or putting food on the table for \ntheir families.\n  I recall a couple of years ago, before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Tom Mullen of Cleveland Catholic Charities described \nthe direct impacts of significant increases in energy prices on those \nwho were less fortunate. This is a quote. He said:\n\n       In Cleveland, over one-fourth of all children live in \n     poverty and are in a family of a single family head of \n     household. These children will suffer further loss of basic \n     needs as their moms are forced to make choices of whether to \n     pay the rent or live in a shelter; pay the heating bill or \n     see their child freeze; buy food or risk the availability of \n     a hunger center. These are not choices that any senior \n     citizen, child, or for that matter, person in America should \n     make.\n\n  So, in effect, if we pass this renewable portfolio, for people who \nlive in my State--and maybe I am being a little bit selfish about the \npeople I represent, but the fact is this is going to increase their \nenergy bills. For those who are poor, for those who are elderly and on \na fixed income, this is significant.\n  Another aspect which I think we forget about is Ohio is a \nmanufacturing State. We are on the economic fault line. I wish our \neconomy were as good as the rest of the States in this country. We have \nthe same problem Michigan has. Energy costs are a huge concern of our \nmanufacturers, who use 34 percent of the energy consumed in our \neconomy. Due in large part to increased energy prices, the United \nStates has lost more than 3.1 million manufacturing jobs since 2000, \nand my State has lost nearly 220,000 jobs.\n  I will never forget in 2001 when we had the big spike in gas prices. \nI believe that was the beginning of the recession in the State of Ohio. \nMany of those small companies never recovered because, for example, in \nmy city, natural gas costs have gone up over 300 percent since 2000. \nThink about that, the impact that has. Then you add another burden on \ntop of that. Rather than enacting an artificial RPS, which will \nincrease costs to our utilities and consumers, we need to be spending \nthis money on the development of technology to reduce our greenhouse \ngases.\n  The cost of the RPS to utilities and ratepayers will be better spent \non funding the programs we authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nsuch as carbon sequestration and IGCC technology, which, as most of us \nknow, are not receiving the appropriate funding today.\n  It is clear we must get serious about partnerships and strategies \nthat maximize Federal funding. We have got to look at how much money we \nare going to raise and where can we get the biggest return on our \ndollars. I do not think RPS does that.\n  It is critical that policymakers work in conjunction with the \nscientific community to develop policy solutions that are in the best \ninterests of our State and Nation. For instance, one area requires \nfurther research to capture greenhouse gases and sequester carbon \ndioxide so we can continue to rely on coal for energy. We are the Saudi \nArabia of coal. We have 250 years of that supply. For the past few \nyears I have called for a ``Second Declaration of Independence,'' \nindependence from foreign sources of energy, for our Nation to take \nreal action toward stemming our exorbitantly high oil and natural gas \nprices. Instead of considering them separately, we must harmonize our \nenergy, environment, and economic needs. This is an absolute must as we \nconsider any additional solutions to address global warming and other \nenvironmental problems.\n  I have been here, this is my ninth year. I have been on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for 9 years. The problem in the \nSenate and in the House is that the environmental, the energy, and the \neconomic people don't get together and put each other's shoes on and \nfigure out how we can work together to not only do a better job of \ncleaning up the environment but utilizing the scarce dollars that are \navailable to make a difference.\n  This is an idea of the costs for Ohio. For example, American Electric \nPower which, while I was Governor, put on a $650 million scrubber to \nreduce their NOx and SOx, it is going to cost \nthem $3 billion between 2010 and 2030; First Energy, $3.18 billion to \n$4.6 billion; Duke--this is also another provider of energy--$1.6 \nbillion.\n  Let's take the Timken Company, the heart and soul of Camden, OH. \nTheir incremental cost of electricity under a 15-percent RPS will \nexceed $20 million per year. They say:\n\n       We would not expect to recoup most of this increased cost \n     through price increases due to the global competition that we \n     face. Adoption of a mandatory RPS would clearly place The \n     Timken Company at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis our \n     foreign competitors, further eroding already slim profit \n     margins, and placing increasingly more jobs at risk.\n\n  We really ought to think about what we are doing here today. I don't \nthink what we want to do is advantage one area of the country by having \na cost increase in another part of the country and see a massive \nshifting of resources. What we should do is look at the big picture and \nfigure out, as Senator Alexander pointed out, where do we put our money \nwhere we can get the greatest return on our investment. I sincerely \nbelieve this isn't the way to do it. Why would we want to do something \nthat will take a State such as Ohio, that is 80 percent reliant on \ncoal, and basically tell our utilities: Folks, you are going to have to \nbuy renewable energy from somebody else, pay the money out, and then \nincrease your rates, increase the rates to the folks in our inner \ncities, when they could be taking that same money and putting more of \nit into, for example, ISGC, the integrated gas-combined cycle. AEP is \ngoing to build a 1,000-megawatt plant that is going to cost an enormous \namount of money. That is where they should be putting their money. They \nshould be putting their money into technology so that we can capture \ncarbon and sequester it.\n  Those are the things that would really make a difference. We are \nfooling ourselves to say we are going to pass this legislation, and it \nis going to make a big difference. I argue that it is going to make \nlittle difference, and we could spend our money on things that are \ngoing to make more of a difference in terms of cleaning up the \nenvironment and dealing with some of the problems we all know this \ncountry faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me start by thanking Senator \nBingaman, chairman of the committee, and Senator Domenici, ranking \nmember, for their fine work in producing the Energy bill before us \ntoday. This energy legislation is important for our country as we move \ntoward energy independence. It is strong on alternative fuels. It is \nstrong on energy efficiency. Through the work of the Commerce \nCommittee, it has strong CAFE standards that will make all the \ndifference in the world in terms of how we use transportation fuels. It \nalso begins to do some important work with respect to carbon \nsequestration. This is good legislation. The amendments and debates we \nare having hopefully will build on that good legislation to get us to \nthe point where we can deliver to the President a good bill.\n  The President said in his State of the Union that one of the things \nhe wanted us to work on was moving forward to get rid of our addiction \nto foreign oil. It is our hope that by working together in a bipartisan \nfashion, as we did in the Energy Committee, we will be able to move \nforward with respect to reaching that vision of energy independence for \nthe United States.\n  Let me say that I am here to speak in support of the Bingaman \nproposal which I am cosponsoring on a renewable electricity standard \nfor the Nation. Let me at the outset say, we in the Congress, we in the \nNation should not be afraid. We should not be afraid of having a robust \nrenewable electrical standard, called an RES, a renewable portfolio \nstandard. There will be significant benefits that will help our \neconomies. It will help rural communities, it will help our \nenvironment, if we have a robust national standard for renewable \nelectricity.\n  Some may say: How do you know that? I have heard my colleagues on the \nother side of this amendment arguing that we don't need a national\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\nstandard because it will harm particular States or areas. There were \nlots of people in my State in Colorado in 2004, just a short 2 years \nago, who made the same argument, that if we passed an RPS in my State \nof Colorado in 2004, we would see a parade of horribles coming down the \npike.\n  Well, in 2004, the voters of Colorado decided on their own they were \ngoing to take this measure to the voters of the State, and they passed \na renewable portfolio standard of 10 percent by the year 2015. Because \nColorado's efforts have been so successful in the last 2 years, the \ngeneral assembly this year decided to double that standard to 20 \npercent by the year 2015. What had been the parade of horribles has not \nbeen a parade of horribles in Colorado with respect to the RPS. It has \nbeen a parade of celebration with respect to what we have been able to \naccomplish on the ground.\n  Let me refer to two very significant economic facts and initiatives \nwithin our State. One relates to wind. Two years ago, we had a very \nsmall wind farm. It produced just a few megawatts of power. That was 2 \nyears ago. Fast-forward to today. Because of the RPS, in Colorado, \ntoday we now have four major wind farms in operation. We have two more \nwind farms currently under construction. By the time we finish a year \nfrom now, those wind farms will be producing 1,000 megawatts of \nelectricity.\n  Let's put that in a context so people can understand what we are \ntalking about with respect to 1,000 megawatts. One thousand megawatts \nis about the equivalent of what we would produce with three coal-fired \npowerplants. We were able to do that with the power of the wind in less \nthan 2 years.\n\n  What has been the benefit for Colorado? First and foremost, we are \ncontributing to the economy of our State because there were counties, \nsuch as Weld, Logan and Prowers Counties that I refer to as forgotten \nAmerica because they have such limited opportunities out in those rural \ncommunities that struggle on the vine every day. What has happened is \nthe RPS has injected a new economic vigor into those rural communities. \nIt is something about which the bankers, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, are all very happy and excited. It is something about which the \nschool boards are very excited as well because it has brought \nsignificant additional tax revenue into the coffers of some of the \nrural school districts that suffer from not having enough money for \nschools or for other public needs.\n  It also has made sure the people of Colorado understand that they are \ncontributing to the environmental security of our Nation. We are past \nthe debate in this Nation as to whether global warming is a reality. \nThe people in my State recognize they are making a significant \ncontribution to dealing with the issue of global warming because they \npassed an RPS which has been a good RPS. In fact, it has been so good \nin terms of acceptance by the people of Colorado, almost without a \nwhimper the requirement was doubled this year so that now we in \nColorado will be producing 20 percent of our electricity from renewable \nenergy resources by the year 2015. That is not a long way away. We are \nnot talking 2050 or 2040. We are already at 2007. So within 8 years in \nColorado, we are going to be producing 20 percent of our energy from \nrenewable energy resources.\n  It is not just wind. I come from what is one of the most remote and \nrural, poorest areas in the United States. The place is called the San \nLuis Valley. It is a place where you have to struggle to make a living. \nBut it is a place also that is embracing the new ethic of renewable \nenergy, driven in large part by the renewable portfolio standard we \nhave in Colorado. Because of that RPS, the largest utility in our \nState, Xcel, has broken ground on the largest solar utility generator \nin the United States. That solar electrical utility farm, which is now \nunder construction in my native valley, is creating jobs for the people \nof the valley. It is something we are very proud of.\n  With the advances being made in solar technology, there is no reason \nin most of our States we would not be able to create a robust addition \nfor our electrical needs that actually is powered from the Sun.\n  Our experience in Colorado with respect to a renewable portfolio \nstandard, a renewable electrical standard, has been an absolutely \npositive one. It was one that was approached with some trepidation a \nfew years ago. Today it is wholly embraced. I ask my colleagues in this \nChamber today to look at the RPS as something that, in fact, is a great \nopportunity for the people of this country. If it worked for the State \nof Colorado, it can also work for the rest of the Nation.\n  Let me also say that Colorado is not alone. If you look at a map of \nthe United States and look at all of the States that have passed a \nrenewable portfolio standard, they are from all parts of the country. \nWe now have at least 22 States that have adopted their own renewable \nportfolio standard. So if we have 22 States plus the District of \nColumbia that have already adopted a renewable portfolio standard, does \nit not make sense, instead of having a patchwork of regulation from one \nState to another, where you essentially have no RPS in one and a \ndifferent RPS in another, that we have a national standard? From my \npoint of view, it does.\n  The mechanism that has been set forth by Senator Bingaman in this \nlegislation will allow us to have that renewable portfolio standard and \nalso will allow us to take into account the different renewable \nresources for electrical production that we have from State to State. I \nam very hopeful that the RES before us will ultimately make it into \nlaw.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the primary benefits I see from this \nRES. The first is that it will bolster our renewable energy production \nby creating certainty in renewable energy markets. With an RES, \nproducers, developers, and manufacturers know that there is a \nguaranteed market for renewable electricity. They make long-term \ninvestments in infrastructure and renewable energy development when \nthey know that certainty is there, and that is what this national RES \nwill provide. That added stability will result in a second major \nbenefit. That is an economic benefit both to consumers and to \ncommunities that assist in production.\n  As I said, in my State consumers who have been participating in a \nprogram that Xcel has provided on a voluntary wind energy program have \nsaved a total of $14 million in 2004 and in 2005. A 2005 study of the \nEnergy Information Administration found that a modest national \nrenewable energy standard of only 10 percent--only talking in 2005 \nabout 10 percent by 2020--would result in savings to consumers of $22.6 \nbillion.\n  We are going to do better than that here because our RES we are \nproposing is 15 percent. Meanwhile, communities particularly rural \ncommunities, thrive with new jobs, with new infrastructure, and a new \neconomy that is built on invention and investment.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that a national renewable \nenergy standard of 20 percent by 2020--we are not proposing that we be \nthat ambitious in this particular amendment--that a 20-percent by 2020 \nstandard would spur $72.6 billion in new capital investment, with $16 \nbillion in income to America's farmers and ranchers, and $5 billion in \nnew local tax revenues for rural communities. That is a terrific shot \nin the arm for parts of our country that are dying for these kinds of \nopportunities.\n  Thirdly, a national renewable electricity standard will enhance our \nenvironmental security and take an important step toward reducing our \ncarbon emissions. If we were to pass a renewable electricity standard \nof 20 percent by 2020, we would reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by \nmore than 400 million tons a year--that is more than 400 million tons a \nyear. That would be equal to taking 71 million cars off of America's \nroads or the planting of 104 million trees in our country.\n  We know an RES by itself will not solve the global warming problem, \nbut it is, in fact, a significant step in the right direction.\n  I want to, once again, thank Chairman Bingaman for his leadership on \nthis amendment. It is an important addition to this bill and a leap \nahead for our Nation's energy security.\n  It is, at the end of the day, an effort for all of us to embrace a \nclean energy economy for the 21st century. A clean energy economy for \nthe 21st century is one of the imperative issues that we can grasp on, \nwe can discover on, on a\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nbipartisan basis, for America, and we can do it now in 2007. It is not \nsomething for which we have to wait until 2010 or 2011. It is something \nwe can do now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed just for \na few minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for her courtesy in allowing me to go forward.\n\n\n                         White House Subpoenas\n\n  Mr. President, the reason I speak on this sort of stage--instead of \ndoing a press conference and calling every one of you about it--today I \nhave issued, on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee, subpoenas to \nthe White House in connection with our investigation into the firing of \nU.S. attorneys around the country. I have spoken recently with Mr. \nFielding, the White House Counsel, and I have consulted with the \nranking Republican on the committee. Regrettably, to date, the White \nHouse has not produced a single document nor allowed White House staff \nto testify, despite our repeated requests for voluntary cooperation \nover the last several months.\n  The White House's stonewalling of the congressional investigative \ncommittees continues its pattern of confrontation over cooperation. \nThose who bear the brunt of this approach are the American people, \nthose dedicated professionals at the Department of Justice who have \ntried to remain committed to effective law enforcement in spite of the \nuntoward political influences from this administration, and, thirdly, \nthe public's confidence in our justice system. That is why I believe we \nhave to do everything we can to overcome the administration's \nstonewalling and get all the facts out on the table--get the facts out \nso Republican Senators and Democratic Senators and the American people \ncan see what the facts are.\n  Actually, the White House cannot have it both ways. They cannot \nstonewall congressional investigations by refusing to provide documents \nand witnesses--or saying they might let witnesses testify behind closed \ndoors, with no transcript, no oath, which neither Republicans nor \nDemocrats would ever accept--but then simultaneously claim that nothing \nimproper ever happened. The involvement of the White House's political \noperation in these matters, including former Political Director Sara \nTaylor and her boss Karl Rove has been confirmed by information \ngathered by congressional committees.\n  Some may hope to thwart our constitutional oversight efforts by \nlocking the doors and closing the curtains and hiding things in their \ndesks, but we will keep asking until we get to the truth.\n  The House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Conyers, is likewise \nissuing and serving subpoenas today. He makes the point that these \nsubpoenas are not merely requests for information; they are lawful \ndemands on behalf of the American people through their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  So we will issue and serve three subpoenas today--two seeking the \ndocuments and testimony of Sara M. Taylor, the former Deputy Assistant \nto the President and Director of Political Affairs, and another seeking \nWhite House documents relevant to the panel's ongoing investigation.\n  Incidentally, Senator Specter and I had written to Ms. Taylor asking \nfor voluntary cooperation. We did this more than 2 months ago, on April \n11, so there would not be any need for a subpoena. We asked for \nvoluntary cooperation. Well, that did not go very far.\n\n  As I noted in my cover letter to the new White House Counsel, Mr. \nFielding, I have sent him a half dozen previous letters during the past \n3 months seeking voluntary cooperation from the White House with the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's investigation into the mass firings and \nreplacements of U.S. attorneys and politicization at the Department of \nJustice.\n  It is now clear from the evidence gathered by the investigating \ncommittees that White House officials played a significant role in \noriginating, developing, coordinating, and implementing the plan and \nthe Justice Department's response to congressional inquiries about it. \nYet to date the White House has not produced a single document or \nallowed even one White House official involved in these matters to be \ninterviewed.\n  It has been 2\\1/2\\ months since Republican and Democratic members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee rejected their take-it-or-leave-it offer \nof off-the-record, backroom interviews with no followup. We said it was \nunacceptable.\n  We have offered to try to work these things out. They have stayed the \ncourse: Take it or leave it. Take it or leave it: a backroom, closed-\ndoor meeting, with no transcript and no oath. Mr. President, I will \nleave that one quickly. As I told the White House Counsel, I would be \nsubject to legislative malpractice if I were to ever accept on the part \nof the Senate such an offer.\n  Ironically, Mr. Rove and the President have had no reluctance to \ncomment publicly that there was, in their view, no wrongdoing and \nnothing improper. But they won't even tell us what they base that on. \nThey cannot have it both ways. Their continuous stonewalling leads to \nthe obvious conclusion they have something to hide. Because they \ncontinue their refusal, I issued these subpoenas.\n  So we formally demanded--this is what it is--production of documents \nin the possession, custody, or control of the White House related to \nthe committee's investigation into the preservation of prosecutorial \nindependence and the Department of Justice's politicization of the \nhiring and firing of U.S. attorneys.\n  The documents compelled by the subpoena include documents related to \nthe administration's evaluation of and decision to dismiss former U.S. \nattorneys David Iglesias, H.E. ``Bud'' Cummins, John McKay, Carol Lam, \nDaniel Bogden, Paul Charlton, Kevin Ryan, Margaret Chiara, Todd Graves, \nor any other U.S. attorney dismissed or considered for dismissal since \nPresident Bush's reelection, the implementation of the dismissal and \nreplacement of the dismissed U.S. attorneys, and the selection, \ndiscussion, and evaluation of possible replacements. They have yet to \nbe explained.\n  Among these documents are documents related to the involvement of \nKarl Rove, Harriet E. Miers, William Kelley, J. Scott Jennings, Sara M. \nTaylor, or any other current or former White House employees or \nofficials involved in the firings and replacements, as well as \ndocuments related to the testimony of Justice Department officials to \nCongress regarding this matter--part of the reason being: What did they \ntell the Justice Department to say or, even more importantly, not to \nsay. Of course these would include the purportedly ``lost'' Karl Rove \ne-mails that should have been retrieved by now and should now be \nproduced without further delay.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer may remember when I said--at the \ntime when they said those were all lost and erased--Well, you could not \nerase them. Of course they could be found. The White House dismissively \nsaid to we computer experts up here: Of course they had been lost. Gee \nwhiz. Golly. Guess what. They seem to have been in a backup hard \ndrive--like the e-mails for all of us are, like everybody knew they \nwere, and notwithstanding the condescending, misleading statements of \nthe White House Press Secretary's Office. Of course the e-mails were \nthere.\n  I am just disappointed that now that it turns out they were not lost \nlike they claimed they were we still do not have them. We have to go to \nsubpoenas to obtain information needed by the committee to fulfill our \noversight responsibilities regarding the firings and the erosion of \nindependence at the Justice Department--probably the greatest crime \nhere. But the evidence so far--that White House officials were deeply \ninvolved--leaves me no choice, in light of the administration's lack of \nvoluntary cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I thank, again, the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for yielding. I know she was to go first. I yield the floor \nto the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, the man who \nprobably understands the necessity of subpoenas better than anybody \nelse in this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Minnesota \nfor yielding. I know she yielded to Senator Leahy; and Senator Leahy, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has made some comments which I \nthink I ought to supplement.\n  I believe when you have the subpoena issued for Ms. Sara Taylor, the \nWhite House staff, it is appropriate at this time. A letter was sent to \nMs. Taylor on April 11 requesting testimony and documents, and there \nhas been no response.\n  It is my hope, as I have said at Judiciary Committee meetings, \nexecutive sessions, that we will yet be able to work this out with Ms. \nTaylor on a cooperative basis without any further controversy.\n  The enforcement mechanism of the subpoenas is very lengthy. The last \ntime it was undertaken, with the conflict between congressional \noversight and the White House, it took more than 2 years. That would \ntake us into 2009, after the election of a new President.\n  I think with respect to the subpoena to former White House Counsel \nHarriet Miers, there again the request went out some time ago, and they \nhave not been forthcoming, and I think it is appropriate to proceed--\nagain, in a manner which looks toward conciliation, looks toward \nresolving it without controversy.\n  I talked again today to White House Counsel Fred Fielding on the \nquestion as to how we are going to obtain testimony from executive \nbranch officials who are high up in the White House, and the President \nmade a televised statement some time ago setting forth the acceptable \nparameters from the President's point of view. After reflecting on it \nand talking to members of the Judiciary Committee--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--I think that most of what the President wants can be \naccommodated.\n  He does not want his officials, his employees, put under oath. My \npreference would be to have an oath, but I would not insist on that \nbecause the testimony would be subject to prosecution under the False \nStatements Act, 18 United States Code 1001.\n  He does not want to have the sessions public. My preference again \nwould be to have them public, but I would not insist upon that.\n  He does not want to have the officials come before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, then before the House Judiciary Committee, and I \nthink we can accommodate that, having members of both committees--both \nDemocrats and Republicans--in a manageable group to obtain the \nnecessary information.\n  The one point where I think it is indispensable is that we obtain a \ntranscript. If you don't have a transcript, people walk out of the room \nin perfectly good faith and have different versions as to what \nhappened. I think it is in the interest of all sides to have a \ntranscript. It is in the interest of congressional oversight so we have \nit precise, so we can pursue questions and have them in black and white \nand know where we stand. It is important for the people whose \ndepositions are being taken that it be written down, too, so nobody can \nsay they said something they didn't say because we know what they said \nwhen it is transcribed. I am pleased to say to the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Rhode Island who is nodding in the \naffirmative, as a former U.S. attorney, attorney general, and one who \nhas had experience with transcripts, as has the chairman and I, it \nneeds to be written down.\n\n  I hope we can accommodate the competing interests here. There is no \ndoubt there are very important issues involved: The request for \nresignations from the U.S. attorneys and the reasons why they were \nreplaced. There is no doubt the President has the authority to remove \nall 93 U.S. attorneys without giving any reason. President Clinton did \nthat at the beginning of his term in 1993. I think it is equally clear \nthe President can't replace people for bad reasons. There is a \nsuggestion of pressure on the U.S. attorney from San Diego that she was \ngoing after some of former Congressman Cunningham's associates, who is \nserving an 8-year sentence, and that pressure was put on some other \nU.S. attorney in some other direction for an improper purpose, and that \nis an appropriate question for congressional oversight. We had a \nlengthy and heated debate earlier this week on the resolution to say \nthe Senate has no confidence in the Attorney General. That was defeated \non procedural grounds.\n  But the issue of the operation of the Department of Justice is not \nyet finished. This inquiry is very important. Next to the Department of \nDefense, which defends the homeland and is our military defense, next \nin line is the Department of Justice, which deals with terrorism, deals \nwith drugs, deals with violent crime and that department has to \nfunction in the interests of the American people. And getting to the \nbottom of this investigation is important for that purpose. So I wanted \nto appear to make these brief comments, following the statement by the \ndistinguished Chairman. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, last Wednesday I came to the floor and \nintroduced legislation that would place the country on a path toward a \nbetter energy future by requiring that 25 percent of our Nation's \nenergy, our Nation's electricity, come from renewable sources. This \nmade sense to me because this is what we do in Minnesota. As my \ncolleagues know, all good things come from Minnesota.\n  But today, Senator Bingaman has introduced an amendment requiring \nthat 15 percent of our Nation's electricity come from renewable \nsources. I also support Senator Bingaman, and I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Bingaman's 15 percent standard by 2020. That is because I \nbelieve our country is headed down the wrong energy path, and we need \nto take it in a new direction.\n  I can't tell my colleagues the number of times I hear from businesses \nin my State, including manufacturing companies, about the high costs \nand how they want to get some new possibilities and a new direction \nwith where their energy comes from. The money issue is one thing you \nhear about from individual consumers, that you hear about from \nbusinesses, but there is also the effect it is having on the \nenvironment. Both the Presiding Officer and I serve on the Environment \nCommittee. We have heard countless accounts from scientists from all \nover this country, from major CEOs of large businesses in this country, \nabout the change we are seeing in our climate and about the chance we \nhave to do something about it.\n  So I have to tell my colleagues, in my State I also hear from regular \npeople. I hear from hunters who see a change in the wetlands. I hear \nfrom people on Leech Lake who say it takes a month later, a month \nlonger than usual to put their fish house out. I hear from kids wearing \nlittle penguin buttons. I hear from city council members in \nLanesborough who are changing out their light bulbs. I hear from \nventure capitalists in Minneapolis who want to get some standards in \nplace so they can invest in this new green technology. I hear from \npeople up in Grand Marais, MN, where I visited 2 weeks ago. This area \nhas had tragic fires. When we saw those fires going on in California, \nthey were also raging in northern Minnesota and up into Canada. Nearly \n200 buildings were downed by this fire in our State--some of them \nbeautiful homes--homes that have been in families for years and years \nand years, rustic cabins and businesses. Of course, the people who \ngathered to meet with me had immediate problems. There was no phone \nservice to many of these places. Many of the lodges that rely on \ntourism were having trouble even taking orders. But in the middle of \nall this, with these scarred forests surrounding us, there were people \nwho wanted to talk about climate change, including ski resort owners \nwho had seen a dramatic drop in their profits when we have had less \nsnow and people who were very concerned about their businesses and the \nfuture of this country.\n  So this standard is not only important for investing in our country \nfor more jobs and putting a renewable standard in place that will spur \ninvestment, it is also important for our country's future and our \nenvironment.\n  A strong renewable energy standard is good policy. Let's look at \nwhere our electricity comes from. Currently, we have 52 percent coming \nfrom coal. We have 15 percent coming from natural gas. We have 3 \npercent from petroleum,\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\n20 percent from nuclear, 7 percent from hydro, and only 3 percent from \nrenewables. Compare this with countries such as Denmark, where they are \nseeing something akin to 50 percent coming from renewables, and Great \nBritain and other countries. What a strong renewable standard can do is \nit can diversify our electricity sources so we are not so reliant on \nenergy sources such as natural gas that are vulnerable to periodic \nshortages or other supply interruptions. A strong renewable energy \nstandard can also save the American consumer money. According to \nstudies, a 15-percent renewable electricity standard will save \nconsumers a total of $16.4 billion on their energy bills by the year \n2030.\n\n  Let's look at some of the savings. What are we going to get if we put \nin a national renewable electricity standard of the kind I have talked \nabout, which is up to 25 percent, and the kind that Senator Bingaman \nand I have sponsored here today at 15 percent by 2020? We will get \n355,000 new jobs, nearly twice as many as generating electricity from \nfossil fuels; economic development, $72.6 billion in new capital \ninvestment; $16.2 billion in income to farmers, ranchers, and rural \nlandowners; $5 billion in new local tax revenues; consumer savings of \n$49 billion in lower electricity and natural gas bills; a healthier \nenvironment with reductions in global warming, as I discussed, equal to \ntaking nearly 71 million cars off the road; less air pollution, less \ndamage to land, and better use of our water.\n  I have seen it firsthand in my State, in southwestern Minnesota, \nwhere there are wind turbines coming up everywhere. They have even \nopened a bed and breakfast near Pipestone, MN, because they are so \nexcited about these wind turbines. If you were looking for a romantic \nweekend and time away from your State of Rhode Island, you could \nactually go down there and stay overnight and wake up in the morning \nand look at a wind turbine. That is the package.\n  But the point is this: The people in that area are so excited about \nthe development and the potential manufacturing that is going on, that \nthey want people to come and see it. We also have individual homeowners \nand school districts that are trying to figure out how they can put a \nwind turbine up so they can bring that kind of homegrown renewable \nenergy into their places of business and into their homes.\n  A strong renewable energy standard is going to save us money, and it \nis going to cause this kind of investment. It is going to open the door \nto a new electricity industry that will bring thousands of jobs and \nbillions of dollars into our economy.\n  Over the last 20 years, America's renewable energy industry, and the \nwind industry in particular, has achieved significant technological \nadvancements. The industries for solar and wind and biomass are \nexpanding at rates exceeding 30 percent annually. Now, some of this is \nbecause the States--and I will talk about this in a minute--have shown \nforesight and have been ahead of the game, but we need to do more. The \nquestion is: Does the United States want to be a leader in creating new \ngreen technologies in the new green industries of the future, or are we \ngoing to sit back and watch the opportunities pass us by?\n  Tom Friedman, who actually comes from Minnesota, wrote a cover story \nfor the New York Times Magazine about a month ago about the power of \ngreen. He talked about a new green deal--not like the old New Deal; not \nnecessarily the kind of money we are talking about there, but that the \nGovernment's role should be to set those standards and industry will \nmeet them. The Government's role should be to seed new research and to \npromote green technology and direct us that way; otherwise, if we don't \ndo that, if we don't have the kind of 15 percent standard we are \ntalking about on a national level, I can tell you what is going to \nhappen because we are already seeing it happen. We no longer are the \nworld leader in two important clean energy fields. We rank third in \nwind power production behind Denmark and Spain. We are third in \nphotovoltaic power installed behind Germany and Japan. Ironically, \nthese countries have surpassed us using our own technology. They used \nthe technology we developed in our country. We came up with the right \nideas, but we didn't capitalize on the innovations with adequate \npolicies to spur deployment. The Federal Government, in fact, has been \ncomplacent. They have been watching the opportunities go by.\n  Now, this is not so of the States. I know Senator Salazar borrowed my \nchart about an hour ago, but I like this chart because it shows the \nprogress that is going on across the country. You can see it is not \nlimited to one area. It is not limited. We have heard about what \nCalifornia has done and how aggressive they are. I am always telling \nthe Senators from California it is great what you have done, but it is \nimportant to talk about what is going on in the rest of the country.\n  You look at what is happening in my own State of Minnesota: 27.4 \npercent mandated renewable standards by 2025. We have what is happening \nin New Hampshire: A 23.8 standard by 2025. We have Maine, which \nactually has a standard and goal, as opposed to a standard, of 30 \npercent by 2000; Virginia, 12 percent by 2022; We have New Jersey, \nwhich has been a leader in this area, at 22.5 percent by 2020. If you \ngo all the way out to Montana, you see a 15-percent standard by 2015; \nif you go up to Washington, 15 percent by 2020. If these courageous \nStates are willing to do this with no direction from the Federal \nGovernment, I think it is time for us to act.\n  It was Louis Brandeis, the judge, who once in one of his opinions \nwrote about how the States are the laboratories of democracy. That is \nwhat you see going on here. The States are the laboratories of \ndemocracy, and you talk about how one courageous State can make a \ndecision to set policy and can be used as a laboratory for the rest of \nthe country. I don't think he ever meant, when he wrote that opinion, \nthat that should mean inaction by the Federal Government. In fact, it \nshould be the opposite. The States experiment, the States show, such as \nour State has, you can put high standards in place, you can start \ndeveloping these industries, and it is a good thing.\n  It revitalizes our rural economy. It is cleaner for our environment. \nIt allows us to invest in new jobs. Now it is time--we have seen the \nstory across the country--for the Federal Government to act.\n  What I want to see when we vote on Senator Bingaman's amendment is a \nbipartisan effort, bipartisan support for this kind of amendment.\n  Let me tell you what happened in our State. In February, the \nMinnesota Legislature--it is a Democratic State senate, Republican \nstatehouse--passed nearly unanimously this 2025 standard. In fact, for \nXcel Energy, our biggest energy company, it is 30 percent. They passed \nthat nearly unanimously, a Democratic house, a Democratic senate, with \na number of Republicans, a majority voting for it, and then they sent \nit to a Republican Governor, and that Republican Governor signed it \ninto law. It is considered the Nation's most aggressive standard for \npromoting renewable energy in electricity production. I think \nMinnesota's aggressive standard is a good example, but I also think the \nbipartisan way in which it was set should be a model for Federal \naction.\n  The courage we are seeing in States such as my own should be matched \nby the courage in Washington. We should be prepared to act on a \nnational level, especially when the States and local communities are \nshowing us the way.\n  There is now an opportunity for the Federal Government to act, and \nthis Energy bill has many good things in it. I love the standards for \nappliances, the standards for buildings. I like to call it ``building a \nfridge to the 21st century.'' But I also would like to see some even \nbolder action. That bolder action comes in many forms, but one that is \nmost important to me is putting this renewable standard into law.\n  We have everything we need. We just need to act. We have the \nscientific know-how in this country. In my State, we are so proud of \nthe work that is going on at the University of Minnesota and the State \ncolleges across the State. It is going on everywhere.\n  We have the fields to grow the energy that will keep our Nation \nmoving, and we have the wind to propel our economy forward. The wind is \nat our back, and it is time for us to move. It is time to act. The only \nthing that is holding us back is complacency.\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\n  In my office in the lobby, I have a picture. It is a picture of \nsomeone holding a world in their hands. The words on it read: The angel \nshrugged, and she placed the world in the palm of our hand. She said if \nwe fail this time, it is a failure of imagination.\n  We in the Senate in the next 2 weeks have the opportunity to show \nthis country and the world that we have the imagination for a better \nworld and we have the imagination that we can start having our energy \nand our electricity produced by the wind and the sun, that we have the \nimagination that we can have a better environment.\n  This is the time to act, and I urge my colleagues to support the 15-\npercent standard for renewable energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to hear \nthe comments of my friend and colleague from Minnesota. She speaks of \nwind in her State. It is fair to say that in certain parts of my fair \nState of Alaska, we, too, have incredible winds that sometimes we feel \ncould power the entire Nation with the amount of wind energy we have. \nIn fact, sometimes the winds are too strong and we cannot keep wind \ngeneration units up because the force of the winds is that intense. But \nI do recognize that all States are not created equal in terms of their \nability to produce forms of renewable energy, such as wind.\n  I am a very strong supporter of renewable energy, really all forms of \nrenewable energy. Whether it is geothermal, ocean energy, wind, solar, \nbiofuels, all aspects of renewable are so important. I want to explain \nthis afternoon why I am supporting the clean portfolio standard over \nthe renewable portfolio standard and actually think that the clean \nstandard is the best for the environment and for the public.\n  Both of these proposals will encourage States to promote the most \nforms possible of renewable energies, whether they be solar, wind, \ngeothermal, ocean, biomass. All are covered equally under both of the \nproposals.\n  For my purposes and where I am really honing in is in the area of \nhydropower, and this is one key area where the different proposals part \ncompany.\n  Under the renewable portfolio standard, new hydropower does not count \ntoward meeting the production mandate, only incremental power. The \naddition of turbines to existing facilities can count.\n  Under the clean portfolio standard, new hydropower, not the power \nfrom dams that span the rivers, but all other forms of new hydropower, \nsuch as power from small hydro projects and from lake taps, can count \ntoward that renewable requirement. That is a very important difference.\n  In my State of Alaska, we tap the mountain lakes, those that have few \nfish. There is a hole that is literally drilled in the bottom. It runs \nthe water into turbines, and this produces the power. About 40 percent \nof the power in urban Alaska comes from projects such as these. They \nhave zero environmental impact. They do not affect the stream flows. \nThey do not affect the fish runs.\n  So I have to look at the two different proposals and ask: How are we \ntreating hydro? How are we treating runs of the rivers, the lake taps? \nHow is that included in the proposals? I believe ignoring the potential \nfor hydropower where it can be done without emissions and without any \nother environmental impact is a mistake and a needless mistake.\n  The clean portfolio standard also allows utilities to count not just \nthe incremental nuclear power and the power from the next generation of \nnuclear, but it also allows you to count the power saved by energy \nefficiency programs. This is an area we all want to encourage. We want \nto encourage energy conservation and efficiency programs. This, I think \nwe will all agree, is a justifiable addition to the bill.\n  Some will argue that the amendment waters down Congress's commitment \nto push renewable energy. I am just not buying into that argument. That \nis not the case. By increasing the standard to 20 percent from the 15 \npercent starting in the year 2020, we have offset any reduction in \neffort, but we have made the provisions more fair to all the States. As \nI mentioned, all States are not equal in their ability to produce \nrenewable energy.\n\n  All State utilities can sponsor energy efficiency legislation. Most \nStates are able to move toward nuclear power. Most States have some \naccess to hydropower. Most States can benefit from landfill gases or \nfrom some forms of biomass. And all States can utilize fuel cells to \nreach a clean energy standard. But not all States have consistent wind \npatterns, have cloudless energy potential or good geothermal or ocean \noptions.\n  I look at the State of Alaska, with our geography and with our \nconsiderable landmass, considerable coastline, and say we are blessed \nwith incredible resources when it comes to renewable resources. We have \nincredible geothermal potential. We have strings of volcanoes up the \nAleutian chain and even in our south central area. With a coastline the \nsize we have in Alaska, we have potential from ocean energy that is \nunequaled anywhere else in the United States. We have, as I mentioned, \nincredible wind potential, and we are seeing that particularly in our \ncoastal communities where we are able to put wind-generating units, \noffsetting the cost of diesel, which is what currently powers far too \nmany of our communities in the State of Alaska.\n  My point is, we are blessed in Alaska with renewable energy options. \nThose in perhaps the southeastern part of the United States have \nalready pointed out some of the very real concerns they have with a \nrenewable standard. In the Pacific Northwest, if we are not counting \nany new hydro development, it makes one wonder: How will they be able \nto achieve the standards that have been set forth in a renewable \nportfolio standard if we cannot count the hydro?\n  I am concerned that we will move toward a one-size-fits-all solution. \nIt is something we are wise to avoid; otherwise, we have electricity \nconsumers in many of the States that will be better off by not having a \nFederal mandate at all but continuing under this patchwork arrangement \nof State renewable portfolio standards that are already being \nformulated. For them, it may be better to stick with that patchwork \nprogram than a Federal approach.\n  I have heard from the American Wind Power Association that the \nprovision in this amendment that allows the Secretary to certify other \nclean energy sources to qualify in the future somehow creates a \nloophole that will harm renewable energy progress. But given the \nstandards that are contained in the amendment, I don't believe this is \na problem. All the provision does is allow new technology to be \nclassified as renewable to benefit from the incentives this provision \ncreates without waiting for Congress to act, which we all know can be a \nvery lengthy process and one we really don't even want to count how \nlong that can be.\n  As a strong supporter of renewables and a really strong supporter of \nwind energy, I am a huge proponent of wind energy. I am the sponsor in \nthis bill of a grant program to have the Federal Government help pay up \nto 50 percent of the cost of renewable projects to help get the \nrenewables over the hump of the higher construction costs. I want to \nwork to encourage a rapid expansion of renewables. We need to increase \nrenewable use in this country tenfold. We are currently at 2 percent. \nWe need to get to 20 percent, and this is what is called for in the \nclean portfolio standard. But I think we need to be careful about \nnarrowing the list of technologies so that we in the Government, we in \nthe Congress are not picking the winners and losers; that we allow wind \nto compete with ocean energy, with geothermal energy; that we allow \nhydropower to compete with the advantages of energy efficiency \nprograms.\n  We have to remember that if the Federal Government does not \ngenerously finance renewable power projects, consumers will be paying \nthe bills for their construction through higher power rates. We have a \nfine line to walk between promoting renewables and raising the cost of \nelectricity in some parts of this country too quickly and too high. \nThat program, if you will, will harm low-income families and the \ncompetitiveness of the economy.\n  So while both proposals are admirable in very many respects--and I \ncommend the chairman of the Energy Committee for his hard work in this \narea--I do believe the clean portfolio standard overall does a better \njob and is more fair to States that have different abilities to meet \nour renewable portfolio standard.\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to study this, study it very carefully, and have \nan open mind when they cast their vote on these provisions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have made it a practice for the last--I \ndon't know how long it has been now, 12-plus years in the Senate--that \nany time I see a major tax increase coming along, at least I want to \nvoice opposition, to get on record against it. That is what we are \ntalking about right now with the renewable portfolio standard that is \nbefore us.\n  I support development of renewable energy resources, as do the \ncitizens of my State of Oklahoma. In fact, in 2006, Oklahoma was ranked \nsixth in the Nation for wind energy capacity, surpassed only by Texas, \nMinnesota, Iowa, California, and Washington State. Those are real \nturbines lighting over 150,000 homes in Oklahoma without an RPS.\n  Let me emphasize, Oklahomans are developing wind energy without a \none-size-fits-all Federal mandate known as an RPS, renewable portfolio \nstandard.\n  Quite a number of years ago I spent a number of years as mayor of a \nmajor American city. Its problems were not the ones you would think, \nnot crime in the streets, not prostitution. It was Federal mandates \nthat were not funded. This is exactly what we are looking at here.\n  Under this amendment, Oklahomans would pay an additional $6 billion \nfor their electricity. You might ask where would that money go? It \nwould go to perhaps the Federal Government to spend as it pleases, or \nit would go to other States that are lucky enough to have the \nparticular energy sources that environmental groups decide today they \nwant.\n  How does this promote clean energy in Oklahoma? It does not. The \namendment cherry-picks technologies that have to be blessed by \nenvironmental groups but ignores the real clean energy benefits of \nnuclear power, hydro power, clean coal, and energy efficiency.\n  A kilowatt saved is a kilowatt earned. You can't get cleaner than \nenergy efficiency, but it doesn't comply with the amendment.\n  The RPS amendment is nothing more than a tax increase. It is a tax on \nStates that lack enough natural resources to meet the 15-percent \nmandate. It is a tax on States that do not harness the particular \nrenewable technologies enshrined in this amendment, and it is a tax on \nStates that do not happen to have electricity transmission lines \nlocated where the renewable resources are. The States, I believe, know \nbest on how to promote and manage the renewable resources unique to \ntheir States without another Federal mandate.\n  We had this discussion this morning when I had my refinery amendment \nup. I said there is this mentality in Washington that no decision is a \ngood decision unless that decision is made in Washington, DC. I think \nthat is what we are looking at here. This is an issue that should be \nleft to the States, not enacted in an RPS. The decision should not be \npreempted, especially not when the cost is $6 billion.\n  I know a lot of people are thinking, in terms of the things we talk \nabout here in Washington, DC, $6 billion is not an astronomical amount. \nBut take a State with a population of the State of Oklahoma. A $6 \nbillion tax increase is huge, particularly when you do not get anything \nfor it.\n  I hope we will oppose the amendment of Senator Bingaman on renewable \nportfolio standards.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Bingaman \namendment relating to the renewable portfolio mandate. The Bingaman \namendment would impose a 15-percent portfolio requirement for a limited \nnumber of so-called renewables by 2030. I oppose this amendment as I \nhave opposed such proposals in the past because it is an egregious \nexample of Federal command and control of the marketplace.\n  Renewables have been and will continue to be an important part of our \nenergy mix. Hydropower, solar, geothermal, wind, municipal solid waste \nall make substantial contributions to our energy needs. These and the \nother power types--nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas--succeed in the \nmarket because they are cost-effective, not because the Federal \nGovernment has required them to be bought.\n  Congress has long supported renewable energy. That is one thing--\nFederal mandates are another. Fundamentally, I oppose Federal command \nand control of the marketplace. I have no doubt that any requirement \nthat a particular percentage of electricity generation by renewables \ncan be met. During World War II, through a tremendous expenditure of \nmoney and effort, we developed nuclear weapons when no one thought it \nwas possible. During the sixties, no one thought it was possible to \nsend a man to the Moon, but we did. A renewable portfolio mandate of \nany percent, be it 15 percent as proposed here or even 50 percent, is \nachievable--whether it be through actual generation of energy or \nthrough the purchase of credits from the Federal Government. But at \nwhat cost? What cost in terms of electricity rates to be paid by \nAmerican consumers, estimated at over $100 billion by 2030, at what \ncost in terms of stifling technological advancement into other \nalternative sources of energy? Over the past 20 years, renewable \ntechnology has advanced by leaps and bounds, not because we ordered \nindustry to generate more renewable power but because we gave \nincentives to generate new renewables. The Bingaman approach turns that \non its head. Under the Bingaman amendment, renewable producers will \ngravitate to low cost, existing renewable sources. They will have no \nincentive to innovate and bring their costs down. The power generated \nwill be sold almost regardless of cost.\n  The Bingaman amendment is nothing more than the Government deciding \nwhich type of energy is politically in favor and which type is \npolitically out of favor. Right now, the wind industry is the big \npolitical winner. It is lower in cost than most renewables, currently \ngobbles up 95 percent of available tax credit, and has the largest \nlobby for the Bingaman amendment.\n  Wind-generated power has significant environmental problems we need \nto address. First, wind turbines take up lots of space to generate any \nsignificant amount of energy, making them poor for urban environments \nand problematic for landscape viewsheds, especially near our Nation's \nnational parks. They are also dangerous for wildlife. The National \nAcademy of Sciences stated in a report released this year that bats are \nat considerable risk in the Southwestern United States and elsewhere, \nwhere reliance on wind power has been growing. The wind-power turbines \ngenerate sounds and, possibly, electromagnetic fields that lure the \nacoustically sensitive creatures into the spinning blades. In addition, \nlocal bird populations are also at risk. NAS also stated that local \nbird populations, especially peregrine falcons and other raptors that \nare attracted to windy areas where the generators are likely to exist, \nare at risk and called for additional study. Raptors ``are lower in \nabundance than many other bird species, have symbolic and emotional \nvalue to many Americans, and are protected by federal and state laws.'' \nBesides these environmental impacts that must be looked at, the fact \nis, wind just doesn't blow enough in most parts of the country for this \nto be a viable source of energy for utilities across the country to \nrely on.\n  I believe the kind of energy utilities use to generate electricity \nshould be based on the free market and consumer choice. If consumers \nwant to buy the kind of renewable energy mandated by the Bingaman \namendment, they are free to do so. Likewise, if they want to spend \ntheir money on something else, they should be free to do that too. \nConsumers are better able to decide what is in their own interest than \ngovernment. Why should a family of four struggling to meet its monthly \nbills, to educate the kids, or help elderly parents be required--due to \nFederal political correctness--to purchase high-priced energy instead \nof meeting family obligations?\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\n  Over 20 States have already adopted their own renewable standards, \nincluding my home State of Arizona. They each did so, presumably, \nbecause those States decided it was in their citizens' best interests. \nI have long believed that decisions affecting people's lives and \nlivelihoods should be made at levels of government that are closest to \nthe people, not by bureaucrats in Washington.\n  Let's look at the problems with a Federal renewable portfolio \nmandate. First, as I said before, it picks certain politically favored \nrenewable energy types for special treatment, ignoring what States have \nalready decided to do on their own. The supporters of the amendment \nwill tell you that is not the case and that State programs can \ncontinue, but that is only true if the State picked the same favorites \nthis amendment does. For instance, what about Pennsylvania? \nPennsylvania took a look at its energy availability and determined that \ncoal to liquids made sense given its vast coal reserves. So coal to \nliquids counts toward meeting its State RPS. Under the Bingaman \namendment, Pennsylvania would not be able to count this source toward \nthe Federal mandate, in effect gutting its State RPS program and \nincreasing the costs to consumers.\n  This example brings me to a basic problem with a Federal renewable \nmandate. Some regions of the country are blessed with abundant \nrenewable resources, while others are not. The renewable mandate will \ncreate stupendous transfers of wealth from renewable-poor States to \nrenewable-rich States. This means that consumers in New York City will \nsend their hard-earned dollars to wind generators in Minnesota. Think \nabout it. Consumers in New York City will pay for renewable electricity \nthey don't even get. That is not fair. If the purpose of the renewable \nmandate is to lessen our dependence on foreign energy, there are better \nways: nuclear power, clean coal, and oil and gas from regions of the \nUnited States that have been put off limits.\n  Let's face it, we have to have reliable sources of energy to meet the \never increasing consumer demand for electricity. However, the primary \nsources of energy that will be necessary to meet this mandate, wind and \nsolar, are intermittent sources. What happens when the wind doesn't \nblow or the Sun doesn't shine? As we learned in economics 101, there is \nno such thing as a free lunch; consumers will pay. They will pay for \nthe renewable energy and they will pay for the backup capacity that \nwill come from what we know are reliable sources of energy--nuclear, \ncoal and natural gas--to keep the lights on.\n  Mr. President, let me return to my fundamental concern about the \nrenewable mandate. The Bingaman amendment gives the Federal Government \nthe power to micromanage the marketplace with a one-size-fits-all \nmandate; I want States to determine the best mix to meet their energy \nneeds and allow the free market to work. Thus, I will vote no on the \nBingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the renewable \nportfolio standard offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. The \nphrase ``renewable portfolio standard'' is a question most of us would \nfail on the final exam. What does it mean? To try to put it in the most \nsimple terms, what we are trying to achieve here is the generation of \nelectricity through means which meet the needs of our families, our \nbusinesses, and our economy, but create fewer environmental problems. \nThat is it--renewable fuel. By doing this, we are going to end up with \nan environment which is kinder and cleaner for future generations.\n  Let's be very honest about this. Some of the people who oppose this \nrenewable portfolio standard do not believe we have an environmental \nproblem. They do not believe global warming exists. They do not believe \nclimate change is an issue. They do not believe pollution is a problem. \nThey can't understand why we are trying to change the way we generate \nelectricity. If that is your point of view, I can understand why you \nwould oppose the amendment of Senator Bingaman, because it seems like \nmuch ado about nothing. Why would we be spending all this time, all \nthis effort, all this debate, and all this force in changing the way we \ngenerate electricity if everything is fine the way it is?\n  I am not one of those persons. I believe we do face some serious \nenvironmental challenges in the world today which, if they go \nunresolved and unanswered, will change the Earth on which we live. In \nfact, I think the process is underway. I do not think it is positive. I \nthink the evidence is abundant that as we become more industrial in the \nworld we live in, we have generated more smoke, more pollution, more \ngreenhouse gases, and it is changing the world in which we live.\n  Some people will say that is what we expect to hear from the \nenvironmentalists, those extremists, those tree huggers. They have been \nsinging this song ever since Earth Day was first created. But you know \nwhat is happening? There are some hard-headed businessmen coming to the \nsame conclusion. When I visit a major insurance company in my home \nState of Illinois which has announced it is no longer going to write \nproperty insurance on Gulf Coast States for fear of the violent storms \nthat are causing damage, it tells me this has gone beyond the musings \nof some people in the green movement. It now has become an economic \nreality, that the world is changing and in some respects not for the \nbetter.\n  If we know that to be true, the obvious question is what will we do \nabout it? Listen to the debate on the floor, Senator after Senator \ncoming in saying this is too complicated. This is the big hand of \nGovernment. It sounds like more taxes. It is going to force some \nchange, pick winners and losers, let's put this off to another day. \nLet's get back to this next year or the year after.\n  I have heard that song before, over and over again. I do not believe \nthe American people sent us to Washington to put off addressing the \nproblems which we face in this Nation and this world today. We have to \ntackle them. Some of them are controversial. Some of them may not be \npopular back home. But we are sent here to make a decision. Even if the \ndecision is uncomfortable for some, we have to understand it is \nimportant.\n  This renewable portfolio standard--a mouthful, if you will--requires \nretail electric utilities to include 15 percent renewable energy in \ntheir generation portfolios by the year 2020. We give a lot of \nflexibility to the utilities about how to reach this goal. They can \ngenerate this renewable electricity themselves--build wind farms or \nsolar facilities. Some people say maybe these wind farms won't work. I \ndid not know much about wind farms myself. What I read suggested my \nhome State of Illinois was just OK when it came to wind energy. But now \nas I move around my State, I see big changes. In the Bloomington-Normal \narea, central Illinois, the Twin Groves project, they are in the \nprocess of building 240 wind turbines, huge turbines.\n  Sadly, they are made in Europe. I hope the day comes soon when more \nare made in the United States. But they are coming here to generate, \nwith the wind blowing across the cornfields, electricity. It is a $700 \nmillion investment. It will generate enough electricity from these wind \nturbines spread out among the cornfields to take care of the needs of \n120,000 families in central Illinois. At the end of the day, there will \nnot be pollution added to the atmosphere. It will be natural wind power \nturning the turbines, generating the electricity for the families and \nbusinesses in that area. That is renewable electricity.\n  When it comes to solar power, I guess some people think that is a \nvestige of some musings back in the 1950s and 1960s, but it is not. \nSolar energy today is growing in its usage. You see it all over the \nUnited States, little solar panels that are now collecting enough \nenergy to do little jobs. Then you take a look at the world scene and \nlook at a country such as Germany, not a country you might single out \nas being a leader when it comes to solar energy. As a country, I doubt \nit has much more sunshine than parts of the United States. But 20 years \nago the Germans made a commitment to solar energy and now that \ncommitment is paying off. By guaranteeing return on investment, more \nand more solar panels are being installed and they are generating more \nelectrical power from the force and power of the Sun. We can do the \nsame.\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\n  How do you reach that goal, for more solar panels? You create \nincentives. How do you create these incentives? The Bingaman amendment. \nThe Bingaman amendment says if you are an electrical power generating \ncompany, we want 15 percent of the power you generate by the year 2020 \nto come from sources such as wind and solar panels.\n  What is that going to do? It is going to change the nature of the \nsolar power industry. There will be more companies, there will be more \ncompensation, there will be more research, there will be more \nefficiency. When it is done, we will end up with the electricity we \nneed to lead the good lives we have without creating a mess in this \natmosphere that changes the climate and creates pollution, creates \nproblems such as asthma and lung disease. We will be moving in the \nright direction instead of the wrong direction.\n  There will always be voices opposing this kind of change. It is too \nmuch for some people. It is a vision of the world they cannot imagine. \nIt is addressing a problem which many of them do not even acknowledge \nand that is why you run into resistance.\n  Some say it is a great idea, but America is not up to this challenge; \nwe can't generate the technology to meet this challenge. Come on. I \ndisagree. There has not been a time in our history when this Nation has \nbeen challenged to achieve anything, from a man on the Moon to taming \nthe atom, that we have not risen to the challenge. We can do it here \nand we must do it here. I believe in the creative genius of this \nAmerican system of government and this economy.\n  If you believe in it, a 15-percent renewable portfolio standard is \nnot a leap of faith. Of course, if the electric utilities do not have \ntheir own generating capacity through solar panels or wind power or \nother sources, they have an option under this to purchase credits from \nother utilities that do.\n  This is a market-based mechanism that Senator Bingaman's amendment \naddresses. It will drive competition into the renewable market without \npicking winners. It is basically going to say: We have some goals we \nhave to meet; now who can do those best? Using the Energy Information \nAdministration's data, a national 15-percent renewable portfolio \nstandard would save American consumers $16 billion on their electric \nand natural gas bills by the year 2030; commercial customers would save \n$8 billion; industrial, $5 billion; residential, $3.3 billion.\n  A renewable portfolio standard will create jobs and income in rural \nareas. I know this for a fact; that is where I come from. I come from \ndownstate Illinois, I have seen these wind farms, and they work. Each \nlarge-scale wind turbine that goes on line generates $1.5 million in \neconomic activity and provides about $5,000 in lease payments per year \nfor 20 years or more to a farmer, rancher, or landowner.\n  If you drive south of Rockford, IL, and go through a little town \ncalled Paw Paw, IL, that really was kind of disappearing on us, with a \nlittle cafe or two and a little gas station, all of a sudden people are \npaying attention. Why? Because they have about 20 wind turbines right \nnext to Paw Paw, IL.\n  I stopped my car and went over to the farmer who lives in the shadow \nof these wind turbines. This man had a smile from ear to ear. He is \ngetting a monthly lease payment for them to put the wind turbines on \nhis property, and he has planted corn right next to these wind \nturbines. He is getting the best of both worlds--the lease payment and \nthe production from his own land. He couldn't be prouder.\n  How did they end up putting those wind turbines in that tiny town? I \ncan tell you why they put them there. Because the mayor of the city of \nChicago, about 50 to 60 miles away, said to the utility company, the \nelectric company supplying electricity to the city government, that \nthey required--the city contract required a percentage of renewable \nsources of electricity. So this electric power company decided they \nneeded to build some wind turbines. They built them, put them in Paw \nPaw, IL. They are now feeding electricity into the grid instead of \nburning coal or some other pollutant. They are trying to find a way to \ngenerate electricity and not make the environmental situation worse. It \nworks. It is in smalltown America. It is in rural America, and it pays \noff.\n  We have over 100 megawatts of wind energy in Illinois already. A \nconservative estimate shows these turbines generate enough electricity \ncurrently to power 22,500 homes; another 300 megawatts under \nconstruction, and that would generate another 1,200 megawatts of \nelectricity. If all of those projects are completed, Illinois will be \ngenerating enough electricity to power over 370,000 homes from this \nwind energy.\n  Now, with a 15-percent renewable portfolio standard, America would \nincrease its total homegrown, clean, renewable power capacity 4\\1/2\\ \ntimes the present level. Senator Bingaman's amendment gives us 13 years \nto reach that goal. It is not unrealistic. In fact, I think one might \nargue we can do better. I hope we will.\n  Some States have already adopted standards far higher than what \nSenator Bingaman is suggesting as a national standard. With the \nabundance of renewable energy resources--the sun, the wind, the Earth \nitself--the technical potential of major renewable technologies could \nactually provide more than five times the electricity America needs.\n  There are limits of how much this potential can be used because of \ncompeting land uses and costs, but there is more than enough to supply \n15 percent, maybe even 20 percent.\n  Twenty-one States and the District of Colombia have already \nestablished a renewable electricity standard. Illinois, for instance, \nhas a goal of 8 percent by 2013; New York, 24 percent by 2013; \nColorado, 16 percent by 2020.\n  By diversifying and decentralizing our energy infrastructure, \nincreased reliance on renewables provides environmental, fuel \ndiversity, national security, and economic development benefits for \neverybody. Increasing renewable energy will reduce the risks to the \neconomy posed by an overreliance on a single source of new power \nsupply.\n  Additionally, the 15-percent national standard will reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions by nearly 200 million metric tons per year by 2020--a \nreduction of 7 percent below the business-as-usual level. That is the \nequivalent--the Bingaman amendment is the equivalent of taking 32 \nmillion cars off the road.\n  Furthermore, the Energy Information Administration study found that a \n20-percent renewable energy standard would reduce the cost to consumers \nof meeting four pollutant reductions from powerplants by $4.5 billion \nin 2010 and $31 billion in 2020, compared to meeting the emission \nreductions without a renewable standard.\n  I support this amendment. I believe that diversifying our electricity \nportfolio and encouraging the development of clean, renewable resources \nprovides economic and environmental benefits to our country.\n  I would say to those who are engaged in this debate: Do not bemoan \nglobal warming, do not cry about climate change, do not say you really \nare concerned about pollution if you cannot accept the challenge of the \nBingaman amendment. In the next 13 years, we can meet this goal. It is \na challenge to America which we can meet and exceed. I am confident we \nwill. In the process, we will find cleaner ways to generate \nelectricity. We will create less pollution for the people who live in \nthis country. We will end up with new technologies, new business \nopportunities that demonstrate the strength of this great country in \nwhich we live. We can meet this goal. We should not shrink away from \nit.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership in bringing \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how much longer we are \ngoing to be here this evening. I have not been able to confer with \nSenator Bingaman on the timing. But I do not think we are going to be \nhere very late. I am not sure--I mean, I am sure we are not going to \nvote on either amendment this evening. Nonetheless, there are a couple \nof Senators--at least one standing there--who have not talked today and \nwho want to.\n  I am going talk for a little bit. First, I want to say to everybody--\nincluding the previous immediate speaker who spoke about what kind of \npeople we are who think we have something better than Senator \nBingaman--I want to say\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\nthat there is no animus between Senator Bingaman and Pete Domenici. We \nare friends, and it is almost difficult when people are saying: You do \nso many things together; how can you come up on opposite sides of this? \nWell, I just studied it as best I could, and I came up with what I \nthought was a better idea. We have to do that. That is what we are \nelected for. New Mexicans ought to be wondering what is cooking, but \nthey also ought to know that he has an idea and I have a different idea \nbuilt on it, and that is all there is to it. One or the other or \nneither will get adopted, and we will have a good exchange here on the \nfloor to see what is really happening.\n  I do want to say that anybody who comes to the floor and talks about \nhow much richer we are going to get by having a plan like Senator \nBingaman's, the mandate for each State--I have not seen any estimate of \nthe cost to the people of either Senator Bingaman's approach or mine. I \nhave seen one of Senator Bingaman's plans--two of them, and none of \nthem say you are going to make money; both of them say it is going to \ncost a lot of money to the taxpayers. One says a lot more than the \nother. So I guess they really don't know. EIA recently studied the 15-\npercent RPS mandate and found that it would cost $21 billion. But there \nwas another one that was already done before that by Global Energy \nDecisions, and they said the cumulative cost to consumers would \nrepresent $175 billion over the 20-year life. But in both cases, they \nsaid it was going to cost money.\n  So I don't think anybody is going to get all excited about a \nstatement down here on the floor that, among the many things, having a \nmandate that every State be the same, have 15 percent, nobody is going \nto get excited and stand up and jump here on the floor of the Senate \nwith the idea that this is a good way for each State to make money. It \nis going to cost them money. It may be a great idea, and it may be \nworth it.\n  But I am here tonight to suggest--and I also want to say that the \nlast speaker on the Democratic side, the Senator from Illinois, spoke \nalso about some of us as if we do not believe in wind energy. Well, let \nme say, there are not too many Senators who came to the party here in \nWashington in helping wind energy. There are not too many who helped \nthem more or came to help them sooner than this Senator. The Senate and \nthe House have been helping solar energy to a fare-thee-well. We will \ncontinue to do that. But I can say to the wind industry that I have \nhelped you all the way through, and now I note that you are out \ncampaigning as hard as you can for this Bingaman proposal, this \nproposal by Senator Bingaman, this mandate. When you look at it and \nthink about it, it is a mandate that we use more and more wind energy. \nThat is what it is.\n  Now, I am not at all sure we are right in assuming that across this \nland the fundamental way to get things going right is for every State \nto march to the tune of getting to 15 percent of solar energy in their \nbase. I am not sure that is the best thing for the United States. I \nthink maybe when it was dreamt up, nobody thought there were any other \nalternatives. But there are, and certainly we are making a mistake in \nsaying it is going to be the language of the Bingaman bill or nothing \nelse when we already see that means wind for the next 20 years or more.\n  What I tried to say in mine was maybe there is something good about \npushing States to change. But I provided alternatives for \ndiversification.\n  I say to my friend from Montana, I do not know where you stand on a \nnuclear powerplant. If you have never had one in your State, you are \nnot going to get one because they are building them right where they \nwere. So States that had them are going to get nuclear powerplants \nwithin the next 10 years, many of them right where the existing \npowerplants are. All the Senator from New Mexico, the senior Senator, \nsaid was that if that is done during the lifetime of this program and \nyou put in a new nuclear powerplant, you ought to get credit for that. \nAnd the only way I could think of was to call my portfolio the clean \nenergy portfolio. That is what is it. And when you look at it that \nway--and I added to the availability of what is allowed, I added \nnuclear and I added some other things that I truly believe we should \npursue with vigor, and I raised the ceiling to 20 instead of 15. Now, \nwhen you look at it, you get a chance of one or the other.\n  The distinguished Senator, my colleague from New Mexico, thought it \nwas kind of unexpected that this bill had an opt-out and seemed to make \nof it as if that was something very bad. Look, we are open and sincere \nabout our bill having an opt-out. When a State meets the goal, we see \nno reason for them to stay in. We think they ought to be able to get \nout. There is nothing that is naturally ideological or philosophical \nabout it; it just seems there is no reason to keep them in. We have \nseen no good suggested from keeping them in, and so we think when they \nget through and meet their goal, they ought to be able, if they want \nto, to get out. If, in fact, they are already tied together because of \nelectric lines and the like, they will not destroy all of that. There \nwill still be relationships of those types which were built, and the \nones that are needed will stay on. They will be there for a long time.\n  Let me say in closing that one from the other side of the aisle need \nnot talk about those on this side of the aisle, including this Senator, \nas if we don't understand what wind energy is and we don't have enough \ndreams about solar energy. We understand both of them. We have funded \nboth of them. We have put the identical tax benefit on both, the same \nas we have put on everything else.\n  Last year when we did them all, we gave them all a 27.5-percent tax \ncredit, from nuclear power all the way down to solar, bio, and \neverything else. They all got the same. We had already begun funding \nwind power. Again, I say to the nuclear industry, but for the Congress \nof the United States, the truth is, there would be no wind industry, \nbecause without the tax credits we gave to make wind energy work, there \nwould be no wind energy except in a few places. I am not saying that in \nany way negative. I am for it. I don't know how many more years we will \nhave to give them this tax credit to push them over the hump, but I am \ngoing to do that because I believe they ought to move ahead. We are \nlearning both sides of the wind energy delivery system. We are \nbeginning to see some negative aspects to it. It was all positive at \none time. Some people are reporting negative ones. Out in the country \nwhere we used to raise cattle, certainly anybody who leases their land \nis delighted. They make a lot more money out of wind turbines than they \ndo trying to graze cattle. There is no doubt about that. Some of those \ncattlemen are extremely happy because they don't look like the old \nwindmills. They are much different. But they pay well, so they are \nglad. They joined up with wind energy, those who are lobbying for them. \nThey got all the property owners who are getting paid. They joined \nthem. That is good. I don't know who is lobbying for the rest of the \nkinds of energy we want to put in so we have diversity.\n  All this is is a vote to distinguish the two. If you want diversity \nof clean energy, vote for Domenici. If you want to be tied rigidly by a \nFederal statute to what is almost all wind, vote for Bingaman. If you \nwant to vote for letting those who have already met their goal opt out \nif they want, vote for Domenici. If you want to say they have to stay \nin, somebody ought to tell us all why and how long they should stay in, \nbut if they are going to have to stay in and be rigidly construed as to \nwhat counts, then obviously, you have to vote for the Bingaman \namendment.\n  We will have more discussion because everybody is getting well \ninformed and asking questions. I don't know what is going to happen \nimmediately after this. I assume the distinguished Senator from Montana \nwill speak. He was next. I will be leaving and apologize in advance \nthat I would not get to hear his speech about this bill. Maybe someday \nwe can meet back up there in Montana on the campaign trail and he can \ntalk about Montana and I can talk about I don't know what. He can tell \nme what to talk about. But it is good to be here with him on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the kind words. I \nappreciate that. I look forward to having him in ``big sky'' country \nanytime he wants.\n  I rise in strong support of the Bingaman amendment. Change is \ndifficult, if\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\nyou are young, if you are old, and oftentimes change is difficult in \npolitics. But what we are talking about is a national energy policy, a \nlong-term national energy policy that people and investors and \nconsumers can depend upon. Within this national energy policy, there is \nan amendment called the Bingaman amendment that deals with the \nrenewable energy standard.\n  Interestingly enough, back in 2005, in a former life when I was in \nthe Montana Senate, I carried a bill for a renewable energy standard in \nMontana that increased the renewable energy portfolio by 15 percent by \n2015. Let me tell you what happened there. The important parts of this \nbill were 8 percent by 2008 renewable energy in the portfolio, 10 \npercent by 2010, and 15 percent by 2015. That was the bill that we \ncarried in the Montana legislature. What happened was, the first year \nthey met the 8 percent. They will meet the 10 percent by next year, 2 \nyears ahead of schedule. It is predicted by 2011, the independent-owned \nutilities will meet the 15-percent threshold, 4 years early.\n  The fact is, this amendment is not cutting edge. This amendment is \nwhat is right for the country, renewable energy. Everybody talks about \nwind. Wind is an important part of renewable energy. But geothermal is \nalso another one. We haven't even tapped into the geothermal resources \nwe have, and they are massive. That is a renewable energy. Biomass, \nsmall bore timber, wood waste products, crop byproducts to help power \ngenerators, that is renewable energy. Landfill gas is another one we \nhaven't tapped into, a renewable energy. Electricity created by solar, \nby the Sun, is a renewable energy. Biofuels such as camelina, such as \nbiodiesel, powering generators, that is renewable energy.\n  Make no mistake about it, when we talk about renewable energy, it is \nnot just wind--although wind is an important factor--it is many \ndifferent avenues we can go down that suit some parts of the country \nbetter than others. By the way, back in 2005, when we were dead last in \nwind energy production, that little renewable portfolio standard bill \nwe passed took Montana from 50th to 15th in the Nation in renewable \nenergy production. We see transmission lines being built in the State, \nsomething that wasn't done before. We saw a whole lot of wind \ngenerators go up in rural Montana, where jobs are most needed, where \neconomic development is most needed, where we develop a tax base for \nour schools and counties in those areas that have seen depopulation, \ngiving these areas hope.\n  What we are talking about is a long-term policy that will invest in \nAmerica's consumers and this country. In the process, it will result in \na 50-percent increase in wind generation, a 300-percent increase in \nbiomass generation, a 500-percent increase in solar power, and it will \nreduce emissions by some 222 million tons per year by 2030. It is \ncheap. It is clean. It is a solution for the climate change issue. It \ndiversifies our production as far as where the energy is produced. It \ndiversifies the energy portfolio which is critically important.\n  If the Members of this body want to help move this country forward, \nhelp make this country energy independent and address the global \nwarming issue, I recommend a ``yes'' vote on the Bingaman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield to the Senator from Iowa for whatever time he \nwishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Alternative Minimum Tax\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, once again, as a leader of our party on \nthe Finance Committee, I come to the floor to discuss one of the \nimportant tax issues that must come before Congress. That is the \nalternative minimum tax. I am sure many have noticed that the \nalternative minimum tax is frequently the subject of my many speeches. \nThey may be wondering how long I intend to keep talking about it. The \nsimple answer is I intend to keep talking about it--meaning the \nalternative minimum tax--until this Congress actually takes some \naction. Instead of taking action, this Congress has done absolutely \nnothing. The problem continues to get worse for millions of Americans \nwho will be caught by the alternative minimum tax and are now being \ncaught. It is this ``now being caught'' that I wish to emphasize, \nbecause when I speak about those now being caught by this alternative \nminimum tax, I am referring to those families who make estimated tax \npayments and who will be making their second payment for this quarter \nthis Friday.\n  Last year, 2006, 4 million families were hit by the alternative \nminimum tax. This was 4 million too many. Of course, it is considerably \nbetter than what we know for the year we are in right now, when 23 \nmillion Americans, mostly middle class, will be hit by the alternative \nminimum tax. The reason we are experiencing this large increase this \nyear is that in each of the last 6 years, Congress has passed \nlegislation that temporarily increased the amount of income exempt from \nthe alternative minimum tax. These temporary exemption increases have \nprevented millions of middle-class Americans from falling prey to the \nalternative minimum tax until now. While I have always fought for these \ntemporary exemptions, I believe the alternative minimum tax ought to be \npermanently repealed because it was never meant to hit the middle \nclass--and it is hitting the middle class--and because the class of \npeople it was intended to hit, the superwealthy, are finding ways of \ngetting around what was thought to be a bright-light idea in 1969. It \nis hitting maybe a few hundred people, finding that superrich class not \neven paying the tax. So it isn't serving the purpose it was intended to \nserve, and it will hit middle-class Americans who were never intended \nto be hit by it by 23 million this year.\n  One reason I have previously given for permanent repeal is it may be \ndifficult for Congress to revisit the alternative minimum tax on a \ntemporary basis every year, as we have for each of the last 6 years. \nFrom January 1 of this year until now, when the second quarterly \npayment is going to be made, proves me right, because nothing has been \ndone. So the new Congress has yet to undertake any meaningful action on \nthe alternative minimum tax. Several proposals have been tossed around \nby the other body, meaning the House of Representatives. I have \ndiscussed a few of them in my earlier speeches. I generally find these \nproposals lacking but completely agree with my colleagues that \nsomething needs to be done, at least I seem to agree. Despite \nassurances that the alternative minimum relief is an important issue, \nnothing has actually been put forward as a serious legislative \nsolution.\n  This chart I am going to put up reflects how the alternative minimum \ntax has been handled by this Congress so far. It is kind of a smoke-\nand-mirrors example that I use because we have had numerous proposals \ntalked about, but that is all, just talk. An academic discussion is not \nin any way a serious substitute for real action this Congress ought to \ntake, as tomorrow people making their quarterly payments will attest \nto.\n  I have also come to realize the best way to learn about new proposals \nthat deal with the alternative minimum tax is not to check for the new \nlegislation in the Congressional Record but to check the daily \nnewspaper. In the course of reading the Washington Post last Friday, I \ncame across another trial balloon--I emphasize ``trial balloon''--for a \nnew idea about the alternative minimum tax that was printed in the \nbusiness section of the newspaper. A lot of people were out of town on \nFriday, so I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \n``Democrats Seek Formula to Blunt Alternative Minimum Tax'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 8, 2007]\n\n Democrats Seek Formula To Blunt AMT; One Plan Would Impose Surtax of \n                       4.3% on Richest Households\n\n                          (By Lori Montgomery)\n\n       House Democrats looking to spare millions of middle-class \n     families from the expensive bite of the alternative minimum \n     tax are considering adding a surcharge of 4 percent or more \n     to the tax bills of the nation's wealthiest households.\n       Under one version of the proposal, about 1 million families \n     would be hit with a 4.3 percent surtax on income over \n     $500,000, which\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\n     would raise enough money to permit Congress to abolish the \n     alternative minimum tax for millions of households earning \n     less than $250,000 a year, according to Democratic aides and \n     others familiar with the plan.\n       Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House \n     subcommittee with primary responsibility for the AMT, said \n     that option would also lower AMT bills for families making \n     $250,000 to $500,000. And it would pay for reductions under \n     the regular income tax for married couples, children and the \n     working poor.\n       All told, the proposal would lower taxes for as many as 90 \n     million households, and Neal said it has broad support among \n     House leaders and Democrats on the tax-writing House Ways and \n     Means Committee. ``Everybody's on board,'' he said.\n       Neal has yet to release details of the plan, however, and \n     others inside and outside the committee say major pieces of \n     it are still in flux. Some Democrats say Neal's plan \n     stretches the definition of the middle class too far, \n     providing AMT relief to too many wealthy households. They \n     argue that the cutoff for families to be spared from the AMT \n     should be lower, at $200,000, $150,000 or even $75,000.\n       ``There is consensus to make sure that we have some \n     responsible tax policy that will also treat taxpayers fairly. \n     No one ever expected to be caught in the AMT making 75 \n     grand,'' said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), a Ways and \n     Means Committee member whose Los Angeles district is \n     populated by working poor. ``We're trying to come up with a \n     fix that does right by the great majority of Americans who \n     fall into the middle class.''\n       The debate has focused attention on a different surtax \n     proposed by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the \n     Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. That plan \n     would eliminate the AMT and replace it with a 4 percent \n     surcharge on income over $200,000 for families and $100,000 \n     for singles, cutting taxes for 22 million households and \n     raising them for more than 3 million.\n       ``Our plan is as simple as can be. And only 2 percent of \n     the whole population would have to pay it,'' said Leonard E. \n     Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center. The plan has the \n     added benefit of abolishing the complicated AMT at all income \n     levels, Burman said, an approach some lawmakers find \n     attractive.\n       On the other hand, fewer families' taxes would be cut, \n     diminishing the ability of Democrats to capitalize on the \n     plan politically. Since they took control of Congress in \n     January, Democrats have made repealing or scaling back the \n     AMT a top priority in hope of establishing tax-cutting \n     credentials and seizing the issue from Republicans for the \n     2008 campaign.\n       The alternative minimum tax is a parallel tax structure \n     created in 1969 to nab 155 super-rich tax filers who had been \n     able to wipe out their tax bills using loopholes and \n     deductions. Under AMT rules, taxpayers must calculate their \n     taxes twice--once using normal deductions and tax rates and \n     once using special AMT deductions and rates--and pay the \n     higher figure.\n       Because the AMT was not indexed for inflation, its reach \n     has expanded annually, delivering a significant tax increase \n     this spring to an estimated 4 million households. The AMT \n     would have spread even more rapidly after President Bush's \n     tax cuts reduced taxpayers' normal bills, but Congress \n     enacted yearly ``patches'' to restrain its growth. The most \n     recent patch expired in December, and unless Congress acts, \n     the tax is projected to strike more than 23 million \n     households next spring, many of them earning as little as \n     $50,000 a year.\n       House Democrats want legislation to spare those households \n     while also lowering the bills of many current AMT payers. But \n     they face numerous obstacles. In the Senate, Finance \n     Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) favors AMT repeal but \n     considers it too ambitious for this year. Baucus has said \n     another year-long patch is more likely.\n       In the House, some Democrats argue that more time is needed \n     to explain the issue to the public. The vast majority of \n     households have yet to pay the AMT and may not fully \n     appreciate the value of eliminating the tax, while the \n     wealthy are sure to feel the bite of a new surtax.\n       ``I don't think there's enough of an understanding right \n     now that you've got this tidal tax wave about to hit \n     everybody,'' said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a Ways and \n     Means Committee member who is also chairman of the Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee. ``From a political \n     perspective, we need to lay the groundwork.''\n       Before the Memorial Day break, Ways and Means Committee \n     Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) said he hoped to announce \n     an AMT proposal as soon as Congress returned to Washington. \n     But his timetable has slipped to late June, Democratic aides \n     said, with the issue set to go before the full House sometime \n     in July.\n       Republicans generally oppose new taxes on the wealthy, \n     saying they disproportionately affect small businesses, but \n     are waiting to hear more before deciding whether to work with \n     Democrats or offer their own plan to abolish the AMT.\n       ``House Democrats are going to have to find their sea legs \n     on this issue fast,'' said Rep. Phil English (R-Pa.), the \n     senior Republican on the Ways and Means tax subcommittee. \n     ``Folks seem to be launching a lot of trial balloons, and \n     it's all very festive. But I don't have enough really to \n     react to yet.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The concept underlying the alternative minimum tax \nfixes highlighted in this article in the Washington Post is that the \nalternative minimum tax could be abolished for families and individuals \nmaking less than a given amount, and that the resulting revenue loss \nwould then be offset by a surtax--I want to emphasize: creating a new \ntax, a surtax--on what the article refers to as our ``nation's \nwealthiest households.''\n  Now, when they use the term the ``nation's wealthiest households,'' \nremember that was the whole concept of the alternative minimum tax in \nthe first place, in 1969, to tax a few thousand people with this tax, \nand now they are not even being hit by it.\n  I will bet you, you could have this surtax, and you are still going \nto find people who can hire the best lawyers to avoid paying that tax. \nWhen I say ``avoid paying that tax,'' I mean avoid paying that tax in a \nlegal way, not in a way that is extralegal.\n  There are two basic proposals that have been laid out in that \nWashington Post article. One of them, put forward by a member of the \nWays and Means Committee of the other body, would use a 4.3 percent \nsurtax on income over $500,000 to offset the elimination of the \nalternative minimum tax for people earning less than $250,000 a year.\n  Now, it is estimated in the article that the surtax of 4.3 percent \nwould affect about 1 million families. It is also suggested the \nalternative minimum tax bills would be decreased for families earning \nbetween $250,000 and $500,000 yearly as part of this option. Now, I am \nnot sure how individuals would be treated in this plan.\n  Interestingly, immediately after the insistence that this option \nenjoys a great deal of support, the article notes that details of the \nplan have yet to be released. In the tax world, the devil, of course, \nis in the details. So I am curious as to exactly what it is that is \nenjoying this broad political support.\n  I will note that Ways and Means members have now denounced--now \ndenounced--this label they have applied to this 4.3 percent tax. They \nhave denied the ``surtax'' label.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to prove what I said, that \nan article from Tax Notes Today be printed in the Record. That is a \npublication dated June 13, 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From Tax Analysts, Tax Notes Today, June 13, 2007]\n\n       Ways and Means Democrats Take Offense to Notion of Surtax\n\n       Both House Ways and Means Committee Chair Charles B. \n     Rangel, D-N.Y., and committee member Richard E. Neal, D-Mass. \n     have said that while their plan to reform the alternative \n     minimum tax will likely be paid for by increasing taxes on \n     the wealthiest taxpayers, claims that they plan to create a \n     ``surtax'' on the rich are unfounded.\n       ``We have not agreed to any surtax,'' Rangel told reporters \n     June 12. ``But that might be another way to say that we're \n     going to adjust the rates to make up for what we don't raise \n     in terms of all the loopholes and knocking out credits and \n     looking for this $340 billion [in the tax gap].''\n       Neal also objected to the notion of a surtax in comments to \n     Tax Analysts on June 11, although he did not completely rule \n     out the possibility of using the proposal when his plan is \n     finally introduced.\n       ``Obviously we're going to ask 1 million people to help pay \n     for tax relief for 92 million people,'' Neal said.\n       The idea of a surtax to pay for the Democrats' AMT reform \n     proposal was first proposed in a May 23 Urban-Brookings Tax \n     Policy Center paper in which Len Burman and Greg Leiserson \n     argued that the AMT should be repealed and replaced with a \n     surtax of 4 percent on adjusted gross incomes above $100,000 \n     for singles and above $200,000 for married couples. That \n     change would lead to a more progressive tax system and would \n     be approximately revenue neutral over 10 years, they said. \n     (For the paper, see Doc 2007-12677 or 2007 TNT 102-36.)\n       Although the details of the Democratic AMT plan have not \n     been released, subsequent media reports have claimed that \n     Ways and Means Democrats plan to employ a surtax in their \n     effort to comply with House ``pay as you go'' budget rules.\n       House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., acknowledged \n     that the idea of a surtax is under consideration by the Ways \n     and Means leaders, but said he was unwilling to ``prejudge'' \n     whether Democrats in the chamber would ultimately support \n     that proposal. He added.that pay-go rules will require \n     lawmakers to make difficult choices when it comes to \n     offsetting the costs of any AMT reform legislation.\n       ``What we want to do is fix the AMT permanently and fix it \n     in a way that does not add to the deficit,'' Hoyer said. ``We \n     adopted pay-go. We believe in pay-go.''\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\n       Rangel and Neal have also repeatedly said that they are \n     committed to complying with pay-go rules, and Rangel said all \n     revenue-raising options are on the table.\n       ``There's nothing we're not considering in terms of raising \n     revenue to take care of the AMT and expand the child \n     credits,'' said Rangel.\n       Rangel's committee is expected to mark up its AMT reform \n     legislation in July, with House floor consideration likely to \n     come the same month. The committee's AMT plan is expected to \n     exempt from the AMT taxpayers earning less than $250,000. \n     Those earning above $500,000 would see an increase in their \n     AMT liability, while taxpayers earning between $250,000 and \n     $500,000 would see a reduced AMT liability. Several other \n     proposals to benefit lower-income taxpayers--including \n     expansion of the earned income and child tax credits--are \n     also expected to be part of that proposal.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now, the other plan comes from our friends at the Tax \nPolicy Center. In a similar plan to the one I just discussed, a 4-\npercent surtax would be charged to individuals with adjusted gross \nincomes above $100,000 and couples with incomes above $200,000. The \nsurtax would apply to income above those thresholds, and the thresholds \nwould be indexed for inflation after the year 2007. Under this option, \nthe alternative minimum tax would be completely repealed.\n  To give an idea of how many people would be hit by this surtax, \naccording to IRS statistics of income, in the year 2004--the latest \nyear we have information available for--there were 1,427,197 returns \nfiled by singles reporting adjusted gross incomes of at least $100,000. \nIn the same year, married persons filing jointly numbered 2,569,288 \nreturns reporting adjusted gross incomes above $200,000.\n  Mr. President, 2004 is the most recent year we have for this data. I \nrealize the proposal hits singles with incomes greater then $100,000 \nand my numbers would include someone with an income exactly at that \namount, but we can see the Tax Policy Center's plan would impact \nroughly 4 million singles and joint filers. It would likely impact more \nthan that, since my numbers do not include heads of households or other \ncategories, but you get the idea, I hope, that a lot of people would \nstill be impacted.\n  Now, as I said before, I am glad people are thinking about the \nalternative minimum tax and realize it is a very real problem out there \nand, specifically, this year, for 23 million middle-income-tax people \nwho would not otherwise be hit. But as I have discussed more and more \nof these proposals with you, I have started to see them--as my chart \nindicates--as more smoke and mirrors than actual, real legislative \nproposals.\n  For one thing, legislation is not introduced in a newspaper--even \nfrom the prestigious Washington Post. I keep hearing about proposal \nafter proposal, but nothing is actually done. Everyone seems to agree \nsomething needs to be done and needs to be done quickly, but the \ndiscussion does not go further from that point.\n  I spoke about the alternative minimum tax at the beginning of this \nCongress, in January and when the first quarterly payment was due. I am \nhere now that the second quarterly payment is due. I bet I will be here \nwhen the third quarterly payment comes due, saying largely the same \nthing I am saying right now.\n  Aside from the fact that Congress does not seem to be under any \npressure to actually take action, all of the proposals I have discussed \nhere share the same major flaw in that they seek to offset any revenues \nnot collected through reform or repeal of the alternative minimum tax. \nNotice I said ``not collected.'' And I did not use the word ``lost.'' \nThis distinction is important for the simple reason that the revenues \nwe do not collect as a result of alternative minimum tax relief are not \nlost because the alternative minimum tax collects revenues that were \nnever supposed to be collected in the first place.\n  Let me emphasize that. We cannot talk about lost revenue because we \nare talking about 23 million people being hit by the alternative \nminimum tax who were never supposed to be hit by the tax in the first \nplace. The alternative minimum tax collects revenues it was never \nsupposed to collect in the first place. Originally conceived as a \nmechanism to ensure high-income taxpayers were not able to completely \neliminate their tax liability, the alternative minimum tax has failed.\n  In 2004, IRS Commissioner Everson told the Finance Committee the same \npercentage of taxpayers continues to pay no Federal income tax. So the \nalternative minimum tax is not even working for those who were supposed \nto pay it. This was originally created in that first year with just 155 \ntaxpayers in mind. Of the two plans I discussed earlier, the one that \nwould impact the lower number of filers would still hit about 1 million \nfamilies. See how 155 has grown to 1 million families?\n  Finally, if we offset revenues not collected as a result of \nalternative minimum tax repeal or reform, total Federal revenues are \nprojected to push through the 30-year historical average and then keep \ngoing.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber, which is reproduced from the \nnonpartisan--I want to emphasize ``nonpartisan''--Congressional Budget \nOffice's publication called ``The Long-Term Budget Outlook,'' issued in \nDecember 2005, illustrates--as you can see by the red mark--the \nballooning of Federal revenues.\n  The alternative minimum tax is a completely failed policy that is \nprojected to bring in future revenues it was never designed to \ncollect--and 23 million people being hit this year by it. A large share \nof that 23 million people being hit by it now in the second quarterly \nestimate they are filing is absolute proof of people being hurt by a \ntax that was never supposed to hit them in the first place.\n  Of course, the best solution to this mess would be S. 55, and that is \ncalled the Individual Alternative Minimum Tax Repeal Act of 2007. It is \na bipartisan bill introduced by Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and this Senator, along with Senators Crapo, Kyl, \nand Schumer. Senators Lautenberg, Roberts, and Smith have also later \nsigned on as cosponsors.\n  While permanent repeal without offsetting is the best option, we \nabsolutely must do something to protect taxpayers immediately, even if \nit involves a temporary solution such as an increase in the exemption \namount. Of course, if we do not do that, we are going to be in the same \nfix next year, and I will be making the same points at that particular \ntime.\n  This Friday, taxpayers making quarterly payments are going to once \nagain discover the alternative minimum tax is neither the subject of an \nacademic seminar nor a future problem we can put off dealing with. It \nis the real world for those taxpayers filing Friday. They are being hit \nby it. The alternative minimum tax is a real problem right now, and if \nthis Congress is serious about tax fairness, we need to stand up and \ntake action on the alternative minimum tax.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Sanders, is in the Chamber and wishes to speak. I \nwill not delay him long.\n  Let me make three brief points with regard to Senator Domenici's \nsecond-degree amendment. What that amendment does is it does three \nthings to the renewable portfolio standard I have sent to the desk.\n  First of all, it starts out by saying: Since it is a requirement that \nyou produce a certain percent of the power you are selling from \nrenewable sources, let's take the base amount of power you are selling \nand redefine it so it is smaller. It does that by saying: OK, if you \nare selling any power you produce from nuclear sources, that does not \ncount in the base. So that automatically eliminates 20 percent of the \nelectricity being sold in this country today.\n  It says: OK, that way, you can suggest to people we have a 20-percent \ngoal here--whereas the one I have sent to the desk is only 15 percent. \nBut you do not need to be a mathematician to realize that after you \ntake the 20 percent out, and you take 20 percent of 80 percent, then \nyou are getting down to 16 percent. So, essentially, there is some \nsmoke and mirrors going on there.\n  Second, they say: OK, let's redefine how you can meet that \nrequirement, that 16 percent requirement, which is what it, in fact, \nis. They say: You can meet it by using any of the renewable sources the \nBingaman amendment allows for; and that is, biomass, solar,\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\nwind, geothermal, tidal energy. Those are all options. In addition, if \nyou want to build another nuclear plant, that counts. If you want to \nimprove energy efficiency, that counts. If you want to adopt some \ndemand response programs to reduce demand, that counts against your \nrequirement. If you want to use the capture and storage technology, \nthat counts. The Secretary is given authority to identify other things \nthat could count, too, which are unspecified in the bill.\n\n  So, essentially, what you wind up--and then the final thing it does \nwith our amendment is it says: If you are a State that has some kind of \nprogram, and you think it is pursuing the same--I will read the exact \nlanguage. It says:\n\n       If the governor of a State submits to the Secretary a \n     notification that the State has in effect and is enforcing a \n     State portfolio standard that substantially contributes to \n     the overall goals of the Federal clean portfolio standard \n     under this section, then the State may elect not to \n     participate in the Federal program.\n\n  So, essentially, it is an invitation to States to adopt something and \nthen opt out, which I think undermines what we are trying to \naccomplish.\n  Essentially, the way I read the amendment by my colleague, his \nsecond-degree amendment would basically say: Let's put together this \ncomplicated trading system to keep track of what utilities are doing, \nbut, in fact, it is designed essentially to mirror what they are \nalready planning to do at any rate. It doesn't require them to do \nanything different.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk does require them to do some \nthings differently. They are going to have to actually start either \nproducing energy from renewable sources, buying energy that has been \nproduced from renewable sources by someone else, buying credits from \nsomeone else who has produced more renewable energy than they, in fact, \nneeded, or pay a compliance fee to the Secretary of Energy. So we have \nsome real teeth in our provision.\n  Now, it is not as strong as some Senators would like. I know my \ncolleague, who is about to speak, will speak to that issue, and I know \nSenator Kerry from Massachusetts feels very strongly that this is not a \nstrong enough requirement that I have suggested. But I would suggest to \nanyone who is studying these issues, the proposal I have made is a \nvastly stronger proposal than the one that my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, has proposed as an alternative.\n  I urge my colleagues to study both amendments tonight and perhaps \ntomorrow we can get a vote on both amendments. Also, I know Senator \nKerry would like an opportunity to propose that we have even a stronger \nstandard. I think he should be given that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three letters--one from \nConstellation Energy, one from a large group of environmental \norganizations, and then another one from a separate group of \nenvironmental organizations--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Constellation Energy,\n\n                                     Baltimore, MD, June 13, 2007.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Hart \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: Constellation Energy is a Fortune \n     200 competitive energy company based in Baltimore, Maryland. \n     We are the nation's leading supplier of competitive \n     electricity to large commercial and industrial customers and \n     one of the largest wholesales power sellers. We serve \n     approximately 57,000 megawatts of load on a daily basis, \n     which is equal to the amount of electricity consumed by the \n     State of California daily. Additionally, we are one of the \n     largest renewable energy credit suppliers in the northeast.\n       We believe that it is time to enact a nationwide, market-\n     based renewable portfolio standard and we support your \n     efforts to amend S. 1419, with your RPS amendment mandating a \n     15% standard by 2020. As you know, the State of Maryland also \n     has a renewable portfolio standard, which we supported. That \n     law also takes into account a market-based mechanism to \n     achieve its objectives. In addition to generating or \n     purchasing renewable energy in Maryland, electricity \n     providers have the option of complying with the standard by \n     making Alternative Compliance payments (ACP). The Maryland \n     law directs ACPs to be paid into the Maryland Renewable \n     Energy Fund, the purpose of which is, ``to encourage the \n     development of resources to generate renewable energy in the \n     State.'' The Maryland law goes on to say that, ``. . . the \n     Fund may be used only to make loans and grants to support the \n     creation of new . . . renewable sources in the State.''\n       We are somewhat concerned that your amendment may create a \n     situation where electricity providers and, by proxy, our \n     customers, may end up paying duplicatively for a separate \n     federal and state program because of uncertainty regarding \n     your definition of, ``direct associations with the generation \n     or purchase of renewable energy''.\n       We think this issue should be surmountable and would like \n     to work with you on this concern as your provision moves \n     through the legislative process.\n       Finally, we appreciate your long standing support of \n     nuclear power and want to continue our efforts to bring the \n     next generation of nuclear power plants to this country.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul J. Allen,\n\n                         Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs,\n     Constellation Energy Group.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 13, 2007.\n\n Vote Yes on the Bingaman Renewable Portfolio Standard, Vote No on the \n                   Domenici Clean Portfolio Standard\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our members and supporters \n     nationwide, we urge you to support the amendment by Senator \n     Bingaman to create a national Renewable Portfolio Standard \n     (RPS) in energy security legislation now being considered on \n     the Senate floor. Adopting a RPS would enhance national \n     energy security by diversifying our sources of electricity \n     generation and would also have substantial environmental \n     benefits, such as reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.\n       We urge you to oppose the ``Clean Portfolio Standard'' \n     amendment by Senator Domenici that allows new hydropower to \n     qualify as new renewable energy under a RPS. Existing \n     hydropower generation comprises about 7% of the nation's net \n     electricity production. The RPS should be reserved for \n     emerging technologies that need help to enter the \n     marketplace. Hydropower, a mature technology that has not \n     advanced significantly since the 19th century. Allowing new \n     hydropower into a RPS would usher in a new era of dam \n     building, destroying our nation's last remaining free-flowing \n     rivers and encourage developers to retrofit existing dams, \n     many of which have significant environmental impacts or pose \n     a threat to public safety.\n       While hydropower is an important source of energy, this \n     energy comes at a great cost to the health of our nation's \n     rivers and communities. Many hydropower plants pipe water \n     around entire sections of river leaving them dry, or worse, \n     constantly alternating between drought and floodlike \n     conditions. Hydropower turbines can chop fish into pieces, \n     and can even change the temperature and basic chemistry of \n     the water, harming fish and wildlife. Hydropower's impacts \n     have even caused the extinction of entire species.\n       We urge you to support the Bingaman Renewable Portfolio \n     Standard and oppose the Domenici Clean Portfolio Standard.\n           Sincerely,\n       American River, American Whitewater, Appalachian Mountian \n     Club, California Outdoors, California Sportfishing Protection \n     Alliance, California Trout, Catawba-Wateree Relicensing \n     Coalition, Coastal Conservation League, Columbia Riverkeeper, \n     Connecticut River Watershed Council.\n       Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center, Foothill \n     Conservancy, Foothills Water Network, Friends of Butte Creek, \n     Friends of Living Oregon Waters, Friends of the Crooked \n     River, Friends of the River, Georgia River Network, \n     Hydropower Reform Coalition, Idaho Rivers United.\n       Michigan Hydro Relicensing Coalition, Missouri Coalition \n     for the Environment, New England FLOW, New York Rivers \n     United, Northwest Resource Information Center, Northwest \n     Sportfishing Industry Association, Oregon Wild, Republicans \n     for Environmental Protection, River Alliance of Wisconsin, \n     San Juan Citizens Alliance.\n       Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, The Lands Council, Trout \n     Unlimited, Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, Utah Rivers \n     Council, Vermont Natural Resources Council, Washington Kayak \n     Club, West Virginia Rivers Coalition, Western Carolina \n     Paddler.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 13, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we urge you to support the Renewable Electricity Standard \n     (RES) to be offered by Senator Bingaman.\n       The Bingaman RES amendment would require utilities to \n     obtain at least 15 percent of their electricity from clean \n     renewable energy sources by 2020. A recent analysis by the \n     Union Concerned Scientists found that the Bingaman amendment \n     would save consumers $16.7 billion on their energy bills, \n     while reducing global warming emissions by the equivalent of \n     taking 41 million cars off the road. The standard will \n     diversify our energy supply with American-grown energy \n     resources create thousands of good new jobs, and generate \n     millions of dollars for farmers, ranchers, and local \n     communities.\n       We urge you to oppose the Domenici amendment.\n       The Domenici amendment would severely curtail our ability \n     to deploy clean renewable resources and stall investment in a \n     clean renewable future. Because it includes nonrenewables, \n     coupled with huge state and federal waivers, the Domenici \n     amendment\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\n     would fail to guarantee any of the benefits for consumers, \n     large energy users, and farmers and ranchers contained in the \n     Bingaman amendment\n       For example, the Domenici amendment would:\n       Waive requirements for state to participate in the program \n     if the governor found state programs to be ``substantially \n     contributing to the overall goal.'' This vague language could \n     stifle investment in renewables and cripple the federal \n     trading program that assures the lowest possible cost for \n     renewable energy.\n       Weaken renewable requirements by including non-renewables \n     such as nuclear power. These provisions would subtract all \n     existing nuclear generation from the utilities renewables \n     requirement, give utilities credits for already-planned and \n     economic capacity upgrades, provide a windfall for the \n     poorest performing nuclear plants of the last 3 years, and \n     give credits for building new nuclear power plants that are \n     already heavily subsidized in the 2005 Energy bill. These \n     nuclear bailouts and subsidies would reduce the potential \n     contribution of new renewable energy from the Bingaman \n     proposal.\n       Allow utilities to receive credits for ``an inherently low-\n     emission technology that captures and stores carbon'' without \n     defining what that technology might be or assuring how much, \n     if any, of the carbon actually gets stored, or how permanent \n     such storage is.\n       Allow DOE to designate ``other clean energy sources'' to \n     qualify for clean energy credits without any restrictions on \n     the Secretary.\n       Undercuts the development of new renewables by including \n     all ``new'' hydropower. This would encourage new dam \n     construction irrespective of the potential for significant \n     environmental impacts these facilities can have. The Domenici \n     amendment would reverse the compromise language in the \n     Bingaman amendment that would permit ``incremental'' hydro \n     power that encourages new hydropower generation while \n     protecting natural resources.\n       Includes electricity savings from energy efficiency and \n     demand-response programs, which will further erode the \n     national energy security, diversity, economic, and \n     environmental benefits of developing new renewable energy \n     sources. While we support a separate standard for energy \n     efficiency and demand-response, the Domenici amendment would \n     create a zero sum game between efficiency and renewable \n     energy by forcing them to compete under the same standard.\n       Overall, the combined effects of allowing nuclear, \n     efficiency, demand-response, as well as new hydro, and other \n     non renewable clean energy sources to qualify for the \n     standard-without any restrictions--would greatly reduce, and \n     potentially eliminate, the development of new renewable \n     energy sources and the corresponding economic and \n     environmental benefits.\n       We urge you to support the strong Bingaman RES amendment \n     and oppose weakening amendment such as the Domenici \n     amendment, as it would take us backwards, not forwards on \n     energy policy.\n           Sincerely,\n         EarthJustice, Environmental Law and Policy Center, \n           Greenpeace, National Audubon Society, National \n           Environmental Trust, Natural Resource Defense Council, \n           Sierra Club, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Union \n           of Concerned Scientists, U.S. Public Interest Research \n           Group, Western Organization of Resource Councils.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7625-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

I thank Senator Domenici as well.\n  As Senator Bingaman just indicated, I would go further than he is \ngoing in his proposal. I think he has made an important step forward, \nbut I think given the gravity of the situation we face, it is \nimperative for the future not only of our country but for the future of \nour planet that we seize this moment and we be bold and we be \naggressive because if we are not, what the scientific community is \ntelling us is that the results could be catastrophic.\n  When thousands of scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change tell us with 100 percent certainty that global warming \nis real, and with 90 percent certainty that it is manmade, we should \nlisten. When these scientists tell us that today, in terms of the \nmelting of glaciers and permafrost, in terms of the increase in drought \naround the world, the increase of forest fires we are seeing in the \nUnited States, in terms of the loss of drinking water and farmland all \nover the world today, it would be absolutely irresponsible not only for \nus but for future generations if we did not stand up and say we are \ngoing to do everything we can to lower greenhouse gas emissions and \nreverse global warming.\n  I have introduced legislation--which the Presiding Officer is one of \nthe cosponsors of and was introduced with Senator Boxer--which, in \nfact, would lower greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent less than \nwhere they were in 1990. I think that is the type of aggressive effort \nthat we need. If Senator Kerry offers his amendment to make sure 20 \npercent of the electricity we produce in this country comes from \nrenewables, I will strongly support that legislation. Fifteen percent, \nas Senator Bingaman has proposed, is a good step forward, but it does \nnot go far enough.\n  The bad news is that as a nation, we are lagging far behind the rest \nof the world, or many countries in the world, in going forward in terms \nof energy efficiency and sustainable energy. The bad news is that today \nin America, in terms of transportation, we are driving vehicles which, \nif you can believe it, get worse mileage per gallon than was the case \n20 years ago. Meanwhile, several weeks ago, I was in a car which was a \nretrofitted Toyota Prius which gets 150 miles per gallon. Yet, as a \nnation, on average we are driving vehicles which get worse mileage per \ngallon than we had 20 years ago.\n  All over our country, we are lacking in public transportation. In \nEurope, in Japan, in China, their rail systems are far more \nsophisticated and advanced than we are. Our roadways, from Vermont to \nCalifornia, are clogged with cars, many of them getting poor mileage \nper gallon. Yet we are not investing and creating jobs in mass \ntransportation. But it is not only transportation that we are lacking \nin, studies have indicated that if we make our own homes more energy \nefficient, we can save substantial amounts of energy.\n  Some estimates are, if we do the right things, we could cut our \nenergy expenditures by 40 percent--40 percent. Yet there are millions \nof homes in this country inhabited by lower income people who don't \nhave the money to adequately insulate their homes, put in the kind of \nroofs they need, the kind of windows they need, and we are literally \nseeing energy go right out of the doors and the windows because we are \nnot adequately funding weatherization. But it is not just lower income \npeople. Many middle-class families are also in homes that are \ninadequately weatherized, inadequately insulated.\n  One of the things I have long believed as I have studied this issue \nof global warming is that not only do we have the moral imperative to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly so that we can reverse \nglobal warming, but in that process we can seize this crisis, respond \nto this crisis, and create some very golden opportunities in terms of \ncreating good-paying jobs. If you look at those areas in the world \nwhere they have moved most effectively in terms of reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions, such as Germany, many countries in Europe, and our own \nState of California, the result has been, yes, there has been economic \ndislocation, but at the end of the day, they have created a lot more \njobs than they have lost.\n  I have worked with groups such as the Apollo Project, which is a \ngroup that brings together labor organizations as well as \nenvironmentalists, that say: How do we move toward lowering greenhouse \ngas emissions and creating good-paying jobs? The opportunities are \nsitting right in front of us.\n  Detroit has lost billions and billions of dollars year after year by \nbuilding cars that many Americans no longer want. Maybe if we move \ntoward energy-efficient cars, people might start buying those cars, and \ninstead of laying off workers, maybe we can create more jobs. Think of \nthe jobs we can create as we build a rail system that we are proud of. \nAs cities like Chicago and New York and other cities rebuild their \nantiquated subway systems, we can create jobs doing that.\n\n  We can create jobs all over this country in terms of energy \nefficiency. As we move toward biofuels, I can tell my colleagues that \nin my State of Vermont, our small family farmers are struggling very \nhard to stay on the\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\nland. There is a lot of evidence out there that we can create \nsignificant income for family-based agriculture as we move to biofuels, \nnot only in Vermont but all over this country.\n  The good news is there is a lot of good, new technology out there. \nThat means we have the opportunity right now to build the cars of the \nfuture. I was in an electric car last month which now has a range of \n200 miles--200 miles in an electric car. That is far more than most \npeople use in a day. There is potential there as well.\n  If we look at what is going on in the world right now, the fastest \ngrowing source of new energy is wind. There is huge potential in terms \nof the growth of wind technology. One of the reasons I am supporting \nthe strongest possible energy portfolio is that I want to see the wind \ntechnology exploding and growing all over this world. The more that is \nproduced, the cheaper it will become. When I talk about wind, we are \nnot just talking about large wind farms, as important as that is, as \npart of the energy mix. We are talking about small wind turbines which \nwe believe in 5 or 6 years will be available for $10,000, $12,000, \n$14,000 that on average can provide half of the electric needs a rural \nhouse might need.\n  Look at what is going on in California right now. I think we owe a \nlot to our largest State for leading us in a direction that the rest of \nour country might want to emulate. In California now what they are \nsaying is that in 10 years they want, and have funded, the need for 1 \nmillion photovoltaic units on rooftops throughout California--1 \nmillion. In California, what they are saying is they can provide \nsignificant incentives to those people who want to install \nphotovoltaics. There is huge potential in this country moving toward \nsolar energy. One of the issues that concerns me and saddens me is that \nthe technology for solar energy, which was originally developed in the \nUnited States, has now moved abroad.\n  Think of all of the jobs we can create if we as a nation had the goal \nof saying, in 10 years we will have 10 million rooftops in America \nusing solar energy. Think how many jobs we can create by people \ninstalling those units. Think of the jobs we can create as American \nfactories start producing those photovoltaic units--not in China, not \nin Japan, not in Germany, but producing them right here in the United \nStates of America. But to do that, we are going to need the policies \nsuch as net metering, which says if I own a photovoltaic unit and I \nproduce more than I am consuming, it goes back into the grid and I get \npaid for that, as they are doing right now in Germany.\n  It means if I am a middle-income person who cannot afford the $30,000 \nI need to install that photovoltaic unit, I am going to need some help, \nand it may be a lot more than the type of tax credits we are now \nproviding. I think we could learn from California, which is encouraging \npeople in a much more generous way than we are doing.\n  It is quite similar for wind production as well; that is, the \nproduction tax credit should be significantly increased and the \ninvestor tax credit should be significantly increased as well.\n  Some people might say: Well, Senator Sanders, this will cost a lot of \nmoney. They are right. It will cost a lot of money. But I would remind \nmy colleagues that not too long ago on the floor of this Senate a \nsignificant number of Senators voted to repeal the estate tax \ncompletely--repeal the estate tax completely--which would cost our \nGovernment $1 trillion over a 20-year period. All of those tax breaks \nare going to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the \npopulation, the very wealthiest people in America.\n  Well, if some of my friends think we have the resources to provide $1 \ntrillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent, I \nwould argue that we have the resources to incentivize the American \npeople to purchase automobiles and other vehicles that get good mileage \nper gallon, incentivize and help people to put photovoltaic units on \ntheir rooftops, and incentivize and help people in rural America to \npurchase small wind turbines which could provide a substantial amount \nof electricity for their homes.\n  So the good news is that today, unlike 20 or 30 years ago, what we \ncan say in honesty is that the technologies now are available in terms \nof transportation and energy efficiency.\n  Last month I talked to a major manufacturer of electric lights. What \nhe told me is that in 4 or 5 years, there will be lights on the market, \nLED lights, which will last for 20 years when plugged in and consume \nabout one-tenth of the electricity that is currently being consumed. \nThose are the kinds of breakthroughs we are making right now.\n  What we have to do as a Senate right now is provide the incentives to \nthe American people to go out and purchase the lightbulbs which today \nmight cost, if it is even a compact fluorescent lightbulb, more than an \nincandescent lightbulb, but in the long run, you save money. But we \nhave to help those who do not have the money to do that.\n  An argument could be made that if the Federal Government helped every \nAmerican purchase compact fluorescent lightbulbs and pay for those \nlightbulbs, we probably will save money in the long run without needing \nto build new powerplants, and certainly we would be making a major \ninvestment in lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I conclude by saying that we would be absolutely irresponsible if we \ndid not stand up to the big oil companies, the big coal companies, and \nall of those people who want us to continue to go along the same old \npath. We would be irresponsible because we would not be bringing about \nthe changes we need to protect our kids and our grandchildren and, in \nfact, the very well-being of our planet.\n  I hope that as this debate continues for the rest of this week and \ninto next week, that what we understand is that there is an absolute \nmoral imperative that we act as boldly as we can to lower greenhouse \ngas emissions, that we act as boldly as we can to break our dependency \non fossil fuels, that we be prepared to be a leader in the world in \nterms of moving toward energy efficiency, and that we embrace the new \ntechnologies that are out there in terms of solar energy, wind energy, \ngeothermal, and other energies.\n  The more we invest, the more we produce, the more breakthroughs we \nwill see. There are extraordinary opportunities out there, and if we do \nthe right things, if we get our act together, 30 years from today the \nkind of energy system that exists in this country will look very \ndifferent than the one that exists now. Not only will we be able to \nlower greenhouse gas emissions and reverse global warming, we are going \nto clean up the planet, which I think will go a long way to prevent \nmany types of diseases that currently exist.\n  Now is the time for boldness, now is the time for the United States \nnot to continue being a laggard behind other countries on this issue \nbut becoming a leader around the world. It is not good enough to \ncriticize China and India. What we need to do is become a leader and \nreach out and help those countries move forward in combating global \nwarming.\n  This is the opportunity, and I think history will not look kindly \nupon us if we do not take advantage of this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I echo the words of the Senator from \nVermont about the Energy bill being an opportunity for our country--an \nopportunity in terms of a better environment, global warming, to \npreserve our planet, an opportunity to stabilize energy costs, and an \nopportunity especially for good-paying jobs.\n  I come from a State that has taken a real hit from the Bush economic \npolicy. I come from a State that has taken a real hit from trade policy \nthrough the last two administrations, Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.\n  I look at what we are able to do with this Energy bill and better \nmanufacturing policy.\n  I start with a story. Oberlin College is a school halfway between \nCleveland and Toledo, not far from where I live. It is the site of the \nlargest freestanding building on any college campus in the country \nfully powered by solar energy. The problem is that all of the solar \npanels were imported from Germany and Japan because we simply do not \nmake enough solar panels in this country to do what we ought to be \ndoing. It is the same with wind turbines. Toledo is especially well \nknown for research in wind turbines and wind power. Yet with the \nexception of a plant in Ashtabula that makes a small component\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\nfor wind turbines, very little manufacturing is done in this country on \nthat particular alternative energy.\n  With the right kinds of incentives and with changing tax law, \nchanging trade law in the Energy bill, Ohio, as the industrial Midwest, \ncan play a major role in alternative energy.\n  We have seen energy policy, tax policy, trade policy, and the failure \nto have a manufacturing policy cause significant job loss. My State has \nlost literally hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs since \nPresident Bush took office, in part because of the lack of a \nmanufacturing policy and no leadership from the White House, in part \nbecause of trade policy, in part because of tax policy.\n  For us, as we look to the future on trade agreements and trade \npolicy, it is not good enough just to oppose bad trade agreements, it \nis not good enough to oppose the next round of NAFTA or CAFTA, it is \nnot good enough to try to fix PNTR with China. We need a much more \nforward-looking manufacturing policy. That means expanding efforts on \nexports. It means expanding the Manufacturing Extension Program that \nSenator Kohl has worked on and I have worked on, and others. And it \nmeans a different regimented trade policy.\n  The Bush administration has just announced with some Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, some Members of my party, that they want to \nmove forward on the Panama and Peru trade agreements. Those are two \ntrade agreements where the administration finally has decided they \nsupport environmental and labor standards, but this is also an \nadministration that has never pushed very hard for environmental and \nlabor standards in our own country.\n  I would look askance at the administration's promises without more \nproof of what, in fact, they are going to do on enforcement of labor \nand environmental standards. All one need do is look at the news \nstories that came out after the announcement from our U.S. Trade \nAmbassador Schwab and some House Democrats that there would be labor \nand environmental standards in the Panama and Peru trade agreements \nwhen soon after those news stories they said they may not be in the \ncore trade agreements, that they may be in side deals, side agreements. \nWe learned that lesson once with NAFTA where the labor standards and \nenvironmental standards were outside the agreement in a separate \nagreement, and that simply didn't matter. It didn't help that trade \nagreement work for American families in Steubenville or for workers in \nToledo. It didn't work for communities in Finley and Lima and \nMansfield.\n\n  We also know, listening to the discussions after the Peru and Panama \ntrade agreements were announced with the labor and environmental \nstandards, some people do not seem so certain that they are going to \nwork as hard on enforcing these labor standards and environmental \nstandards as they might have initially promised. All we need to do is \nlook at the Jordan trade agreement passed in 2000, a trade agreement in \nthe House of Representatives I supported but a trade agreement that had \nlabor and environmental standards. Soon after President Bush took \noffice, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick sent a letter to the \nJordanians with a wink and a nod saying that because of dispute \nresolution issues, he wasn't going to enforce those labor and \nenvironmental standards.\n  If we are going to move forward on trade policy, it means stronger \nlabor standards, stronger environmental standards, and stronger food \nsafety standards. It means standards in the agreements, as part of the \nagreements. It means enforcing those agreements, and it means a \nmanufacturing policy, the Manufacturing Extension Program, better \nassistance for small companies to export, better currency rules, \nparticularly with China. It means benchmarks so that once these trade \nagreements pass, we can gauge whether the trade agreements helped our \ntrade surplus deficit, our trade relations, and that there be \nbenchmarks showing if there were job increases or job losses, did it \nmean a lower trade deficit or higher trade deficit, did it mean wages \nwent up or wages went down for American workers. We need those \nbenchmarks if we are going to pass trade agreements so we can look a \nyear later and see if these trade agreements are working.\n  I contend they certainly are not working. The year I ran for \nCongress, the same year the Presiding Officer was elected to Congress, \nin 1992, we had a trade deficit of $38 billion. In 2006, our trade \ndeficit exceeded $800 billion. Our trade deficit with China bilaterally \nin 1992 was barely in the double digits. Today, our trade deficit with \nChina is upward of $230 billion.\n  President Bush 1 said $1 billion in trade deficit is equivalent to \nthe result of about 13,000 fewer jobs, and if you just do the math and \nlook at the trade deficit, multiplying times 20, from a factor of 20, \nthe trade deficit is that much larger today than it was a decade and a \nhalf ago, you know it is costing us jobs. That is why a trade agreement \nwith a tax policy, with a manufacturing policy that really does help \nAmerican communities, that helps people in Toledo, Finley, Zanesville, \nSpringfield, Miami Valley, and the Mahoney Valley in my State, will \nmatter to help build a middle class.\n  I am hopeful that as we do this Energy bill and the House and Senate \nmove ahead on trade policy in the next year, that we can link these so \nthat it really does help to create a middle class, strengthen the \nmiddle class in our country with better trade, tax, and manufacturing \npolicies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator \nBingaman's renewable portfolio amendment which would require that 15 \npercent of the Nation's electricity be generated from renewable sources \nby 2020.\n  I have heard from my office some of the debate which has taken place \ntoday. I was surprised that some of my colleagues have characterized \nthis amendment as some sort of Federal giveaway for the wind industry. \nThe renewable portfolio standard will not just benefit the wind \nindustry, of course, but it will also benefit the production of energy \nfrom solar, biomass, electricity from biogas, small hydro, geothermal, \nand ocean and tidal energy projects as well.\n  This diverse set of energy sources will help protect us from the fuel \nprice increases, such as those we have seen in natural gas recently. In \nturn, this reduction in demand for natural gas might even cause natural \ngas prices to fall, causing electricity prices to also fall.\n  Another economic benefit of the renewable portfolio standard is that \nit would help these emerging technologies flourish in the United \nStates. Right now there are renewable energy firms in Europe that are \noutpacing their U.S.-based competitors. But by driving up demand for \nrenewable energy domestically, we will help develop these industries at \nhome, creating jobs and allowing us to develop energy as a domestic \neconomic engine. At the same time we are meeting our energy challenges, \nat the same time that we are meeting the economic imperative of our \nenergy challenges, at the same time that we undermine foreign \ncountries--for which we are giving our dollars abroad in terms of our \naddiction to those energy sources--we can also fuel a domestic economic \nengine by pursuing these sources.\n\n  Of course, the most dramatic effect of the amendment will be its \npositive impact environmentally. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, it will reduce carbon emissions by 222 million tons per \nyear by the year 2030, and other reports project reductions of as much \nas 10 percent per year from the electricity sector. This would be the \nequivalent of removing 71 million cars from the road. Think about it--\nremoving 71 million cars from the road.\n  I also want to point out what this amendment will do for the solar \nenergy industry. This amendment will provide triple renewable energy \ncredits to solar energy. As a result, it has been estimated that this \nwill result in a 500-percent increase in solar energy production.\n  Solar needs to be a significant part of America's energy future. When \nyou have a way to generate energy that produces no carbon emissions, \nhas no moving parts, makes no noise, and results in no adverse wildlife \nimpacts, that is something we as a nation need to be pursuing.\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\n  My home State of New Jersey realized this a few years ago and set \nabout enacting policies designed to spur the growth of its solar \nmarket. The results have been extremely successful. New Jersey has the \nsecond largest solar market in the entire Nation, from 6 installations \nto nearly 2,000 in just 5 years, over 7 megawatts of installed \ncapacity, and tens of millions of kilowatt-hours produced each year. \nNew Jersey, of course, is blessed with many things, but it is not \nblessed with more Sun than most of the rest of the Nation. The State \nsimply recognized that by being visionary we could not only start \ngenerating large amounts of pollution-free energy in our own State, but \nwe could also provide a kick-start to a whole new industry. That \nindustry, of course, generates not only great energy, truly clean \nenergy, truly renewable energy, but at the same time creates a very \nsignificant economic positive consequence as well.\n  What New Jersey has done we must do as a nation. The renewable \nportfolio standard amendment, along with the extension of solar tax \ncredits, will help expand the use of solar energy, and, most \nimportantly, lower the cost.\n  I also want to urge my colleagues to oppose the Domenici amendment--\nthe amendment that Senator Domenici has offered to Senator Bingaman's \nrenewable portfolio standard amendment. That amendment would stall the \ndevelopment of renewable energy and thereby undercut the entire point \nof this bill. There are some who don't want to challenge the industry. \nThere are those who don't want to bring us to a higher standard. For \nthem, the Domenici amendment to Senator Bingaman's renewable portfolio \nstandard is their out. That is their out.\n  For those Members of the Senate who don't want to bring us to a \nhigher challenge, who don't want to challenge the industry, who, in \nessence, are happy to support the status quo, the Domenici amendment is \ntheir solution.\n  The Domenici amendment, however, has numerous problems. To begin \nwith, the substitute would allow States to opt out of the standard for \njust about any reason--just about any reason. If a State can opt out, \nthe renewable industries will be hesitant to adequately invest in these \nprojects and, therefore, we won't move forward.\n  The substitute will also weaken renewable requirements by including \nnonrenewables, such as nuclear power. This would divert money from \nrenewables to an already well-subsidized energy source.\n  The Domenici substitute would also allow the Department of Energy to \ndesignate ``other clean energy sources'' to qualify for clean energy \ncredits without any restrictions on the Secretary--without any \nrestrictions on the Secretary. Who knows what would be included under \nsuch a definition. This would leave discretion for the Secretary to \ninclude ``clean coal'' or any other source of energy one could put the \nword ``clean'' in front of.\n  In addition, the Republican substitute would include energy \ninefficiency projects and demand-response programs. The more things we \nadd to the standard, the less meaningful the standard becomes. We \ncannot pit efficiency against renewables. We need both efficiency and \nrenewables to flourish in partnership and not compete for investment \ndollars.\n  Once again, I praise Senator Bingaman, the chair of the Energy \nCommittee, on which I have the privilege of sitting, for his amendment, \nfor his vision, for bringing us and challenging us to a higher \nstandard, one that the Nation clearly needs. It will be beneficial for \nour environment, it will boost our domestic economy, and it will \nreinforce the actions taken by 23 States that have already shown \nleadership by instituting renewable portfolio standards. If the States \nhave already shown leadership in this regard, the Nation and the Senate \nneed to show the same leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that important amendment and \nagainst efforts to weaken this important provision. Those are, I hope, \nwords that Members of the Senate will take to heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7628-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PETER CHASE NEUMANN\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today I rise to honor the achievements of \nPeter Chase Neumann. Not only is Peter recognized locally and \nnationally for his skill as a trial lawyer, he is also deeply involved \nwith philanthropies whose work has been enormously beneficial to \nNevada. These significant contributions have resulted in Peter being \nnamed the recipient of the Nevada Trial Lawyers Association Lifetime \nAchievement Award, and deservedly so.\n  Peter has tried more than 150 civil and criminal cases to verdict and \nalmost 50 appeals to the Nevada and Arizona Supreme Courts. His ability \nin the legal profession is renowned, and his talents are wide-ranging, \nfrom trial advocacy in personal injury cases to writing academic \narticles. He has dedicated himself to the cause of justice for the \nwrongfully injured, and has been recognized for his work in Town and \nCountry Magazine's Top Trial Lawyers in America, in Las Vegas Magazine, \nby Top Gun Lawyers in Nevada and by The Best Lawyers in America.\n  His leadership in the legal community is unparalleled: He has served \nas president of the Arizona, Nevada, and Western Trial Lawyers \nAssociation, and on the Board of Governors for the American Trial \nLawyers Association. He was both legislative advocate for and president \nof the Plaintiff's Bar, and was accepted as a diplomat in the \nInternational Society of Barristers and the American Board of Trial \nAdvocates.\n  His devotion to the law has not in any way impeded his philanthropic \ncontributions. He and his wife Renate have served with the Angel Kiss \nFoundation, a nonprofit dedicated to helping families cope with the \nfinancial burdens associated with childhood cancer. President Clinton \nrecognized Peter's influence and appointed him to the Tahoe Regional \nPlanning Committee. He has involved himself with Scenic America and \nScenic Nevada, committing himself to the cause of protecting Nevada's \nnatural treasures in the Lake Tahoe region and beyond.\n  Peter is also an accomplished airplane pilot. In recent years, he has \nspent untold hours soaring in his gliders all over America.\n  Most people know Peter for his reputation as a renowned trial lawyer \nor for his work in the philanthropic community in my State. But I have \nhad the privilege to call Peter my friend. It is my great pleasure to \noffer congratulations to Peter Chase Neumann for his lifetime of \nexcellence in his profession, in his public service, and in his \nphilanthropy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7628-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7628-S7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, with the cost of health care \ncontinually increasing for employers, individuals, and the Government \ncombined with the growing number of uninsured Americans it is clear \nthat our health care system is in dire need of change. My goal is to \nhelp every American have access to affordable health insurance and to \ncontinue the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP.\n  In an op-ed in The Hill on June 6, 2007, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Mike Leavitt, suggested a very good proposal for \nincreasing access to health insurance. His proposal calls for \nreauthorization of SCHIP and keeping the program's focus on kids, \nproviding the same tax advantage to all Americans through a standard \ndeduction for health insurance, and encouraging State innovation \nthrough grants to help low income individuals afford private health \ninsurance.\n  I support Secretary Leavitt's ideas. However, health care reform is \ntoo big of an issue for one party to tackle on its own. Our only chance \nof achieving true, meaningful reform is if both parties work together. \nThis involves reaching across the aisle and getting Democrats to say \ntwo words ``private markets'' and Republicans to say to two words \n``universal access.''\n  Two of my colleagues have put forward two different but thoughtful \npieces of legislation addressing the uninsured Senator Wyden's Healthy \nAmericans Act, S. 334, and Senator Coburn's Universal Health Care \nChoice and Access Act, S. 1019. But I am doing something that I rarely \ndo cosponsoring both of them to encourage my goal of affordable health \ninsurance for every American while continuing the SCHIP program helping \nchildren.\n  I have cosponsored these bills in the spirit of reform, but that does \nnot mean I support every provision in both\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\npieces of legislation.

Madam President, today there is a great deal of debate \nabout how Americans are doing, in particular those considered low \nincome. I rise today to dispel a major misconception about the progress \nof low-income Americans. Those on the other side of the aisle would \nhave you believe that when one person does better it must be at the \nexpense of another. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, \nwhen Congress adopts policies that encourages individuals to work \nharder, save, take risks, and invest more, the economy does better and \neveryone benefits. Two recent studies I requested from CBO prove a \nrising tide does lift all boats.\n  The first report issued in December, entitled ``Changes in Low Wage \nLabor Markets Between 1979 and 2005,'' found that the inflation \nadjusted hourly earnings of U.S. workers was 10 percent higher now than \nback in 1979. Since 1990 those in the bottom 10th percentile of wage \nearners witnessed their inflation adjusted wages increase 12.8 percent, \nmore than 2.5 percentage points faster than those in the statistical \nmiddle.\n  CBO's second report entitled ``Changes in the Economic Resources of \nLow-Income Households with Children'' indicates that poor households \nwith children experienced real earnings gains of 80 percent since 1991, \noutpacing even those in the top income quintile whose earnings grew 54 \npercent. This fact is even more amazing viewed in the context of \nwelfare reform.\n  Those opposing welfare reforms in the mid 1990s argued that limiting \ndirect Government assistance and requiring low-income people to work \nmore would prove to be disastrous. However, low-income households with \nchildren now rely less on the Government, are more self reliant and \nhave a higher standard of living. In 1991, low-income households relied \non the Government for a majority of their income with earnings \naccounting for just 49 percent. Today, low-income households earn 65 \npercent of their income and rely on Government assistance for the \nremainder. Female headed households also rely less on the Government \nfor their livelihood. In 1991, 35 percent of their income was earned \ncompared with 54 percent now. The share of their income derived from \nAFDC or TANF fell from 42 percent in 1991 to 7 percent in 2005.\n  These two studies prove that when the Government interferes less in \nthe lives of its citizens, they are more productive. Once unencumbered \nby Government, people are motivated to work harder, save, and invest \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7629-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PASSING OF ADEN ABDULLE OSMAN\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nexpress sorrow on behalf of the Somali community of Minnesota, which is \ncurrently mourning the death of an important figure for Somalia, former \nPresident Aden Abdulle Osman. Aden Abdulle Osman, known by many Somalis \nas Aden Adde, passed away at the age of 99 on June 7, 2007.\n  Aden Abdulle Osman became the first President of Somalia in 1960 \nafter the country gained its independence on July 1. Mr. Osman served \nas President of the newly formed Somalia until June 10, 1967. President \nOsman led his country during the critical time of its formation and \ndevelopment into a full-fledged state. When he lost the Presidential \nelection in 1967, President Osman graciously ceded his position to his \nopponent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke. In doing so, Aden Abdulle Osman set \nan example for the peaceful transfer of democratic power, which is a \ncritical aspect of all democratic systems. For this reason, Aden \nAbdulle Osman is viewed throughout Somalia and Africa as a model of \nstatesmanship that seeks the greater good.\n  I am privileged to represent the State that has the largest Somali \ncommunity in the U.S. The Somalis of Minnesota represent a thriving \ncommunity that has enriched the fabric of our State through its vibrant \nculture. I would like to join my Somali constituents in expressing \nsorrow for Aden Abdulle Osman's death. It is my sincere hope that the \ncurrent leaders of Somalia will look to his leadership as an example, \nand that such leadership will serve to usher Somalia towards peace, \nstability and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7629-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MODESTO'S NATIONAL NIGHT OUT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the outstanding National Night Out program in Modesto, CA. \nFor the past 6 years, the city of Modesto has either ranked first or \nsecond in the Nation in National Night Out participation among cities \nwith populations of 100,000 to 299,999.\n  Since its inception in 1983, National Night Out has brought millions \nof Americans together to take a united stand against crime and send a \nclear message to criminals that citizens and neighborhoods are \ncommitted to crime prevention. National Night Out has played an \ninstrumental role in helping to raise crime and drug prevention \nawareness, generate support for and participation in local anticrime \nprograms, and perhaps most importantly, improve neighborhood spirit and \nstrengthen community-police partnerships.\n  In 2006, more than 35.2 million people and 11,125 communities from \nall 50 States, U.S. territories, and military bases worldwide \nparticipated in the National Night Out campaign. Conscientious \ncitizens, law enforcement agencies and civic groups came together to \nparticipate in a variety of festive events and activities such as block \nparties, ice cream socials, flashlight walks, and visits from law \nenforcement and other public agencies to help promote the importance of \ncommunity involvement in local crime-fighting programs.\n  In Modesto, 123 neighborhoods participated in National Night Out last \nyear, making it the Nation's leader among cities with populations of \n100,000 to 299,999. The city of Modesto is a shining example of the \nimportance of community and cooperation in local crime-fighting \nefforts.\n  As the residents of Modesto gather for another successful National \nNight Out campaign, I would like to congratulate and commend its \ncitizens, civic leaders, and the Modesto Police Department for their \nleadership and willingness to help make their city a safer and better \nplace to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7629-5", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7629-S7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              150TH ANNIVERSARY OF SACRAMENTO HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the \n150th anniversary of Sacramento High School in Sacramento County, CA.\n  On September 1, 1856, as the Gold Rush came to an end in California \nand miners migrated into newly formed cities, Sacramento High School \nopened its doors and began a long tradition of quality education. As \nthe second oldest high school west of the Mississippi, Sacramento High \nSchool is a historical landmark and symbol of a quality educational \ninstitution in California's capital city.\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\n  Sac High, as it is locally known, has been the alma mater of a wide \nrange of notable alumni including NBA great Kevin Johnson, Pulitzer \nPrize winner Herb Caen, and a number of distinguished Californians, \nincluding former California Governor Hiram Johnson.\n  Most recently, nearly 100 percent of the senior class will have the \nopportunity to pursue a post secondary education, 70 percent of whom \nhave been accepted to a public or private 4-year college. Sac High's \nDragons have also accumulated many championships in a variety of \nathletics over the years, including the recent San-Joaquin Division III \nChampionship that both men's and women's basketball teams have won.\n  As the school and the community celebrate Sac High's \nsesquicentennial, I would like to congratulate the past and present \nstudents, faculty, and administrators who upheld Sacramento High \nSchool's traditions and campus pride for the last century and a half \nand wish them another 150 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7630-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

These three students have harnessed \ntheir creativity and skills to produce amazing projects which were \ndisplayed today at the National Portrait Gallery in honor of National \nHistory Day. What a great achievement for these students to be selected \nout of 500,000 entries to be showcased in the National Portrait \nGallery.\n  Shannon Burns, from Los Alamos Middle school, has put together a 10-\nminute documentary on Irish immigration and how it contributed to the \nAmerican Civil War while Ryan Andrews-Armijo and Ashley Page from \nMoriarity Middle School contributed a documentary on the racial \ntensions and the triumph over those obstacles, of the 1966 Texas \nWestern College basketball team. I was incredibly honored to meet with \nthese three individuals earlier today, and I am impressed by their \nprojects and their tenacity. I am proud to see these kids learn and put \ninto action what they have learned at school and beyond.\n  I was also very pleased to hear of 44 other students, in total, from \nNew Mexico participating in the National History Day contest in \nMaryland today. It is quite impressive to see how well New Mexico was \nrepresented in this nationwide contest.\n  National History Day is an academic organization for elementary and \nsecondary children that has been celebrating history for over 25 years \nnow. This exceptional scholarship program gives kids the opportunity to \nresearch a historical event and put that research into a format for \nothers to enjoy. This is a great way for our children to learn and \nexplore history while also putting their creativity to work. History is \none of the cornerstone subjects taught in America's schools today. When \nstudents learn about the past, they are taught how to handle the \nfuture.\n  National History Day gives us a unique opportunity to reflect on our \npast and appreciate where we, as Americans, come from. History makes us \nwho we are, it defines us. We must not forget our history. Learning \nhistory is as important today in our schools as it ever was. We must \nalways be stewards of continual learning from our mistakes and \nvictories.\n  Congratulations again to the amazing students participating in this \ngreat commemoration of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7630-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HISTORY DAY PROJECTS\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

Each project reflects on this year's National History Day theme, \n``Triumphs and Tragedies in History.''\n  Haworth and Knight have been selected to present their history \nproject at the White House Visitor's Center. Trusty has been selected \nto present her project at the National Archives and Records \nAdministration. Their projects were selected by the National History \nDay program from hundreds of thousands nationwide.\n  Haworth's and Knight's project, ``Land Divided--World United,'' is a \ndepiction of the historical creation of the Panama Canal. The exhibit \nbegins with the original vision to construct a channel through Central \nAmerica and extends all the way to the completion and proposed \nexpansion of the Panama Canal.\n  Trusty is presenting a U.S. Supreme Court case which addressed the \ncontroversial issue of equal educational opportunities available \nthroughout American history. Fisher v. University of Oklahoma Board of \nRegents was one of the unfamiliar but significant cases that ultimately \nled to the landmark decision to desegregate schools in America.\n  I believe it is important for students to be informed and educated \nabout the milestones of American history, because it will strengthen \nthem as our country's future leaders and provide them with the \nknowledge to continue to lead our Nation as our Founding Fathers \nintended. History is an integral part of the education of future \ngenerations of Americans, and I would like to commend the National \nHistory Day program for empowering teachers to improve history \neducation and influencing students to follow these Oklahoma students' \nexemplary example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7630-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING MATTHEW MARIUTTO\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ.

Madam President, I wish to recognize a tremendously \ninnovative small business from my home State of Maine that recently \nopened an upgraded production facility to benefit both its employees \nand its business operations. Immucell, an emerging biotechnology \ncompany based in Portland, opened its newly expanded building on June 7 \nto great fanfare. The new facility benefits Immucell's 30 employees, \nwho now have enhanced space and equipment with which to conduct \nresearch and manufacture products. Equally as critical, the facility \nwas designed to help Immucell more easily comply with current good \nmanufacturing practice standards. Enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration, current good manufacturing practice requirements assure \nquality in our food and medicines.\n  Immucell's specialized work is quite impressive. In a rapidly \nexpanding biotech industry, Immucell has carved out a niche as a \nleading producer of medicines for animals in the dairy industry. The \ncompany's products, such as First Defense and Mast-Out, have ensured \nthe safety and health of cows and calves that supply our milk and other \ndairy products. Working together with Pfizer, Immucell has managed to \nturn Mast-Out into a profitable product. Besides its products, \nImmucell's research provides the company a respected and prestigious \nrole in the animal-health industry.\n  I was delighted to hear that Immucell is seeking to use its expanded \nfacilities to extend its reach into overseas markets. What a great \nhonor that would be for the State of Maine. Immucell contributes \nimmensely to Maine's small business community, and the ever-increasing \nrelevance of its work also places it at the forefront of modern science \nworldwide.\n  Immucell's efforts to become a leader in its market are noteworthy, \nand the vision that its leadership has for future growth reflects a \nsteadfast determination for continued success. It is particularly \nexciting that a Maine small business is making such a name for itself \nin an industry replete with large companies. Immucell and its high-\npaying jobs provide us with a shining example of smart growth. I \ncommend chief executive officer Michael Brigham and all the employees \nat Immucell for their wise choices and tremendous achievements, and I \nwish them much success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7631-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING KEITH AND PATTI JENNINGS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana expressing its opposition to the Rockies \n     Prosperity\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n     Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, bills with the same content have been introduced \n     in the Congress for the past three sessions, named \n     successively the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act of \n     2001, the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act of 2003, \n     and the Rockies Prosperity Act of 2005; and\n       Whereas, these acts would designate more than 15.4 million \n     acres as new wilderness, more than 1.4 million acres as park \n     preserves, more than 1 million acres as recovery areas, and \n     an additional 8.51 million acres as biological connecting \n     corridors; and\n       Whereas, the proposed wilderness, preserves, and recovery \n     areas would impose severe restrictions on access and human \n     activities in violation of existing laws such as the \n     Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act; and\n       Whereas, severe restrictions on the management of the \n     private property within the corridors would lead to \n     prohibition of even-aged silvicultural management, \n     prohibition of timber harvesting, prohibition of mineral, \n     oil, and gas exploration, prohibition of road construction or \n     reconstruction with the goal of achieving zero miles of road \n     in the corridors over a short time period, causing loss of \n     value to private property even to the point of forcing \n     landowners to abandon their properties, hopes and dreams and \n     causing extreme hardship and anguish; and\n       Whereas, additional taking of private property would occur \n     with the reduction of water rights on National Forest land \n     and the reduction of grazing rights on National Forest land, \n     causing hardship and loss of business to ranchers, farmers, \n     and residents in the region; and\n       Whereas, the requirements for implementation of the \n     management plans set forth in the acts are extremely \n     unbalanced in their approach to conservation, focus entirely \n     on plant, animal, and ecological effects and leave out the \n     social, economic, and cultural impacts on people who also are \n     part of the natural environment, and are in violation of \n     existing law, such as the National Environmental Policy Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Montana Legislature does not believe these \n     acts, drafted by extreme special interest groups funded by \n     international foundations and other sources that do not \n     represent the majority of Montana residents, should be \n     allowed to subject land in Montana to this sort of \n     unbalanced, unnecessary control; and\n       Whereas, the placing of environmental or other restrictions \n     upon the use of private lands has been held by a number of \n     recent United States Supreme Court decisions to constitute a \n     taking of the land for public purposes; and\n       Whereas, these acts do not include proposals to purchase \n     the private lands; and\n       Whereas, the restrictions contemplated constitute an \n     unlawful taking of that land in violation of Article I, \n     section 8, clause 17, of the Constitution of the United \n     States, which provides that before any state land can be \n     purchased, the consent of the state Legislature and not the \n     state Executive Branch must be obtained; and\n       Whereas, Article IV, section 3, clause 2, of the \n     Constitution of the United States provides that ``nothing in \n     this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any \n     claims of the United States, or of any particular state''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Article IV, section 4, of the Constitution of the \n     United States provides that ``the United States shall \n     guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of \n     government''; and\n       Whereas, Amendment V of the Constitution of the United \n     States provides that no person shall ``be deprived of life, \n     liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall \n     private property be taken for public use, without just \n     compensation''. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana: That the Montana Legislature is opposed \n     to the passage of these acts. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Montana Legislature urge the members of \n     Congress, especially the Montana delegation, to vigorously \n     oppose these acts and any revisions of these acts and to vote \n     against these acts at every opportunity, Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of State of the United States, the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States, and Montana's Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-117.

A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Nevada encouraging the use of biomass in the \n     production of energy in Nevada and encouraging certain \n     activities relating to that production; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, ``Biomass'' is the term used to describe organic \n     matter that is available on a renewable basis, including, but \n     not limited to, agricultural crops and agricultural wastes, \n     wood and wood residues, animal wastes, municipal wastes and \n     various aquatic plants; and\n       Whereas, unlike petroleum, biomass is a resource that is \n     renewable and is generally readily available at the location \n     where it is used to produce renewable energy, thereby \n     reducing the costs of distributing the biomass; and\n       Whereas, although the production and use of renewable \n     energy is encouraged in Nevada, and biomass is included in \n     the incentives provided for the production and use of \n     renewable energy, the availability and benefits of using \n     biomass itself should be accentuated and brought to the \n     attention of the members of the general public: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges Congress to \n     make biomass eligible for production tax credits at the same \n     level and in the same manner as wind and geothermal energy: \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That this Legislature encourages the use of \n     biomass in the production of energy in Nevada and therefore \n     urges all Nevadans to consider investing money in the \n     production of energy from biomass and to participate in the \n     establishment throughout the State of Nevada of projects that \n     demonstrate the effectiveness and desirability of using \n     locally obtained biomass in the production of energy and \n     partnerships between private enterprises and federal, state \n     and local governmental entities to create those projects: and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Director of the \n     Bureau of Land Management, the Chief of the United States \n     Forest Service, the Governor of the State of Nevada, the \n     Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural \n     Resources and each member of the Nevada Congressional \n     Delegation: and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-119.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to reevaluate the ``fast \n     track'' approval of international trade agreements; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, as international trade has evolved in recent years \n     under the ``fast track'' authority by which Congress reviews \n     international trade agreements involving the United States, \n     the authority for which will expire on June 30, 2007, \n     significant questions have developed with respect to the \n     continuing ability of states to retain their character, \n     environmental controls and quality of life; and\n       Whereas, under ``fast track'' rules, the review of complex \n     trade agreements by Congress is limited to a vote to approve \n     or reject the agreements, after limited time for \n     consideration, without the possibility of amendments; and\n       Whereas, trade agreements today have an impact which \n     extends significantly beyond the bounds of traditional trade \n     matters such as tariffs and quotas, and instead grant foreign \n     investors and service providers certain rights and privileges \n     regarding acquisition of land and facilities and regarding \n     operations within a state's territory, subject state laws to \n     challenge as ``non-tariff barriers to trade'' in the binding \n     dispute resolution bodies that accompany the pacts and place \n     limits on the future policy options of state legislatures; \n     and\n       Whereas, despite the demonstrated variety of significant \n     impacts that trade and investment agreements have on state \n     governance, taxation authority, environmental protection, \n     land use regulation and many other areas of state interest, \n     states and local governments have not received assurances \n     that their concerns will be adequately addressed in any \n     ``fast track'' renewal process; and\n       Whereas, Federal legislation should clarify the negotiating \n     agenda of the United States in a manner that establishes a \n     stronger role for states and should include an explicit \n     mechanism for the prior informed consent of affected state \n     legislatures: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges Congress to \n     reevaluate the ``fast track'' approval of international trade \n     agreements, and to consider replacing that authority with a \n     more democratic, inclusive and deliberative mechanism which \n     takes into consideration the concerns of state legislatures \n     and authorizes their participation in the international trade \n     agreement process; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-122. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to enact the Resident \n     Physician Storage Reduction Act of 2007; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of \n     2007 was recently introduced in Congress as a tool to help \n     states whose physician to population ratios are below that of \n     the national median; and\n       Whereas, the intent of this legislation is to increase the \n     number of residency positions for which Medicare payments \n     will be made to teaching hospitals in states with a shortage \n     of resident physicians; and\n       Whereas, increasing the number of resident physicians in \n     states is an important step towards ensuring an adequate \n     supply of physicians in the health care system; and\n       Whereas, as a result of this legislation, teaching \n     hospitals in approximately 24 states would be eligible for an \n     increase in their resident cap, including Nevada which \n     currently has 199 physicians in training and is estimated to \n     be eligible for an additional 93 positions; and\n       Whereas, as one of the fastest growing states in the \n     nation, and with a ranking of 43rd in the nation in \n     physicians per 100,000 residents, it is critical to the \n     residents of Nevada that the shortage of physicians be \n     remedied; and\n       Whereas, it is the belief of the Nevada Legislature that \n     the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act is an important \n     first step that will help meet Nevada's and the nation's need \n     for future physician services: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature hereby \n     express their support for passage of the Resident Physician \n     Shortage Reduction Act of 2007: and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature will continue to do \n     all things possible to make Nevada a desirable location for \n     the physicians who choose to practice here; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services and each member of the Nevada \n     Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-123. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to support a free trade \n     agreement between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the \n     United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 16\n\n       Whereas, it is our belief that it is this country's \n     responsibility to promote the values of freedom and \n     democracy, a commitment to open markets and the free exchange \n     of goods and ideas both at home and abroad, and the Republic \n     of China on Taiwan shares these values and has struggled \n     throughout the past 50 years to create what is an open and \n     thriving democracy; and\n       Whereas, despite the fact that Taiwan is a member of the \n     World Trade Organization, it has no formal trade agreement \n     with the United States, yet Taiwan has emerged as the United \n     States' eighth largest trading partner, the United States is \n     Taiwan's largest trading partner and American businesses have \n     benefited greatly from this dynamic trade relationship; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has emerged over the past two decades as \n     one of the United States' most important allies in Asia and \n     throughout the world; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has forged an open, market-based economy \n     and a thriving democracy based on free elections and the \n     freedom\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\n     of dissent, and it is in the interest of the United States to \n     encourage the development of both these institutions; and\n       Whereas, the United States has an obligation to its allies \n     and to its own citizens to encourage economic growth, market \n     opening and the destruction of trade barriers as a means of \n     raising living standards across the board; and\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement with Taiwan would be a \n     positive step toward accomplishing all of these goals: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature hereby \n     urge President George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Florida urging Congress to timely authorize the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program to assure federal funding \n     for the Florida Kidcare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1506\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Florida regards \n     the health of children to be of paramount importance to \n     families in the state, and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Florida regards \n     poor child health as a threat to the educational achievement \n     and social and psychological well-being of the children of \n     the State of Florid, and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Florida considers \n     protecting the health of children to be essential to the \n     well-being of Florida's youngest citizens and the quality of \n     life in the state, and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Florida considers \n     the Florida Kidcare program, which was created in 1998 and \n     currently has 1,388,520 children enrolled in the program, to \n     be an integral part of the arrangements for health benefits \n     for the children of the State of Florida, and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Florida recognizes \n     the value of the Florida Kidcare program in preserving child \n     wellness, preventing and treating childhood disease, \n     improving health outcomes, and reducing overall health costs, \n     and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Florida considers \n     the federal funding available for the Florida Kidcare program \n     to be indispensable to providing health benefits for children \n     of modest means, Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Legislature of the State of Florida: That \n     the Legislature urges the members of the Florida delegation \n     to the United States Congress to ensure that the Congress \n     reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) to continue to provide federal funding for the \n     Florida Kidcare program: Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the Governor to work \n     with the Florida delegation to ensure that SCHIP is \n     reauthorized in a timely manner. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the Governor to \n     provide the assistance necessary to identify and enroll \n     children who qualify for Medicaid or the Florida Kidcare \n     program. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature proclaims that all \n     components of state government should work together with \n     educators, health care providers, social workers, and parents \n     to ensure that all available public and private assistance \n     for providing health benefits to uninsured children in this \n     state be used to the maximum extent possible. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-125. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to continue to support \n     the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the \n     World Health Organization; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, in the first chapter of its charter, the World \n     Health Organization set forth the objective of attaining the \n     highest possible level of health for all people, and \n     participation in international health programs is crucial as \n     the potential for the spread of infectious diseases increases \n     proportionately with increases in world trade, travel and \n     population; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's population of over 23 million is larger \n     than three-fourths of the member countries who currently \n     participate in the World Health Organization; and\n       Whereas, the achievements of Taiwan in the field of health \n     are substantial and include one of the highest life \n     expectancy levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality \n     rates comparable to those of western countries, the \n     eradication of such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox \n     and the plague, and the distinction of being the first \n     country in the world to provide children with free hepatitis \n     B vaccinations; and\n       Whereas, before its loss of membership in the World Health \n     Organization in 1972, Taiwan sent specialists to serve in \n     other member countries on countless health projects and its \n     health experts held key positions in the organization, all to \n     the benefit of the entire Pacific region; and .\n       Whereas, presently, this remarkable country is not allowed \n     to participate in any forums or workshops organized by the \n     World Health Organization concerning the latest technologies \n     in the diagnosis, monitoring and control of disease; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, the government and the expert \n     scientists and doctors of Taiwan have expressed a willingness \n     to assist financially and technically in international aid \n     and health activities supported by the World Health \n     Organization, but these offers have been refused; and\n       Whereas, admittance of Taiwan to the World Health \n     Organization would bring tremendous benefits to all persons \n     in this world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     Nevada, Jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature \n     hereby urge President George W. Bush and the Congress of the \n     United States to continue to support all efforts made by the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan to gain meaningful participation \n     in the World Health Organization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, the Director General of the Taipei \n     Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco, the Executive \n     Director of the Las Vegas Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce and \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-126.

Bush described the crisis in \n     Darfur as genocide, and\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2005, President Bush confirmed that \n     ``the violence in the Darfur region is clearly genocide and \n     the human cost is beyond calculation,'' and\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2006, President Bush stated, ``we will \n     call genocide by its rightful name, and we will stand up for \n     the innocent until the peace of Darfur is secured,'' and\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2006, the Government of Sudan and the \n     largest rebel faction in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation \n     Movement, led by Minni Minnawi, signed the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement (DPA), and\n       Whereas, violence in Darfur escalated in the months \n     following the signing of the DPA, with increased attacks \n     against civilians and humanitarian workers, and\n       Whereas, violence has spread to the neighboring states of \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, threatening regional \n     peace and security, and\n       Whereas, in July 2006, more humanitarian aid workers were \n     killed than in the previous 3 years combined, and\n       Whereas, violence has forced some humanitarian \n     organizations to suspend operations, leaving 40 percent of \n     the population of Darfur inaccessible to aid workers, and\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), \n     asserting that the existing United Nations Mission in Sudan \n     (UNMIS) ``shall take over from the African Union Mission in \n     Sudan (AMIS) responsibility for supporting the implementation \n     of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) upon the expiration of \n     AMIS's mandate but in any event no later than 31 December \n     2006,'' and that UNMIS ``shall be strengthened by up to \n     17,300 military personnel . . . up to 3,300 civilian police \n     personnel and up to 16 Formed Police Units,'' which ``shall \n     begin to be deployed no later than 1 October 2006,'' and\n       Whereas, on September 19, 2006, President Bush announced \n     the appointment of Andrew Nastios as Presidential Special \n     Envoy to lead United States efforts to bring peace to the \n     Darfur region in Sudan, and\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2006, high-level consultations led \n     by Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, and \n     Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the African \n     Union Commission, and including representatives of the \n     Arab League, the European\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\n     Union, the Government of Sudan, and other national \n     governments, produced the ``Addis Ababa Agreement,'' and\n       Whereas, the Agreement stated that the DPA must be made \n     more inclusive, and ``called upon all parties--Government and \n     DPA nonsignatories--to immediately commit to a cessation of \n     hostilities in Darfur in order to give the peace process the \n     best chances for success,'' and\n       Whereas, the Agreement included a plan to establish a \n     United Nations-African Union peacekeeping operation that \n     would consist of no fewer than 17,000 military troops and \n     3,000 civilian police, and would have a primarily African \n     character, and\n       Whereas, the Agreement stated that the peacekeeping \n     operation must be logistically and financially sustainable, \n     with support coming from the United Nations, and\n       Whereas, it is imperative that a peacekeeping force in \n     Darfur have sufficient strength and the mandate to provide \n     adequate security to the people of Darfur, and\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, New Mexico Governor Bill \n     Richardson met with Sudanese President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir; \n     their meeting resulted in the issuance of a Joint Statement \n     calling for ``a 60-day cessation of hostilities by all \n     parties within the framework of the Darfur Peace Agreement,'' \n     and\n       Whereas, the Joint Statement called for the initiation of \n     African Union/United Nations diplomatic efforts within the \n     framework of the DPA, and for two projected meetings--a \n     Government of Sudan-sponsored field commanders' conference to \n     be attended by representatives of the African Union and the \n     United Nations, and a subsequent African Union/United Nations \n     sponsored peace summit, again within the framework of the \n     DPA, to be held no later than March 15, 2007, and\n       Whereas, the Joint Statement stated the need to disarm all \n     armed groups, including the Janjaweed, pursuant to the \n     provision of the DPA: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Florida Legislature:\n       (1) Supports, given the rapidly deteriorating situation on \n     the ground in Darfur, the principles of the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement of November 17, 2006, in order to increase security \n     and stability for the people of Darfur.\n       (2) Declares that the deployment of an African Union-United \n     Nations peacekeeping force under the command and control of \n     the United Nations, as laid out in the Addis Ababa Agreement, \n     is the minimum acceptable effort on the part of the \n     international community to protect the people of Darfur.\n       (3) Supports the strengthening of the African Union \n     peacekeeping mission in Sudan so that it may improve its \n     performance with regard to civilian protection as the African \n     Union peacekeeping mission begins to transfer responsibility \n     for protecting the people of Darfur to the United Nations-\n     African Union peacekeeping force under the command and \n     control of the United Nations, as laid out in the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement.\n       (4) Calls upon the Government of Sudan to immediately:\n       (a) Allow the implementation of the united Nations light \n     and heavy support packages as provided for in the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement;

and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Florida Legislature urges Congress to do \n     all in its power to further the goals expressed in this \n     memorial in order to bring lasting peace to the people of \n     Darfur: and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-127. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana repealing, rescinding, canceling, \n     voiding, and superseding any and all extant application \n     previously made by the Legislature to Congress to call a \n     convention pursuant to the terms of Article V of the U.S. \n     Constitution for proposing one or more amendments to it; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Montana, acting \n     with the best of intentions, has, at various times and during \n     various sessions, previously made applications to the \n     Congress of the United States of America to call one or more \n     conventions to propose either a single amendment concerning a \n     specific subject or to call a general convention to propose \n     an unspecified and unlimited number of amendments to the \n     United States Constitution, pursuant to the provisions of \n     Article V of the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, former Chief Justice of the United States of \n     America Warren E. Burger, former Associate Justice of the \n     United States Supreme Court Arthur J. Goldberg, and other \n     leading constitutional scholars agree that such a convention \n     may propose sweeping changes to the Constitution, any \n     limitations or restrictions purportedly imposed by the states \n     in applying for a convention or conventions to the contrary \n     notwithstanding. thereby creating an imminent peril to the \n     well-established rights of the citizens and the duties of \n     various levels of government; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     has been amended many times in the history of this nation and \n     may be amended many more times. without the need to resort to \n     a constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for \n     more than 200 years and has been found to be a sound document \n     that protects the lives and liberties of the citizens; and\n       Whereas, there is no need for, and rather there is great \n     danger in, a new Constitution or in opening the Constitution \n     to sweeping changes, the adoption of which would only create \n     legal chaos in this nation and only begin the process of \n     another 2 centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the Legislature does hereby \n     repeal, rescind, cancel, nullify, and supersede to the same \n     effect as if they had never been passed any and all extant \n     applications by the Legislature of the State of Montana to \n     the Congress of the United States of America to call a \n     convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the \n     United States of America, pursuant to the terms of Article V \n     of the Constitution, regardless of when or by which session \n     or sessions of the Montana Legislature the applications were \n     made and regardless of whether the applications were for a \n     limited convention to propose one or more amendments \n     regarding one or more specific subjects and purposes or for a \n     general convention to propose an unlimited number of \n     amendments upon an unlimited number of subjects; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the following resolutions and memorials are \n     specifically repealed, rescinded, canceled, nullified, and \n     superseded: Joint Concurrent Resolution No. 2, 1901; House \n     Joint Resolution No. 1, 1905; Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, \n     1907; House Joint Memorial No. 7, 1911; House Joint \n     Resolution No. 13, 1963; and Senate Joint Resolution No. 5, \n     1965; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Montana \n     urges the Legislatures of each and every state that has \n     applied to Congress to call a convention for either a general \n     or a limited constitutional convention to repeal and rescind \n     the. applications; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is directed to send \n     copies of this resolution to the Secretary of State of each \n     state in the Union, to the presiding officers of both houses \n     of the Legislatures of each state in the Union, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7638-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DODD, from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 1610.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1604. A bill to Increase the number of well-educated nurses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Nursing \nEducation and Quality of Health Care Act of 2007. This legislation is \nessential for addressing our current and future nursing shortages.\n  I have been hearing from nurses and health care providers from every \npart of New York that we are facing an impending nursing crisis and \ntheir stories echo what nurses across the Nation tell me.\n  By 2014, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that there will be \nover 1 million job openings for registered nurses. In New York alone, \nwe will need to produce over 80,000 new RNs to meet these projections. \nOne of our greatest needs will be in rural areas where the pool of \nnurses is small and the loss of just one nurse from the workforce can \nhave a profound impact on the health of the community.\n  I can proudly say we have made good progress in New York on one \nfront. In 2006, 30 percent more registered nurses graduated than in \n2004. I believe that we can credit this increase to the Nurse \nReinvestment Act that was signed into law in 2002. Through this \nbipartisan legislation, we were able to make great strides in \nstrengthening our Nation's nursing workforce.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act included a number of critical initiatives \nincluding one from the bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Smith \nto retain nurses who are already in the profession by encouraging \nhospitals to become magnet hospitals. Hospitals that have achieved \nmagnet status report lower mortality rates, higher patient \nsatisfaction, greater cost-efficiency, and patients experiencing \nshorter stays in hospitals and intensive care units underlining the \nimportance of nursing in our health care system.\n  I am here today because nurses are still facing an urgent situation \nthat requires our action. Even though we are making progress in \ngraduating more nurses, in 2006 over 32,323 qualified applicants were \nturned away from nursing schools in the United States. In New York, it \nis estimated that nearly 3,000 nursing school applicants were denied \nentry. Put simply, we don't have the capacity in our nursing schools to \ntrain qualified potential students.\n\n  Not only are we facing a nursing shortage, we are setting ourselves \nup for a potential nursing crisis if we don't address the impending \nfaculty shortage that will occur as baby boomer nurse faculty reach \nretirement age, leaving fewer and fewer faculty to teach the next \ngeneration of nurses.\n  We need to pave the way and recruit more people into the nursing \nprofession. This shortage impacts not only nurses, but also patients \nsince we know that the quality of care they receive is directly related \nto nurses.\n  The Nursing Education and Quality of Health Care Act supports \nrecruitment, education, and training to help alleviate the nursing \nshortage in New York and in the rest of the Nation. This act will \nestablish distance learning opportunities for peop1ein rural \ncommunities who wish to pursue the nursing profession without leaving \ntheir home town. This legislation will also provide tuition assistance \nand loan forgiveness for those who choose to practice in rural \ncommunities.\n  To increase the number of nurses in the workforce we need to expand \nthe nursing faculty so that thousands of qualified students are not \nturned away from the profession. This legislation will fund programs \nthat enhance recruitment of faculty and allow for the expansion of \nnursing education programs by funding distance learning innovation, and \nby expanding the recruitment and training of community-based faculty \nfor classroom and clinical education.\n  We also need nurses to participate and collaborate in patient-safety \ninitiatives for the well-being of patients. The Nursing Education and \nQuality of Health Care Act will take the lead by supporting projects \nthat integrate patient safety practices into nursing education programs \nand enhance the leadership of nurses in improving patients' outcomes \nwithin their health care settings.\n  We will all rely on nurses sometime in our life, and we need to make \nsure that this essential member of the health care team will always be \npresent at our bedsides.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation that supports nurses and that \nis supported by nursing organizations like the American Association of \nColleges of Nursing, the American Nurses Association, the American \nOrganization of Nurse Executives, the Brooklyn Nursing Partnership, and \nthe New York State Area Health Education Center System. Nurses are \ncritical to the successful operation of our hospitals and the quality \nof care patients receive and we must do everything we can to address \nthe nursing shortage and make nursing an attractive and rewarding \nprofession.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nClinton, in introducing this important piece of legislation to help \nalleviate the nursing shortage in our Nation. This legislation will \nwork to ensure that our nursing schools have increased capacity and the \ntools necessary to properly train nurses to enter into the workforce.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the shortage of nurses is a current \nand ever increasing problem in our Nation. As baby boomers age and \ndemands for health care continue to increase, we will further see a \nshortage of nurses, which is not sustainable for the health needs of \nour Nation. While the number of graduates from nursing programs is \nincreasing, we are still facing ongoing critical shortages and we must \ndo better.\n  Incredibly, while we have an ever-increasing demand for nurses, we \nare also seeing our schools of nursing turn away scores of students \neach year who are viable candidates due to lack of capacity and lack of \nteaching staff. In fact, in my home State of Oregon, for each student \nposition available in nursing programs, there are six applicants. This \nforces many young men and women who want to enter this field of work to \ngive up on pursuing a nursing career. This is one of many reasons that \nwe currently have 118,000 vacant positions for nurses nationwide, this \ntranslates to a national vacancy rate of 8.5 percent.\n  Our entire Nation is on an aging trajectory in all areas, and the \nnursing workforce is no exception. In Oregon, nearly half of our nurses \nare age 50 or older, and the proportion of nurses over the age of 50 \nhas doubled in the last 20 years. We also know that according to a \nsurvey in 2006, 55 percent of surveyed\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\nnurses reported their intention to retire between 2011 and 2020. \nFurther, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nHRSA, this will leave America with a deficit of more than 1 million \nnurses by the year 2020.\n  The bill that I am introducing today with Senator Clinton will \nprovide grants to enhance rural nurse training programs by improving \nthe technology infrastructure. It also will provide grants for nurse \nfaculty development so that schools of nursing can increase the number \nof nursing faculty in their programs, thereby increasing the number of \nstudents they can accept into their programs. This bill also will \nencourage pipeline programs to help increase the number of rural \nresidents who pursue nursing in their communities. Lastly, it will \nprovide grants for partnerships that advance the education, delivery \nand measurement of quality and patient safety in nursing practices. \nThese important provisions will help in the recruitment and training of \nnurses as well as work towards enhanced quality and safety of nursing \nacross the Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Kennedy and other members of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to secure its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Smith, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Thune, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Enzi, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1605. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect and preserve access of Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas to \nhealth care providers under the Medicare program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is with mixed emotions that I rise \ntoday to introduce the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act of 2007, \nor R-HoPE. This proposal is the result of months of work with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, who just passed away. In fact, \nSenator Thomas and I were getting ready to introduce this bill the week \nwe lost him.\n  This particular legislation is the product of work that Senator \nThomas and I have done over many years as cochair of the rural health \ncaucus. So it is a poignant moment for me to come to the floor to \nintroduce this bill. I am asking my colleagues that we name this bill \nthe Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act of 2007, as we \npay tribute to the service of our colleague, Senator Thomas.\n  I can think of no better champion of rural health than Senator Craig \nThomas, and there is not a more appropriate way to honor his Senate \ncareer than by enacting this legislation that will carry his name.\n  As Senator Thomas and I continually argued in this Chamber, Medicare \nshortchanges many rural hospitals and providers. Before the Medicare \nModernization Act, rural providers received one-half the payments that \nurban areas received--one-half to provide exactly the same treatment \nfor exactly the same illness. That was unfair.\n  Senator Thomas and I teamed up at the time to make changes that were \nin the Medicare prescription drug bill that began to level the playing \nfield, but those provisions are about to run out.\n  I would be the first to admit that health care can be more expensive \nin urban areas than rural areas, but it is not twice as much. When I \nask the doctors and hospital administrators of my State if they get a \nrural discount when they buy technology for hospitals, they laugh, they \nchuckle, they say, no, they don't get any rural discount. We know now \nit actually costs more to recruit doctors to rural parts of the country \nthan it does more urban settings, and we know while there is some cost \ndifferential, it is not a 100-percent cost differential.\n  The Medicare bill, the prescription drug bill recognized this \ndisparity in reimbursement and took steps to close the gap. Even with \nthe additional funding, many rural hospitals and providers continue to \nexperience negative margins.\n  If we are to maintain access to health care in rural areas, we cannot \nallow providers to lose 3 percent on nearly every patient they see. But \nthat is what is occurring in rural America today.\n  Congress needs to take steps to fairly reimburse rural providers for \nthe care they provide. The Craig Thomas R-HoPE bill will build on the \nprogress made in the medicare Prescription Drug Act and add new \nprovisions that would protect access to rural health care.\n  First, the bill will fulfill the promise made to those living and \ntraveling in rural areas that they don't have to travel far for \nhospital care. The bill would also provide more reflective \nreimbursement for the cost of labor in rural areas. I should say \nreimbursement that more fairly reflects the costs in rural areas since \nthey are often competing with more urban areas in the global health \ncare marketplace.\n  In addition, our proposal would provide the resources currently \nlacking in rural hospitals to repair crumbling buildings. It also \nincludes two changes to the Critical Access Hospital Program and will \nput these facilities on a sounder financial footing.\n  Second, R-HoPE will promise that rural Americans can see a doctor \nwhen they are sick. As is the case with most rural States, much of \nNorth Dakota is designated as a health professional shortage \narea. Recruiting doctors is extremely difficult. Our bill would extend \nthe provision in current law that provides incentive payments for \ndoctors who practice in rural areas.\n\n  Third, our bill would guarantee that when there is an emergency, \nthere is an ambulance there to respond. Many rural ambulance services \nare closing because of lower Medicare reimbursement, resulting in \nresponse times far above the national average. R-HOPE would protect \nrural ambulance services and those living and traveling in these parts \nof the country by providing a 5-percent bonus payment for 2008 and \n2009.\n  Finally, our bill takes a number of steps to help protect the \navailability of other health care providers, such as rural health \nclinics, home health agencies, and mental health professionals. This \nbill achieves the goal Senator Thomas and I have had for a number of \nyears, that rural America enjoy the same level of health care access \nand affordability more urban areas enjoy. Rural America is the heart of \nour country. We cannot turn our backs on these areas and their health \ncare needs.\n  Before I close, I also want to recognize Senator Thomas's staff \nmember, Erin Tuggle, who has worked tirelessly on this legislation on \nbehalf of rural health care and served Senator Craig Thomas so very \nwell. She played a key role in developing this legislation, along with \nmy staff, and I thank her for her efforts.\n  It is my hope this legislation, which will carry Senator Craig \nThomas's name, will help strengthen our rural health care system. I \ncan't think of a better tribute to my friend and our colleague, Senator \nCraig Thomas.\n  At this point, I wish to indicate that Senator Roberts is my leading \ncosponsor, Senator Roberts of Kansas, and we are joined by Senator \nHarkin, Senator Salazar, Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nSmith, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Snowe, Senator Murray, \nSenator Thune, Senator Dorgan, Senator Collins, Senator Johnson, and \nSenator Enzi. I ask unanimous consent that they all appear as \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I should also indicate before I close that this bill has \nnow been endorsed by the National Rural Health Association, the \nAmerican Hospital Association, the American Ambulance Association, the \nAmerican Telemedicine Association, the National Association for Home \nCare & Hospice, the American Association for Marriage and Family \nTherapy, the National Association of Rural Health Clinics, the North \nDakota Hospital Association, and the Federation of American Hospitals, \nall of them joining together to send a message that this legislation is \nneeded and it is needed now.\n  This is one way we can pay a tangible tribute to the service of \nSenator Craig Thomas. I think all of us who knew him and worked with \nhim knew him as\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\na quintessential gentleman, and I hope very much that others of our \ncolleagues will join us in cosponsoring this legislation in this \ntribute to Senator Thomas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. McCain, Mr. Warner, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Graham, Mr.  Kennedy, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Ms. Collins, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Obama, \n        Mrs. Dole, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Thune, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Brown, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n        Tester, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Pryor, Mr. Webb, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1606. A bill to provide for the establishment of a comprehensive \npolicy on the care and management of wounded warriors in order to \nfacilitate and enhance their care, rehabilitation, physical evaluation, \ntransition from care by the Department of Defense to care by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and transition from military service to \ncivilian life, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President in February, a series of articles in the \nWashington Post highlighted shortfalls in the care and treatment of our \nwounded warriors at the Walter Reed Army Hospital. These articles \ndescribed deplorable living conditions for some service members in an \noutpatient status; a bungled, bureaucratic process for assigning \ndisability ratings that determine whether a service member will be \nmedically retired with health and other benefits for himself and for \nhis family; and a clumsy handoff between the Department of Defense and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs as the military member transitions \nfrom one department to the other. The Nation's shock and dismay \nreflected the American people's support, respect, and gratitude for the \nmen and women who put on our Nation's uniform. They deserve the best, \nnot shoddy medical care and bureaucratic snafus.\n  The Armed Services Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee held \na rare joint hearing to identify the problems our wounded soldiers are \nfacing. These committees continue to work together to address these \nissues, culminating in the bill we introduce today, the Dignified \nTreatment for Wounded Warriors Act. Our bill addresses the issues of \nsubstandard facilities, inconsistent disability ratings, lack of \nseamless transition from DOD to the VA, inadequacy of severance pay, \ncare and treatment for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, medical care for caregivers not eligible for TRICARE, and the \nsharing of medical records between the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  The Dignified Treatment for Wounded Warriors Act requires the \nSecretary of Defense to establish standards for the treatment of and \nhousing for military outpatients. These standards will require \ncompliance with Federal and other standards for hospital facilities and \noperations and will be uniform and consistent throughout the Department \nof Defense.\n  Another shortfall identified in the aftermath of the Washington Post \narticles is the inconsistency in disability ratings for the same and \nsimilar disabilities. In many instances, disability ratings assigned by \nthe Veterans' Administration are higher than the disability ratings \nassigned by the military services for the same injuries. The military \nservices are not even consistent among themselves in assigning \ndisabilities. The Dignified Treatment for Wounded Warriors Act \naddresses the issue of disparate disability ratings in several ways.\n  First, it requires the military departments to use VA standards for \nrating disabilities, allowing the military to deviate from these \nstandards only when the deviation will result in a higher disability \nrating for the service member. In our view, requiring all of the \nmilitary departments and the VA to use the same standards should result \nin identical disability ratings for the same or similar disabilities.\n\n  Second, the act will change the statutory presumption used by the \nmilitary departments for determining whether a disability is incurred \nincident to military service or existed prior to military service to \nmirror the statutory presumption used by the VA. Currently, the \nmilitary rule is that a disability is presumed to be incident to \nservice if a member has been in the military for 8 or more years. That \nleaves out a high percentage of our troops. Under the revised rule, a \ndisability will be presumed to be incident to service when the member \nhas 6 months or more of active military service and the disability was \nnot noted at the time the member entered active duty, unless compelling \nevidence or medical judgement warrant a finding that the disability \nexisted before the member entered active duty. This should avoid the \nsituation where the military assigns a disability rating of zero \npercent on the basis that a disability existed prior to service and the \nVA later awards a higher disability rating and disability compensation \nby using the VA presumption to conclude that the very same disability \nis service connected.\n  Third, the act will require two pilot programs to test the viability \nof using the VA to assess disability ratings for the Department of \nDefense. One pilot program will require the Veterans' Administration to \nassign the disability ratings for the Department of Defense, based on \nall medical conditions that render the service member medically unfit \nfor military service. The other pilot program will require the military \ndepartment and the VA to jointly assign the disability rating, also \nbased on all medical conditions that render the service member \nmedically unfit for military service.\n  Fourth, the act will require the Secretary of Defense to establish a \nboard to review and, where appropriate, correct disability \ndeterminations of 20 percent or less for those service members \nseparated from service because they were medically unfit for duty after \nSeptember 11, 2001. This will give our service members an opportunity \nto correct unwarranted low disability ratings and ensure that \ndisability ratings are uniform and equitable.\n  The Institute of Medicine has just completed a study for the \nVeterans' Disability Benefits Commission, concluding that current VA \nstandards are out of step with modern medical advances in conditions \nsuch as traumatic brain injury and modern concepts of disability. The \nDisability Commission is due to report to Congress on its findings and \nrecommendations in October. The Dignified Treatment for Wounded \nWarriors Act will require the Department of Defense to use any updated \nstandards as soon as the Veterans' Administration adopts them.\n  Our bill addresses the lack of a seamless transition from the \nmilitary to the Veterans' Administration by requiring the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a \ncomprehensive policy on the care and management of service members who \nwill transition from DOD to the VA. This policy will address the care \nand management of service members in a medical hold or medical holdover \nstatus, the medical evaluation and disability evaluation of disabled \nservice members, the return of disabled service members to active duty \nwhen appropriate, and the transition of disabled service members from \nreceipt of care and services from the Department of Defense to receipt \nof care and services from the VA.\n  Another problem identified by the committees is the inadequacy of \nseparation pay for junior service members. Those separated with a \ndisability rating of 30 percent or higher are medically retired with \nhealth care and additional benefits for the service members and their \nfamilies. Those separated with a disability rating of less than 30 \npercent are discharged and given a severance pay that is based on how \nlong they were in the military. For example, a service member with 2 \nyears of service will receive the equivalent of only 4 months basic pay \nas severance pay. This bill increases the minimum severance pay to \n1 year's basic pay for those separated for disabilities incurred in a \ncombat zone and 6 months' basic pay for all others. Furthermore, under \ncurrent law, severance pay is deducted from any VA disability \ncompensation these service members receive. Our bill changes that by \neliminating the requirement that severance\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\npay be deducted from disability compensation for disabilities incurred \nin a combat zone.\n\n  The signature injuries of the current conflicts are post-traumatic \nstress disorder, commonly referred to as PTSD, and traumatic brain \ninjury, referred to as TBI. We still have a lot to do to adequately \nrespond to these injuries. To address this, the Dignified Treatment of \nWounded Warriors Act authorizes $50 million for improved diagnosis, \ntreatment, and rehabilitation of members with TBI or PTSD. The act also \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to establish Centers of Excellence \nfor PTSD and for TBI. These centers will conduct research, train health \ncare professionals, and provide guidance throughout the Department of \nDefense in the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and \nrehabilitation of these injuries. Finally, the act requires the \nSecretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, to report to Congress with comprehensive plans to prevent, \ndiagnose, mitigate, treat, and otherwise respond to TBI and PTSD. These \nplans will address improvements of personnel protective equipment in \naddition to addressing the medical aspects of diagnosing and treating \nTBI and PTSD.\n  We are also addressing the problem that exists because medically \nretired service members, who are eligible for TRICARE as retirees, do \nnot have access to some of the cutting-edge treatments that are \navailable to members still on active duty. To address this shortfall, \nthe act authorizes medically retired service members with disability \nratings of 50 percent or higher to receive the active duty medical \nbenefit for 3 years after the member leaves active duty.\n  We are also beginning to address the problem created when parents, \nsiblings, and others who are not normally authorized to receive \nmilitary health care leave their homes to serve as caregivers to \nmilitary personnel with severe injuries while the members are \nundergoing extensive medical treatment. In many cases, these family \nmembers leave their jobs and lose their job-related health care. Even \nthough these family members are in a military hospital, they are not \nauthorized to receive medical care from the doctors at that facility \nwhen they need it. To address this, the act authorizes military and VA \nhealth care providers to provide urgent and emergency medical care and \ncounseling to family members on invitational travel orders.\n  One of the significant shortfalls in the smooth transition from \nmilitary health care to VA health care is the inability to share health \nrecords between the two Departments. Our bill will establish a \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs Interagency \nProgram Office to develop and implement a joint electronic health \nrecord.\n  The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act is a comprehensive \nbill that lays out a path for the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to address shortfalls in the care and \nmanagement of our wounded warriors. They deserve the best care and \nsupport we can muster. The American people rightly insist on no less.\n  Mr. AKAKA Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I was \ndelighted to work with Senator Levin, chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and others on this important legislation, the Dignified \nTreatment of Wounded Warriors Act of 2007. I really appreciated the \nwillingness of the Armed Services Committee staff to work in close \ncooperation with the Veterans' Affairs Committee staff on its drafting. \nThis legislation would improve the policies which govern the care and \nmanagement of all servicemembers with a serious illness or injury that \nmight render them unfit for duty in order to facilitate and enhance \ntheir care, rehabilitation, and physical evaluation, as well as improve \ntheir transition from the Department of Defense to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  This measure is a direct outcome of an unprecedented joint hearing \nheld on April 12, 2007, by the Senate Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs Committees during which we heard testimony on the transition of \nservicemembers from DoD to VA. This measure will go a long way toward \naddressing the problems that first gained public attention with the \nstories about Walter Reed Army Medical Center and will help achieve the \ngoal of providing optimal care and a truly seamless transition for the \nnation's wounded warriors.\n  I view issues relating to those servicemembers who may be rendered \nunfit as a result of an illness or injury from two different \nperspectives, both as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and \nas a member of the Armed Services Committee. As I said at the joint \nhearing, this is not solely a DoD or a VA problem. While DoD and VA are \nseparate organizations, they both deal with the same servicemembers. A \nkey element of this proposed legislation is the requirement that DoD \nand VA develop a comprehensive policy for transitioning those with \nserious illnesses or injuries from Active Duty military status to \nveteran status. As part of this effort, the two Departments will be \nrequired to conduct a comprehensive review of all regulations, \npolicies, and procedures that impact these servicemembers and to \nidentify best practices when developing joint policy. If we are going \nto fix the problems identified at Walter Reed, there must be uniform \nstandards for the transition process that are understood by all parties \nand that are consistently applied by the military services.\n  I am delighted that the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act \nembraces the reforms to the DoD Disability Evaluation System contained \nin S. 1252, legislation I introduced on April 30, 2007. For the \nDisability Evaluation System to work fairly and consistently, there \nmust be uniform use by the military services of VA's disability rating \nschedule. The services must take into account all conditions which \nrender a servicemember unfit when making a disability rating, as well \nas develop a program for the uniform training of Medical Evaluation \nBoard and Physical Evaluation Board personnel. It is also essential \nthat DoD develop a system of accountability to ensure that the military \nservices comply with disability rating regulations and policies.\n  I am pleased to note that on June 27 the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nwill conduct a markup of legislation that will complement the efforts \nof the Armed Services Committee to make sure that VA appropriately \naddresses problems confronting seriously wounded and injured \nservicemembers once they become veterans.\n  I commend Chairman Levin and the staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee for crafting this comprehensive legislation. It will go a \nlong way toward providing DoD and VA with a roadmap for improving the \ntransition processes and ensuring that seriously ill and injured \nservicemembers and veterans get the benefits and services they need and \ndeserve, the benefits and services these courageous men and women have \nearned by their service.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support this proposed legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee I am pleased to co-sponsor the Dignified Treatment \nof Wounded Warriors Act, which would ensure that wounded and injured \nmembers of the Armed Forces receive the care and benefits that they \ndeserve.\n  We were all surprised and deeply disappointed by the conditions at \nWalter Reed and the problems that our wounded warriors faced after \ntheir inpatient care was complete, living in substandard conditions at \nBuilding 18, being treated poorly, battling a Cold War-era disability \nevaluation process, and for some, simply falling through the cracks.\n  Since February of 2007, many encouraging changes have been initiated \nby the Department of Defense. First and foremost, Secretary Gates \nestablished and enforced a culture of accountability for the leadership \nfailures that lead to the tragedy at Walter Reed. Medical facilities \nhave now been inspected by all three military departments, and \nimprovements are underway. Additional counselors and support has been \nprovided to families. On April 25, 2007, a new Warrior Transition \nBrigade stood up at Walter Reed to manage all the needs of wounded and \nill soldiers, both Active and Reserve. DOD has begun to exert greater \nmanagement responsibility for the disability\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nevaluation systems of the military departments. We are on the right \ntrack to address the problems at Walter Reed and at other hospitals. We \nneed to ensure that the effort is sustained. This legislation will \nensure that these efforts continue.\n  The legislation requires that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs work together to develop new policy to better manage the care \nand transition of our wounded soldiers. This policy would address many \nof the concerns that have been raised by wounded soldiers and their \nfamilies, conditions while in a medical hold status, the need to \nstreamline and make more transparent the medical and physical \nevaluation board processes, policies that facilitate the return to duty \nfor soldiers who are able, and a policy governing the smooth transition \nof separating service members from the Department of Defense to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs which focuses on the needs of patients.\n  This legislation would improve health care benefits to severely \nwounded soldiers by extending their health care benefits as if the \nmember were on active duty for a period of up to 5 years. This approach \nensures that our most severely wounded have as many health care options \nas possible, especially for treatment of traumatic brain injury and \nother long term serious conditions.\n  This legislation authorizes additional funding for traumatic brain \ninjury and post-traumatic stress disorder and requires the \nestablishment of two centers of excellence for the prevention, research \nand treatment on these consequences of war. This legislation would also \nrequire DOD to develop a comprehensive plan for research, prevention \nand treatment of traumatic brain injury, which is long overdue in \naddressing the so-called signature injury of this war.\n  The administration requested, and this bill would provide, additional \nauthorities to the Department of Defense to hire health care \nprofessionals to care for our service members and their families. It \nwould also require the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans \nAffairs to jointly develop an electronic health record that can easily \nbe shared between the two departments.\n  With respect to disability determinations for wounded warriors who \nleave military service, this legislation would require the Secretary of \nDefense to establish a special review board to independently review the \nfindings and decisions of the Physical Evaluation Boards of the \nmilitary departments since 2001, in cases in which the disability rates \nof 20 percent or less were awarded and members were not medically \nretired. We must act, in light of data showing that some members, \nparticularly junior enlisted soldiers, may have unfairly been denied \nmedical retirement. This legislation empowers the special board to \ncorrect military records and, if appropriate, restore to a wounded \nsoldier a higher disability rating or retired status.\n  The bill would also end the requirement that disabled service members \npay back severance pay if they obtain a higher disability rating from \nthe VA, and increase the amount of severance pay that separating \nmembers receive.\n  To address the need for fundamental change in the way that the DOD \nand VA disability evaluation systems are structured, a belief shared by \nmany of my colleagues, this legislation would require the Secretary of \nDefense to immediately implement pilot projects to test new \nimprovements to the disability evaluation system. Such pilot programs \nwill help expedite implementation of needed changes to the disability \nevaluation system.\n  This legislation would also require the Secretary of Defense to \nestablish uniform standards for medical treatment facilities and \nmedical residential housing facilities, and a DOD investment strategy \nto remedy all medical facility deficiencies. It would also require the \nSecretary of Defense to study the feasibility of accelerated \nconstruction of state-of-the art facilities and consolidation of \npatient care services at the new National Medical Center at Bethesda. \nAs a condition for the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, it \nwould require the Secretary of Defense to certify that health care \nservices would remain available in their totality until the new \nfacility and staff are in place to effect a seamless transfer of care. \nThe current facilities at Walter Reed have served the Nation well, but \nwe can and must do better.\n  This legislation is a start on the journey to restore trust for \nAmerica's wounded and her veterans, but it is not our final \ndestination. It will take time to understand fully the complexities of \nthe DOD and VA disability systems and to reconcile them in the best \ninterests of our wounded veterans.\n  We must also look to the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve \naccess to care for wounded veterans and improvements in its handling of \nveterans claims for disabilities. We must ensure that the VA maintains \na robust medical infrastructure for quality health care, teaching and \nresearch, but one that also supports veterans beyond the limits of \nbricks and mortar in communities throughout the nation. I am developing \nlegislation which would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish health care access standards for veterans with a service-\nconnected disability throughout the VA health care delivery system, \nand, similar to DOD's TRICARE system, when services cannot be provided \nby the VA, authorize that care to be purchased from civilian providers. \nCivilian health care specialists are eager to do their part for \nAmerica's veterans. Given the strain on the veterans health system, and \nthe limits to our resources, we should give them that chance, and make \ncertain that our Nation's veterans get the care that they need, when \nthey need it.\n  There is no more important responsibility than to act on our moral \nobligation as a Nation to those who are willing to give their blood for \nits freedom. Let us continue to be guided by the words of President \nGeorge Washington in 1789, who said, ``the willingness with which our \nyoung people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, \nshall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of \nearlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.''\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Levin and me in a \nbipartisan effort to make a difference in the lives of our service \nmembers who have given so much in support of our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Stevens) (by request):\n  S. 1609. A bill to provide the necessary authority to the Secretary \nof Commerce for the establishment and implementation of a regulatory \nsystem for offshore aquaculture in the United States Exclusive Economic \nZone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, by request of \nthe administration, the National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007. I am \njoined by Senator Stevens, the vice chairman of the Senate Commerce, \nScience and Transportation Committee. This bill would authorize the \nSecretary of Commerce to establish and implement a regulatory system \nfor offshore aquaculture in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. While \nSenator Stevens and I understand this is a top priority for the \nadministration, we continue to have concerns with the administration's \nbill as drafted, particularly with regard to the need for clearer \nsafeguards for the environment and native fish stocks. Therefore, we \nare also filing several amendments that would address these concerns. \nThe three amendments that I am filing, and which Senator Stevens is \ncosponsoring, would strengthen requirements to address potential \nenvironmental risks from offshore aquaculture, including to native \nspecies; require a more comprehensive research and development program \nfor offshore aquaculture; and ensure that offshore aquaculture permits \ncould only be provided to citizens, residents, or business entities of \nthe United States. Senator Stevens is also filing an amendment, which I \nam cosponsoring, that would prohibit offshore aquaculture of finfish in \nthe Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of Alaska. I intend to \nintroduce later this year a comprehensive bill that would address \nadditional concerns with the administration's proposed legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Offshore \n     Aquaculture Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States--\n       (A) to support an offshore aquaculture industry that will \n     produce food and other valuable products, protect wild stocks \n     and the quality of marine ecosystems, and be compatible with \n     other uses of the Exclusive Economic Zone;\n       (B) to encourage the development of environmentally \n     responsible offshore aquaculture by authorizing offshore \n     aquaculture operations and research;\n       (C) to establish a permitting process for offshore \n     aquaculture that encourages private investment in aquaculture \n     operations and research, provides opportunity for public \n     comment, and addresses the potential risks to and impacts \n     (including cumulative impacts) on marine ecosystems, human \n     health and safety, other ocean uses, and coastal communities \n     from offshore aquaculture; and\n       (D) to promote, through public-private partnerships, \n     research and development in marine aquaculture science, \n     technology, and related social, economic, legal, and \n     environmental management disciplines that will enable marine \n     aquaculture operations to achieve operational objectives \n     while protecting marine ecosystem quality.\n       (2) Offshore aquaculture activities within the Exclusive \n     Economic Zone of the United States constitute activities with \n     respect to which the United States has proclaimed sovereign \n     rights and jurisdiction under Presidential Proclamation 5030 \n     of March 10, 1983.\n\n     SEC. 3.

OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE PERMITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) The Secretary shall establish, through rulemaking, in \n     consultation as appropriate with other relevant Federal \n     agencies, coastal States, and regional fishery management \n     councils established under section 302 of the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1852), a process to make areas of the Exclusive Economic Zone \n     available to eligible persons for the development and \n     operation of offshore aquaculture facilities. The process \n     shall include--\n       (A) procedures and criteria necessary to issue and modify \n     permits under this Act;\n       (B) procedures to coordinate the offshore aquaculture \n     permitting process, and related siting, operations, \n     environmental protection, monitoring, enforcement, research, \n     and economic and social activities, with similar activities \n     administered by other Federal agencies and coastal States;\n       (C) consideration of the potential environmental, social, \n     economic, and cultural impacts of offshore aquaculture and \n     inclusion, where appropriate, of permit conditions to address \n     negative impacts;\n       (D) public notice and opportunity for public comment prior \n     to issuance of offshore aquaculture permits;\n       (E) procedures to monitor and evaluate compliance with the \n     provisions of offshore aquaculture permits, including the \n     collection of biological, chemical and physical oceanographic \n     data, and social, production, and economic data; and\n       (F) procedures for transferring permits from the original \n     permit holder to a person that--\n       (i) meets the eligibility criteria in subsection (b)(2)(A); \n     and\n       (ii) satisfies the requirements for bonds or other \n     guarantees prescribed under subsection (c)(3).\n       (2) The Secretary shall prepare an analysis under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.) with respect to the process for issuing permits.\n       (3) The Secretary shall periodically review the procedures \n     and criteria for issuance of offshore aquaculture permits and \n     modify them as appropriate, in consultation as appropriate \n     with other Federal agencies, the coastal States, and regional \n     fishery management councils, based on the best available \n     science.\n       (4) The Secretary shall consult as appropriate with other \n     Federal agencies and coastal States to identify the \n     environmental requirements that apply to offshore aquaculture \n     under existing laws and regulations. The Secretary shall \n     establish through rulemaking, in consultation with \n     appropriate Federal agencies, coastal States, and regional \n     fishery management councils established under section 302 of \n     the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 1852), additional environmental requirements to \n     address environmental risks and impacts associated with \n     offshore aquaculture, to the extent necessary. The \n     environmental requirements shall address, at a minimum--\n       (A) risks to and impacts on natural fish stocks and \n     fisheries, including safeguards needed to conserve genetic \n     resources, to prevent or minimize the transmission of disease \n     or parasites to wild stocks, and to prevent the escape of \n     marine species that may cause significant environmental harm;\n       (B) risks to and impacts on marine ecosystems; biological, \n     chemical and physical features of water quality and habitat; \n     marine species, marine mammals and birds;\n       (C) cumulative effects of the aquaculture operation and \n     other aquaculture operations in the vicinity of the proposed \n     site;\n       (D) environmental monitoring, data archiving, and reporting \n     by the permit holder;\n       (E) requirements that marine species propagated and reared \n     through offshore aquaculture be species native to the \n     geographic region unless a scientific risk analysis shows \n     that the risk of harm to the marine environment from the \n     offshore culture of non-indigenous or genetically modified \n     marine species is negligible or can be effectively mitigated; \n     and\n       (F) maintaining record systems to track inventory and \n     movement of fish or other marine species in the offshore \n     aquaculture facility or harvested from such facility, and, if \n     necessary, tagging, marking, or otherwise identifying fish or \n     other marine species in the offshore aquaculture facility or \n     harvested from such facility.\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\n       (5) The Secretary, in cooperation with other Federal \n     agencies, shall--\n       (A) collect information needed to evaluate the suitability \n     of sites for offshore aquaculture; and\n       (B) monitor the effects of offshore aquaculture on marine \n     ecosystems and implement such measures as may be necessary to \n     protect the environment, including temporary or permanent \n     relocation of offshore aquaculture sites, a moratorium on \n     additional sites within a prescribed area, and other \n     appropriate measures as determined by the Secretary.\n       (b) Permits.--Subject to the provisions of subsection (e), \n     the Secretary may issue offshore aquaculture permits under \n     such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe. \n     Permits issued under this Act shall authorize the permit \n     holder to conduct offshore aquaculture consistent with the \n     provisions of this Act, regulations issued under this Act, \n     any specific terms, conditions and restrictions applied to \n     the permit by the Secretary, and other applicable law.\n       (1) Procedure for issuance of permits.--\n       (A) An applicant for an offshore aquaculture permit shall \n     submit an application to the Secretary specifying the \n     proposed location and type of operation, the marine species \n     to be propagated or reared, or both, at the offshore \n     aquaculture facility, and other design, construction, and \n     operational information, as specified by regulation.\n       (B) Within 120 days after determining that a permit \n     application is complete and has satisfied all applicable \n     statutory and regulatory requirements, as specified by \n     regulation, the Secretary shall issue or deny the permit. If \n     the Secretary is unable to issue or deny a permit within this \n     time period, the Secretary shall provide written notice to \n     the applicant indicating the reasons for the delay and \n     establishing a reasonable timeline for issuing or denying the \n     permit.\n       (2) Permit conditions.--\n       (A) An offshore aquaculture permit holder shall--\n       (i) be a resident of the United States;\n       (ii) be a corporation, partnership, or other entity \n     organized and existing under the laws of a State or the \n     United States; or\n       (iii) if the holder does not meet the requirements of \n     clause (i) or (ii), to the extent required by the Secretary \n     by regulation after coordination with the Secretary of State, \n     waive any immunity, and consent to the jurisdiction of the \n     United States and its courts, for matters arising in relation \n     to such permit, and appoint and maintain agents within the \n     United States who are authorized to receive and respond to \n     any legal process issued in the United States with respect to \n     such permit holder.\n       (B) Subject to the provisions of subsection (e), the \n     Secretary shall establish the terms, conditions, and \n     restrictions that apply to offshore aquaculture permits, and \n     shall specify in the permits the duration, size, and location \n     of the offshore aquaculture facility.\n       (C) Except for projects involving pilot-scale testing or \n     farm-scale research on aquaculture science and technologies \n     and offshore aquaculture permits requiring concurrence of the \n     Secretary of the Interior under subsection (e)(1), the permit \n     shall have a duration of 20 years, renewable thereafter at \n     the discretion of the Secretary in up to 20-year increments. \n     The duration of permits requiring concurrence of the \n     Secretary of the Interior under subsection (e)(1) shall be \n     developed in consultation as appropriate with the Secretary \n     of the Interior, except that any such permit shall expire no \n     later than the date that the lessee, or the lessee's \n     operator, submits to the Secretary of the Interior a final \n     application for the decommissioning and removal of an \n     existing facility upon which an offshore aquaculture facility \n     is located.\n       (D) At the expiration or termination of an offshore \n     aquaculture permit for any reason, the permit holder shall \n     remove all structures, gear, and other property from the \n     site, and take other measures to restore the site as may be \n     prescribed by the Secretary.\n       (E) The Secretary may revoke a permit for failure to begin \n     offshore aquaculture operations within a reasonable period of \n     time, or prolonged interruption of offshore aquaculture \n     operations.\n       (3) National interest determination.--If the Secretary \n     determines that issuance of a permit is not in the national \n     interest, the Secretary may decline to issue such a permit or \n     may impose such conditions as necessary to address such \n     concerns.\n       (c) Fees and Other Payments.--\n       (1) The Secretary may establish, through regulations, \n     application fees and annual permit fees. Such fees shall be \n     deposited as offsetting collections in the Operations, \n     Research, and Facilities account. Fees may be collected and \n     made available only to the extent provided in advance in \n     appropriation Acts.\n       (2) The Secretary may reduce or waive applicable fees or \n     other payments established under this section for facilities \n     used primarily for research.\n       (3) The Secretary shall require the permit holder to post a \n     bond or other form of financial guarantee, in an amount to be \n     determined by the Secretary as sufficient to cover any unpaid \n     fees, the cost of removing an offshore aquaculture facility \n     at the expiration or termination of an offshore aquaculture \n     permit, and other financial risks as identified by the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) Compatibility With Other Uses.--\n       (1) The Secretary shall consult as appropriate with other \n     Federal agencies, coastal States, and regional fishery \n     management councils to ensure that offshore aquaculture for \n     which a permit is issued under this section is compatible \n     with the use of the Exclusive Economic Zone for navigation, \n     fishing, resource protection, recreation, national defense \n     (including military readiness), mineral exploration and \n     development, and other activities.\n       (2) The Secretary shall not authorize permits for new \n     offshore aquaculture facilities within 12 miles of the \n     coastline of a coastal State if that coastal State has \n     submitted a written notice to the Secretary that the coastal \n     State opposes such activities. This paragraph does not apply \n     to permit applications received by the Secretary prior to the \n     date the notice is received from a coastal State. A coastal \n     State that transmits such a notice to the Secretary may \n     revoke that notice in writing at any time.\n       (3) Federal agencies implementing this Act, persons subject \n     to this Act, and coastal States seeking to review permit \n     applications under this Act shall comply with the applicable \n     provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n       (4) Notwithstanding the definition of the term ``fishing'' \n     in section 3(16) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \n     and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(16)), the conduct of \n     offshore aquaculture in accordance with permits issued under \n     this Act shall not be considered ``fishing'' for purposes of \n     that Act. The Secretary shall ensure, to the extent \n     practicable, that offshore aquaculture does not interfere \n     with conservation and management measures promulgated under \n     the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n       (5) The Secretary may promulgate regulations that the \n     Secretary finds to be reasonable and necessary to protect \n     offshore aquaculture facilities, and, where appropriate, \n     shall request that the Secretary of the department in which \n     the Coast Guard is operating establish navigational safety \n     zones around such facilities. In addition, in the case of any \n     offshore aquaculture facility described in subsection (e)(1), \n     the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is \n     operating shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior \n     before designating such a zone.\n       (6) After consultation with the Secretary, the Secretary of \n     State, and the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the \n     department in which the Coast Guard is operating may \n     designate a zone of appropriate size around and including any \n     offshore aquaculture facility for the purpose of navigational \n     safety. In such a zone, no installations, structures, or uses \n     will be allowed that are incompatible with the operation of \n     the offshore aquaculture facility. The Secretary of the \n     department in which the Coast Guard is operating may define, \n     by rulemaking, activities that are allowed within such a \n     zone.\n       (7)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), if the Secretary, after \n     consultation with Federal agencies as appropriate and after \n     affording the permit holder notice and an opportunity to be \n     heard, determines that suspension, modification, or \n     revocation of a permit is in the national interest, the \n     Secretary may suspend, modify, or revoke such permit.\n       (B) If the Secretary determines that an emergency exists \n     that poses a risk to the safety of humans, to the marine \n     environment, to marine species, or to the security of the \n     United States and that requires suspension, modification, or \n     revocation of a permit, the Secretary may suspend, modify, or \n     revoke the permit for such time as the Secretary may \n     determine necessary to meet the emergency. The Secretary \n     shall afford the permit holder a prompt post-suspension or \n     post-modification opportunity to be heard regarding the \n     suspension, modification, or revocation.\n       (8) Permits issued under this Act do not supersede or \n     substitute for any other authorization required under \n     applicable Federal or State law or regulation.\n       (e) Actions Affecting the Outer Continental Shelf.--\n       (1) Concurrence of secretary of interior required.--The \n     Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of \n     the Interior for permits for offshore aquaculture facilities \n     located--\n       (A) on leases, right-of-use and easements, or rights of way \n     authorized or permitted under the Outer Continental Shelf \n     Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), or\n       (B) within 1 mile of any other facility permitted or for \n     which a plan has been approved under that Act.\n       (2) Prior consent required.-- Offshore aquaculture may not \n     be located on facilities described in paragraph (1)(A) \n     without the prior consent of the lessee, its designated \n     operator, and the owner of the facility.\n       (3) Review for lease, etc., compliance.--The Secretary of \n     the Interior shall review and approve any agreement between a \n     lessee, designated operator, and owner of a facility \n     described in paragraph (1) and a prospective aquaculture \n     operator to ensure that it is consistent with the Federal \n     lease terms, Department of the Interior regulations, and the \n     Secretary of the Interior's role in the protection of the \n     marine environment, property, or human life or health. An \n     agreement under this subsection shall be part of the \n     information reviewed pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management \n     Act review process described in paragraph (4) and shall not \n     be subject to a separate Coastal Zone Management Act review.\n       (4) Coordinated coastal zone management act review.--\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\n       (A) If the applicant for an offshore aquaculture facility \n     that will utilize a facility described in paragraph (1) is \n     required to submit to a coastal State a consistency \n     certification for its aquaculture application under section \n     307(c)(3)(A) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1456(c)(3)(A)), the coastal State's review under the Coastal \n     Zone Management Act and corresponding Federal regulations \n     shall also include any modification to a lessee's approved \n     plan or other document for which a consistency certification \n     would otherwise be required under applicable Federal \n     regulations, including changes to its plan for \n     decommissioning any facilities, resulting from or necessary \n     for the issuance of the offshore aquaculture permit, if \n     information related to such modifications or changes is \n     received by the coastal State at the time the coastal State \n     receives the offshore aquaculture permit applicant's \n     consistency certification. If the information related to such \n     modifications or changes is received by the coastal State at \n     the time the coastal State receives the offshore aquaculture \n     permit applicant's consistency certification, a lessee is not \n     required to submit a separate consistency certification for \n     any such modification or change under section 307(c)(3)(B) of \n     the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)) and \n     the coastal State's concurrence or objection, or presumed \n     concurrence, under section 307(c)(3)(A) of that Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(A)) in a consistency determination for the \n     offshore aquaculture permit, shall apply to both the offshore \n     aquaculture permit and to any related modifications or \n     changes to a lessee's plan approved under the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act.\n       (B) If a coastal State is not authorized by section \n     307(c)(3)(A) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1456(c)(3)(A)) and corresponding Federal regulations to \n     review an offshore aquaculture application submitted under \n     this Act, then any modifications or changes to a lessee's \n     approved plan or other document requiring approval from the \n     Department of the Interior, shall be subject to coastal State \n     review pursuant to the requirements of section 307(c)(3)(B) \n     of the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)), \n     if a consistency certification for those modifications or \n     changes is required under applicable Federal regulations.\n       (5) Joint and several liability.--For offshore aquaculture \n     located on facilities described in paragraph (1), the \n     aquaculture permit holder and all parties that are or were \n     lessees of the lease on which the facilities are located \n     during the term of the offshore aquaculture permit shall be \n     jointly and severally liable for the removal of any \n     construction or modifications related to aquaculture \n     operations if the aquaculture permit holder fails to do so \n     and bonds established under this Act for aquaculture \n     operations prove insufficient to cover those obligations. \n     This paragraph does not affect obligations to decommission \n     facilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.\n       (6) Additional authority.--For aquaculture projects or \n     operations described in paragraph (1), the Secretary of the \n     Interior may--\n       (A) promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary \n     and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this \n     subsection;\n       (B) require and enforce such additional terms or conditions \n     as the Secretary of the Interior deems necessary to protect \n     the marine environment, property, or human life or health to \n     ensure the compatibility of aquaculture operations with all \n     activities for which permits have been issued under the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act;\n       (C) issue orders to the offshore aquaculture permit holder \n     to take any action the Secretary of the Interior deems \n     necessary to ensure safe operations on the facility to \n     protect the marine environment, property, or human life or \n     health. Failure to comply with the Secretary of the \n     Interior's orders will be deemed to constitute a violation of \n     the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; and\n       (D) enforce all requirements contained in such regulations, \n     lease terms and conditions and orders pursuant to the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.-- In consultation as appropriate with other \n     Federal agencies, the Secretary may establish and conduct an \n     integrated, multidisciplinary, scientific research and \n     development program to further marine aquaculture \n     technologies that are compatible with the protection of \n     marine ecosystems.\n       (b) Partnerships.--The Secretary may conduct research and \n     development in partnership with offshore aquaculture permit \n     holders.\n       (c) Reduction of wild fish as food.--The Secretary, in \n     collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall \n     conduct research to reduce the use of wild fish in \n     aquaculture feeds, including the substitution of seafood \n     processing wastes, cultured marine algae, and microbial \n     sources of nutrients important for human health and \n     nutrition, agricultural crops, and other products.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall promulgate such \n     regulations as are necessary and appropriate to carry out the \n     provisions of this Act. The Secretary may at any time amend \n     such regulations, and such regulations shall, as of their \n     effective date, apply to all operations conducted pursuant to \n     permits issued under this Act, regardless of the date of the \n     issuance of such permit.\n       (b) Contract, Etc., Authority.--The Secretary may enter \n     into and perform such contracts, leases, grants, or \n     cooperative agreements as may be necessary to carry out the \n     purposes of this Act and on such terms as the Administrator \n     of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deems \n     appropriate.\n       (c) Use of Contributed Governmental Resources.-- For \n     purposes related to the enforcement of this Act, the \n     Secretary may use, with their consent and with or without \n     reimbursement, the land, services, equipment, personnel, and \n     facilities of any department, agency or instrumentality of \n     the United States, or of any State, local government, Indian \n     tribal government, Territory or possession, or of any \n     political subdivision thereof, or of any foreign government \n     or international organization.\n       (d) Authority to Utilize Grant Funds.--\n       (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may \n     apply for, accept, and obligate research grant funding from \n     any Federal source operating competitive grant programs where \n     such funding furthers the purpose of this Act.\n       (2) The Secretary may not apply for, accept, or obligate \n     any grant funding under paragraph (1) for which the granting \n     agency lacks authority to grant funds to Federal agencies, or \n     for any purpose or subject to conditions that are prohibited \n     by law or regulation.\n       (3) Appropriated funds may be used to satisfy a requirement \n     to match grant funds with recipient agency funds, except that \n     no grant may be accepted that requires a commitment in \n     advance of appropriations.\n       (4) Funds received from grants shall be deposited in the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration account that \n     serves to accomplish the purpose for which the grant was \n     awarded.\n       (e) Reservation of Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to displace, supersede, or limit the jurisdiction, \n     responsibilities, or rights of any Federal or State agency, \n     or Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization, under any \n     Federal law or treaty.\n       (f) Application of Laws to Facilities in the EEZ.--The \n     Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States shall \n     apply to an offshore aquaculture facility located in the \n     Exclusive Economic Zone for which a permit has been issued or \n     is required under this Act and to activities in the Exclusive \n     Economic Zone connected, associated, or potentially \n     interfering with the use or operation of such facility, in \n     the same manner as if such facility were an area of exclusive \n     Federal jurisdiction located within a State. Nothing in this \n     Act shall be construed to relieve, exempt, or immunize any \n     person from any other requirement imposed by an applicable \n     Federal law, regulation, or treaty. Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to confer citizenship to a person by birth or \n     through naturalization or to entitle a person to avail \n     himself of any law pertaining to immigration, naturalization, \n     or nationality.\n       (g) Application of Certain State Laws.--The law of the \n     nearest adjacent coastal State, now in effect or hereafter \n     adopted, amended, or repealed, is declared to be the law of \n     the United States, and shall apply to any offshore \n     aquaculture facility for which a permit has been issued \n     pursuant to this Act, to the extent applicable and not \n     inconsistent with any provision or regulation under this Act \n     or other Federal laws and regulations now in effect or \n     hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed. All such applicable \n     laws shall be administered and enforced by the appropriate \n     officers and courts of the United States. For purposes of \n     this subsection, the nearest adjacent coastal State shall be \n     that State whose seaward boundaries, if extended beyond 3 \n     nautical miles, would encompass the site of the offshore \n     aquaculture facility. State taxation laws shall not apply to \n     offshore aquaculture facilities in the Exclusive Economic \n     Zone.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary \n     $4,052,000 in fiscal year 2008 and thereafter such sums as \n     may be necessary for purposes of carrying out the provisions \n     of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 8.

The amount of the \n     civil penalty under this paragraph shall not exceed $200,000 \n     for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall \n     constitute a separate violation.\n       (2) Compromise or other action by the secretary.--The \n     Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without \n     conditions, any civil administrative penalty which is or may \n     be imposed under this section and that has not been referred \n     to the Attorney General for further enforcement action.\n       (b) Civil Judicial Penalties.--Any person who violates any \n     provision of this Act, or any regulation or permit issued \n     thereunder, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed \n     $250,000 for each such violation. Each day of a continuing \n     violation shall constitute a separate violation. The Attorney \n     General, upon the request of the Secretary, may commence a \n     civil action in an appropriate district court of the United \n     States, and such court shall have jurisdiction to award civil \n     penalties and such other relief as justice may require. In \n     determining the amount of a civil penalty, the court shall \n     take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and \n     gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with respect to \n     the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior \n     violations and such other matters as justice may require. In \n     imposing such penalty, the district court may also consider \n     information related to the ability of the violator to pay.\n       (c) Permit Sanctions.--\n       (1) In any case in which--\n       (A) an offshore aquaculture facility has been used in the \n     commission of an act prohibited under section 8 of this Act;\n       (B) the owner or operator of an offshore aquaculture \n     facility or any other person who has been issued or has \n     applied for a permit under section 4 of this Act has acted in \n     violation of section 8 of this Act; or\n       (C) any amount in settlement of a civil forfeiture imposed \n     on an offshore aquaculture facility or other property, or any \n     civil penalty or criminal fine imposed under this Act or \n     imposed on any other person who has been issued or has \n     applied for a permit under any fishery resource statute \n     enforced by the Secretary, has not been paid and is overdue, \n     the Secretary may--\n       (i) revoke any permit issued with respect to such offshore \n     aquaculture facility or applied for by such a person under \n     this Act, with or without prejudice to the issuance of \n     subsequent permits;\n       (ii) suspend such permit for a period of time considered by \n     the Secretary to be appropriate;\n       (iii) deny such permit; or\n       (iv) impose additional conditions and restrictions on such \n     permit.\n       (2) In imposing a sanction under this subsection, the \n     Secretary shall take into account--\n       (A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the \n     prohibited acts for which the sanction is imposed; and\n       (B) with respect to the violator, the degree of \n     culpability, any history of prior violations, and such other \n     matters as justice may require.\n       (3) Transfer of ownership of an offshore aquaculture \n     facility, by sale or otherwise, shall not extinguish any \n     permit sanction that is in effect or is pending at the time \n     of transfer of ownership. Before executing the transfer of \n     ownership of an offshore aquaculture facility, by sale or \n     otherwise, the owner shall disclose in writing to the \n     prospective transferee the existence of any permit sanction \n     that will be in effect or pending with respect to the \n     offshore aquaculture facility at the time of the transfer. \n     The Secretary may waive or compromise a sanction in the case \n     of a transfer pursuant to court order.\n       (4) In the case of any permit that is suspended under this \n     subsection for nonpayment of a civil penalty or criminal \n     fine, the Secretary shall reinstate the permit upon payment \n     of the penalty or fine and interest thereon at the prevailing \n     rate.\n       (5) No sanctions shall be imposed under this subsection \n     unless there has been prior opportunity for a hearing on the \n     facts underlying the violation for which the sanction is \n     imposed, either in conjunction with a civil penalty \n     proceeding under this section or otherwise.\n       (d) Injunctive Relief.--Upon the request of the Secretary, \n     the Attorney General of the United States may commence a \n     civil action for appropriate relief, including a permanent or \n     temporary injunction, for any violation of any provision of \n     this Act, or regulation or permit issued under this Act.\n       (e) Hearing.--For the purposes of conducting any \n     investigation or hearing under this section or any other \n     statute administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration which is determined on the record in \n     accordance with the procedures provided for under section 554 \n     of title 5, United States Code, the Secretary may issue \n     subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and \n     the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and \n     may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the \n     same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the \n     courts of the United States. In case of contempt or refusal \n     to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to this \n     subsection, the district court of the United States for any \n     district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts \n     business, upon application by the United States and after \n     notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an \n     order requiring such person to appear and give testimony \n     before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents \n     before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such \n     order of the court may be punished by such court as a \n     contempt thereof. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     grant jurisdiction to a district court to entertain an \n     application for an order to enforce a subpoena issued by the \n     Secretary of Commerce to the Federal Government or any entity \n     thereof.\n       (f) Jurisdiction.--The United States district courts shall \n     have original jurisdiction of any action under this section \n     arising out of or in connection with the construction or \n     operation of aquaculture facilities, and proceedings with \n     respect to any such action may be instituted in the judicial \n     district in which any defendant resides or may be found, or \n     in the judicial district of the adjacent coastal State \n     nearest the place where the cause of action arose. For the \n     purpose of this section, American Samoa shall be included \n     within the judicial district of the District Court of the \n     United States for the District of Hawaii. Each violation \n     shall be a separate offense and the offense shall be deemed \n     to have been committed not only in the district where the \n     violation first occurred, but\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\n     also in any other district as authorized by law.\n       (g) Collection.--If any person fails to pay an assessment \n     of a civil penalty after it has become a final and \n     unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has \n     entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the matter \n     may be referred to the Attorney General, who may recover the \n     amount (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the \n     date of the final order). In such action the validity, amount \n     and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil \n     penalty shall not be subject to review. Any person who fails \n     to pay, on a timely basis, the amount of an assessment of a \n     civil penalty shall be required to pay, in addition to such \n     amount and interest, attorney's fees and costs for collection \n     proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each \n     quarter during which such failure to pay persists. Such \n     nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal to 20 percent \n     of the aggregate amount of such persons penalties and \n     nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of \n     such quarter.\n       (h) Nationwide Service of Process.--In any action by the \n     United States under this Act, process may be served in any \n     district where the defendant is found, resides, transacts \n     business or has appointed an agent for the service of \n     process, and for civil cases may also be served in a place \n     not within the United States in accordance with Rule 4 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 11. CRIMINAL OFFENSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any person (other than a foreign \n     government or any entity of such government) who knowingly \n     commits an act prohibited by subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f) \n     of section 8, shall be imprisoned for not more than 5 years \n     or shall be fined not more than $500,000 for individuals or \n     $1,000,000 for an organization, or both; except that if in \n     the commission of any such offense the individual uses a \n     dangerous weapon, engages in conduct that causes bodily \n     injury to any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of \n     this Act, or places any such officer in fear of imminent \n     bodily injury, the maximum term of imprisonment is not more \n     than 10 years.\n       (b) Other Offenses.--Any person (other than a foreign \n     government or any entity of such government) who knowingly \n     violates any provision of section 8 other than subsection \n     (c), (d), (e) or (f), any provision of any regulation \n     promulgated pursuant to this Act, or any permit issued under \n     this Act, shall be imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or \n     shall be fined not more than $500,000 for an individual or \n     $1,000,000 for an organization, or both.\n       (c) Jurisdiction of District Courts.--The United States \n     district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any \n     action arising under this section out of or in connection \n     with the construction or operation of aquaculture facilities, \n     and proceedings with respect to any such action may be \n     instituted in the judicial district in which any defendant \n     resides or may be found. For the purpose of this section, \n     American Samoa shall be included within the judicial district \n     of the District Court of the United States for the District \n     of Hawaii. Each violation shall be a separate offense and the \n     offense shall be deemed to have been committed not only in \n     the district where the violation first occurred, but also in \n     any other district as authorized under law.\n\n     SEC. 12. FORFEITURES.\n\n       (a) Criminal Forfeiture.--A person who is convicted of an \n     offense under section 11 of this Act shall forfeit to the \n     United States--\n       (1) any property, real or personal, constituting or \n     traceable to the gross proceeds obtained, or retained, as a \n     result of the offense including, without limitation, any \n     marine species (or the fair market value thereof) taken or \n     retained in connection with or as a result of the offense; \n     and\n       (2) any property, real or personal, used or intended to be \n     used to commit or to facilitate the commission of the \n     offense, including, without limitation, any offshore \n     aquaculture facility or vessel, including its structure, \n     equipment, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo, and \n     any vehicle or aircraft.\n\n     Pursuant to section 2461(c) of title 28, United States Code, \n     the provisions of section 413 of the Controlled Substances \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 853), other than subsection (d), shall apply \n     to criminal forfeitures under this section.\n       (b) Civil Forfeiture.--The following shall be subject to \n     forfeiture to the United States and no property right shall \n     exist in them:\n       (1) Any property, real or personal, constituting or \n     traceable to the gross proceeds obtained, or retained, as a \n     result of a violation of any provision of section 8 or \n     section 4(b)(2)(D) of this Act, including, without \n     limitation, any marine species (or the fair market value \n     thereof) taken or retained in connection with or as a result \n     of the violation.\n       (2) Any property, real or personal, used or intended to be \n     used to commit or to facilitate the commission of any such \n     violation, including, without limitation, any offshore \n     aquaculture facility or vessel, including its structure, \n     equipment, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo, and \n     any vehicle or aircraft.\n\n     Civil forfeitures under this section shall be governed by the \n     procedures set forth in chapter 46 of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       (c) Rebuttable Presumption.--In any criminal or civil \n     forfeiture proceeding under this section, there is a \n     rebuttable presumption that all marine species found within \n     an offshore aquaculture facility and seized in connection \n     with a violation of section 8 of this Act were taken or \n     retained in violation of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 13. SEVERABILITY AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Severability.--If any provision of this chapter or the \n     application thereof to any person or circumstances is held \n     invalid, the validity of the remainder of this chapter and of \n     the application of such provision to other persons and \n     circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n       (b) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) In general.--Judicial review of any action taken by the \n     Secretary under this chapter shall be in accordance with \n     sections 701 through 706 of title 5, United States Code, \n     except that--\n       (A) review of any final agency action of the Secretary \n     taken pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of section 11 may be \n     had only by the filing of a complaint by an interested person \n     in the United States District Court for the appropriate \n     district; any such complaint must be filed within 30 days of \n     the date such final agency action is taken; and\n       (B) review of all other final agency actions of the \n     Secretary under this chapter may be had only by the filing of \n     a petition for review by an interested person in the Circuit \n     Court of Appeals of the United States for the Federal \n     judicial district in which such person resides or transacts \n     business which is directly affected by the action taken; such \n     petition shall be filed within 120 days from the date such \n     final action is taken.\n       (2) Limitation of judicial review.--Final agency action \n     with respect to which review could have been obtained under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall not be subject to \n     judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for \n     enforcement.\n       (3) Awards of litigation costs.--In any judicial proceeding \n     under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may award \n     costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert \n     witness fees) to any prevailing party whenever it determines \n     that such award is appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 1613. A bill to require the Director of National Intelligence to \nsubmit to Congress an unclassified report on energy security and for \nother purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Chambliss and I are \nintroducing legislation that could have a far-reaching impact on the \nnational security of the United States. As every American knows, one of \nthe most important elements of our national security infrastructure is \nthe collection of agencies that make up our national intelligence \ncommunity. But when most Americans think about the CIA, the FBI, or the \nNSA, they tend to think of agencies that are focused on a small handful \nof James Bond-style issues, such as missile stockpiles, new weapons \ntechnologies, and coups in foreign lands. These issues are still \nimportant, but in the modem world it is essential to recognize that \nprotecting national security is a lot more complicated than it was \nduring the Cold War, and there are many other issues that require \nattention and action.\n  Thankfully, the men and women of the intelligence community already \nrecognize this crucial fact, and are working hard to address the wide \nvariety of threats and challenges that face America in the 21st \ncentury. Unfortunately, many policymakers still think of intelligence \nin 20th century terms, and as a result many of our national \nintelligence capabilities are underused and underappreciated.\n  The best example of this is unquestionably in the field of energy \nsecurity. American dependence on foreign oil has made our Nation less \nsafe. Oil revenues have provided income for dangerous rogue states, \nthey have sparked bloody civil wars, and they have even provided \nfunding for terrorism. In a sickening phenomenon that I call the terror \ntax, every time that Americans drive their cars down to the gas station \nand fill up at the pump, the reality is that a portion of that money is \nthen turned over to foreign governments that ``backdoor'' it over to \nIslamist extremists, who use that money to perpetuate terrorism and \nhate. As the GAO has pointed out, while talking about the oil-rich \nnation of Saudi Arabia:\n\n       Saudi Arabia's multibillion-dollar petroleum industry, \n     although largely owned by the government, has fostered the \n     creation of large private fortunes, enabling many wealthy \n     Saudis to sponsor charities and educational foundations whose \n     operations extend to many countries. U.S. government and \n     other expert reports have linked some Saudi donations to the \n     global propagation of religious intolerance, hatred of \n     Western values, and support to terrorist activities.\n\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n\n  Furthermore, by allowing our national energy security to depend on \nforeign oil, we are leaving the American economy vulnerable to external \nshocks and disruptions. Recent American history is full of examples of \nevents overseas jolting U.S. energy supplies, and just a couple decades \nago the oil cartel known as OPEC declared an embargo which sent the \nU.S. economy into a tailspin.\n  There are many other challenges out there that have the potential to \naffect U.S. national security and energy security. For example, it \nseems clear that the Middle East will remain in turmoil for years to \ncome, and policmakers will have to consider the potential impact of \nevents such as a terrorist attack on a major oil facility, or a change \nin government in an oil-producing state, or the further deterioration \nof the situation in Iraq. Outside of the Middle East there are other \nchallenges to face, including the continued growth of major energy \nconsuming countries like India and China, the policies of less-\npredictable governments such as Russia and Venezuela, and the emergence \nof new energy producers in unstable areas of the world.\n\n  As policymakers attempt to grapple with these challenges, it is vital \nfor them to be informed by the best thinking available, and as I said, \nthe men and women of our national intelligence agencies are already \nperforming quality analysis on many topics relevant to national \nsecurity. This expertise is spread throughout the intelligence \ncommunity, and includes professionals at the National Intelligence \nCouncil, the CIA's Office of Transnational Issues, and the Office of \nIntelligence and Counterintelligence at the Department of Energy.\n  Unfortunately, this expertise is rarely used to inform energy policy \ndebates, primarily because these agencies generally use it to produce \nclassified assessments. This means that I can discuss them in closed \nsessions of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, but not at \nhearings of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, even though \nI am a member of both committees. This legislation would address this \nproblem by requiring the Director of National Intelligence to \ncoordinate the production of an unclassified report on the intelligence \ncommunity's assessments of key energy issues that have implications for \nthe national security of the United States. It will be up to the \nintelligence agencies to determine what information can safely be \ndiscussed in public, but I am confident that the Director will be able \nto provide Congress with a report that includes thoughtful, insightful \ndiscussion of these issues, without revealing any sensitive information \nor compromising any sources and methods.\n  This legislation is entitled the Weighing Intelligence for Smarter \nEnergy Act, or the WISE Act for short. I think that my colleagues and \nthe American public would agree that when it comes to protecting our \nnational energy security, it certainly wouldn't hurt for Congress to be \na little bit wiser.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Weighing Intelligence for \n     Smarter Energy Act of 2007'' or the ``WISE Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The members of the intelligence community in the United \n     States, most notably the National Intelligence Council, the \n     Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence of the \n     Department of Energy, and the Office of Transnational Issues \n     of the Central Intelligence Agency, possess substantial \n     analytic expertise with regard to global energy issues.\n       (2) Energy policy debates generally do not use, to the \n     fullest extent possible, the expertise available in the \n     intelligence community.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Weighing \nIntelligence for Smarter Energy Act, or the WISE Act. I worked with \nSenator Wyden to introduce this bill and am happy to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I see \nsome of the most sensitive products produced by our intelligence \ncommunity. The intelligence community's analysts possess an extensive \nand wide range of expertise on all matters which could have national \nsecurity implications for the United States. However, because of the \nsecretive nature of the intelligence community and the sensitive work \nwhich it conducts, few policymakers are privy to many of its products. \nIn most cases, this is essential in order to protect the sensitive \nsources and methods used by our intelligence agencies. In other areas, \nincluding matters related to global energy security, our intelligence \nanalysts can provide some valuable analysis at an unclassified level.\n  Energy policy and energy security have far reaching implications for \nthe United States. As the country recognizes the danger of relying on \nimported oil, we need to develop an energy policy that is aggressive \nwhile at the same time thoughtful. Renewable fuels like ethanol and \nbiodiesel are not the solution to our problems, but they can help \nreduce our dependence on imported oil from unstable regions of the \nworld during a time of rising crude oil prices. At the same time, we \nmust understand and be prepared for the unintended consequences of \npursuing alternative fuel policies and to be sensitive to their impact \non other sectors of the U.S. and global economies. Already, incentives \nfor ethanol and biodiesel in the United States, Europe, Brazil and \nother developed and developing countries are forcing changes in the \nagriculture economy not seen in over a generation. While rising demand \nfor alternative fuels will increase prices for agriculture commodities \nand benefit farmers, will this increase strain development in \ndeveloping countries, in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa? We don't \nknow yet, but these are questions we should and must ask.\n  We already know the impact poverty and food insecurity has on \npopulations around the world. However, policymakers, especially here in \nCongress, are not realizing the full extent of information available to \nthem. Energy policy debates usually do not harness the full expertise \nof the intelligence community or consider the substantive analysis they \nmay contribute to the debate. Experts in the intelligence community may \nexamine the effects of energy policy around the globe and the impact \nthose decisions may have on U.S. policy. In addition, the intelligence \ncommunity can provide an analysis of the impact around the world of \npolicies that utilize renewable resources. This legislation asks for \njust that type of analysis.\n  The WISE Act asks the intelligence community to provide an \nintelligence\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nassessment on the long-term energy security of the United States. The \nbill requests that as much of the assessment as possible be \nunclassified, while taking into consideration the need to protect \nvaluable sources and methods by including a classified portion, it is \nmy hope that this bill will better inform energy policy. In addition to \ninforming policymakers of the energy security of the United States, the \nbill will also provide important analysis on the international impact \nof energy policies around the world.\n  The WISE Act will harness fully the expertise of our intelligence \ncommunity and allow policymakers to formulate more informed energy \npolicy. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 1615. A bill to provide loans and grants for fire sprinkler \nretrofitting in nursing facilities; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce bipartisan legislation \nwith my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr, that seeks to \nprotect nursing home residents, staff, and visitors from the dangers \nassociated with fire.\n  In February, 2003, a multi-alarm fire at a nursing home in Hartford, \nCT, took the lives of 16 residents. It was the worst nursing home fire \nin Connecticut's history. The tragic loss of life was made worse by the \nfact that the nursing home lacked an automatic sprinkler system, a \ndefect disturbingly common in many nursing homes across the country.\n  I believe many Americans, especially those with a loved one in a \nnursing home facility, would be shocked to learn that, according to the \nGovernment Accountability Office between 20 and 30 percent of the \ncountry's 17,000 nursing homes lack an automatic sprinkler system. In \nits 2004 report, the GAO found that ``the substantial loss of life in \nthe [Hartford fire] could have been reduced or eliminated by the \npresence of properly functioning automatic sprinkler systems.'' \nFurthermore, the report concluded that ``the Federal oversight of \nnursing home compliance with fire safety standards is inadequate.''\n  Responding to the fire in Hartford and a similar tragedy in \nNashville, TN, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nrequired that nursing homes without automatic sprinkler systems install \nbattery-operated smoke detectors. While this new requirement was viewed \nas a positive step, it was largely criticized by fire and patient-\nsafety advocates because smoke detectors are often not wired to a \ncentral alarm system or a fire department.\n  I believe it is safe to assume that nursing home directors do not \nchoose freely to operate their facilities without automatic sprinkler \nsystems. According to the GAO and the American Health Care Association, \nmost nursing homes simply cannot afford the costs incurred by \ninstalling an automatic sprinkler system. Today, many nursing homes, \nincluding many in Connecticut, are financially strained by inadequate \nreimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid, rising insurance \npremiums, rising energy costs, and the general cost of care for some of \nour country's most vulnerable patients.\n  That is why Senator Burr and I are reintroducing this legislation. \nThe Nursing Home Fire Safety Act of 2007 provides low-interest loans \nand grants to nursing homes in proven need of financial assistance. The \nlarger loan initiative assists nursing homes that cannot afford the \nupfront costs of installing automatic sprinkler systems but can afford \nto pay back a low-interest Government-issued loan. The smaller grant \ninitiative would assist qualified nursing homes that lack any ability \nto pay for the installation of an automatic sprinkler system. Together, \nthese initiatives would provide critical resources to prevent tragedies \nlike those seen in Hartford and Nashville from occurring again.\n  I thank my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr, for \nreintroducing this bipartisan measure with me. I also thank Congressmen \nJohn Larson from Connecticut and Peter King from New York for \nspearheading companion legislation in the House. I look forward to \nworking with all of my colleagues to protect nursing home residents, \nstaff, and visitors from the dangers associated with fire.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE .\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nursing Home Fire Safety Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An estimated 1,500,000 Americans reside in \n     approximately 16,300 nursing facilities nationwide, an \n     estimated 20 to 30 percent of which lack an automatic fire \n     sprinkler system.\n       (2) In a July 2004 report, the Government Accountability \n     Office found that ``the substantial loss of life in [recent \n     nursing home] fires could have been reduced or eliminated by \n     the presence of properly functioning automatic sprinkler \n     systems'' and that ``Federal oversight of nursing home \n     compliance with fire safety standards is inadequate''.\n       (3) Many nursing facilities lack the financial capital to \n     install sprinklers on their own and must consider closure as \n     an alternative to taking on large loans or other financing \n     options in order to install sprinklers.\n       (4) Recognizing that automatic fire sprinkler systems \n     greatly improve the chances of survival for older adults in \n     the event of a fire, the National Fire Protection \n     Association, with the support of the American Health Care \n     Association, the fire safety community, and the nursing \n     facility profession, recently adopted requirements for \n     automatic sprinklers in all existing nursing facilities.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) within 5 years, every nursing facility in America \n     should be equipped with automatic fire sprinklers in order to \n     ensure patient, resident, and staff safety;\n       (2) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     should require all nursing homes to be fully sprinklered as \n     recently required by the Life Safety Code of the National \n     Fire Protection Association with the support of the nursing \n     home industry, which includes the requirement that all \n     nursing facilities be fully sprinklered; and\n       (3) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in \n     collaboration with Congress, should take into consideration \n     the costs of retrofitting existing nursing home facilities \n     and commit itself to providing facilities with the critical \n     financial resources necessary to ensure the speedy and full \n     installation of life saving sprinkler systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. DIRECT LOANS FOR FIRE SPRINKLERS RETROFITS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall establish a program of direct loans to \n     existing nursing facilities to finance retrofitting the \n     facilities with an automatic fire sprinkler system. Such \n     loans shall be made under terms and conditions specified by \n     the Secretary.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n\n     SEC. 4. SPRINKLER RETROFIT ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall establish a program to award grants to nursing \n     facilities for the purposes of retrofitting them with an \n     automatic fire sprinkler system. Such grants shall be awarded \n     under terms and conditions specified by the Secretary.\n       (b) Priority.--In awarding grants under this section, the \n     Secretary shall give a priority to applications that \n     demonstrate a need or hardship. In determining hardship, the \n     Secretary may take into account factors such as the number of \n     residents who are entitled to or enrolled in the medicare \n     program under title 18 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395 et seq.) or receiving assistance under the medicaid \n     program under title 19 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), \n     the age and condition of the facility, and the need for \n     nursing facility beds in the community involved.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Carper, Mr. Lugar, \n        and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1616. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to promote and assure the \nquality of biodiesel fuel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould create a Federal biodiesel mandate and improve the quality and \nlabeling of this product.\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\n  Biodiesel fuel holds great promise to help move the United States \ntoward energy independence. It is created by converting soybean oil, \nanimal fats, and yellow grease and other feed stocks into \ntransportation fuel.\n  Compared to petrol diesel, biodiesel burns much more cleanly. \nProduction of biodiesel creates jobs in rural areas and makes farming \nmore profitable. The carbon footprint of biodiesel also is superior to \npetrol diesel. Cars and trucks fueled by biodiesel produce fewer \nunburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and particulate \nmatter.\n  The biodiesel industry is young but growing, and its growth is driven \nby the rising cost of oil and a growing awareness of the need to move \ntoward energy independence. In 2005, the United States produced 75 \nmillion gallons of biodiesel. That number more than tripled in 2006, \nwhen the United States produced 250 million gallons of biodiesel.\n  By the end of this year, we expect capacity to increase to more than \n1 billion gallons. More than 140 plants already produce biodiesel, and \nmore are moving to production soon. Biodiesel fuel plants can be found \nall across the country, from the Corn Belt and Great Plains to the \nPacific Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic.\n  The bipartisan bill I am introducing today with Senators Grassley, \nCarper, Lugar, and Obama is a modest attempt to take advantage of this \npotential capacity and to reduce the amount of petroleum used in the \n60-billion-gallon diesel fuel pool. Under this bill, over the next 5 \nyears, the United States would blend 450 million gallons of biodiesel \ninto diesel fuel in 2008, 625 million gallons in 2009, 800 million \ngallons in 2010, 1 billion gallons in 2011, and 1.25 billion gallons in \n2012.\n  This mandate would create an incentive for the production and \nconsumption of biodiesel and give this infant industry some market \nguarantees to help it achieve stability and maturity.\n  Many States already are moving in the direction of biodiesel \nmandates. My home State of Illinois has offered a biodiesel tax \nincentive since 2003 that has increased demand for the product, and \nMinnesota has had a 2-percent biodiesel mandate since 2005.\n  This is an environmentally friendly, home-grown fuel, and we should \nembrace its use. I thank Senators Grassley, Carper, Lugar, and Obama \nfor their early support and urge others in the Senate to cosponsor our \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7653-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 233--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE \n           SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS FOR THE 110TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 234, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 234) designating June 15, 2007 as \n     ``National Huntington's Disease Awareness Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I rise today to support a resolution \ndesignating June 15, 2007, as ``National Huntington's Disease Awareness \nDay,'' a devastating disorder that affects an estimated 1 in every \n10,000 persons. We need to raise awareness of Huntington's disease, \nwhich is a progressive degenerative neurological disease that causes \ntotal physical and mental deterioration over a 12-15 year period. \nThough Huntington's disease typically begins in midlife, between the \nages of 30 and 45, onset may occur as early as the age of 2. The \naverage lifespan after onset of Huntington's disease is 10 to 20 years. \nThe younger a person contracts the disease, the more rapid the \nprogression. Additionally, children who develop the juvenile form of \nthe disease rarely live to adulthood, and a child of a Huntington's \ndisease parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the Huntington's \ndisease gene.\n  Since the discovery of the gene that causes Huntington's disease in \n1993, the pace of Huntington's disease research has accelerated. \nAlthough scientists and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs are \nforthcoming, no cures for this disease currently exist.\n  The need for heightened awareness of Huntington's disease was brought \nto my attention by constituents who suffer from this disease. For the \nbenefit of these individuals and for the well-being of sufferers in \nyour own State and around the Nation, I ask you to join me in this \neffort to raise awareness of Huntington's disease.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 234) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 234\n\n       Whereas Huntington's Disease is a progressive degenerative \n     neurological disease that causes total physical and mental \n     deterioration over a 12 to 15 year period;\n       Whereas each child of a parent with Huntington's Disease \n     has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the Huntington's \n     Disease gene;\n       Whereas Huntington's Disease typically begins in mid-life, \n     between the ages of 30 and 45, though onset may occur as \n     early as the age of 2;\n       Whereas children who develop the juvenile form of the \n     disease rarely live to adulthood;\n       Whereas the average lifespan after onset of Huntington's \n     Disease is 10 to 20 years, and\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\n     the younger the age of onset, the more rapid the progression \n     of the disease;\n       Whereas Huntington's Disease affects 30,000 patients and \n     200,000 genetically ``at risk'' individuals in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas since the discovery of the gene that causes \n     Huntington's Disease in 1993, the pace of Huntington's \n     Disease research has accelerated;\n       Whereas, although no effective treatment or cure currently \n     exists, scientists and researchers are hopeful that \n     breakthroughs will be forthcoming;\n       Whereas researchers across the Nation are conducting \n     important research projects involving Huntington's Disease; \n     and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     Huntington's Disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 15, 2007, as ``National Huntington's \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of Huntington's Disease; and\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Huntington's \n     Disease Society of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/13/senate-section/article/S7677-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MEASURES INDEFINITELY POSTPONED: S.
