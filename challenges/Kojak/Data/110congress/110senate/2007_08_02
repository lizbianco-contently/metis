Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 270, H.R. 2900, the FDA \nreauthorization bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand Senator Kennedy's substitute amendment be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, and the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees, with the conferees being the members \nof the HELP Committee.\n  Further, there were tax measures in this matter that we dealt with on \nthe floor. They have been stricken from the bill. That is what Senator \nKennedy's amendment is all about. I hope we could go to conference on \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and before I \nobject, I need to understand the rationale of the majority leader to \npropound the request at this time. I sent a letter last week. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n           Pensions,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: I urge you to \n     appoint conferees as soon as possible to S. 1082, a bill that \n     renews expiring authorities at the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) as well as reforms our drug safety \n     system.\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\n       Every day, we hear about a new problem the FDA faces in \n     protecting our health. From contaminated seafood to tainted \n     toothpaste, this agency is in dire need of Congressional \n     support to carry out its mission. Reauthorizing these \n     programs is critical to ensure that new drugs and medical \n     devices reach the patients who need them.\n       As you know, this work period is nearly over. If the drug \n     and device user fee programs are not renewed prior to the \n     recess, FDA will have no choice but to send what is known as \n     a ``Reduction In Force'' or layoff notice to hundreds of FDA \n     employees involved in these programs. These highly skilled \n     and dedicated public servants are not likely to wait until \n     Congress musters enough interest to act to maintain the user \n     fee programs. They will find other jobs. A staff exodus would \n     be a disaster for this agency, and for the public health it \n     safeguards so zealously.\n       This comprehensive bill will provide new authorities for \n     FDA to be able to react in a timely way to any safety \n     problems that arise after a drug has been brought to market. \n     FDA needs these tools both to get drugs to the market quickly \n     and efficiently and to respond to potential problems the same \n     way, especial1y when lives are on the line and people need \n     new drugs and therapies.\n       We must think carefully about our priorities for the \n     limited time we have before the recess begins, and take \n     strong action to give the FDA the resources and tools it \n     needs to protect us. Appointing conferees now would send a \n     powerful message that Congress is working as hard as FDA is \n     to make these programs work.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Michael B. Enzi,\n\n                              Ranking Member, Committee on Health,\n                                   Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this letter is asking for a conference to be \nappointed. But it is my understanding the House never intended to \nappoint one this week. Had I known that, I would not have delivered the \nletter. We were working in a very bicameral, bipartisan manner on \ngetting this done.\n  At that time, the key players for this legislation--Representatives, \nSenators, Republicans, and Democrats--were engaged in a very productive \nbicameral, and bipartisan preconference negotiation. We had all rolled \nup our sleeves and decided that we were going to complete the \nlegislation before the August recess.\n  We had a good core agreement, focused on good policy. That is not to \nsay that there weren't a few sticking points. There always are a few of \nthose, but we were making significant progress and coming to a better \nunderstanding of each other's legislation. Thus, the appointment of \nconferees would have been a simple step in the process.\n  However, a week later, we are not in the same place. As the majority \nleader knows, this body can seemingly operate in Senate dog years. One \nweek can be a lifetime. In that short week, there were a series of \nunfortunate events. These events made it impossible for us to meet the \ngoal of completing this key legislation before August recess. I don't \nwant these unfortunate events to derail this process.\n  The first unfortunate event was a discussion on the House floor last \nFriday afternoon between Representative Cantor and Representative \nWasserman-Schultz. In that discussion, the House leadership indicated \nthat they did not intend to have the FDA bill on the House suspension \ncalendar this week. Given that I am not one to watch the House floor, I \ndid not realize that this decision had been made by House leadership \nlast Friday. On Monday, that information was conveyed to my staff by \nthe staff of key Democrats engaged in discussion. The House Democrats \ndid not see how this FDA bill was to get done before recess.\n  Had I known that this was what the House Democrats wanted a few days \nbefore, I would not have hand-delivered that letter to the majority \nleader and the minority leader.\n  Partially, I believe the decision by House Democrats was related to \nother items, other priorities facing the House. Like us, the House has \nbeen discussing the SCHIP legislation this week. Unlike the Senate, the \nHouse committees overlap such that the same committee that works on FDA \nissues also works on SCHIP issues. While we pride our staff in being \nable to do the impossible, forcing both FDA and SCHIP at the same time \nwould be well past impossible. Thus, the House Democrats made a \nchoice--SCHIP over FDA.\n  Partially, I also believe that the House leadership felt as if they \ncould get a ``better deal'' if they were to wait until September and \nbuild up additional pressure related to reduction in force directly \nrelated to the reauthorization of the core of the FDA drug safety bill. \nI hope to disabuse them of that reality.\n  If we are to answer to the American people, to give FDA the necessary \nnew authorities, we must do this in a bipartisan manner. We should not \npoliticize this. We should not hold out for ``better deals'' but work \ntogether to forge a strong agreement that every American can support.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues not to politicize this issue. Too \nmuch is at stake for us to begin the blame game. Instead of blaming \neach other for potential failure, we should be working to ensure our \nsuccess. We should be developing a process agreement for how we are to \ncomplete this key legislation. We should begin defining the scope of \nthe conference to ensure that extraneous proposals do not weigh down \nour ability to quickly respond when we return in September.\n  As part of that first step, I would like everyone to know what I \nbelieve is the appropriate scope of the conference. First, we must \ninclude the reauthorizations of user fee programs at the FDA to ensure \nthat nearly 2,000 employees at that agency are not laid off. These \nstaff not only ensure that drugs and devices are appropriately and \nefficiently reviewed before they are allowed to go to market, but they \nalso are in charge of key postmarket safety monitoring of those \nproducts. We must reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and \nthe Medical Devices User Fee Modernization Act.\n  Beyond these items, during our Senate debate on FDA, we discussed key \nprovisions that provided FDA with new authorities to assist the agency \nin quickly and effectively responding to potential safety issues. These \nnew authorities include requiring labeling changes, requiring \npostmarket studies to more fully examine potential risks, and to have \naccess to clinical trials information for patients and providers. In \naddition, we discussed how to address potential conflicts of interest \nof advisory committee members to ensure greater transparency and \npreserve scientific integrity. I commend Senator Mikulski and Senator \nGrassley for their work in this area.\n\n  In addition, we must include three key provisions that focus on \nchildren. The first two--the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and \nthe Pediatric Research Equity Act--ensure that drugs used in children \nare tested on children. The third proposal would increase our ability \nto have devices geared toward children.\n  Beyond those, there were a series of other provisions which were key \nto our bipartisan agreement. There is the Reagan-Udall Foundation \nprovisions to ensure that FDA has additional tools to advance the \nscience behind its regulations. The Senate also debated and then \naccepted a variety of important provisions related to citizens \npetitions, direct-to-consumer advertising, counterfeit drugs, and \nantibiotics and enantiomers.\n  Senator Stabenow, Senator Brown, Senator Lott, Senator Thune, Senator \nHatch and Senator Coburn developed a proposal on citizens petitions \nthat will end the abuse of the system while preserving FDA's ability to \nreview those petitions that have public health merit. Senator Roberts \nand Senator Harkin worked together successfully to solve the difficult \nissue of how to see that direct to consumer advertisements provide \neffective safety information to patients while meeting the stringent \ntest of constitutionality. Senator Dorgan and Senator Snowe contributed \na proposal on counterfeit drugs that will be included here as well. \nSenator Hatch, Senator Brown, and Senator Burr developed key public \nhealth provisions to ensure access to new antibiotics and drug \nenantiomers.\n  Senator Brown and Senator Brownback offered an important incentive to \nencourage the development of drugs for tropical diseases. All of these \nitems are important components to this legislation and speak to the \nlarger bipartisan nature of our agreement. Let me say that again. We \nworked deliberately to ensure that our bill was bipartisan.\n  Finally, there were a variety of provisions included within the \nSenate bill to address key food safety provisions. Senator Sessions, \nSenator Stevens, and Senator Durbin and I worked on\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\namendments that addressed issues with food and pet food safety.\n  While I have discussed several key provisions that have been within \nthe scope of our discussions, we must also discuss what should not be \nwithin the scope of this legislation. While a sense of the Senate \nindicated our desire to make generic biologics--or what I like to call \nbiosimilars--available to American consumers to reduce the costs of \nsome medications while preserving quality, the House has so far made it \nclear that such legislation would not be welcome on this legislation. \nThey prefer to move through regular order. I understand that desire. I \nprefer regular order, too.\n  During our discussion on the Senate floor, there was one provision \nthat I believe put the bill in jeopardy--an importation amendment. The \nHouse opted not to include this provision so that they could deal with \nit at a later date. This bill is not the time for this debate, given \nthat we are focusing on key bipartisan proposals.\n  So, I turn to the majority leader, and I ask him to refrain from \npoliticizing this issue. I ask him to work with me to define the scope \nof the conference, to develop a plan for getting this legislation done.\n  Until the House leadership is in agreement with our plan, we should \nnot force the issue today by appointing conferees too early. If we do \nthis too early, we set ourselves up for the blame game, not for getting \nthis key legislation done. This place should not be about ``gotcha'' \npolitics when lives are at stake.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what the logjam is at the moment. I \nunderstand there is some concern on the biologics. There isn't any \nreason this cannot be completed, but I am afraid the motion, if we are \ndoing this, would appear to put the blame on the House, or on the \nRepublicans--I am not sure which--and I don't think we can do that at \nthis point in time. Maybe later in the day.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if this is the way the Senator feels, I am \nhappy to have him and Senator Kennedy see if this can be worked out.\n  I withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10687-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRAGEDY IN MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief comment on the \ntragedy in Minneapolis, MN. Watching those pictures on television and \nlistening to the accounts on the radio and seeing newspaper accounts \nand the pictures, this is a real tragedy. My heart and the hearts of \nall Americans go out to the people of Minnesota--to those who have \ndied, those who have been injured, and certainly the families and \nfriends of all those people.\n  I am confident we will find out why that disaster occurred. Right \nnow, we don't know. There is every reason to believe it was not an act \nof terrorism. I feel that is the case, based on hearing the Governor of \nthat State making an announcement this morning.\n  In passing, I say this. After every storm, the sun shines. I think we \nshould look at this tragedy that occurred and make it a wake-up call \nfor us. All over this country, we have crumbling infrastructure--\nhighways, bridges, and dams. We need to take a hard look at that. We \nneed to look at it as the right thing to do and also not only for the \nfact that the infrastructure needs repairing or rebuilding, but it is \ngood for America in more ways than that.\n  For every $1 billion we spend in our crumbling infrastructure, 47,000 \nhigh-paying jobs are created. I hope we will take a look at our \nhighways, bridges, dams, water systems, and sewer systems, and see if \nwe can do something about this infrastructure that needs such \nattention.\n  We have some things coming up in the Senate in the near future we \nneed to focus on. This tragedy is a wake-up call. We will have the \nTransportation appropriations bill, and we will have WRDA, which should \nbe coming from the House. We will have Energy and Water appropriations \nand other matters. We need to work in a bipartisan way and also to work \nwith the White House and have them realize there are things that need \nto be done with our country's infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10687-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, quickly, before I begin, I also wish \nto send my very deep condolences to those families who will have lost \ntheir loved ones in this very tragic bridge collapse. I heard the mayor \non the television this morning, and it brought me back to my days as \nmayor. I know what this\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nkind of difficulty--whether it is an earthquake or a bridge collapse--\nbrings for a city.\n  I wish to extend my thanks to the wonderful efforts made by the \nemergency forces and the medical team of the city of Minneapolis. I \nthink it was very special. I saw many acts of heroism.\n  I very much agree with what the majority leader said about our \ndeteriorating infrastructure. My thoughts went to the great Golden Gate \nBridge. I think we need to pay more attention to our homefront and to \nthose items. But at this point I send my very deep condolences to those \nwho will have lost family members and loved ones.\n  Mr. President, if I may, I wish to present a unanimous consent \nagreement regarding speakers on our side directly following my remarks: \nSenator Lieberman, for 10 minutes; Senator Obama, for 10 minutes; \nSenator Feingold, for 10 minutes; Senator Durbin, for 10 minutes; and \nSenator Reid, for 10 minutes of leader time, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to \ninvoke cloture on this bill, S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act. In the last election, the message was loud and clear: \nIt is time to change the way business is done in the Nation's Capital. \nIn response, what is before us this morning is the single most sweeping \ncongressional reform bill since Watergate. I support its passage, and I \nsupport its passage despite the fact that I do not like everything that \nis in this bill. It is a strong bill. I am sure it is too strong for \nsome and it is too weak for others, but, like all conference reports, \nit is, in effect, to some degree a compromise.\n  On Tuesday, by a 411-to-8 strongly bipartisan vote, the House passed \nthis legislation, and now it is the Senate's turn. It would be a \nserious mistake if we do not step up to the plate and demonstrate to \nthe American people that we have heard their message.\n  As I say, the bill is not perfect. There have been some complaints by \nthe minority party about the process used to bring this bill to the \nfloor, and I wish to begin by addressing that issue.\n  Last January, the Senate passed S. 1 by a 96-to-2 vote. On May 24, \nthe House passed companion legislation by a 386-to-22 margin. Those \nwere strong bipartisan votes. But when the majority leader sought \nunanimous consent to name conferees, one member of the minority party \nobjected, and he held fast to his objections, preventing the \nestablishment of a conference committee where Members could have sat \ndown in the light of day and negotiated Member to Member the \ndifferences between the two bills. Clearly, that wasn't able to take \nplace.\n  With few other options available, the majority leader and the Speaker \nof the House sought consensus on a bill that could be taken up by both \nHouses, and that consensus bill is what we have before us today.\n  It may not be every person's wish, and as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I commit right now to keep these items on the front burner, \nand should changes be necessitated, I would be very happy to entertain \nthem. Though I cannot speak for my counterpart, the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Bennett, I believe he would also.\n  But today, let me say this: I believe this is a good bill--not a \nperfect bill but a good bill. Its passage today is the most direct \naction we can take to show the American people that, yes, we want to \ncurb the influence of lobbyists and we want to restore the public trust \non how we operate as Senators and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the number of \nregistered lobbyists in Washington from 16,342 in 2000 to 34,785 in \n2005. So in 5 years, the numbers of lobbyists have doubled, and, \naccording to all reports, the numbers keep growing.\n  One of the most critical provisions of this bill will now shine new \nlight on the role lobbyists play in political campaigns by requiring \nthe disclosure of funds they bundle on behalf of Members, PACs, and \nparty committees. It will also require that lobbyists disclose all \ntheir campaign contributions as well as payments to Presidential \nlibraries, inaugural committees, or entities controlled by, named, or \nhonoring Members of Congress, and it requires lobbyists to file \nelectronic reports quarterly on their lobbying activity, with these \nreports becoming available on a searchable public database. The bill \nalso increases civil penalties from $50,000 to $200,000 and establishes \na criminal penalty of up to 5 years for those lobbyists who knowingly \nand corruptly fail to comply with these new requirements.\n  There has been increasing concern about former members of the \nadministration, former lawmakers, and their staff gaining undue access \nas lobbyists because of the relationships they have made while working \nfor the Government. This bill seeks to address those concerns by \nincreasing the length of time, the so-called cooling-off period, for \nSenators. Currently, Senators are barred from lobbying Congress for 1 \nyear. With passage of this bill, that would be extended to 2 years.\n  Cabinet Secretaries and other very senior executive personnel would \nbe prohibited from lobbying the department or agency in which they \nworked for 2 years after they leave their position. In other words, \nthey cannot lobby the department from which they left for 2 years. That \nis an increase from 1 to 2 years.\n  Senior Senate staff and Senate officers would be barred from lobbying \nthe entire Senate for 1 year, instead of just their former employing \noffice. That would be the whole Senate, not just their office.\n  There has been a lot of talk also about the K Street Project in which \nlobbyist firms, trade associations, and other business groups were told \nby former House majority leader Tom Delay and others that they would \nencounter a closed door in Congress unless they hired members of the \nthen majority party. This bill seeks to end that practice by \nprohibiting Members of Congress and their staff from influencing hiring \ndecisions of any private organization on the sole basis of partisan \npolitical gain, and it carries with it a fine and imprisonment of up to \n15 years for violations. That is a stiff penalty, but hopefully it \nsends a stiff and strong signal that such practices will not be \ntolerated in the future.\n  Another issue that recently came to light is that Members of Congress \nconvicted of bribery, perjury, conspiracy, and other related crimes can \nstill receive their congressional pensions. I did not know this. \nProbably you didn't know this, Mr. President. But, fortunately, this \nbill ends that practice.\n  S. 1 also contains a number of major reforms to Senate rules, and I \nwill highlight a few of the most important procedural reforms.\n  Section 511 amends rule XXVIII to subject ``dead of night'' additions \nto conference reports, when the new matter was not approved by either \nHouse, to a 60-vote point of order. This is a very important change in \nthe rules, and it has been the bane of many our existence for a long \nperiod of time. You go through the process, and then after the process \nis concluded, in the dead of night, something is stuck into a \nconference bill. This practice will end.\n  Currently, when an out-of-scope provision is added to a conference \nreport, we can object, but the objection brings down the whole bill. \nThe reform in this bill will allow a Member to object to just the added \nprovision.\n  I first proposed this provision in the last Congress and worked \nclosely with Senator Lott on its development. I am very happy that it \nis included in the final bill.\n\n  Section 512 ends secret Senate holds by requiring the Senator placing \na hold on a legislative matter or nomination to publicly disclose that \nhold within 6 days. This, too, is an important reform. We all know \nabout anonymous holds. We all know what it takes to discover who \nactually has the hold. It is time those Members who seek to hold up \nlegislation come forward and disclose who they are and why. We do not \nprohibit their ability to exercise this senatorial prerogative, but we \ndo require that they be transparent and, therefore, public about it.\n  Section 513 requires that Senate committees and subcommittees post \nvideo recordings, audio recordings, or transcripts of all public \nmeetings on the Internet.\n  A great deal of attention has been given to the dramatic escalation \nin the number of earmarks awarded by Congress, and I wish to spend a \ncouple of minutes on the earmark provisions.\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\n  According to a survey of the Congressional Research Service, CRS, the \nnumber of earmarks has skyrocketed from 6,114 to 13,012 in 2006. So in \n6 years, the number of earmarks has more than doubled. Henceforth, \nearmarks which are in effect congressional additions to spending cannot \nbe made in the dark of night but only in the full light of transparent \ndisclosure. That is a big change.\n  This bill would require that the sponsor or the requester of each and \nevery earmark be publicly identified, and because there is often \ndisagreement about what does and does not constitute an earmark, the \nbill provides for the first time in Senate rules a definition that does \nnot restrict the disclosure requirement to only appropriations bills. \nYou and I, Madam President, serve on the Appropriations Committee, but \nthere are also these authorizations that, in effect, are requests for \nadded spending.\n  This new rule XLIV requires that all congressionally directed \nspending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits in \nbills, resolutions, conference reports, and managers' statements be \nidentified and posted on the Internet at least 48 hours before Senate \naction. So 48 hours before a bill comes to the floor, all of these \nadditions must be transparently available to the public. It requires \nfor the first time that Senators certify that they and their immediate \nfamily will not have a direct pecuniary benefit from the earmark they \nrequest as defined by rule XXXVII.\n  Separately, rule XLIV also subjects new directed spending added to a \nconference report when the new spending was not approved by either \nHouse to a 60-vote point of order so that you, Madam President, I, \nSenator Grassley, or anyone else can come to the floor and raise a \npoint of order to that congressional add-on, and then that would be \nsubject to a 60-vote point of order. If a Senator objects to the \nearmark being dropped into the conference report, it then will most \nlikely be stripped out unless 60 Senators vote to keep it in.\n  Committees would also be required, to the greatest extent \npracticable, to disclose in unclassified language the funding level and \nthe name of the sponsor of congressionally directed spending included \nin classified portions of bills, joint resolutions, and conference \nreports. The chairman of each committee is responsible for certifying \nthat the list of earmarks is correct and properly identified. So there \nis also a burden placed on the chair of every committee and \nsubcommittee.\n  Let me speak for a moment about gift and travel reform. The Senate \nrules have also been reformed to curb the special access that special \ninterests seek to gain by providing Members with gifts, meals, and \ntickets to entertainment and sports events. This bill prohibits staff \nand Senators from accepting gifts from registered lobbyists or entities \nthat employ them. The bill prohibits Senators from attending parties in \ntheir honor at national party conventions if they have been sponsored \nby lobbyists, unless the Senator is the party's Presidential or Vice \nPresidential nominee.\n  The bill amends rule XXXV by prohibiting Senators and their staff \nfrom accepting private travel from registered lobbyists or entities \nthat hire them, and prohibiting lobbyists from organizing, arranging, \nrequesting, or participating in travel by Senators or their staff. \nHowever, Senators and their staff, with preapproval from the Ethics \nCommittee, will still be allowed to accept travel by entities that \nemploy lobbyists if it is necessary to participate in a 1-day meeting, \na speaking engagement, a fact-finding trip, or similar event. And \nSenators and their staff can still accept travel provided by 501(c)(3) \norganizations if the trip has been preapproved by the Ethics Committee.\n  Finally, Senators will be required to pay the fair market value--that \nis, the charter rate--for flights on private jets not operating or paid \nfor by an air carrier that is certified by the FAA. Section 601 \nseparately establishes the same requirement for Senate candidates and \nPresidential and Vice Presidential candidates. This, in itself, is a \nconsequential reform and somewhat controversial.\n  Finally, before closing, I would like to thank the majority leader \nfor his unyielding determination to bring this bill forward. Without \nhis dogged determination, and that of the Speaker of the House, I don't \nbelieve this bill would be before us today, and both are to be \ncommended.\n  The 2006 election saw the largest congressional shift since 1994, and \neven with the war in Iraq on many voters' minds, Americans remain \nseriously concerned about ethics in government. It is time we listen to \ntheir concerns. This bill attempts to do so.\n  It is not always easy, it is not going to please everybody, and as I \nsaid in the beginning, Members are either going to feel that this bill \nis too strong about this part or that part, or too weak about this part \nor that part. But let me just reinforce that this is a conference \nreport. It is not subject to amendment. It has been put together in an \nunusual procedure because of the objection from the other side to us \ngoing to conference, which would have been a far preferable method of \nhandling this.\n  I once again repeat my commitment that as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I will be happy to consider any amendments that the \noperation of this bill might indicate are warranted in the future.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, may I claim my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually, under previous order, Senator \nLieberman was scheduled to follow Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are not going back and forth?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa may proceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Also, on behalf of Senator Stevens, because he was \nwaiting to claim his time, and he had to go to a markup, he asked if I \nwould have his name taken off the list and reserve the time for our \nside. But I would ask unanimous consent that I have 5 of that 10 \nminutes he originally had added to my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwon't object, but I misspoke, and if I may just correct the record.\n  This is not a conference report. It is a bill. But it is still not \nsubject to amendment because the tree is filled. I wanted to make that \nclear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Iowa?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nI wanted to ask my friend from Iowa how long he intends to speak.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That would be 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am rising to speak against the \ncompromise that deals with the issue of secret holds. I would agree \nwith the Senator from California, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, that what we have in this report is probably better than \nwhat we have today because secret holds are secret, and nobody knows \nwho is holding a bill. The public's business ought to be public, and it \nisn't today. But I do take exception to what is before us in regard to \nsecret holds for the simple reason that there wasn't any necessity \nwhatsoever to compromise.\n  Secret holds are rules of the Senate, or procedures in the Senate, \nand this body spoke with 84 votes in favor of what Senator Wyden and I \nput before the Senate. Basically, this makes it so liberal that it is \npractically meaningless what we are doing about secret holds.\n  Article I, section 5 of the Constitution of the United States reads \nin part:\n\n       Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.\n\n  That means that the House of Representatives would have no say \nwhatsoever in the Senate rules, but a conference was used for \nnegotiations between the House and Senate. That was used as a rationale \nfor changing what Senator Wyden and I had previously gotten passed in \nthe Senate. So when the Senate debates and passes changes to its rules, \nthat ought to be the final word. But that wasn't the final word, as we \nare seeing today. That is what\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\nhappened with the House package of rules changes that the body passed \nin the Congress, and we didn't attempt to tell the House what they \nought to do.\n  However, since the ethics reform bill that the Senate passed in \nJanuary also contained changes to the Lobbying Disclosure Act and other \nlaws, the entire bill needs to pass both Houses of Congress and be \nsigned by the President. Nevertheless, that does not change the fact \nthat under the Constitution, only the Senate determines its rules and \nprocedures, and the Senate, in an overwhelming majority, spoke. So why \nshouldn't it be left just the way Senator Wyden and I had originally \nintroduced it.\n  What has happened is, the Senate had a full open debate about it and \npassed the changes that we did in Wyden-Grassley. Now we have a \nsituation where the majority leader of the Senate and the Speaker of \nthe House rewrote major provisions in this package, including rewriting \nSenate rules that had already passed the full Senate.\n  In conference, one provision that was changed was a provision that I \nreferred to which Senator Wyden and I had been working on for years to \nend the practice of secret holds because the public's business ought to \nalways be public. Any Senator who has guts enough to put a hold on a \nbill ought to be willing to stand up and say who they are. Only in the \nSenate can a single Member prevent legislation or nominations from \nbeing considered under the so-called procedure of holds. Holds do not \nexist in the House.\n  Senator Wyden and I were successful in passing an amendment in last \nyear's ethics reform bill by a vote of 84 to 13 on public disclosure. \nThat same language was included in the bill without a vote in this \nCongress. But you know how things go on around the Senate. We had \nprominent Senators, people who run this body, who told Senator Wyden \nand I that ``they get the message,'' after 6 or 7 years, and, finally, \nwe were going to end this secrecy. That bill wasn't enacted, but we \nincluded those identical provisions in this bill.\n  Senator Wyden and I pushed for that provision because we believed the \npublic's business ought to be done in public. Every Senator has the \nright to object to a unanimous consent request to proceeding to a \nmatter. Senators have every right to object to a unanimous consent \nrequest publicly, but I see no legitimate reason Senators should be \nable to be secret about what they are doing in the Senate. It has been \nmy policy for years to place a brief statement in the Congressional \nRecord each time I place a hold, with a short explanation of why I \nplaced that hold. It has never hurt me one bit, and Senators should \nhave no fear following a requirement of the public's business being \npublic. In other words, nothing secret. If you want to hold up a bill, \njust have guts enough to say so.\n  So I say the Senate has spoken in passing our very well thought out \nprovision. And I should add that this provision was written with the \nhelp and advice of Senator Lott and Senator Byrd, both former majority \nleaders with much valuable insight about how the Senate works. Yet even \nthough the Senate has already spoken as a body on this matter, a single \nSenator has single-handedly rewritten part of this provision, \noverriding what I consider overwhelming support in the Senate to end \nsecret holds.\n  In the version that was Senate passed, we allowed 3 days for Senators \nto submit a simple public disclosure form for the Record, just like \nadding your name as a cosponsor to a bill. The intent is not that it is \nsomehow legitimate to keep a hold secret for 3 days, but we wanted to \ngive Senators ample time to get their disclosure to the floor to be \nentered into the Record. The rewritten provision, as Senator Feinstein \nhas said, gives Senators 6 legislative days instead of those 3 days. It \nis absurd to think that Senators need over a week to send an intern \ndown to the floor with this simple form.\n  Of greater concern is that the rewritten language requires Senators \nto disclose a hold only after a unanimous consent request is made and \nobjected to anonymously on the Senator's behalf, and then they have 6 \ndays after that. That is too late. By that point, particularly at the \nend of a session, it is going to make this process meaningless. By that \npoint, a hold could have existed for some time, perhaps without the \nsponsor of the bill even realizing it.\n  Furthermore, since the majority leader controls the Senate's \nschedule, he would hardly object to his own request to bring up a bill \nor nominee. He would simply not bring up a bill or nominee being held \nup by a Member of his own party. If a Member of the minority party were \nto attempt to ask unanimous consent to proceed to a matter, he would \nobject on his own behalf to protect the majority leader's prerogative \nto set the agenda, and any secret holds by members of a majority party \nwould remain secret.\n  I am deeply disappointed that this provision that Senator Wyden and I \nworked so hard on, over a period of at least 6 years, to finally get a \nvote of 84 Members of this body supporting it, and then, because it was \nalmost a fait accompli as seen by leaders of this body--powerful \nSenators in this body--just to put it in, in January, in the bill that \nis before us because it would be done--so-called ``getting the \nmessage,''--well, who has forgotten that they got the message that they \nhad to change this? And that is what is so irritating.\n  I am going to vote for this bill, but this was something that didn't \nneed to be in a bill. It didn't need to be negotiated. This was decided \nby the vast majority of the Senate. But you know what it tells me. \nThere are still people around here who don't want the public's business \nto be public. They want to do things in secret. They do not have guts \nenough to say they want to hold up a bill. So we end up with this \nconvoluted thing we have of 6 days, but it isn't even kicked in until \nafter there is an attempt by somebody to ask for a unanimous consent \nrequest to bring up a bill, and then only at that point, and then there \nis 6 days after that.\n  So I have stated my piece. I am not very happy. I hope Senator Wyden \nis as unhappy as I am and will try to do something in the future.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from California for \nher leadership in this very important matter.\n  We all know, if you read the public opinion polls, Congress is at an \nall-time low in the estimation of the American people. I am not going \nto comment about the political impact of that, but more broadly on the \nfact that this is, in our self-estimation, the greatest democracy in \nthe world, and that means this is a government which depends on the \nsupport of those we govern--the consent of the governed. When the level \nof trust and respect between the people of the United States and the \nMembers of this elected Congress is as low as it is now, our democracy \nis less than it should be. I don't want to say it is in jeopardy, but I \nwill say that it is weakened by this distrust.\n  So why does this distrust exist? I am sure everybody has their own \nfavorite explanations. It seems to me that part of it is a pervasive \npartisanship here that gets in the way of us producing results, \nproducing solutions to problems that people have--the people who are \ngood enough to honor us by sending us here. They are frustrated because \nthey think we too often put partisan interests ahead of public \ninterests, ahead of their interests.\n\n  Another reason for the low estimation and opinion the American people \nhave of Congress today is the wave of scandals that has afflicted the \nCongress and individual Members. When one Member is accused or \nconvicted of an ethical or legal lapse, it affects the attitude of the \npeople toward the entire institution. These seem to have come with \nincreasing frequency.\n  Ultimately, no law can guarantee that an individual anywhere, \nincluding in Congress, will do the right thing and will be ethical. \nThere are always private moments when we will all have to count on our \nmoral compasses and our values center. But we adopt law to try to \ncreate a clarity of rules and create incentives for our society \noverall--and in this case, we ourselves--to guide us, encourage us, \nhopefully to scare us into doing the right thing. It is in that\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\ncontext that I rise with real enthusiasm to support the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act which is before the Senate today.\n  This is not only the right thing to do in every substantive way, but \nit is the right thing to do in the larger sense that I described, of \ntrying to rebuild the respect the American people have for this \ninstitution and for all of us who are Members of it. The focus here is \non disclosure, as it ought to be.\n  The American people will naturally view darkly what is done in the \nshadows. They want to know that what we do in their names here in \nCongress is done with their best interests at heart rather than the \nnarrow interests of a special few whose money may appear to the public \nto buy those special few access. Those suspicions, in the context of \npublic cases of ethical and legal violations, grow in the darkness. The \nAmerican people must know, through disclosure and sunlight--and this \nbill will shine light on so much of what we do--that the only special \ninterest being represented here in Congress is the interest of the \nAmerican people who were good enough to honor us by sending us here to \nserve them. This sweeping legislation shines much needed light in \ncorners and corridors of this Capitol, too long left in the dark. It \nshould help restore the public's trust now, a trust that is in much \nneed of restoration.\n  I am proud to say that much of the lobbying part of this legislation \ncame from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nlast year under the leadership of Senator Collins, this year under my \nchairmanship. We always have worked together on a bipartisan basis.\n  With regard to lobbying, I wish to cite a few of the key proposals \nthat increase disclosure.\n  This bill will bring the Lobbying Disclosure Act into the age of the \nInternet by requiring electronic filings and by requiring quarterly--\nrather than semiannual--reports detailing lobbying activities that \nlobbyists perform for specific clients. The reports are going to be \nright there for the public to see on the House and Senate Web sites.\n  Second, the bill amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act to require \nlobbyists to file reports detailing their activities beyond lobbying \ndirectly. That includes campaign contributions, payments for events to \nhonor Members or to entities controlled by Members, and donations to \nMember charities, Presidential libraries or inaugural committees. None \nof these contributions are currently disclosed under law. This \nlegislation attempts to build a broader wall between what we do here in \nserving the public and the lobbying world. Lobbying is a \nconstitutionally protected activity. We are not trying to stop it or \ncurtail it. We are trying to make sure it is done in an honorable and \nhonest way.\n  This legislation increases from 1 to 2 years the cooling-off period \nbefore Senators can come back and lobby their colleagues. The bill also \nadds a provision to the Lobbying Disclosure Act prohibiting lobbyists \nfrom knowingly providing gifts or travel to Members in violation of \nHouse or Senate ethics rules, putting lobbyists on the hook for civil \nor criminal penalties if they violate the rules. Amendments to the \nLobbying Disclosure Act will also shine a spotlight on so-called \nstealth coalitions by requiring greater disclosure of the identity of \nindividual organizations that contribute to collective and focused \nlobbying efforts.\n  We back all these provisions with teeth--better enforcement. We \nincrease civil penalties under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and create \nnew criminal penalties for knowing and corrupt failure to comply with \nthe act. We will have annual audits. We require annual audits by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, of lobbyists' filings--that is a \nsecond tier of review--and regular reporting by the Department of \nJustice on actions they take against those who violate the rules.\n  Those are the most significant parts of this legislation that came \nout of our committee with regard to lobbying. I do wish to compliment \nmy friend and colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, for her \nwork in putting together an extremely tough ethics package. I think it \nis a very significant accomplishment for her in the first half year of \nher chairmanship of the Senate Rules Committee. In particular, I am \npleased the final package, for the first time, requires so-called \nbundled campaign contributions made by lobbyists to Federal candidates \nto be disclosed to the public and published on the Federal Election \nCommission Web site. I know Senator Feinstein has mentioned, and others \nwill, other reforms here.\n  I wish to say just a final word about earmarks. This was an issue \nthat came up in my campaign for reelection last year. I was accused by \none of my opponents of bringing earmarks back to Connecticut. I thought \nthat was something good to do. I said, like so much else in life, there \nare good earmarks and bad earmarks. Bad earmarks can often get through \nif there is not adequate disclosure. If you support an earmark and it \nis in legislation, you ought to not only be proud to be identified with \nthat earmark in public but, if necessary, to come to the floor and \ndefend the earmark to make sure it has the support of your colleagues.\n  This legislation requires that all earmarks included in bills and \nconference reports and their sponsors be identified on the Internet at \nleast 48 hours before the Senate votes. Senators will be required to \ncertify that they and their immediate family members have no financial \ninterest in these earmarks. Dead-of-night additions to conference \nreports--that is, new earmarks, business that has too often been done \nhere without public scrutiny or even the scrutiny of most Members of \nCongress--will now be subject to a 60-vote point of order.\n  I will say, if a Senator from yesteryear--not so far back yesteryear, \n15 years, maybe 10 years--came back and saw that we were doing this \nhere, they would wonder where they were. But where they would be is \nsomeplace where the American people justifiably want us to be.\n  Once the elections are over, the American people expect us to come \nhere and do their business. That is exactly what this legislation will \nmake much more likely. In the end, as I said at the beginning, it all \ncomes down to the moral compass each Member of Congress has and the \nrespect we give to the office in which it is our privilege to serve. \nBut government in the shadows with deals cut behind closed doors \ninvites abuse, breeds distrust, and simply must end. This bill goes a \nlong way toward doing exactly that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The lobbying \nportion of this bill falls within Senator Lieberman's jurisdiction. I \nalso thank him for a job well done. He has been steadfast in this \npursuit for a number of years.\n  I will exchange places with the Presiding Officer, and Senator Obama \nwill be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in strong \nsupport of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007.\n  First of all, let me commend the Presiding Officer for the \noutstanding work she has done in helping to shepherd this process \nthrough. It is wonderful work. I think the American people very much \nappreciate the improvements that are being made to our political \nprocess as a consequence. I also commend Senator Reid for his \noutstanding leadership on this bill. I especially thank my good friend, \nSenator Feingold, with whom I have worked closely on this issue over \nthe past year and a half.\n  The bill before us today could not be more urgently needed. For too \nlong, the American people have seen lobbyists treat the legislative \nprocess like a game, using targeted contributions to maximize their \nleverage. For too long, people have believed their voice and interests \nhave been drowning in a sea of lobbyist money and influence in \nWashington.\n  This is not the first time we have faced a crisis of confidence in \ngovernment. Around the turn of the last century, wealth was becoming \nmore concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons, railroad \ntycoons, and oil magnates. It was an era known as the Gilded Age. It \nwas made possible by a government that played along. But when\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt took office, he wouldn't play along. He \ndevoted his Presidency to busting trusts, breaking up monopolies, and \ndoing his best to give the American people a shot at the American dream \nonce more.\n  America needs this kind of leadership more than ever. It needs \nleadership that sees government not as a tool to enrich well-connected \nfriends and high-priced lobbyists but as the defender of fairness and \nopportunity for every American.\n  We cannot settle for a second Gilded Age in America. Yet we find \nourselves once more in the midst of a new economy, where more wealth is \nin danger of falling into fewer hands, where CEO pay grows from year to \nyear as the average worker's pay remains stagnant, where Americans are \nstruggling like never before to pay their medical bills or kids' \ntuition or high gas prices, all the while the profits of drug and \ninsurance and oil industries have never been higher.\n  Once again we are faced with the politics that makes all of this \npossible. In recent years, the doors to Congress and the White House \nhave been thrown wide open to an army of Washington lobbyists who \nturned our Government into a game only they can afford to play. Year \nafter year, they stand in the way of our progress as a country. They \nstop us from addressing the issues that matter most to our people.\n  Let's take health care, just as one example. The drug and insurance \nindustry spent $1 billion in lobbying over the last decade. They got \nwhat they paid for when their friends in Congress broke the rules and \ntwisted arms to push through a prescription drug bill that actually \nmade it illegal for our own Government to negotiate with the \npharmaceutical companies for cheaper drug prices. Because reform has \nbeen blocked up until now, there are parents and grandparents in this \ncountry who are walking into the drugstore and wondering how their \nSocial Security check is going to cover a prescription that is more \nexpensive than it was a month ago, who are being forced to choose \nbetween their medicine and groceries because they can no longer afford \nboth.\n  Let me be clear, I do not begrudge businesses trying to make a \nprofit. I do not begrudge them hiring lobbyists to plead their case \nbefore Congress. It is protected political speech, and we appreciate \nthat there are many lobbyists who represent their clients well and \nfairly. But it is time we had a Congress that tells drug companies or \noil companies or the insurance industry that, while they may get a seat \nat the table in Washington, they don't get to buy every single chair. \nWe need to put an end to the prevailing culture in this town, and that \nis what we have been trying to do for the past couple of years.\n  Last year, Congress came up with a somewhat watered-down version of \nreform.\n  I, along with others, such as Senator Feingold and the Senator from \nArizona, who is about to speak, Mr. McCain, voted against it because we \nthought we could do better.\n  In January, I came back with Senator Feingold, and we set a high bar \nfor reform. I am pleased to report that the bill before us today comes \nvery close to what we proposed. By passing this bill, we will ban gifts \nand meals and end subsidized travel on corporate jets; we will close \nthe revolving door between Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street; and we \nwill make sure the American people can see all the pet projects \nlawmakers are trying to pass before they are actually voted on.\n  We will do something more. Over the objections of powerful voices in \nboth parties, we will ensure that our laws shine a bright light on how \nlobbyists help fill the campaign coffers of Members of Congress by \nbundling contributions from others. Because an era in which soft money \nis prohibited, the real measure of a lobbyist's influence is not how \nmuch money he has contributed, it is how much money he is raising from \nothers.\n  For too long, this practice has been hidden from public view. But \ntoday we can change that. I am pleased the amendment I have offered on \nbundling is part of this bill. I wish to thank Representative Chris Van \nHollen, who fought so hard to get this provision included in the House \nbill. As the Washington Post described the bundling provision earlier \nthis year:\n\n       No single change would add more public understanding of how \n     money really operates in Washington.\n\n  So there is a lot of good in this bill. I truly hope and believe it \nwill change the way we do business in Washington.\n  Let's not forget, though, there is still some more we need to do. One \nof the things I have argued is necessary to have on this is an \nindependent entity to enforce ethics rules in Congress. Because no \nmatter how well we police our own conduct, as long as we are our own \nprosecutor, judge, and jury, the public will never have complete trust \nin our decisions. So far, that is a fight I have lost. But I will \ncontinue to support independent enforcement because I believe it is in \nour Nation's best interests.\n  I also believe that if we are serious about change, we need to have a \nreal discussion about public financing for Congressional elections. \nBecause even if we can stop lobbyists from buying us lunch or taking us \nout on junkets, they will still be able to attend our fundraisers, and \nthat is access the average American does not have.\n  In our democracy, the price of access and influence should be nothing \nmore than your voice and your vote. That should be enough for health \ncare reform. That should be enough for a real energy policy. That \nshould be enough to ensure our Government is still the defender of \nfairness and opportunity for every American.\n  It is time to show the American people we have the courage to change \nthe prevailing culture in this city. It is time to give people \nconfidence in their Government again. We have a chance to start doing \nit with this bill.\n  I proudly support this legislation. I once again thank the chair for \nher outstanding work in moving this forward. I urge all my colleagues \nto support the legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, over the last 20 years, I have found \nmyself in a lonely fight against earmarks and porkbarrel spending year \nafter year. I have come to the floor and read list after list of the \nridiculous items we are spending money on, hoping enough embarrassment \nmight spur some change.\n  I was encouraged in January, when this body passed by 96 to 2, an \nethics and lobbying reform package which contained real, meaningful \nearmark reform. I thought at last we would finally enact some effective \nreforms. Unfortunately, the victory was short-lived.\n  One of my happier days, I will admit, was when Dr. Coburn was elected \nto the Senate in 2004. There is no better advocate of earmark reform; \nno one more consistent in standing firm to fight the worthy fight \nagainst wasteful spending, and I am proud to call him my friend.\n  I would like to commend my friend, Senator DeMint, and Senator \nGraham, Senator Cornyn, and others for joining our effort. Sadly, I say \nto my friends, that given the very watered-down earmark provisions \ncontained in the measure brought to us by the majority, our good fight \nclearly will have to continue.\n  Not only does this bill do far too little to rein in wasteful \nspending, it has completely gutted the earmark reform provisions we \npassed overwhelming in January. It provides little more than lip \nservice, unless, of course, you happen to be a committee chairman of \nthe majority leader.\n  Under this majority-written bill, with no input from the Republicans, \nthis bill will, unless you hold one of the top positions, you will now \nwield even more power, even more power with your porkbarrel pen.\n  Let me be clear. The ethics and lobbying reform bill has some good \nprovisions which I strongly support: A ban on gifts and travel paid for \nby lobbyists or groups, although, if you want to get a free meal, count \nit as a campaign contribution. But, anyway, increased disclosure is \nwelcome reform.\n  But the bill before us fixes only part of the problem and does not go \nto the heart of the problem. The heart of the problem that has bred the \ncorruption is the earmark process. We all know that as my friend, Dr. \nCoburn, has said from time to time, it is the gateway drug to \ncorruption--it is the gateway drug to corruption. I do not throw around \nthe word ``corruption'' lightly. But there\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\nare former Members of Congress in jail. There are investigations going \non right now, and you can trace it all back to the influence of money \nwhich has corrupted a process which then allows money, our tax dollars, \nto be given to special interests or even accrue to the benefit of the \nauthor of the earmarks.\n  We come to the floor a lot and talk about a lot of the earmarking. \nSome of them are fun to talk about, but they make you sad: $225,000 for \na historic wagon museum in Utah; $1 million for a DNA study of bears in \nMontana; $200,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n  You notice all these earmarks are geographically designated so there \nwill be no mistake that that money might go someplace else other than \nwhere it had been intended by the appropriator.\n  One of my favorites is the $37 million over 4 years to the Alaska \nFisheries Marketing Board to promote and develop fishery products and \nresearch pertaining to American fisheries. So how does this board spend \nthe money so generously? I have a picture I will not show. Well, they \nspent $500,000 of your tax dollars to paint a giant salmon on the side \nof an Alaska Airlines 747, and nicknamed it the ``Salmon Forty \nSalmon.''\n\n  So the fact is, we are not going at the heart of the problem. Let me \nquote from yesterday's Wall Street Journal that says it even better \nthan I can:\n\n       Our favorite switcheroo: Under the previous Senate reform, \n     the Senate parliamentarian would have determined whether a \n     bill complied with earmark disclosure rules. Under Mr. Reid's \n     new version, the current majority leader, that is, Mr. Reid \n     himself, will decide if a bill is in compliance. When was the \n     last time a Majority Party Leader declared one of his own \n     bills out of order?\n\n  I have only been here 20 years, but I have never seen it. I do not \nthink you are going to see it in the future. So while under this new \nversion of the bill earmarks should be disclosed in theory, the fact \nremains that only the committee chair or the majority leader or his \ndesignee can police it.\n  If they say all the earmarks are identified, we take it as gospel. \nOur only option is to appeal the ruling of the chair that a \ncertification was made. Of course, that is business as usual, requiring \n60 votes.\n  The new version does retain the requirement that bills and conference \nreports be available 48 hours before a vote, but the searchable \ndatabase is no longer a requirement when it comes to conference \nreports; conference reports, where we have seen inserted some of the \nmost egregious porkbarrel projects in this system as it exists today.\n  Of course, conveniently the bill was modified between its release \nMonday morning and another version Monday afternoon. It was a \nmodification to the benefit of the business-as-usual crowd. It would \nnow require a 60-vote threshold to appeal the ruling of the chair, \ncompared to a mere majority vote under the version released a few hours \nearlier.\n  Let's be clear. Sixty Members are not going to overrule the majority \nleader. Fact. Business as usual. Business as usual.\n  I am a bit saddened, too, because there was an opportunity here. \nThere is enough outrage and anger out there amongst the American people \nthat they are demanding reform. They are not demanding an increase from \n1 year to 2 years for disclosure; they are not demanding about meals, \nthey are demanding we fix the earmark process which has led to \ncorruption. We have taken a pass. I regret it very much.\n  I predict to you now the earmarking and porkbarrel spending will \ncreep back into the process sooner rather than later, and we will not \nregain the confidence of the American people.\n  I wish to thank again my colleagues, both Senators from South \nCarolina, the Senator from Oklahoma, and others who have fought \nsometimes a lonely fight to try to clean up this mess.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin is next on \nour list. However, he had a pressing meeting, so we would be happy to \ngo to a Republican.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for highlighting \nsome of the problems with the bill. The real problem is that we last \nyear spent $434 billion of our grandkids' money that we could not come \nup with. We did not collect taxes; we lowered their standard of living \nin the future. How did we get there?\n  We got there because we use earmarks to buy votes on appropriations \nbills. So we never look at the appropriations bill, we only look to see \nif our little thing is in it. Not all earmarks are bad. What is bad is \na lack of transparency in our Government.\n  I know, Mr. President, you have helped me in terms of the \nTransparency and Accountability Act, but that is all after the fact. \nWhat this bill does is create a lie. That is what it is. It is not \nanything less than that.\n  We are lying to the American people that we are fixing earmarks, when \nwe are not. The reason is, the vast majority of people in this body do \nnot want their earmarks disclosed because it limits their ability to \nplay the power game with the well connected who get something ahead of \neverybody else.\n  The other problem with earmarks is it takes our eye off the \npriorities for our country. Earmarks cause us not to do what is best \nfor the country as a whole in the long term. It makes us short-term \nthinkers. It makes us parochial in our interests. I challenge any \nMember of this body to look at the oath they took and see if it says \nanything about your State when you swore to uphold the Constitution and \nserve as a Senator. Your duty is to the country as a whole, not to the \nwell-heeled special interests who are the beneficiaries, whether they \nare parochial or not, to your earmark.\n  So there is no question this bill will pass. But the question the \nSenators have to ask is: Was I intellectually honest when every one of \nthem out there is saying: We will have to fix this later because we do \nnot like it, but we do not have the courage to vote against it--because \nthey know we have not fixed the problem. But they are afraid of the \npublic outrage and the pressure that has been created, in the essence \nof creating the impression that we fixed the problem.\n  Now, why do I say we have not fixed the problem? You go through this. \nWhat the Senate passed was Dick Durbin-Nancy Pelosi's bill on \ntransparency and earmarks, brought to the Senate by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The first provision prohibits Senators from trading earmarks for \nvotes. In other words, I will give you your earmark if you will vote \nfor my bill. It is gone. It is not there anymore.\n  Prohibiting Senators and staff from promoting earmarks from which \nthey or their families would receive a direct financial benefit, it is \ngone. We now say it has to be for that person, even though you may be \nconnected. So we have gutted that. One of the greatest problems we \nhave, we have gutted. So no longer is there a prohibition that your \nfamily member cannot benefit from an earmark from Congress. That is the \ngreatest conflict of interest there is. Yet it goes on every day.\n  Third. Allows the Senate Parliamentarian, not the majority leader, \nnot the chairman of the committee, to determine if a bill complies with \nearmark disclosure and transparency rules. The American people are \nnever going to be able to hold us accountable until they can see what \nwe are doing.\n  We have now said that, whoever is the leader, Republican or Democrat, \nthis is not about who is in charge, it is about whether who is in \ncharge will have the courage to go against the whole political power of \ntheir own party to certify.\n  The first appropriations bill we had so far in the Senate, the only \none we passed, was certified that it was totally compliant. It missed \nit by $7 billion. They did not list all the earmarks, and they \ncertainly were not transparent, but they certified they were.\n  The next provision prohibits consideration of bills, joint \nresolutions, or conference reports if earmarks are not disclosed. You \ncan't bring it to the floor anymore if they are not disclosed. You \nstill can bring it to the floor under the rules of this new ethics \nbills.\n  The next provision requires earmarks attached to a conference report \nto be publicly available on the Internet in a searchable format 48 \nhours before consideration. It still says it, but there is an out. The \nway this place works, we\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n\nbring conference reports up such as that all the time. So every time it \nis going to get waived, and we are not going to know. We are going to \nbe voting on bills where the earmarks aren't disclosed.\n  Next provision: Requires 67 votes to suspend the earmark disclosure \nrule. That is what we passed 98 to nothing. Now if you want to fight \nthat, you have to have 61 votes to say it doesn't. We have totally put \non it the other side. We have totally made it so that you can in fact \nnot disclose earmarks, and the majority will vote with you. We have \nmade it hard for transparency rather than easy.\n  The next provision requires a full day's notice prior to attempting \nto suspend the earmark disclosure rule. Not anymore. No notice. So you \ncould suspend it and don't have to notify anybody that you are \nsuspending it.\n  Finally, it requires all earmark certifications from Senators to be \nposted on the Internet within 48 hours. Not anymore, not if the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee doesn't think they can get it \ndone. They just waive it.\n  So where are the problems? Why is it that the country has between 14 \nand 28 percent confidence in the Congress? It is because we continue to \nuse sleight of hand to tell them we are doing something when we are \nnot. I don't have any problems with the other things in the bill \nbasically, but those are symptoms of the disease. The disease is right \nhere. It is called earmarks. If we don't treat the disease rather than \nthe symptoms, we are never going to fix the problem.\n  I am adamantly opposed to this bill and what it has done to gut \nearmark disclosure. I have been around here long enough to know what \nwill happen under the time pressures and the constraints and the way we \noperate. This will all go away. It may not go away on the first bill or \nthe second bill, but it will go away. So we find ourselves with the \nSenate getting ready to vote on an ethics and disclosure rule, and \nevery Senator is saying: How do we fix the things we don't like? Well, \nwe will do it later.\n  Nobody loves this bill, but we are going to vote for it, not because \nwe are fixing the problem, but it looks as if we are fixing it. The \nconfidence in Congress isn't going to go up; it is going to go down.\n  We started this debate 2\\1/2\\ years ago on an amendment on a bridge \nto 50 people in Alaska of which 15 Members of this body voted with me. \nBut the American people came to realize that the bridge to nowhere \nstood for something more than the bridge to nowhere. It stood for the \nlack of character and integrity in this body in terms of making long-\nterm decisions and putting the country first instead of political \ncareers. We haven't solved anything with this ethics bills in terms of \nthat problem and rebuilding confidence. There is a crisis of confidence \nin this country. There is a rumble that we don't deserve the positions \nwe hold because we haven't earned them, because we are going to use \nsleight of hand. We are going to lessen confidence in this country. We \ntalk about money. It is great, except what is going to happen is we are \ngoing to bundle $14,900 every 6 months and it is not going to be \nreported. Over a 6-year career, that is $180,000 that one lobbyist can \nbundle for you that does not have to be reported. So tell me how we \nfixed the problem? The bundling is a symptom of the earmarks. It is a \nsymptom. Where is the connection between earmarks and campaign \ncontributions? It is there almost every time. You just have to look for \nit.\n  With the President's help we passed the post-transparency bill, \nSenator Obama and I, to where we get a look at it after the fact. But \nnow we don't want to have transparency before the fact. We have failed \nthe American people with this bill. We are also failing the Senate and \nultimately we fail ourselves.\n  I ask the American people to look at the pictures of their children \nand grandchildren. Do you want them to have the same opportunities, the \nsame benefits, the same freedoms and liberties? This is the thing that \nis going to take it away--the lack of an honest and open debate about \npriorities, the continued spending of money we don't have, and most of \nit on the basis that we have a gateway drug to spending addiction \ncalled earmarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a proud day for the Senate. I \ncertainly thank the Chair of the committee, the Senator from \nCalifornia, for all her guidance and hard work to make sure this \nlegislation got to this point. I certainly thank the Presiding Officer, \nMr. Obama of Illinois, who has been a wonderful partner in this effort. \nI enjoyed working with him, and he was tough all the way through when \nit counted to make sure we would end up with this kind of strong \nlegislation. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Many months of work on legislation to reform our Nation's lobbying \ndisclosure laws and the rules that govern our conduct as Senators are \nabout to come to a close. The result is a bill that by any measure must \nbe considered landmark legislation. I am pleased to support this bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and support the bill. I \nwant to speak for a few minutes about what is in this bill and the \nforces that brought us to this moment.\n  I introduced the first comprehensive lobbying and ethics reform \npackage in the Senate in July 2005, about 10 years after enactment of \nthe Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and the last significant changes to \nthe Senate's rules on gifts and travel on which I worked with the \nsenior Senator from Arizona. A decade of experience had exposed the \nweaknesses in those important pieces of legislation. In light of \ngrowing concern about the relationships between certain Members of \nCongress and Washington lobbyists, I thought it was time to undertake \nfurther significant reform.\n  In the months that followed, the Jack Abramoff scandal consumed more \nand more space on the front pages of the newspaper. When he was \nindicted in December, lobbying and ethics reform all of a sudden got a \nbig burst of momentum in Congress. In the first few months of 2006, \nradical reform seemed not only possible but likely. Hearings were held, \nand a bidding war for who could sound the most sincere about fixing the \nproblems that had led to the Abramoff scandal ensued.\n  Unfortunately, the congressional leadership at the time talked a good \ngame, but was not really committed to reform. The bill that passed the \nSenate last May fell well short not only of what was needed, but also \nof what had been promised only a few months earlier. The House \nleadership waited even longer to act and tried to add controversial \ncampaign finance legislation to the package, dooming it to defeat. The \nconventional wisdom was that the voters didn't care, at least that's \nwhat the defenders of the status quo assured themselves as they \nengineered the stalemate that led to no reform at all being enacted. As \nwe found last November, they were wrong.\n  The voters sent a clear message in November 2006 that they were fed \nup with the way things were going in Washington. And the leaders of the \nnew Congress responded to that message by making lobbying and ethics \nreform their very top priority. Speaker Pelosi included major changes \nto the ethics rules in the House in a package of rules changes adopted \non the very first day of the session. And Majority Leader Reid \nintroduced an ethics and lobbying reform package as S. 1 and brought it \nimmediately to the Senate floor.\n  I am pleased that only 7 months later, we are here today to finish \nthe job. The bill before us is a very strong piece of reform \nlegislation. We have a real ban on gifts from lobbyists, strong new \nrules governing privately funded travel, a requirement that Senators \npay the full charter rate to travel on corporate jets for personal, \nofficial or campaign purposes, strengthened revolving door \nrestrictions, and improved lobbying disclosure provisions. And for the \nfirst time, the public will get a full accounting, through reports \nfiled by lobbyists, and reports filed by campaigns and party \ncommittees, of all the ways that lobbyists provide financial support \nfor the Members of Congress who they lobby.\n  I am very pleased also that the bill includes provisions to provide \ngreater transparency in the process by which\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nlegislation is considered here in the Senate. Finally, after years of \nfailed attempts, secret holds on legislation will be a relic of the \npast. In addition, out of scope additions to conference reports can be \nstricken individually rather than bringing down the whole report. All \nof these items show the seriousness with which this Congress and its \nnew leadership addressed the anger that the American people expressed \nlast November.\n  Let me say a word about earmarks. I heard my colleagues discussing \nit, and they know how strong I have been on this issue and how much I \nopposed the earmark process in my own practices and how many times I \nsupported strong legislation in this regard. I have long been a strong \nsupporter of earmark reform. I have cosponsored legislation on this \ntopic with the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. Back in January, when \nthe Senate first debated this bill, I broke with my leadership and \nsupported the earmark reform amendment authored by the junior Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. DeMint. It is my judgment that the earmark \nreforms included in the proposal before the Senate today are consistent \nwith the DeMint amendment, much stronger than the original bipartisan \nleadership proposal that was introduced in January, and an enormous \nimprovement over the way earmarks had been handled by both Democratic \nand Republican-controlled Congresses in the past. It is simply not \naccurate to say that the final version of this provision guts the \nDeMint amendment that the Senate passed early this year. The minor \nchanges that were made certainly do not justify a vote against cloture \nor against the bill.\n  The difference between the approach to lobbying and ethics reform \nthis year and last year is this: Last year there was a lot of tough \ntalk, but when it came down to it, the goal was to try to satisfy \npublic outrage but actually do as little as possible. This year, the \ntough talk was backed up by tough action. This bill includes real \nreform on things like gifts and earmarks that get a lot of public \nattention and also on things like secret holds and corporate jets that \noccur mostly behind the scenes but have a big impact on how things work \nin Washington.\n  I especially thank Majority Leader Reid for his steadfast insistence \non passing strong legislation. This is a great accomplishment for him \nand for the Senate. I am pleased it is getting done in a timely manner. \nAnd I want to thank my colleagues for recognizing that regardless of \nhow reforms might inconvenience us or impact our personal lifestyles, \nour priority must be to convince our constituents that we are here to \nadvocate their best interests, not those of well-connected lobbyists.\n  Ethical conduct in government should be more than an aspiration, it \nshould be a requirement. That is what this bill is all about. I am \nproud to support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote aye on cloture, \nand on final passage of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if the Chair would allow me to thank \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, he has been an energetic, enthusiastic \nadvocate for a very long time. He is not always hard to please. I want \nto particularly say ``thank you'' to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I see we have 30 minutes before the vote. \nI was offered 10. I ask unanimous consent that I have up to 15 minutes \nto complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the pretense of \nearmarks reform that is included in this so-called ethics bill and to \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on cloture this morning so we can \nrestore the earmark transparency rules we all voted on in January. If, \nas the majority contends, the differences between that bill and the one \nwe bring to the floor today are minor, there should be no objection to \nmaking those rules the same.\n  Americans know how much Congress loves earmarks. These are the \nspecial interest spending items that fill most of our bills. Americans \nalso know that these earmarks are at the center of most of the waste \nand corruption in Washington. They know money in the form of earmarks \nis the easiest favor a lawmaker can deliver to a special interest. They \nknow the explosion of earmarks in the last decade has turned Congress \ninto a giant favor factory that turns out favors for special interests, \nnot for the American people.\n  The Associated Press ran a fascinating article this morning entitled \n``Earmarks Prove Popular and Dangerous.'' The article talks about how \nearmarks have been at the center of corruption in this town, yet \nMembers of Congress continue to embrace earmarks and will do whatever \nit takes to keep them in the shadows away from public scrutiny.\n  The article says:\n\n       Even the imprisonment of lobbyists Jack Abramoff and former \n     [Representative] Duke Cunningham . . . on corruption charges \n     that included earmark abuses has not dulled lawmakers' \n     appetite for pet projects. One recent study found that \n     earmarks in House legislation went from 3,000 in 1996 to \n     15,000 in 2005.\n\n  The article highlights that earmark disclosure is at the center of \nthe debate on the so-called ethics bill before us today. It concludes \nby predicting there will not be enough Senators voting today to restore \ntrue earmark reform in this bill. That may be true, but I hope it is \nnot the case.\n  This bill as it is currently written is a fraud. It is business as \nusual dressed up like ethics reform. And it is a stunning \ndisappointment and a huge missed opportunity. It completely guts \nearmark rules we all agreed to back in January and allows us to \ncontinue to add secret earmarks to our bills. Even worse, it allows \nMembers of this body to steer millions of tax dollars to themselves and \ntheir families. Yet the bill has the title of ``ethics reform,'' so \nmany are going to support it so they can have a sound bite during their \nelection.\n  This is not really a big surprise. Even though the Democratic \nleadership campaigned on cleaning up the culture of corruption in \nWashington, it has never been committed to cleaning up the culture of \nearmarks. The first version of this bill which came to the floor in \nJanuary was so inadequate in how it dealt with earmarks, it only \ncovered 5 percent of all the earmarks. The authors of this bill thought \nthey could get away with saying they were providing earmark \ntransparency without actually doing it.\n  Fortunately, after a lot of public pressure was applied, we were able \nto come together in a bipartisan way to fix this problem and bring \nevery earmark out into the light of day. The rule we all agreed to not \nonly disclosed all earmarks, but it also gave every Senator the ability \nto hold the committees accountable if the American people do not get \nthe transparency they deserve.\n  I thought the Democratic leadership had realized the importance of \nthese reforms, so when the appropriations season began and earmarks \nstarted to be added to our bills, I sought consent from my colleagues \nto formally enact these rules so we could be true to our word and \nensure honest, full earmark disclosure. But, as my colleagues know, the \nDemocratic leadership objected to real earmark reform. In fact, they \nobjected on March 29, April 17, June 28, July 9, and July 17--five \ntimes in over what has now been 196 days since these earmark rules were \npassed in January. When it comes to true earmark reform, we have heard \nnothing but excuses and seen nothing but obstruction.\n  The majority leader wanted to take this bill to conference with the \nHouse back in June so he could kill earmark reform behind closed doors \nand share the blame with Republicans. I asked him if he would pledge to \npreserve earmark rules we all agreed to, but he said he could not give \nme that assurance. He left me no choice but to object to conferencing \nthis bill with the House.\n  Now the rule is back before us. It has been rewritten in secret by \nthe majority leader and the Speaker of the House, and they did exactly \nwhat I was afraid of--they killed earmark reform, only this time they \ncannot blame this on anyone but themselves.\n  For some reason, the Democratic leadership does not understand the \nimportance of this issue. They talk a lot about the culture of \ncorruption, but when it comes to reining in the most corrupting \npractice in Washington,\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\nwhich is earmarking, they only offer lip service.\n  My colleagues should remember that it was the practice of trading \nearmarks for bribes that has been at the heart of the corruption \nscandals here in Washington. Let me say that again because it is very \nimportant. We had and still have a process in place that allows Members \nof this body to trade the public trust for personal gain.\n  Former Congressman Duke Cunningham was the master at this. He knew \nthe oversight of his activities was so lax that he kept his own earmark \n``bribe menu.'' He knew the House and the Senate were not going to \npolice his colleagues and that the earmark process would give them the \nability to steer millions of dollars to his friends who were bribing \nhim. The document that charged Duke Cunningham outlined very clearly \nwhat he was doing, and I quote:\n\n       Under the very seal of the United States Congress, \n     Cunningham placed this nation's governance up for sale to a \n     defense contractor--detailing the amount of bribes necessary \n     to obtain varying levels of defense appropriations.\n\n  Or earmarks.\n\n       In this ``broad menu,'' the left column represented the \n     millions in government contracts that could be ``ordered'' \n     from Cunningham. The right column was the amount of the \n     bribes that the Congressman was demanding in exchange for the \n     contracts.\n\n  The bill we are considering does nothing to stop the earmark factory. \nThis so-called ethics bill does not actually require the Senate to \ndisclose every earmark. All it requires is the chairman of the relevant \ncommittee or the majority leader to tell us they have disclosed every \nearmark. It does nothing to guarantee that earmarks are actually \ndisclosed, and it is therefore unenforceable.\n  The rule we all agreed to in January that put the Senate \nParliamentarian in charge of enforcing this rule has been changed. The \nParliamentarian is a nonpartisan referee who works for all Senators, \nbut this bill puts him on the sidelines. It allows the chairman of the \ncommittee and the majority leader--two of the most ardent supporters of \nearmarks and the two people least likely to object to one of their own \nbills--in charge of enforcing earmark disclosure. This allows the fox \nto guard the henhouse, and it makes a joke of ethics reform.\n  This is clearly a sham, and it is a total shame. It has been \nconfirmed by the Senate Parliamentarian and the Congressional Research \nService. A memo prepared by CRS states:\n\n       If a point of order is raised under the new rule, it \n     appears that the Chair presumably would base his or her \n     ruling only on whether or not the certification has been \n     made, and not on the contents of the available lists or \n     charts, including the accuracy or completeness of this \n     information.\n\n  Mr. President, this has also been confirmed by the Senate \nParliamentarian, who says he would not be able to ensure full earmark \ndisclosure.\n  I hope my colleagues understand what is going on here. The lists of \nearmarks may only include the ones the Appropriations Committee thinks \nwe should know about. If their certification is inadequate and leaves \nout 95 percent of the earmarks--like they wanted to do earlier this \nyear--the new rule does not give Senators the ability to raise a point \nof order to require full earmark disclosure.\n  But this is not some theory of what could happen. We know without a \ndoubt that secret earmarks will continue because this Democratic leader \nand Appropriations chairman are already hiding secret earmarks while \nclaiming to be in full compliance with the rule. The nonpartisan \nGovernment watchdog group, Taxpayers for Commonsense, has already \ndiscovered $7.5 billion in undisclosed earmarks this year, while we are \nsupposedly operating under this rule.\n  There are several other loopholes in this bill that allow secret \nearmarks. It allows Senators to trade earmarks for votes. It allows \nSenators to provide earmarks that financially benefit themselves or \ntheir families. It still allows Senators to drop earmarks into bills \nwhen they are in conference and cannot be fully debated or voted on. It \nallows Senators to get around disclosing earmarks on the Internet in a \ntimely way. And it allows Senators to avoid having to put their no-\nconflict certification letter on the Internet in a timely way.\n  This so-called ethics bill is a fraud. The majority leader and some \nof the supporters of this bill want to tell the American people they \nhave fixed the secret earmark problem when they have actually codified \nthe status quo. This bill is actually worse than doing nothing because \nit preserves business as usual while trying to fool people into \nthinking everything has been fixed.\n  I also want to read something that was sent out by nationally \nsyndicated columnist Robert Novak which explains why Republicans are \nnot innocent either. He wrote:\n\n       Yet neither the prospect of several Republicans going to \n     prison nor the disastrous loss of the 2006 election has \n     weakened the party's embrace of the earmark model they ran \n     from while holding the majority, in which each congressman \n     provides for his district or state according to the New Deal \n     model of ``Tax, tax! Spend, spend! Elect, elect!''\n\n  Mr. President, Democrats wrote this shameful earmark rule, and they \nwill have to take responsibility for that. But Republicans have a \nresponsibility to stop it. Republicans need to learn their lesson from \nthe last election and, at the very least, shine some light on the \nearmarking process.\n  I do not know if we will win the vote this morning, but I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose cloture so we can restore the earmark transparency \nrules we all agreed to in January. This would be an easy fix. It could \nbe done in a matter of minutes. This bill could be quickly sent back to \nthe House for its approval and then on to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Earmarks are where most of the corruption has come from. It is \ndirecting money in return for some favor. If we are not willing to \nhonestly reform this process with this bill, then it will not solve the \nproblem it claims to solve. It will make it worse.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized \nunder a previous order for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the members of the \nRules Committee, particularly Chairman Dianne Feinstein. This is \nlandmark legislation. We have had groups that have been watchdogs over \nthe Congress, that have been the first to complain when there are \nethical lapses, that have weighed in and said this bill can make a \ndifference.\n  It was not easy, trust me. Members of the Senate and Members of the \nHouse--many of them--resisted the changes that are included in this \nbill. But Senator Feinstein was given the authority and the \nresponsibility to come up with a bill that is going to literally change \nthe climate and the way we do business here on Capitol Hill, and she \ndid it. I thank her for her leadership.\n  New transparency for lobbying activities; a strong lobbyist gift ban; \nlimits on privately funded travel; restrictions on corporate flights; \nstrong revolving-door restrictions; expanding public disclosure of \nlobbyist activities; ending the infamous K Street Project, which, \nunfortunately, for a long time was just acceptable conduct under the \nprevious party's control of Congress; and congressional pension \naccountability--all of these are dramatic changes.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has focused on the issue of earmarks. \nI have been fortunate, in the House and the Senate, to have served on \nappropriations committees. I chair one of those subcommittees now. I \nwant to tell you that the Senator from South Carolina has, \nunfortunately, misrepresented what this bill does. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina can, undoubtedly, remember when I offered an amendment \non the floor, which he supported, which said we could not even proceed \nto an appropriations spending bill until we had posted on the Internet, \nfor the world to see, every single congressional earmark in the bill 48 \nhours in advance. That is the type of disclosure which has never \noccurred on Capitol Hill, and it means that not only will the members \nof the committee and those who bring the bill to the floor be held \naccountable, but every person requesting an earmark--every Senator--\nwill have to put their name next to the earmark request. I have just \ngone through this again. I think it is the right thing to do--full \ndisclosure, full transparency, nothing to hide.\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\n  The situations that led to the imprisonment of Members of the House \nand lobbyists were these secret earmarks that popped up in the dead of \nnight and people did not know what they meant. Change a comma here or \nput a semicolon there, and all of a sudden millions of dollars were \nflowing to favored clients of some lobbyist. Well, there is a \nCongressman from California who is now in jail for that, and there is a \nlobbyist in jail for it as well. Let me tell you, that era of secrecy \nin earmarks is over. It is over. Forty-eight hours before the bill \ncomes to the floor, the whole world can take a look at it. And if you \nfailed to put the earmarks in that disclosure, you are subject to a \npoint of order.\n  Now, who rules on a point of order here? It is the gentleman sitting \nin front of the Presiding Officer. He is the Parliamentarian. We turn \nto him and say: All right, was there full disclosure of the earmarks in \nthe bill? And he rules one way or the other. He doesn't have a dog in \nthis fight. He works for both political parties. That is the way it \nshould be. This is going to be an independent judgment as to these \nearmarks and whether there is full disclosure.\n\n  What about conflicts of interest between Senators and those who are \nrequesting these disclosures? We have to file--each Senator, asking for \nan earmark for a project at home, has to file a statement on the record \nthat we have no personal or pecuniary interest in this earmark we are \nrequesting. That didn't occur before. That didn't occur before this \nCongressman went to jail and before this lobbyist went to jail. This is \na dramatic change, and that disclosure--that denial of any kind of \nconflict of interest, or I should say acceptance that we won't have any \nconflict of interest, is public record. It is there to be seen. If \nsomeone violates it, they have made this statement to the committee, it \nhas been disclosed to the public, and the whole earmark is there for \nthe world to see. It is a level of transparency and disclosure which we \nhave never had before.\n  What troubles me the most about the criticism of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is that he is arguing that the writing of this bill was \ndone ``behind closed doors, in secret.'' Well, there was an opportunity \nto take this bill to a conference committee. That is when House and \nSenate Members sit in a room at a table, work out their differences, in \npublic, so that the press and the world can hear the deliberations and \nsee the changes that are made. When we came to the floor and asked for \nthat conference committee so the world could see the whole process, one \nSenator got up and objected. Does anyone want to guess which one? The \nSenator from South Carolina who just gave the speech this morning about \nthe secrecy of this process. He can't have it both ways. He cannot \nobject to a conference committee which is open and public, and then \nwhen the conference committee doesn't occur, object to what follows. We \nhad no choice but to work out this bill and bring it to be considered \nby the House and the Senate.\n  So how did this bill fare on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives that was hit so hard by this culture of corruption and \nethical scandals? The final vote was 411 to 8, a bipartisan vote on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives for this ethical reform, and now \nwe hear from the Senator from South Carolina that somehow we have \nstacked the deck on the Democratic side. That wasn't reflected in the \nHouse vote.\n  Many of his Republican colleagues realize, as we do, that as painful \nas this is, it is necessary. If we don't have the trust of the American \npeople when it comes to the business we do, then, frankly, many of us \nwho have dedicated our lives to public service are going to be the \nlesser for it. For all this hard work and all the time we put in, \npeople will always be suspicious: Is that Senator voting for that \nproject because his brother-in-law works there or something? Well, that \nis going to end with this reform.\n  The Senator from South Carolina may have wanted more. He may have \nwanted to do it differently. That is his right. He is a Senator from a \nState, and he has that right, but he has to be honest and acknowledge \nthat what we have done here is significant change. In the 5 years he \nwas serving over in the House of Representatives, he didn't suggest \nthat the Republican majority change their earmark process, ever. We \ncan't find one single instance when he went to the floor of the House \nand argued for earmark reform when his party was in the majority. Now \nthat the Democrats are in the majority, he has become outspoken on this \nissue. That, again, is his right to do so. I welcome it. I will say, \nconceding to the Senator from South Carolina, you have forced some \nvaluable change in this process. You should take credit for that. But \nto stand here now and tell us this work product is not real reform \nflies in the face of comments made by people who have been working for \nreform in Congress for decades.\n  They believe this is landmark legislation. To put a 48-hour \ndisclosure--48-hour disclosure--before we can even take up a bill, to \nput it on the Internet for everyone to see is a level of transparency \nnever before seen in the Halls of Congress in our entire history. It \nnever took place. That is a significant change. It is a change which I \nthink moves us in the right direction.\n  Let me say a word about earmarks because there is a lot of comment \nabout Members of Congress earmarking money on special projects. The \nbill I just completed, the financial services bill, we took a look at \nearmarks. Do you know what it turned out? It turned out the earmarks by \nthe President of the United States were two or three times larger than \nany requested earmarks by Members of Congress. And there are no \nrequirements under our rules that the administration say there is no \npecuniary conflict of interest, no disclosure of 48 hours in advance. \nThey put them in the bill.\n  But when it comes to Members of Congress, we have changed those \nrules, in my subcommittee and in other appropriations committees, and \nit will also apply to tax bills as well. Give me the power to change \nthe punctuation in the Tax Code, and I can make a lot of people happy \nin a hurry.\n  So we want to get down to the real business and make sure that \nwhether the earmark is in an appropriations bill or a tax bill, the \nAmerican people see it from the start, and then they decide. When I run \nfor reelection, my opponent--and I am certain the press--will scour \nthrough things I have asked for to see if they can be justified. If \nthey find something they question, I am going to have to answer that \nquestion. We make that much easier for the public and for the press to \nget to the bottom of it.\n  I would say to my colleague from the State of South Carolina, by \nending the K Street Project, by restricting lobbyist activities, by \nadding dramatic transparency to the Senate rules, we are seeing more \nreform in this bill than at any time in the history of the Senate or \nthe House. How did we reach this point? Out of embarrassment--\nembarrassment over a culture of corruption that overtook many of the \nactivities of Congress over the last few years. People have gone to \njail. They have paid a heavy price. There have been embarrassments, and \nI am sure a lot of sadness in many families. But the bottom line is, we \nhave kept our word that this bill, through real reform, and that will \nmake a difference in the way we do business, is going to be passed.\n  I sincerely hope that an overwhelming, bipartisan majority will \nsupport this reform, this rules change when it comes before us today.\n  If one Senator or any group of Senators is successful in stopping \nthis reform of the rules, this reform of ethics, then they better go \nhome and answer to their constituents. When you pick up the morning \npaper, you know America is counting on us to do the right thing, and I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority whip has expired.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois, but I \ndo have to clarify the facts because his representation of this bill \nhas actually been an obvious misrepresentation. He has said if they \ncertify that all the earmarks have been reported 48 hours in advance, \nand we have verified that family members have no interest in it, that \nwe can challenge that if we don't believe it is true--but we can't \nchallenge those facts.\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\n  I would like to ask the Parliamentarian at this point to confirm that \nbecause the way the sleight of hand is worked in this bill is, I can no \nlonger object to the accuracy of the certification. I will just have to \nobject to whether or not it has been certified.\n  I ask the Parliamentarian this specific question: If a point of order \nis raised under the earmark disclosure rule in this bill, would the \nChair--through the Parliamentarian--be permitted to verify the \ncompleteness and accuracy of the disclosure, or would the Chair be \nrequired to only recognize whether a certification has been made by the \nchairman or majority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is required to only recognize \nwhether a certification has been made by the chairman or the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I just want to explain to my colleagues \nthat is the crux of this issue. If the accuracy makes no difference--as \nit hasn't this year when we have gotten certification of disclosure or \nverification there has been no conflict of interest--if all that has to \nhappen to comply with this rule is the majority leader or the chairman \nof the committee to say it has been complied with, and if I contest it, \nthat I have no standing because it has been certified, that the \nParliamentarian has been sidelined on this issue and can no longer \nverify whether it is true or accurate, what we have done is created \nthis sham of disclosure that can be covered up by one Member of the \nSenate. That is why I call it a fraud. That is why I call it a sham. We \nhave put all the language in here, except we have allowed it all to be \nwaived by one Member of the Senate. This is not ethics reform at all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment \naside.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2506 and ask that \nit be adopted.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would just like to advise my colleagues \nthat the majority has just objected to adopting the DeMint amendment \nfor earmark reform that has been gutted in this rule. This is all we \nhave been asking for throughout the process, that we put in this ethics \nbill the exact same language we all voted on that was written by \nSpeaker Pelosi, rewritten by Senator Durbin, and has been gutted in \nthis process, and it is still being called earmark reform. The \nParliamentarian has just confirmed for us and the world that the \ncertification is a complete sham.\n  I thank the President, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I applaud the good work of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina in pointing out the defects in this bill. I know he \nhas been criticized for exercising his rights as a U.S. Senator to \nobject to a unanimous consent request that the bill go to conference \ncommittee where, as we all know, Republicans and Democrats would \nordinarily sit down together and work out a compromise and would then \ncome back to the floor for a vote. But as a result of the process \nemployed by the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and the Speaker \nof the House, Speaker Pelosi, Republicans have had no opportunity to \nhave any impact whatsoever on the final language of this bill. The only \ntime we will have a chance to voice our views on this bill will be the \nvote that is coming up now.\n  So make no mistake about it, the bill we will be voting on is not the \nproduct of bipartisan negotiations; it is exclusively the act of the \nDemocratic majority. I think only time will tell whether this bill \noperates as advertised or whether, as the Senator from South Carolina \npoints out, it is a complete sham, perhaps presenting a patina or a \nthin veneer of reform, when, in fact, it really is rotten to the core \nbecause of the fact that business as usual will continue to be carried \non here when it comes to the nondisclosure of the appropriation of \nFederal tax dollars for special purposes.\n\n\n                   Reporting of Bundled Contributions\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one of the most important provisions \ncontained in S. 1 when it first passed the Senate in January was an \namendment offered by the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, to \nrequire lobbyists to report on a quarterly basis the campaign \ncontributions that they collected or arranged for Members of Congress. \nI was the primary cosponsor of that amendment. The activity the \namendment covered is often called ``bundling.'' S. 1, as passed by the \nSenate, also required lobbyists to report on fundraisers that they host \nor cohost.\n  I am very pleased that the final bill maintains the requirement that \nthis information be disclosed. It is important to note, however, that \nan agreement was reached to move the duty to report this information \nfrom the lobbyists to campaigns, in part to protect Members from \nunfounded allegations that lobbyists had raised political contributions \nfor them when they actually had not. I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Illinois, who worked hard to make sure that a bundling provision \nwas included in the final bill, if section 204 of the bill is designed \nto capture the same kind of activity that the Obama amendment covered--\nlobbyists' bundling of contributions and hosting of fundraisers for \nFederal candidates?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I respond to my friend from Wisconsin that \nthat is, indeed, the case. The bill requires candidate committees, \npolitical party committees, and leadership PACs to report contributions \nbundled by lobbyists if those contributions total more than $15,000 in \na 6-month period. Persons whose bundling has to be reported include \nindividuals, lobbying firms, or lobbying organizations registered or \nlisted on registrations filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and \npolitical committees established or administered by each registrant or \nindividual listed lobbyist. These persons also include any agent acting \non behalf of a registered lobbyist, lobbying firm, or lobbying \norganization. Thus, if the CEO of a lobbying organization is raising \nmoney as an agent of the organization, his activities are covered by \nthe legislation and must be reported. But employees of a lobbying \norganization, including a CEO, who are not lobbyists listed on the \norganization's lobbying disclosure reports are not covered, unless they \nare acting as agents for the organization.\n  The definition of bundled contributions includes contributions (i) \n``forwarded from the contributor or contributors to the committee'' and \n(ii) contributions ``received by the committee from a contributor or \ncontributors, but credited by the committee or candidate involved . . . \nto the [lobbyist] through records, designations, or other means of \nrecognizing that a certain amount of money has been raised by the \n[lobbyist].''\n  Part (i) of the definition means that any contributions that are \nphysically handled by the lobbyist and are transferred, delivered, or \nsent to a campaign are considered to be bundled. But in addition, under \npart (ii), if contributions sent directly to a campaign by the \ncontributors are ``credited'' to the lobbyist, they are also bundled. \nThe ``credit'' doesn't have to be written or recorded because the \ndefinition includes ``other means of recognizing that a certain amount \nof money has been raised.'' So if a lobbyist tells a candidate that he \nhas raised a certain amount of money for the campaign, the lobbyist \nshould be credited with that amount of fundraising, and the bundling \nmust be reported, assuming, of course, that the threshold amount of \ncontributions is met within the 6-month period. This was what we were \ntrying to get at in the amendment that passed the Senate in January--to \ncover contributions that were physically collected by a lobbyist and \ntransferred to a campaign, contributions that were formally recorded by \na campaign as having been raised by a lobbyist, and contributions that \na candidate or a campaign was aware had been raised by a lobbyist.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree with that. With respect specifically to \nfundraisers hosted or cohosted by lobbyists, my view is that virtually \nall such events would be covered by this provision. Is\n\n[[Page S10699]]\n\nthat how the Senator from Illinois sees it as well?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Yes, I agree with that view. At many fundraisers, the host \nof the event collects the checks and gives them to a representative of \nthe campaign. So that would be covered because the contributions have \nbeen ``forwarded'' to the campaign. But at some events, a \nrepresentative of the campaign, or even the candidate, physically \nreceives checks directly from contributors as they arrive or leave, and \nof course, some checks may be sent in afterward. In that case, the \ncampaign knows the total amount raised, and knows the lobbyist who \nhosted the fundraiser is responsible for those contributions. Even if \nno formal records are kept about the money raised at the event, \nalthough most campaigns obviously do keep such records, the campaign \nhas credited the lobbyist with that fundraising and it must be \nreported, as long as the threshold amount is met.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is my understanding as well of section 204. It \nrequires, however, that a candidate or campaign know that a lobbyist \nhas raised a certain amount of money, not that they are just generally \naware that the lobbyist has been fundraising for the campaign.\n  And it should be understood as well that the term ``raised'' in \nsection 204 includes but is broader than the term ``solicited,'' which \nis defined in the FEC regulations issued to implement the campaign \nfinance laws. For example, even if a lobbyist does not make a \nsolicitation for a contribution, as the term ``solicit'' has been \ndefined in FEC regulations, the lobbyist will still have ``raised'' a \ncontribution if the lobbyist facilitated the contribution by hosting or \ncohosting a fundraising event that brought in the contribution.\n  Mr. OBAMA. That brings up a question that I wanted to clarify. In a \nsituation when a fundraising event is cohosted by a number of different \nlobbyists, I am concerned that some might want to avoid reporting \nbundled contributions by dividing up the total receipts of a \nfundraising event among many sponsors or cohosts of the event. \nCertainly, that was not our intention. Does my friend from Wisconsin \nagree with me?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, the purpose of the bundling reporting provision is \nto get as much disclosure as possible of bundling by lobbyists. In the \nprovision, we have specifically asked the FEC to keep that purpose in \nmind as it promulgates regulations. The bill requires a committee to \nreport ``each person'' who ``provided 2 or more bundled contributions'' \nin excess of the ``applicable threshold,'' which is an aggregate amount \nof $15,000 in a 6-month period. When two or more lobbyists are jointly \ninvolved in providing the same bundled contributions--as, for instance, \nin the case of a fundraising event co-hosted by two or more lobbyists--\nthen each lobbyist is responsible for and should be treated as \nproviding the total amount raised at the event, for purposes of \napplying the applicable threshold to the funds raised by that lobbyist, \nand for purposes of reporting by the committee of ``the aggregate \namount'' of bundled contributions ``provided by each'' registered \nlobbyist ``during the covered period.''\n  It would be acceptable, of course, to report that certain funds were \nraised jointly in a single event so that by crediting each of the \nlobbyists involved with the total amount and reporting each lobbyist on \nthe new schedule, the campaign does not suggest that the total amount \nof contributions bundled is far greater than the amount actually \nraised. But a campaign should not be able to avoid disclosing, for \nexample, that three lobbyists raised $30,000 in a single fundraiser by \nclaiming that each lobbyist has been credited with only one-third of \nthe total amount. If this evasion were allowed, reporting for any \nfundraising event could be avoided simply by adding enough lobbyist \ncohosts for the event so that all of the lobbyists fall below the \nthreshold. We certainly did not intend that result.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I appreciate the explanations and \nclarifications offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. The provision in \nthe bill is aimed at requiring the disclosure of bundling, not \nprohibiting bundling. It must be broadly interpreted by the Federal \nElection Commission, consistent with its purpose. Indeed, section 204 \nspecifically directs the FEC ``to provide for the broadest possible \ndisclosure'' of bundling activities.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree. The Commission should not allow evasion or \ngame playing of any kind, by campaigns, candidates, or lobbyists, to \navoid reporting the activities of lobbyists. Section 204, the bundled \ncontributions reporting section, along with section 203, which requires \nreports of campaign contributions and other payments by lobbyists \nthemselves, is about giving information to the American people about \nhow lobbyists provide financial assistance to Members of Congress and \ncandidates. This information will allow the public to understand much \nbetter how Washington works. I congratulate the Senator from Illinois \nfor successfully seeing his amendment through the process and into the \nfinal bill.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I commend my good friend from Wisconsin for his leadership \non this issue. He has championed ethics and lobbying reform for many \nyears, and he deserves much of the credit for the crafting of this \nimportant bill.\n\n\n                    Limited Tax and Tariff Benefits\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nFinance Committee a question regarding the implementation of the \nprovisions of the ethics reform bill as they apply to limited tax and \ntariff benefits. This legislation establishes the principle that the \nMembers of this body and the American people at large should have full \ndisclosure of the source and beneficiaries of legislative provisions \nthat are directed to benefit a limited number of people or entities. \nThe disclosure requirement would apply to limited tax and tariff \nbenefits as well as to congressionally directed appropriations.\n  Specifically, the new rule states that it shall not be in order to \nvote on a motion to proceed to consider a bill or joint resolution \nunless the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction or the majority \nleader or his or her designee certifies that each limited tax or tariff \nbenefit, if any, has been identified; that the Senator who submitted \nthe request for such item has been identified; and that this \ninformation has been available on a publicly accessible congressional \nWeb site in a searchable format at least 48 hours before such vote.\n  For the purpose of implementing this requirement, a ``limited tax \nbenefit'' is defined as a revenue provision that ``(A) provides a \nFederal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to a particular \nbeneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries under the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986; and (B) contains eligibility criteria that are \nnot uniform in application with respect to potential beneficiaries of \nsuch provision.'' A ``limited tariff benefit'' is defined as ``a \nprovision modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States \nin a manner that benefits 10 or fewer entities.''\n  Under the rule, a Senator who requests a limited tax or tariff \nbenefit is required to provide a written statement to the chairman and \nranking member of the committee of jurisdiction, including, among other \nthings, the name of the Senator and ``in the case of a limited tax or \ntariff benefit, identification of the individual or entities reasonably \nanticipated to benefit, to the extent known to the Senator.'' It is the \nresponsibility of the requesting Senator to provide such information to \nthe chairman and ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction. The \nchairman will expect this information to be provided by the requesting \nSenator and will disclose this information to the public if a requested \nprovision is included in a bill in the chairman's jurisdiction.\n  The intent of this new rule is to ensure that any Senator who \nrequests a limited tax or tariff benefit discloses to the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee the identity of any individual \nor entities reasonably anticipated to benefit from the provision and \nthat the identity of the Senator who requested the provision and the \nidentity of the individual or entities reasonably anticipated to \nbenefit are made available on a publicly accessible congressional Web \nsite at least 48 hours before a vote on a motion to proceed to the \nmeasure that contains the provision. This disclosure applies when a \nlimited number of taxpayers receive a benefit from a provision and the \nbenefit is not uniformly available to other\n\n[[Page S10700]]\n\nsimilarly situated taxpayers solely because the provision does not \nencompass those other similarly situated taxpayers. Does the chairman \nagree with this understanding of the proposed rule?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, the Senator from Illinois has accurately described \nthe proposed rule and its intent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may inquire further, I would like to have a clear \nunderstanding of how the chairman will implement this rule. Once this \nrule is adopted, I expect that, as bills and joint resolutions that \ncontain tax or tariff provisions are brought to the Senate floor, the \nchairman will, before a vote on a motion to proceed to such a measure, \npublish a list of all limited tax or tariff benefits therein, \nidentifying each of these provisions, the Senator or Senators \nrequesting the provision, and the entities reasonably anticipated to \nbenefit, to the extent known to the requesting Senator.\n  Am I correct in my understanding that the chairman will make such \ninformation public for each tax or tariff provision in the measure that \nprovides a benefit to a limited group of beneficiaries where the \nprovision results in those beneficiaries being treated more \nadvantageously than entities that, in the absence of such a provision, \nwould be considered similarly situated with regard to the portion of \nthe Tax Code affected by the provision?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, I plan to provide such a list with regard to \nlegislation in my committee's jurisdiction.\n\n\n                   disclosure of limited tax benefits\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe ranking Republican member of the Finance Committee about language \nin this bill regarding the disclosure of limited tax benefits. The \nranking member and I have each been chairman of the committee in recent \nyears. And we try whenever possible to work together. And nowhere is \nthat more true than with regard to tax policy.\n  We have worked together to try to join in a policy about how to \ninterpret the provisions in this bill on limited tax benefits. We hope \nthat by explaining this joint policy now, we can help observers of the \ntax process to know how we intend to apply this new rule. I believe \nthat the policy that I am about to tribe reflects our jointly held \nviews.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the distinguished chairman, my friend from \nMontana, for initiating this important discussion. I would like to put \nthis discussion into a broader historical context. For over 20 years, \nchairmen of the Finance Committee have employed a practice of opposing \nnarrow tax provisions, commonly known as ``rifleshots.'' The \nlegislative change we will discuss in some detail is really a \nformalization of the practice the Finance Committee has maintained over \nthe past two decades.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from Iowa. And I agree.\n  So here is our view. We wish to clarify the operation of the proposed \nrule change related to limited tax benefits. We know that it is \nimpossible to foresee every possible application of the proposed \ndisclosure rule for limited tax benefits. But we hope that this \ndiscussion will provide a more complete explanation of how the rule \nwill operate.\n  For more guidance, we also recommend the interpretative guidelines \ndeveloped by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in response \nto the prior-law line item veto. These guidelines may also be \napplicable to the interpretation of the proposed earmark disclosure \nrules for limited tax benefits in this bill. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation documents are called, first, the ``Draft Analysis of Issues \nand Procedures for Implementation of Provisions Contained in the Line \nItem Veto Act, Public Law 104-130, relating to Limited Tax Benefits,'' \nthat's Joint Committee on Taxation document number JCX-48-96, and \nsecond, the ``Analysis of Provisions Contained in the Line Item Veto \nAct, Public Law 104-130, relating to Limited Tax Benefits,'' that's \nJoint Committee on Taxation document number JCS-1-97.\n  The proposed rule in this bill would require the disclosure of \nlimited tax benefits. It would define a limited tax benefit to mean any \nrevenue provision that, first, provides a Federal tax deduction, credit \nexclusion, or preference to a particular beneficiary or limited group \nof beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and second, \ncontains eligibility criteria that are not uniform in application with \nrespect to potential beneficiaries of such provision.\n  The proposed rule would apply in most cases where the number of \nbeneficiaries is 10 or fewer for a particular tax benefit. But the \nFinance Committee will not be bound by an arbitrary numerical limit \nsuch as ``10 or fewer.'' Rather, we will apply the standard \nappropriately within the unique circumstances of each proposal. For \nexample, if a proposal gave a tax benefit directed only to each of the \n11 head football coaches in the Big Ten Conference, we may conclude \nthat the rule would nonetheless require disclosure of this benefit, \neven though the number of beneficiaries would be more than 10.\n  We will not limit the application of the proposed rule to proposals \nthat result in a reduction in Federal receipts relative to the \napplicable present-law baseline. We believe that the proposed rule \nwould have application to limited tax benefits that provide a tax cut \nrelative to present law for certain beneficiaries, like, for example, a \ntax rate reduction for certain beneficiaries. But we also believe that \nthe rule would apply to limited tax benefits that provide a temporary \nor permanent tax benefit relative to a tax increase provided in the \nproposal, like, for example, exempting a limited group of beneficiaries \nfrom an otherwise applicable across-the board tax rate increase.\n  For example, a new tax credit for any National Basketball Association \nplayers who scored 100 points or more in a single game would be covered \nby the rule. And the rule would also cover a new income tax surtax on \nplayers in the National Hockey League that exempted from the new income \nsurtax any players who were exempted from the league's requirement that \nplayers wear helmets when on the ice.\n  The rule defines a beneficiary as a taxpayer; that is, a person \nliable for the payment of tax, who is entitled to the deduction, \ncredit, exclusion, or preference. Beneficiaries include entities that \nare liable for payroll tax, excise tax, and the tax on unrelated \nbusiness income on certain activities.\n  The rule does not define a beneficiary as the person bearing the \neconomic incidence of the tax. For example, in some instances, a \ntaxpayer may pass the economic incidence of a tax liability or tax \nbenefit to that taxpayer's customers or shareholders. The proposed rule \nwould look to the number of taxpayers. That number is easier to \nidentify than the number of persons who might bear the incidence of the \ntax.\n  In determining the number of beneficiaries of a tax benefit, we will \nuse rules similar to those used in the prior-law line item veto \nlegislation. For example, we will treat a related group of corporations \nas one beneficiary for these purposes. Without such a rule, a parent \ncorporation could avoid application of the disclosure rule by simply \ncreating a sufficient number of subsidiary corporations to avoid \nclassification as a limited tax benefit under the proposed rule.\n  For example, if a related group of corporations--like parent-\nsubsidiary corporations or brother-sister corporations--owns a football \nteam, then the related group will be considered one beneficiary. That \ntreatment is analogous to the team being one entity, not separate \nentities, like the coaching staff, offensive unit, defensive unit, \nspecialty unit, and practice squad.\n  The time period that we will use for measuring the existence of a \nlimited tax benefit will be the same time period that is used for \nBudget Act purposes. That is the current fiscal year and 10 succeeding \nfiscal years. Those are also all the fiscal years for which the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation staff regularly provide a revenue estimate.\n  For purposes of determining whether eligibility criteria are uniform \nin application with respect to potential beneficiaries of such a \nproposal, we will need to determine the class of potential \nbeneficiaries. In the case of a closed class of beneficiaries--for \nexample, all individuals who hit at least 755 career home-runs before \nJuly 2007--that class is not subject to interpretation, since only \nHenry Aaron satisfies this criteria. If, instead, the defined class of \nbeneficiaries is all individuals who hit at least 755 career home-runs, \nthen we will determine the class of potential beneficiaries by \nassessing the\n\n[[Page S10701]]\n\nlikelihood that others will join that class over the time period for \nmeasuring the existence of a limited tax benefit.\n  Whether the eligibility criteria are not uniform in application with \nrespect to potential beneficiaries will be a factual determination. To \ncontinue with the previous hypothetical, a proposal that provides a tax \nbenefit to all individuals who hit at least 755 career home-runs may \nstill not require disclosure if it is uniform in application. If the \nsame proposal is altered so as to exclude otherwise eligible career \nhome-run hitters who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates at some point in \ntheir career, then that kind of a limited tax benefit would require \ndisclosure under the proposed rule.\n  Some of the guidelines in the Joint Taxation Committee's reports \nnumbered JCX-48-96 and JCS-1-97 would not be directly applicable, but \nmay be helpful in determining the class of potential beneficiaries. For \nexample, the same industry, same activity, and same property rules \nmight provide useful analysis.\n  So that is how we propose to apply the new rule.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Baucus for taking the time today to \nshed some light on implementing the limited tax benefits standard. I \nlook forward to working with the chairman as we proceed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, while I support S. 1, I strongly oppose \nthe provision within it which will require members to fully reimburse \nprivate plane flights at so-called fair market value. This requirement \nis unnecessarily excessive for intrastate travel, it places an undue \nburden on Members from rural States, and its enactment will come at \ngreat expense to American taxpayers.\n   The Senate's current rule requires members to pay the cost of a \nfirst-class ticket any time we travel by private plane. In areas with \nno regularly scheduled air service, Members pay their proportionate \ncost of chartering the same or similar aircraft. This rule ensures that \nMembers pay the fair market value of traveling on such aircraft, while \nat the same time recognizing that private air travel is, at times, a \nnecessity. Because these flights often represent the only way to access \nrural areas, most Members who travel by private plane do so to complete \nofficial business.\n  While I understand the desire to stem the perception and practice of \nmembers traveling in lush private jets, in reality, traveling on these \ntypes of aircraft is the exception rather than the rule. In my home \nstate, my staff and I routinely travel in propeller and float planes. \nThese are not luxurious jets. If any Member believes differently, I \nwelcome them to travel with me as I traverse the State from \nTuntatooliak to Savoonga.\n   Alaska does not have the transportation infrastructure found in more \ndensely populated areas of the country. More than 70 percent of our \nState's towns and villages are not accessible by road year-round. We \nneed to fly in order to reach these remote communities. If a private \nplane with others aboard is going to the same village I am, I should be \nable to get on that plane at a reasonable price.\n   During initial consideration of S. 1 in January, Members of the \nSenate raised concerns regarding the impact that the revised travel \nrules had on their ability to meet with their constituents. That \nmeasure, as drafted, would not have affected lobbyists--it impacted \nreal people and prevented their elected representatives from responding \nto the issues they face. As such, I offered an amendment designed to \naddress the concerns of rural State Senators in ensuring their ability \nto continue to travel around their States. I declined to pursue the \namendment on the Senate floor when leadership on both sides of the \naisle agreed to consider this matter during conference.\n  Unfortunately, this matter was not addressed because of the Senate's \ninability to conference the legislation.\n   While other travel matters were addressed, such as permitting \nMembers to travel on their own planes or on the planes of their family \nmembers, the issue of rural transportation costs was not. Given this \nunfortunate circumstance, I have again introduced an amendment to \naddress this situation. My amendment would require travel on private \nplanes to be precleared by each Chamber's Ethics Committee to avoid \neven the appearance of a conflict of interest. It would also allow the \ncommittee to set and publicly disclose the rate we pay for each trip.\n  The private plane provision in S. 1 will not produce meaningful \nreform and will only increase the amount of money Members need from the \nTreasury to pay for these flights. Ultimately, it will be the taxpayer \nwho foots this bill, and the only real change will be more money in the \npockets of those who own and operate private planes.\n  A perfect example will come later this month, when a Cabinet \nSecretary and staff travel to Alaska. We plan to visit several western \nAlaska communities, and private plane is the only way to reach them in \na single day.\n  Under the Senate's current rule, each individual would pay their \nshare of the charter rate or an equivalent first-class fare. This rule \nis equitable: The operator of the flight would be paid a reasonable \nexpense for our travel.\n   Under S. 1, my staff and I would pay fair market value--the entire \nprice of the private plane. The Cabinet Secretary and their staff, \naccording to their department's rules, would also reimburse the company \nfor the costs associated with their travel. Any State and local \nofficials who travel with us will likewise be required to pay for their \nseats.\n   The end result of this legislation will be a windfall for companies \nand a travesty for taxpayers--the very opposite of intended effects. \nOur system needs transparency, not additional financial burdens for \nhard-working Americans.\n   I am told that another provision of this legislation may be of \ninterest to many Members of this Chamber--in fact, I may be the only \none it will not affect.\n   Section 601 of S. 1 will require a sitting President, or a \nPresident's campaign, to pay for Members who travel on Air Force One. \nThis provision will make campaigns even more expensive than they are \ntoday, and again do very little to increase transparency.\n   Lobbying reform is necessary, but it cannot harm our ability to do \nour jobs. Members should disclose flights on private planes, provide \nthe reasons for their travel, and receive approval from the Ethics \nCommittee prior to any travel. However, there is absolutely no reason \nwhy each seat should be paid for more than once. By requiring the \nreimbursement of private flights at fair market value, S. 1 will \nprevent many Members from serving their constituents effectively. While \nthe majority leader's interest in passing this legislation is \nunderstandable, the Senate should ensure it does not adversely impact \ntaxpayers. I urge my colleagues to consider these consequences and \nadopt my amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 1, the Legislative \nTransparency and Accountability Act of 2007. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure, which is the most sweeping reform of ethics and \nlobbying laws and rules in many years.\n  I am pleased that we have worked in a bipartisan fashion on ethics \nand lobbying reform. The American people made their views clear in last \nyear's election, and sent a strong message to Congress to clean up our \nact.\n  In January the Senate passed this legislation as our first order of \nbusiness by a vote of 96 to 2, and the House followed suit by a vote of \n411 to 8 earlier this week. I hope that the Senate will once again give \noverwhelming, bipartisan approval of this legislation, and send it to \nthe President for his signature into law.\n  I have been privileged to serve as a legislator--first in the \nMaryland House of Delegates, then in the United States House of \nRepresentatives, and now in the United States Senate. I appreciate the \ntrust that the people of Maryland placed in me. And I appreciate how \nimportant it is that we adhere to the strictest ethical standards. The \nAmerican people need to believe their Government is on the up and up.\n  The legislation represents a significant change in the way elected \nofficials, senior staff, and lobbyists would do business.\n  When it comes to how we treat ourselves, this legislation provides \nmuch greater transparency in earmarking. It requires that the sponsors \nof all earmarks, including limited tax and tariff benefits, that are \ninserted into bills\n\n[[Page S10702]]\n\nand conference reports be identified on the Internet at least 48 hours \nbefore a Senate vote. The bill requires Senators to certify that they \nand their immediate family members have no financial interest in the \nearmark. The bill also creates a point of order against new earmarks \nadded in conference reports for the first time.\n  When it comes to making how Congress works more transparent, the bill \nrequires conference reports to be available for public review on the \nInternet 48 hours before a Senate vote. It ends the practice of secret \nSenate holds which can kill legislation or nominations. It requires all \nSenate committees and subcommittees to post video recordings, audio \nrecordings, or transcripts of all public meetings on the Internet.\n  This legislation makes needed reforms to the lobbying industry as \nwell. The bill prohibits lobbyists and their clients from giving gifts, \nincluding free meals and tickets, to Senators and their staffs. It \nrequires Senators to pay charter rates for trips on private planes. The \nbill prohibits Senators and their staff from accepting multiday private \ntravel from registered lobbyists. It requires much greater transparency \nfor lobbyist bundling and political campaign fund activity. The bill \nrequires lobbyists' disclosure filings to be filed quarterly instead of \nsemiannually, and requires these disclosures to be filed electronically \nand in a publicly searchable Internet database. It increases civil and \ncriminal penalties for lobbyists who break the law.\n  The bill also takes major stops in slowing the revolving door between \nMembers of Congress, staff, and the private sector. It stops partisan \nattempts like the K Street Project to influence private-sector hiring. \nIt strengthens the revolving door restrictions by increasing the \ncooling off period for Senators from 1 to 2 years before they can lobby \nCongress, and prohibits senior Senate staff from lobbying contacts \nwithin the entire Senate for 1 year. It eliminates floor, parking, and \ngym privileges for former Members who become lobbyists.\n  Finally, the bill holds Members of Congress and staff accountable by \nmaking ongoing ethics training mandatory for Members and staff. It \nincreases civil and criminal penalties for Members of Congress and \nsenior staff who falsify or fail to report items on their financial \ndisclosure forms. It denies congressional retirement benefits to \nMembers of Congress who are convicted of serious crimes related to \ntheir official duties, such as bribery.\n  Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' famous dictum still \nholds true today: ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' \nThe leadership and Members of Congress will have delivered on their \npromise to the American people by passing this bill. That is what the \nAmerican people have asked us to do, and that is what we need to do to \nregain their trust.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2007. This bill has taken on many \nnames and many forms over the last year. While I am pleased to see this \nCongress at last addressing ethics issues, I am disappointed that the \nbill is being brought to the floor in this manner and in this form.\n  Last year, when I was chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the committee produced a bipartisan \nbill that the Senate passed in March 2006 by a vote of 90 to 8. That \nbill never became law, and as a result those issues were never \naddressed. But when Congress failed to take action, the American people \nstood up and sent a powerful message. The last election took place in \nthe shadow of far too many revelations of questionable--or downright \nillegal--conduct by Members of Congress. When we returned to Washington \nin January, the first priority of this Senate was to take steps to \nrestore the confidence of the American people in their Government.\n  It is unfortunate that we now find ourselves nearly 7 months later--\ntaking up yet another version of this bill with several provisions that \nare far weaker than they should be. In particular, I am disappointed \nthat in spite of a 98-0 Senate vote in favor of strong earmark \ndisclosure rules, the provision now before us is weak and riddled with \nloopholes. I cannot understand why the majority leadership has chosen \nto ignore the clearly expressed will of the Senate in this way.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention to the first page of this new bill, \nin which its purpose is stated as, ``To provide greater transparency in \nthe legislative process.'' This declaration--made without a trace of \nirony--belies the fact that this version of the bill was developed in \nclosed-door discussions between the majority leader of the Senate and \nthe Speaker of the House. Ethics is not an issue of the right or the \nleft, so why has the process of drafting ethics legislation suddenly \nbecome so partisan?\n  In spite of these reservations, I will support this bill because I \nbelieve that it does contain positive provisions that are long overdue. \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes is said to have once noted, ``Sunlight is \nthe best disinfectant,'' and this bill does bring sunlight into some of \nthe dark corners of the legislative process.\n  The bill requires more frequent filings under the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct, and more detailed disclosure of lobbyist activities in those \nreports. In addition, it makes that information readily available to \nthe public via the Internet.\n  The bill also contains a change to the Senate rules to eliminate, at \nlong last, the undemocratic practice of anonymous holds in the Senate. \nThe hallmark of this body should be free and open debate, and a process \nthat allows a secret hold to kill a bill without a word of debate on \nthe floor is antithetical to that principle.\n  The bill contains important provisions to slow the so-called \nrevolving door problem where Members of Congress and their senior \nstaffs leave Government jobs and then turn around to lobby the \ninstitution they once served.\n  These provisions--which I note, are substantially the same as those \nthat the Senate passed earlier this year--are a step forward in \nrestoring the American people's confidence in the integrity of their \nleadership.\n  In November 2006, the American people sent Congress a message that \nthey had lost faith in the integrity this institution. I will support \nthis bill because it takes a step forward in restoring the people's \nfaith in the work we do here, but unfortunately I am left to conclude \nthat had there been a better process, there would have been a better \nbill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act.\n  I have worked for many years to enact meaningful lobbying and ethics \nreform. In 1995, I helped lead the effort to pass the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act which helped to open up the world of lobbying, and the \nbillions of dollars spent in it, to the light of day. By requiring paid \nlobbyists to register and disclose whom they represent, how much they \nare paid, and the issues on which they are lobbying, this act was a \nreal step forward. A number of scandals over the past few years have \nillustrated the importance of taking these reforms a step further and \nthis bill does just that.\n  This bill includes much needed lobbying and ethics reforms, some of \nwhich I sought to include in the Lobbying Disclosure Act 12 years ago. \nIt includes provisions to ensure greater transparency and disclosure of \nlobbyist activities by requiring lobbyists to file their reports \nquarterly and electronically in an online, public, searchable database. \nThis bill requires lobbyists to disclose to the Federal Election \nCommission when they bundle or gather over $15,000 in campaign \ncontributions for any Federal elected official, candidate or political \naction committee. Additionally, lobbyists will be required to disclose \ntheir own campaign contributions as well as payments they make to \nPresidential libraries, inaugural committees or other organization \ncontrolled by or named for Members of Congress.\n  This bill also includes an important provision I authored to require \nreporting by foreign lobbyists. Foreign lobbyists file their \ndisclosures under the Foreign Agents Registry Act. The forms are \ndifficult to find and hard to understand. This bill will require a \npublicly accessible, electronic database containing FARA disclosures in \nthe same format that will be in place for registrants under the \nLobbying Disclosure Act.\n\n[[Page S10703]]\n\n  Also included is a strict ban on gifts from lobbyists or their \nclients to Members of Congress and congressional staff. These perks \nhave no place in Government and I am glad that this legislation will \neliminate them.\n  Strong travel restrictions are also an essential component of this \nbill. The new rules will ensure that Members traveling on corporate \njets would have to pay for them at the charter rate, not at the current \nlevel of a first class commercial ticket, which is but a fraction of \nthe cost.\n  This bill strengthens restrictions on lobbying for former Senators \nand former senior Senate staff by prohibiting Senators from lobbying \nCongress for 2 years after they leave office and prohibiting senior \nSenate staff from lobbying any Senate office for 1 year after leaving \nSenate employment. Also included is a provision that prohibits Members \nand their staff from influencing the hiring decision of private \norganizations in exchange for political access.\n  This bill strengthens penalties for Members of Congress who are \nconvicted of crimes that involve violations of the public trust by \nrevoking Federal retirement benefits. It also increases the penalties \nfor Members of Congress, senior staff and senior executive officials \nwho falsify or fail to file financial disclosure forms.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes earmark reforms to ensure \ntransparency in the legislative process. Requiring that earmarks \nincluded in bills and conference reports are available to the public on \nline will allow the average American the opportunity to know where \ntheir tax dollars are going and it is my hope that it will help ensure \nthe quality of the projects which are funded.\n  I commend my colleagues in both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate for working in a bipartisan way to pass this important \nlegislation. Though this bill is not perfect, it is a significant \nimprovement over current law. Some will continue to find ways to \ncircumvent it and undermine the safeguards we put in place. Standing \nfor honesty, openness and accountability in Government will forever be \nan unfinished task. We must continue to be aware of abuses and \nunderstand that further legislation may be necessary in the coming \nyears to ensure the integrity of the legislative process.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as elected representatives, I believe we \nmust hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards. The principle is \na simple one. I want to take this opportunity to express my \nappreciation to Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Lieberman and Chairman \nFeinstein for their work to keep that faith by increasing the ethical \nstandards of the Congress in the legislation that the Senate is \nconsidering today.\n  While not perfect, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of \n2007 will expand public disclosure of lobbyist activities, increase the \ntransparency of the congressional earmarking process, strengthen the \nexisting gift bans and ``cooling-off periods'' for Members of Congress \nand their staff, and prohibit Congress from attempting to influence \nemployment decisions in exchange for political access.\n  I very much appreciate the assistance of Majority Leader Reid, \nChairman Lieberman, and Senator Salazar in including a provision in \nthis legislation that will prohibit Members of Congress who are \nconvicted of serious ethics crimes such as bribery and fraud from \nreceiving Federal pensions. This provision, based on my amendment to \nthe Senate Ethics bill in January, which in turn was based on the \nCongressional Pension Accountability Act which I introduced with \nSenator Salazar, will go a long way toward rebuilding the trust of the \nAmerican people. Those who abuse the public trust shouldn't be allowed \nto exploit the Federal retirement system at taxpayer expense. That is \nsimply unacceptable and this legislation will finally change that \ninequity in the law.\n  We all remember just last year, when former Representative Randy \n``Duke'' Cunningham received the longest prison sentence ever imposed \non a former Member of Congress. His crime? He collected approximately \n$2.4 million in homes, yachts, antique furnishings and other bribes \nincluding a Rolls Royce from defense contractors. This disgraceful \nconduct a crime which lies beyond comprehension for honest, hardworking \nAmerican taxpayers has earned him 8 years and 4 months in a Federal \nprison and has required him to pay the Government $1.8 million in \npenalties and $1.85 million in ill-gotten gains.\n  Unfortunately, the American taxpayer will continue to pay his Federal \npension--a pension worth approximately $40,000 per year. Thanks to this \nlegislation, no longer will taxpayers' hard-earned dollars be used to \npay for the pensions of Members of Congress who are convicted of \nserious ethics abuses in the future.\n  I believe this legislation will significantly improve our Government \nby changing the way business is done and helping to ensure that \nCongress once again responds to the needs of our people, not special \ninterests.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the reauthorization \nof the State Children's Health Insurance Program. It is critically \nimportant that we continue and improve upon this successful effort that \nhas made a difference in the lives of so many children.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Baucus, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, as well as their \nstaffs, for the countless hours they have spent in order to bring this \nbipartisan compromise before us today.\n  Like all compromises, the bill is not perfect. I, along with several \nof my colleagues, voted for a budget resolution that included an \nadditional $50 billion for the reauthorization of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. I understand that fiscal constraints make it \ndifficult to fund a sum of that magnitude. But at the same time, no \ndollar spent to insure a child is wasted.\n\n\n                         History of the Program\n\n  I am proud to have supported this program since its inception in \n1997. At that time, there were too many working families who played by \nthe rules and could not afford health insurance for their children. \nThey had just a little too much to qualify for Medicaid or other \nGovernment programs, but not enough income to be able to afford the \npremiums that private insurance requires.\n  So a Republican Congress and a Democratic President came together to \ncreate the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has enjoyed a \ndecade of broad bipartisan support.\n  The success has been clear. Twenty-one percent of the children in \nCalifornia were uninsured when the Children's Health Insurance Program \nlaunched. Six years later, in 2005, that rate had fallen to 14 percent, \ndespite economic downturns, which commonly lead to increases in the \nnumber of uninsured.\n  It is now time for a Republican President and a Democratic Congress \nto come to together to allow this program to continue to fulfill its \npromise.\n\n\n                         Summary of Legislation\n\n  The bill we are considering today will allow this program's success \nto continue and make significant improvements. This legislation would:\n  Invest $35 billion to provide health insurance coverage to 3.2 \nmillion children who are currently uninsured. This will keep the 6.6 \nmillion children already enrolled in the program from losing coverage.\n  Give States the tools they need to find and enroll these uninsured \nchildren. Six million of the nine million uninsured children in the \nUnited States today are eligible for Medicaid, or they are eligible for \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. These families deserve to know \nthey are eligible for coverage, and they ought to receive it without \nunnecessary bureaucracy and additional paperwork.\n\n\n                          Tobacco Tax Increase\n\n  These improvements are funded with an increase in the Federal tobacco \ntax, to $1 per package of cigarettes. Not only will this increase fund \nneeded health insurance for children, it will create significant health \nimprovements.\n  We must be very clear about the serious implications of tobacco use. \nIt has to be understood that:\n  Tobacco is linked to at least 10 different kinds of cancer.\n  Tobacco use accounts for about 30 percent of all cancer deaths.\n  Tobacco use remains the top cause of preventable death in the United \nStates.\n  According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, this tax will \nprevent an additional 1,873,000 children alive\n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\ntoday from ever becoming smokers. And this prevents them from becoming \ncancer victims later in life. Of this I am certain.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have worked to make the eradication \nof cancer a top priority. I strongly believe that we can eliminate the \ndeath and suffering caused by cancer in my lifetime. I have worked with \nthe American Cancer Society, and the National Cancer Institute. I have \nspoken to leading cancer researchers, and patients and their families.\n  And over and over again, I have heard that tobacco is a leading cause \nof cancer.\n  There is much about cancer that we still do not understand and that \nwe cannot control. But the relationship between tobacco and cancer \ncould not be clearer.\n  The one thing we can do, immediately, to stop cancer deaths, is to \nreduce tobacco use. This legislation takes a step in that direction, \nwhile providing health coverage for children in the process.\n\n\n              Importance of health insurance for children\n\n  We know that when it comes to children, health insurance matters. It \ncan determine whether a child receives appropriate treatment, and even \nif he lives or dies. According to a Families USA study conducted this \nyear,\n  An uninsured child admitted to the hospital as the result of an \ninjury is twice as likely to die during his or her hospital stay than a \nchild with insurance.\n  Uninsured children admitted to the hospital with middle ear \ninfections are less than half as likely to get ear tubes inserted than \nchildren with insurance.\n  These are not rare occurrences. As any parent will attest, children \nget into plenty of accidents, and children get lots of ear infections. \nNo child should suffer a worse outcome because her parents could not \nafford health insurance.\n\n\n                   CHIP is not Government Health Care\n\n  Frankly, I am quite surprised that the Senate is not unanimously \nendorsing the compromise we have before us today. I was stunned when \nPresident Bush indicated he would veto it.\n  Unfortunately, some are attempting to use this debate to score \npolitical points, and in the process, are portraying the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program in an unfair light.\n  Let us be clear. The Children's Health Insurance Program is not \nGovernment-run health care. Doctors, nurses and parents still make \nmedical decisions. And in California, our Healthy Families program \nrelies on commercial managed care plans.\n  California offers 24 health plans, 6 dental plans, and 3 vision \nplans.\n  In fact, 99.72 percent of Californians in Healthy Families have a \nchoice between two health plans.\n  In four of our largest counties, families can choose between as many \nas seven plans.\n  Twenty-four different health plans in one State. That is certainly \nnot a form of ``socialized medicine.'' Many employers providing private \ninsurance cannot afford to give their workers more than one choice.\n  This legislation remains targeted at the children and families most \nin need of assistance. I am from San Francisco, one of the most \nexpensive cities in one of the most expensive States in the Nation. No \none will deny that it costs more to live in San Francisco than just \nabout any other place in the country. You spend more on groceries, more \non housing, more on transportation, and not surprisingly, more on \nhealth care. The California Association of Realtors estimates that in \norder to purchase the average entry level home in California, a family \nmust have a household income of over $96,000 per year.\n  Yet, with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii, we have a uniform \nFederal poverty level, which is $20,650 for a family of four. President \nBush insists that no family above twice this poverty level, or $41,300, \ncould possibly need additional help to afford health insurance. I \nstrongly disagree.\n  I would like to challenge anyone to support two children on $41,300 \nannual income in California, and find the $11,480 necessary to purchase \nthe average family insurance policy. It is nearly impossible. This is \nprecisely why we created the Children's Health Insurance Program 10 \nyears ago, to prevent hard-working families from falling through the \ncracks.\n  This legislation maintains the State flexibility necessary to do just \nthat.\n\n\n                           California Stories\n\n  As a mother and grandmother, I know that there are few things worse \nthan having a sick child. I cannot imagine the dilemma of a mother or \nfather who knows that their child needs medical attention, but must \nalso consider whether that treatment will have a catastrophic impact on \ntheir family's finances.\n  The Herman family from Sonoma County, CA, found themselves in this \nsituation, twice in 1 month. Daughter Amber Herman fell and hurt her \narm. Three-year-old Jacob shoved a rock in his ear during a family \ncamping trip. Parents Penny and Peter Herman are self-employed small \nbusiness owners, unable to afford private insurance.\n  The Hermans faced a $5000 out-of-pocket medical bill for their care. \nAnd Penny was pregnant with the couple's third child, Abraham. The \nfamily learned they were eligible for Healthy Families, and enrolled in \nthe program. Penny received coverage for her pregnancy from Medi-Cal. \nAll three children now have comprehensive health care coverage.\n  The Nunez family in Solano County, California never worried about \nhealth insurance; they were always covered under their father Pablo's \nunion health plan. Pablo started his own business and he, wife Sandra, \nand their four children lost their coverage. Through outreach efforts, \nthe family learned a few months later that their kids might qualify for \ncoverage. They did, and all four Nunez children were enrolled in \nHealthy Families before they had a health care emergency.\n  These stories show that a robust Children's Health Insurance Program, \ncoupled with good information and a straightforward enrollment process, \nmakes a real difference in the lives of countless families.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Without action, these children and many others will risk losing this \ninsurance coverage. It is my hope that the President will reconsider \nhis ill-advised veto threat and sign this bipartisan legislation into \nlaw. While the President may want to advance his own health care reform \nideas, it is not fair to hold millions of uninsured children hostage in \nthe process. I welcome a wide-ranging debate on how to reform our \nhealth care system, after this bill is signed and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is protected.\n  This is a successful bipartisan program. It must be reauthorized, and \nthe American people must make it clear to President Bush that they will \naccept no less.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the legislation before us today is labeled \nas an ethics and lobbying reform measure. Unfortunately, legislative \nlabels don't guarantee performance. Just calling a bill ``reform'' \ndoesn't guarantee it will improve the transparency of legislative \noperations so that the American people can better see what Congress is \ndoing and hold its representatives accountable for their actions.\n  In this case, I am troubled by the bill we are being asked to support \ntoday--a bill prepared without input from Republicans and outside the \nnormal bipartisan, consensus-building legislative procedures of the \nCongress.\n  While it contains a number of worthwhile provisions, I cannot agree \nthat it makes the kind of fundamental improvements that its label \npromises in a number of critical areas.\n  For example, there has been significant focus on how this bill would \nchange Senate rules concerning ``earmarks''--that is, congressionally \ndirected funding. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have \nbeen asked about earmarks and have talked frankly with my Idaho \nconstituents and others about this practice. I don't believe in secret \nearmarks and, in fact, on my Web site I have published a list of all \nthe earmarks I have secured in appropriations legislation since I have \nbeen a member of the committee, so that anybody can review them.\n  In my opinion, the so-called ``earmark reforms'' in this bill are \nmore likely to result in misleading people and gaming the process, \nrather than opening it up to public scrutiny.\n  There is more to the bill than its earmark provisions--there are \nother\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\nflawed provisions as well as worthwhile provisions. It is not unusual \nfor us to be asked to vote on a package including both provisions we \nagree with and those we don't. Sometimes we overlook the bad, if the \npackage on balance does more good than harm.\n  But it would be perverse indeed for me to sanction, with my vote, a \nmeasure that I believe will frustrate the very goal of ethics reform \nthat it is supposed to accomplish. I cannot pretend that the earmark \nprovisions or other flaws in this bill are unimportant. I cannot ignore \nthe real harm that some provisions of this bill will likely do. For \nthese reasons, I cannot support this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the bill before us contains, in section \n542, a provision to prohibit Senators from attending parties to honor \nthem at the national party conventions if those parties are paid for by \nlobbyists or organizations that employ or retain lobbyists. The \nprovision originated with an amendment that I offered to S. 1 when the \nSenate considered S. 1 at the beginning of the year. My amendment \npassed the Senate on January 17, 2007, by a vote of 89 to 5. I am \npleased that the final bill retains this provision and also contains in \nsection 305 a similar provision that will apply to Members of the House \nof Representatives. I wanted to take a minute to explain the purpose \nand operation of the provision and why I believe it was an important \naddition to the bill.\n  When the Senate adopted the Reid amendment in January to strengthen \nthe lobbyist gift ban, we took a huge step toward eliminating gifts to \nMembers of Congress from lobbyists and groups that lobby. The final \nbill retained that language, and it is one of the most significant \nprovisions in the bill. But it is important to remember that the \nlobbyist gift ban is subject to the same exceptions in the gift rule \nthat now apply. Some of these exceptions, like the personal friendship \nexception and the informational materials exception, are sensible and \nlimited. Others, particularly the widely attended event exception, \nsometimes allow items of great value to be given to Members. Over the \nnext few years, the Senate should look closely at whether lobbyists \nwill now flock to these exceptions in order to continue to give us \ngifts. We may need to revisit some of the exceptions in the future.\n  One application of the widely attended event exception needed to be \naddressed immediately. At the political party conventions, which many \nof us attend, lobbyists and groups that lobby have fine-tuned the \nwidely attended event exception and turned it into almost a competition \nover who can throw the most lavish, the most over-the-top, the most \nexcessive party in honor of a powerful Member of Congress. These \nparties have become huge gifts to the honored Members. Essentially they \nallow a Member to host a gigantic party, with an unlimited expense \naccount granted by the generous lobbyist sponsor.\n  Mr. President, I will ask to have a USA Today story about these \nparties at the Republican convention in 2004 printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  Here is how that story begins:\n\n       On Tuesday night, a few fortunate Republicans attending the \n     party's convention will have a chance to try on ``the most \n     exclusive and prestigious jewels in the world'' at the \n     Cartier Mansion on the edge of New York's Diamond District.\n       The point is not only to ``indulge yourself,'' as an \n     invitation says. It's also to honor a Republican congressman \n     from Texas, Henry Bonilla, at a cocktail reception under \n     chandeliers that sparkle almost as brightly as the diamonds \n     and emeralds beneath them.\n       The event is hosted by a group of Washington lobbyists who \n     hope to reinforce their ties with Bonilla, a powerful \n     chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee. It's but one \n     among more than 200 lavish parties being thrown this week by \n     corporations, lobbyists, trade groups and other interests \n     whose fortunes rise and fall on the actions of government \n     policymakers.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Bonilla is just one of many committee chairmen and members \n     of the House and Senate leadership who will be feted at what \n     may be the most expensive round of receptions, dinners, \n     concerts, golf outings and cruises ever at a political \n     convention.\n\n  The USA Today story lists some of the other parties. Let me quote \nagain from the article:\n\n       House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois was the honoree at \n     a reception Sunday afternoon sponsored by General Motors at \n     Tavern on the Green, a glittering Victorian gothic restaurant \n     on the edge of Central Park. The Distilled Spirits Council of \n     the United States threw a reception at the New York Yacht \n     Club for Rep. Thomas Reynolds of New York, chairman of the \n     party's House campaign committee. And AT, Chevron Texaco, \n     Target and Time Warner were among the sponsors of a martinis-\n     and-bowling night for House Rules Committee Chairman David \n     Dreier of California.\n       AT also is among the sponsors of a Tuesday ``Texas Honky \n     Tonk for Joe Barton,'' the Texas congressman who chairs the \n     House Energy and Commerce Committee. Barton's panel has wide \n     jurisdiction over telecommunications, health and energy. And \n     members of the House Financial Services and Senate Banking \n     committees will be toasted at Madame Tussaud's Tuesday night, \n     sponsored by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.\n\n  The conventions have thus become giant lobbying festivals. Everyone \nwho wants to get close to powerful Members of Congress is there, or at \nleast everyone with the money to spend on a lavish party honoring a \nMember.\n  Here is what one lobbyist said about these parties at the 2004 \nRepublican convention, according to USA Today:\n\n       ``The Republicans are the majority party. They run the \n     administration, they run the House, they run the Senate. So \n     anyone who wants to talk to them is there,'' says David \n     Hoppe, a lobbyist at the Washington firm Quinn Gillespie & \n     Associates. ``It is a good time to see people and establish \n     personal relationships.''\n\n  Another lobbyist commented about the importance of these types of \nevents as follows:\n\n       ``You go (to the convention) with a targeted plan of who \n     you need to see, and you can get a lot of work done,'' says \n     Scott Reed, a Republican lobbyist and political strategist. \n     Approaching policymakers in a social setting puts them more \n     at ease, he says, ``unlike in Washington, where you are \n     normally coming to ask a favor or to help get somebody out of \n     trouble.''\n\n  I don't know about my colleagues, but my stomach turns when I read an \narticle like this. And we all know that similar events take place at \nthe Democratic convention. The brazenness of these events as places \nwhere monied interests have special access to lawmakers is just \nshocking. We simply could not go back to our constituents and claim \ncredit for getting rid of gifts from lobbyists if we allowed these \nkinds of events to continue at the conventions. And so I offered my \namendment, and I am pleased that it was adopted in January and included \nas section 542 in the final bill.\n  Section 542 does not prohibit parties at the convention, but it does \nprohibit Senators from accepting free attendance at parties thrown in \ntheir honor at the conventions. If an industry group wants to throw a \nparty, fine, but they won't have a congressional guest of honor to use \nas a lure to get other lobbyists to pitch in and fund the party. And a \nSenator won't be able to accept a gift of hosting a huge party at the \nexpense of lobbyists and groups that lobby.\n  According to USA Today, these huge parties honoring Members date back \nto 1996, just a year after the gift ban was passed. They have increased \nin recent years, especially since the soft money ban we passed in 2002 \nprevents corporations from making huge contributions to the political \nparties. These convention events are one of the few ways that \ncorporations and the lobbyists they employ can show their loyalty to a \nMember of Congress in a big way. It is time that we close this brazen \nevasion of the spirit of the gift rules. I am pleased that section 305 \nand section 542 will do just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the USA Today article to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Lobbyists' Lure to GOP: `Indulge Yourself'\n\n                           (By Jim Drinkard)\n\n       New York.--On Tuesday night, a few fortunate Republicans \n     attending the party's convention will have a chance to try on \n     ``the most exclusive and prestigious jewels in the world'' at \n     the Cartier Mansion on the edge of New York's Diamond \n     District.\n       The point is not only to ``indulge yourself,'' as an \n     invitation says. It's also to honor a Republican congressman \n     from Texas, Henry Bonilla, at a cocktail reception under \n     chandeliers that sparkle almost as brightly as the diamonds \n     and emeralds beneath them.\n       The event is hosted by a group of Washington lobbyists who \n     hope to reinforce their ties with Bonilla, a powerful \n     chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee. It's but\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\n     one among more than 200 lavish parties being thrown this week \n     by corporations, lobbyists, trade groups and other interests \n     whose fortunes rise and fall on the actions of government \n     policymakers. They are taking advantage of New York's bounty \n     of interesting event sites, from the aircraft carrier USS \n     Intrepid to the 56th floor panorama of the Sky Club on Fifth \n     Avenue.\n       While similar events were held at the Democratic convention \n     in Boston last month, the New York partying will be more \n     purposeful for one reason: ``The Republicans are the majority \n     party. They run the administration, they run the House, they \n     run the Senate. So anyone who wants to talk to them is \n     there,'' says David Hoppe, a lobbyist at the Washington firm \n     Quinn Gillespie & Associates. ``It is a good time to see \n     people and establish personal relationships.''\n       Among the hosts for Bonilla's bash are the Wine Institute, \n     which represents California vintners; Christine Pellerin, a \n     former Bonilla aide who lobbies on appropriations matters; \n     and UST, whose tobacco and wine interests fall under the \n     jurisdiction of Bonilla's agriculture subcommittee. Bonilla \n     is just one of many committee chairmen and members of the \n     House and Senate leadership who will be feted at what may be \n     the most expensive round of receptions, dinners, concerts, \n     golf outings and cruises ever at a political convention.\n       ``The entry fee for participation has gone up \n     dramatically,'' says David Rehr, president of the National \n     Beer Wholesalers Association, who is contributing either beer \n     or money to help sponsor nine parties this week. To get \n     top billing as a sponsor for an elaborate event can cost \n     $100,000 or more; lower-level sponsorships are available \n     for $50,000 or $25,000.\n       Rehr attributes that at least in part to a new campaign-\n     finance law that bars corporations, unions and trade groups \n     from giving big checks known as ``soft money'' to the \n     political parties. Staging lavish parties ``is now the only \n     legitimate outlet for soft money,'' he says. ``People have \n     this pool of money and want visibility, or to show their \n     commitment or loyalty, and to advance the reputation of a \n     particular member (of Congress) or cause. So the parties are \n     more lavish, the venues are bigger, the bands are bigger \n     names than ever before.''\n       Top sponsorship for a Wednesday night benefit concert at \n     Rockefeller Center costs $250,000. The event is being \n     organized by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee \n     for his World of Hope foundation, which seeks to alleviate \n     AIDS and other health problems in Africa. Frist's aides \n     declined to name top sponsors.\n       The longest-running convention party is the one being \n     thrown all four nights of the convention to honor Rep. John \n     Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Committee on Education \n     and the Workforce. It's at the Tunnel, a former nightclub on \n     Manhattan's West Side.\n       The party-every-night tradition goes back to the GOP's San \n     Diego convention in 1996, where nightly bashes for Boehner--\n     then a member of the House leadership--got a reputation as \n     the best events in town. Boehner's lobbyist friends \n     replicated it at a Philadelphia warehouse in 2000 and are \n     doing it again this year. The effort is led by Bruce Gates, a \n     lobbyist for Washington Council Ernst & Young, a firm whose \n     client list includes employers such as General Electric, \n     Ford, AT and Verizon.\n       House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois was the honoree at \n     a reception Sunday afternoon sponsored by General Motors at \n     Tavern on the Green, a glittering Victorian gothic restaurant \n     on the edge of Central Park.

And \n     members of the House Financial Services and Senate Banking \n     committees will be toasted at Madame Tussaud's Tuesday night, \n     sponsored by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.\n       Koch Industries, a Kansas-based oil company, is putting on \n     a reception Thursday for Sen. George Allen of Virginia at the \n     Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center. BellSouth, Coca-Cola, \n     Home Depot, UST and the Southern Co. are throwing a late-\n     night party on Wednesday for Sens. Lindsey Graham of South \n     Carolina and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia at the Supper Club in \n     midtown Manhattan.\n       Among the busiest sponsors this week will be the American \n     Gas Association, a trade group that represents 192 local \n     natural gas utilities. They're putting on at least nine \n     shindigs, from a ``Wildcatter's Ball'' honoring Sen.

Mr. President, earlier this week the House and Senate \nDemocratic Leadership--forced to forgo a formal conference by one \nRepublican Senator's insistence on blocking this bill--made public \ntheir comprehensive new ethics reform legislation. This legislation is \nhistoric, an important next step in the process of restoring the \nconfidence of Americans in the legislative process. Designed to bolster \ncongressional accountability, make the legislative process fairer and \nmore transparent, and regulate more tightly the relationships between \nMembers of Congress, executive branch officials, and lobbyists, it \ndeserves our full support.\n  After being stymied by serious procedural hurdles in the last \nCongress, earlier this year in the Senate we passed a tough, \ncomprehensive, bipartisan bill of which this body can be very proud. \nRegrettably, this week we had to overcome a filibuster by my Republican \ncolleagues to get this bill to this point--a filibuster on a bill very \nsimilar to the earlier Senate-passed bill for which many of them voted. \nI congratulate my colleagues on voting earlier today to overcome \nobjections from those who attempted to block its progress.\n  We should adopt this bill today without changes and send it to the \nPresident for his signature. It is important that Congress act quickly \non this bill to help restore the confidence of all Americans in the \nlegislative process and in the laws we write. That confidence, already \nlow, has been further shaken by recent lobbying scandals and \ninvestigations, some involving funding earmarks. Bringing this bill to \nthe floor as the first piece of legislation in this Congress was an \nindication of the depth of our commitment to restore the confidence of \nAmericans in that process; I commend the majority leader for making \nthis measure a priority and for pressing forward relentlessly, through \nmany obstacles, to get this final version to the floor.\n  This bill, which passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 411 to 8 \nearlier this week, reflects the approach we took last year in \ndeveloping reform legislation. I commend our Rules Committee chair \nSenator Feinstein, along with Chairman Lieberman of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, for working with our \nleaders to develop this strong bill. It is the final step in a lobbying \nreform process which has taken several years to come to fruition.\n  Let's remember why we are here: because of a need to respond to the \ncrisis in confidence of the American people following the Jack Abramoff \nscandal in the House, a matter involving the bribery conviction of a \nMember of that body, and legal proceedings against certain other \ncongressional and administration officials involving allegations of \nlobbying-related improprieties. The serious violations that have lead \nto last year's guilty pleas by former House Members and staff and the \nactivities of Abramoff and his cronies in\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\nwhich they violated lobbying, gift, and ethics rules have helped to \ncreate a climate of disillusionment and distrust of Congress. Americans \nmade very clear in the last elections that cleaning up this process was \na priority for them; it must also be a priority for us.\n  This comprehensive reform bill will help reduce the risk of future \nwrongdoing by lobbyists and officeholders. It is important to \nstrengthen our current rules and procedures, where we can, to avoid \nfuture problems. But enforcing current rules is not enough; that is why \nwe should adopt these tough new reforms today. And let me say that by \nmaking these changes we impugn no one in this body--I know my \ncolleagues, many of whom I have worked with for decades, to be men and \nwomen of integrity, their behavior above reproach.\n  Regulating the relationships between lawmakers and lobbyists is not \nnew. In 1876, the House tried to require lobbyists to register with its \nclerk, but enforcement was weak and not much came of these efforts. In \nthe early 1930s, Congress held hearings on lobbying abuses, with little \nresult. In 1938, the Foreign Agents Registration Act was enacted, \nfollowed by the 1946 Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, the scope of \nwhich the Supreme Court soon narrowed. Additional minor reforms were \nimplemented in the sixties, and then the Lobbying Disclosure Act of \n1995 and new Senate gift and travel rules followed. And now this reform \nmeasure, the most sweeping of its kind since Watergate, will help shed \nfurther sunlight on the legislative process and illuminate how special \ninterests influence that process.\n  It is clear that real, enforceable ethics reforms do work. Such \nreforms have over the years worked to improve the way Congress \noperates. Conflict of interest rules, earned-income limits, lobbying \ndisclosure laws, the McCain-Feingold law and the honoraria ban, both of \nwhich I was privileged to play a role in, and other key reforms have \nhelped ensure greater transparency and accountability to those whom we \nrepresent. But we must do more, and that is what this effort is about.\n  When we initially considered this legislation many months ago, \nMembers from both sides of the aisle offered their ideas to improve the \nbill on the floor, which were incorporated into the final bill. That \nmeasure then passed 96 to 2. While some may quibble with the way one or \nanother provision was finalized, virtually all of the bill's major \nelements have been retained in some form, and that is why this is a \nvery strong product. Our leader rightly called it the strongest reform \nbill since the Watergate era; we should be proud to support it.\n\n  Since others have detailed what is in this bill--including provisions \nto slow the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying industry; \ntough new conflict of interest and postemployment rules; expanded \ndisclosure of lobbyists' activities, including campaign-related \nactivities; tightening of gift and travel rules; increased enforcement; \nrequiring Members to pay charter rates to fly on private aircraft, and \nthe like--I will not spend time doing that here. Suffice it to say this \nis a very strong bill, worthy of our support.\n  Finally, let me say a word about what I think is the elephant in the \nroom on congressional reform efforts, and that is the need to enact \ncomprehensive reforms of the way we organize and finance campaigns in \nthis country.\n  As I have said, gift and lobby reforms do matter and are important. \nBut while it is clear serious reform of the way some in Congress and \ntheir lobbying allies do business is needed, these changes alone won't \naddress the core problem: the need for campaign finance reform which \nbreaks once and for all the link between legislative favor-seekers and \nthe free flow of inadequately regulated, special interest private \nmoney. Ultimately, this is more significant than lobbying, gift and \ntravel rules, or procedural reforms on earmarks and conference \nprocedures and reports.\n  My preferred reform approach would include a combination of public \nfunding, free or reduced media time, spending limits, and other key \nreforms. Others will have different views and approaches. But I hope \nthis will be just the first step in a process that will include \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform. It took us years to enact the \nMcCain-Feingold law, and it will likely take at least as long to enact \na more comprehensive bill; we should get started on that effort as soon \nas possible. Real campaign finance reform must address not just \ncongressional campaigns but also the urgent need to renew and repair \nour Presidential public funding system, which has served Democratic and \nRepublican candidates--and all Americans--for 25 years.\n  The American public is way ahead of us on this issue. Too many \nbelieve the interests of average voters are usurped by the money and \ninfluence of lobbyists, powerful individuals, corporations, and \ninterest groups. Too many believe their voices go unheard, drowned out \nby the din of special interest favor-seekers.\n  Our system derives its legitimacy from the consent of the governed. \nThat is put at risk if the governed lose faith in the system's \nfundamental fairness and in its capacity to respond to the most basic \nneeds of our society because narrow special interests hold sway over \nthe public interest. Nowhere is the need for reform more urgent than on \ncampaign finance. In the Rules Committee we held a recent hearing on \nthe issue; I hope we will keep moving forward on it, and I intend to \ncontribute to that debate as I have before.\n  I end where I began, with a concern about the confidence of Americans \nin Congress. Our credibility, and the credibility of the legislative \nprocess, is at stake. Let's not fool ourselves that these issues will \nultimately be resolved without a fundamental overhaul of our campaign \nfinance system. But in the wake of overwhelming approval by the House, \nlet's adopt this measure and get it signed by the President, \nrecognizing that it is an important next step in the reform process.\n  I again congratulate the majority leader for bringing this \nlegislation back to the Senate floor and look forward to seeing it \nenacted into law so that we can help to begin to restore the confidence \nof the American people in the legislative process. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in voting aye.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in the past few years, the newspapers were \nconsistently laden with stories of scandal at every level of \ngovernment. In November, the American people told us that they were \ntired of Congressional corruption. And today, the Senate finally acted. \nDespite countless hurdles and setbacks, today Congress will pass the \nmost significant overhaul of lobbying and ethics rules in decades, and \nin doing so will fundamentally change the way we do business here.\n  Just as I did last year when I spoke on similar legislation, I want \nto make it clear to my constituents that I take no contributions from \nspecial interest PACS or lobbyists. I am beholden to no one except the \npeople of Wisconsin, and I hold myself and my office to the highest \nstandard of conduct regardless of any legislation.\n  But the growing number of scandals--and the strengthened voice of the \nAmerican people against that corruption--made clear the need for this \nlegislation. I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle argue that this bill does not constitute true change. While \nthese individuals focus on what they see as shortcomings, I choose to \nfocus on the monumental reforms contained in the bill. The bill \nincludes important restrictions on gifts and travel from lobbyists. It \nprevents a ``revolving door'' scenario, one in which Senators and \nsenior staff are given complete access to lobby their former \ncolleagues. Finally, the legislation restores common sense in its \ntreatment of convicted Members of Congress by denying them \nCongressional retirement benefits.\n  I also support the earmark provisions contained in the bill. These \nbring an unprecedented amount of transparency to the earmarking \nprocess. It requires earmarks included in bills and conference reports \nto be identified on the Internet at least 48 hours before the Senate \nvotes. Last minute additions to conference reports are subject to a 60-\nvote point of order under this bill. Every American deserves to know \nhow their tax dollars are being spent, and I believe this bill helps \nour constituents do just that.\n  I will continue to represent the people of Wisconsin without regard \nto special interests. And I will continue to\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\nhold myself and my office to the highest levels of accountability. It \nis my hope that this legislation will restore the trust of the American \npeople, a trust eroded by so many Congressional scandals. It has been a \nlong time coming, but the passage of this legislation today marks a new \nway of doing business in Washington, one that the voters have demanded \nand the people deserve.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1, the \nHonest Leadership and Open Government Act. I would first like to extend \nmy condolences to all those affected by the tragedy in Minneapolis. I \nwatched the dramatic footage with horror and I can only hope we can \nquickly find the cause of this disaster and do all we can to prevent \nsomething like this from happening again.\n  This ethics bill is the product of many hours of hard work, and I \ncommend Leader Reid and Senators Feinstein and Lieberman for their \nleadership and determination in getting this done. Make no mistake. \nToday, this body is considering the greatest overhaul of legislative \nrules and procedure in generations. This ethics bill has passed the \nHouse overwhelmingly, and we should do the same without any further \ndelay.\n  Last November, the American people sent a strong message to its \nleaders and that message read, ``Enough is enough!'' The people said, \n``No more scandals! No more shady dealings!'' The people saw that \nCongress had needed to fix gaping holes in its ethics rules, and they \nvoted for people they believed would make those changes.\n  So keeping with our promise to the American people, we developed \ncomprehensive ethics and lobbying reform with an eye towards a quick \npassage. Back in January, this reform passed with a vote of 96-2. \nUnfortunately, the will of the people and the efforts of the Senate \nwere stymied and we had to return to square one.\n  With this bill, however, we have overcome this obstruction and have a \nchance to pass what is being called ``landmark'' legislation by the \nreform community. And not a moment too soon. The American people expect \ntheir elected leaders to abide by the highest moral and ethical \nstandards. We need to do everything we can to not disappoint them. The \nconversation at the dinner table should not be about how we let them \ndown. It should not be about how the American people have lost trust in \nus. And that is why this legislation--and the corresponding message--is \nso important. It seeks to restore that trust that eroded over the past \ndecade.\n  With this reform, we are closing loop-holes, enacting restrictions, \nand creating transparency. These new rules are substantively the same \nas those passed by this body back in January; any statements to the \ncontrary are simply false.\n  First and foremost, this bill will improve the culture in Washington \nby substantively changing the way that lobbyists interact with elected \nofficials. The American public neither wants nor deserves another \nAbramoff scandal. With this bill, they can now be assured of clean and \ntransparent interactions between K Street and the Hill. Rules will be \nplaced on the travel and gifts that legislators can accept from \nlobbyists, and the revolving door between public and private employment \nwill be slowed.\n  Additionally, lobbyists now face additional disclosure requirements. \nThey must now file their disclosure forms twice as often, and certify \nthat they have not given gifts of travel in violation of Senate or \nHouse rules. Lobbyists' participation in the campaign process must also \nbe disclosed. Lobbyists must list their campaign contributions, and \ncampaign committees must disclose the names of lobbyists that \n``bundle'' contributions to the candidate.\n  These sweeping changes do not just apply to the lobbyists \ninteractions but also to us and our conduct in the legislative process. \nThis bill will change Senate procedure in various ways and seeks to end \n``anonymous holds'' that hamper and disrupt the business of this body.\n  Additionally, this bill will shine new light onto the sometimes murky \nearmark process with new levels of transparency. For the first time, \nall earmarked appropriations and their sponsors must be disclosed to \nthe public on the Internet at least 48 hours prior to Senate action. \nNot only will this provide the American people with a greater \nunderstanding of how their tax dollars are being spent, but it allows \nfor a more comprehensive debate on the Senate floor to help ensure we \nare spending those same tax dollars wisely. Furthermore, each Senator \nmust now certify that neither they nor their immediate family members \nwill profit from any earmark they are requesting. This lends legitimacy \nto the projects that we fund, reassuring Americans that they are indeed \nnecessary, and not just enriching politicians and their friends.\n  When we were all voted into office, the public enlisted their trust \nin us to act appropriately. We must not take that responsibility \nlightly. We must always strive for the high ground--where the process \nis clean and clear, and where the behavior is exemplary.\n  America expects nothing less from us.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this \nmonumental bill, and I hope that the Senate sends a message to the \nAmerican public that we too are sick of corruption, shady dealings, and \nlies. This bill will take a giant leap forward to end that behavior. We \ncannot--and should not--wait any longer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na section-by-section analysis of the bill we are about to vote on, \nincluding legislative history endorsed by the three principal Senate \nauthors of the legislation: myself, Chairman Lieberman and Majority \nLeader Reid.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 Section by Section \n                    Analysis and Legislative History\n\n\n                   Title I Closing the Revolving Door\n\n     Section 101. Amendments to restrictions on former officers, \n         employees and elected officials of the executive and \n         legislative branches\n       This section prohibits very senior executive personnel from \n     lobbying the department or agency in which they worked for 2 \n     years after they leave their position. It bans Senators from \n     lobbying Congress for 2 years after they leave office and \n     bans senior Senate staff and officers from lobbying the \n     Senate for 1 year after they leave Senate employment. Senior \n     employees of the Senate are those who, for at least 60 days, \n     during the 1-year period before they leave Senate employment, \n     are paid a rate of basic pay equal to or greater than 75 \n     percent of the basic rate of pay payable to a Senator. \n     Section 101 also makes technical and conforming changes to 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 207(e).\n     Section 102. Wrongfully influencing a private entity's \n         employment decisions or practices\n       Section 102 prohibits members from influencing hiring \n     decisions of private organizations on the sole basis of \n     partisan political gain. It subjects those who violate this \n     provision to a fine and imprisonment for up to 15 years. This \n     section is not intended to preclude Senators from providing \n     references or writing letters of recommendation that speak to \n     the credentials of an individual.\n     Section 103. Notification of post-employment restrictions\n       This provision directs the Clerk of the House and the \n     Secretary of the Senate to inform Members, officers, and \n     employees of the beginning and end dates of their post-\n     employment lobbying restrictions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207. It \n     also requires the Clerk and Secretary to post such \n     notifications on their Internet sites.\n     Section 104. Exception to restrictions on former officers, \n         employees, and elected officials of the executive and \n         legislative branch\n       This section removes any confusion as to whether lobbying \n     rules apply to former federal legislative and executive \n     senior staffers who go to work for Indian tribes, tribal \n     organizations and inter-tribal consortia immediately after \n     their federal employment.\n       The amended tribal provision applies lobbying restrictions \n     to those former federal employees who do not work directly \n     for tribes or the exempted tribal entities or who represent \n     an entity in an unofficial capacity or on non-governmental \n     matters.\n       Section 104 removes any ambiguity that federal employees \n     who are assigned to Indian tribes, tribal organizations or \n     inter-tribal consortia may represent the Indian entity before \n     a federal agency, department or court without violating \n     lobbying laws. Further, this section removes any ambiguity \n     that only those former federal executive and legislative \n     branch employees who go to work for tribes, tribal \n     organizations and inter-tribal consortia and who perform \n     official governmental duties associated with tribal \n     governmental activities or Indian programs and services are \n     exempt from lobbying laws.\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\n     Under the provision, only ``tribal organizations'' (for \n     example, a tribal or village governing body) or ``inter-\n     tribal consortia'' (defined as, a coalition of tribes who \n     join to undertake self-governance activities) may employ \n     former officials, who may be exempted. And, only employees of \n     these entities who act on behalf of these entities and who \n     participate in matters related to a tribal governmental \n     activity or federal Indian program or service may be \n     exempted.\n       Importantly, the amendment preserves federal policy that \n     encourages former federal employees to go to work directly \n     for Indian tribes and tribal organizations that provide \n     governmental services.\n     Section 105. Effective date\n       The effective date for section 101 is for individuals that \n     leave federal office or employment on or after the date of \n     adjournment of the first session of the 110th Congress sine \n     die, or December 31, 2007, whichever is earlier. Section 102 \n     will become effective upon enactment. Section 103 requires \n     the Secretary to begin issuing notifications after 60 days, \n     and all notifications must be published on the Internet as of \n     January 1, 2008. Section 104 goes into effect upon enactment; \n     however the post-employment restrictions go into effect for \n     individuals that leave federal employment on or after 60 days \n     after enactment.\n       The new ``revolving door'' restrictions are effective only \n     for officials or employees that terminate office or \n     employment on or after the relevant effective date. A delayed \n     effective date was deemed more reasonable and practical than \n     an immediate effective date.\n\n\n              Title II Full Public Disclosure of Lobbying\n\n     Section 201. Quarterly filing of lobbying disclosure reports\n       Section 201 increases the frequency of lobbying disclosure \n     reports from semiannually to quarterly filings, with required \n     adjustments to dates, thresholds, etc. A number of practical \n     consequences result from the changes in section 201. For \n     instance, exempted from filing are those whose total income \n     from lobbying activities does not exceed $2,500 or for whom \n     total expenses in connection with lobbying activities do not \n     exceed $10,000. The changes in the section decrease the \n     threshold amounts that trigger required disclosures of earned \n     income or expenses from clients on lobbyist disclosure \n     reports from $10,000 to $5,000, and require registrants to \n     round income and expenses to the nearest $10,000.\n     Section 202. Additional disclosure\n       This provision requires that lobbyists disclose whether \n     their client is a State or local government or a department, \n     agency, or other instrumentality of a state or local \n     government on their reports filed under the Lobbying \n     Disclosure Act.\n     Section 203. Semiannual reports on certain contributions\n       This section requires lobbyists to disclose semiannually \n     their name, their employer, the names of all political \n     committees that they established or control, the name of each \n     Federal candidate, officeholder, leadership PAC or political \n     party committee to whom they have contributed more than $200 \n     in that semiannual period, payments for events honoring or \n     recognizing federal officials, payments to an entity named in \n     honor of a covered federal official or to a person or entity \n     in recognition of such official, payments made to \n     organizations controlled by such official, or payments made \n     to pay the costs of retreats, conferences or similar events \n     held by or in the name of one or more covered federal \n     officials, and contributions to Presidential library \n     foundations and Presidential inaugural committees in that \n     semiannual period. To avoid duplicative reporting, the bill \n     provides an exception for payments made to committees \n     regulated by the Federal Election Commission with respect to \n     the provisions relating to disclosure of payments made to \n     events honoring or recognizing federal officials, to entities \n     named in honor or recognition of federal officials, to \n     organizations controlled by such officials, and to pay the \n     costs of meetings, etc. held by officials. All of this \n     information would already be reported elsewhere under \n     provisions in this bill or under reporting required by the \n     Federal Election Commission Act.\n       Section 203 also requires a certification by the lobbyist \n     filing the disclosure report that the person is familiar with \n     House and Senate gift and travel rules, and has not provided, \n     requested, or directed a gift, including a gift of travel, to \n     a Member, officer, or employee of Congress with knowledge \n     that receipt of the gift would violate the relevant rules.\n       The bill directs the Clerk of the House and the Secretary \n     of the Senate to submit a report to Congress on the \n     feasibility of requiring such reports to be made on a \n     quarterly rather than semiannual basis and expresses the \n     sense of Congress in favor of moving to quarterly reporting \n     in the future if it is practically feasible to do so. After \n     the report is filed by the Clerk and the Secretary, an \n     affirmative vote of Congress will be required to alter the \n     frequency of the filing period.\n     Section 204. Disclosure of bundled contributions\n       This section requires certain political committees to \n     disclose to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) the name, \n     address and employer of each current registered lobbyist who \n     has provided the committee with bundled contributions in \n     excess of $15,000 in each six month period defined \n     in statute. The aggregate amount of contributions is \n     measured on a non-cumulative basis in each six month \n     period.\n       The definition of ``bundled contribution'' in this section \n     contains two prongs. Subparagraph 204(a)(8)(A)(i) covers the \n     situation where a lobbyist physically forwards contributions \n     to the campaign. Subparagraph 204(a)(8)(A)(ii) covers the \n     situation where contributions are sent directly by \n     contributors to the committee, but where the committee or \n     candidate credits a registered lobbyist for generating the \n     contributions and where such credit is reflected in some form \n     of record, designation or recognition. An example of such \n     designations would include honorary titles within the \n     committee; examples of such recognition include access to \n     certain events reserved exclusively for those who generate a \n     certain level of contributions or similar benefits provided \n     by the committee as a reward for successful fundraising.\n       The disclosure requirement is not triggered by general \n     solicitations of contributions, or where a registered \n     lobbyist attends an event or an event is held on the premises \n     of a registrant. An event hosted by a registered lobbyist may \n     trigger the disclosure requirement if the committee credits \n     the lobbyist with the proceeds of the fundraiser through \n     record, designation or other form of recognition, as \n     described in the preceding paragraph.\n       This provision covers only contributions credited to \n     registered lobbyists, as defined in subsection 204(a)(7). \n     Contributions credited to others, including others who may \n     share a common employer with, or work for a lobbyist, are not \n     covered by this section so long as any credit is genuinely \n     received by the non-lobbyist and not the lobbyist.\n       Subparagraph 204(a)(8)(A)(ii) requires that the \n     contribution be credited by the committee or ``candidate \n     involved.'' The candidate ``involved'' in the case of a \n     principal campaign committee is the candidate for whom the \n     committee is the principal campaign committee; the candidate \n     ``involved'' in the case of a Leadership PAC is the candidate \n     who directly or indirectly establishes, finances, maintains \n     or controls the Leadership PAC; and the candidate \n     ``involved'' in the case of a political party committee is \n     the chairman of the committee.\n       The definition of ``Leadership PAC'' in 204(a)(8)(B) is \n     intended to recognize the FEC rule on a related topic at 68 \n     Fed. Reg. 67013 (December 1, 2003)--a Leadership PAC \n     associated with a given Member of Congress is not deemed to \n     be ``affiliated'' with that office holder's principal \n     campaign committee for purpose of contribution or expenditure \n     limits under the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n     Section 205. Electronic filing of lobbying disclosure reports\n       Section 205 requires lobbying disclosure reports to be \n     filed in electronic form, and directs the Clerk of the House \n     and Secretary of the Senate to use the same electronic \n     software for receipt and recording of the filings.\n     Section 206. Prohibition on provision of gifts or travel by \n         lobbyists that are registered or required to register \n         under the LDA, to Members of Congress and to \n         congressional employees\n       This provision prohibits registrants and lobbyists from \n     providing gifts or travel to covered legislative branch \n     officials with knowledge that the gift or travel is in \n     violation of House or Senate rules.\n     Section 207. Disclosure of lobbying activities by certain \n         coalitions and associations\n       This section amends existing rules in section 4(b)(3) of \n     the Lobbying Disclosure Act requiring reporting of \n     ``affiliated organizations.'' The bill closes a loophole that \n     has allowed so-called ``stealth coalitions,'' often with \n     innocuous-sounding names, to operate without identifying the \n     interests engaged in the lobbying activities. Section 207 \n     requires registrants to disclose the identity of any \n     organization, other than the client, that contributes more \n     than $5,000 toward the registrant's lobbying activities \n     (either directly to the registrant or indirectly through the \n     client) in a quarterly period and actively participates in \n     the planning, supervision, or control of such lobbying \n     activities.\n       The new provision includes several exceptions to narrow the \n     rule. First, it does not require disclosure of an \n     organization or entity that would otherwise be identified if \n     the client already lists the organization or entity as a \n     member or contributor on its publicly-accessible website. In \n     such cases, the registrant must report the specific web page \n     that includes the relevant information. If the entity would \n     have been disclosed under the existing rule 4(b)(3) language \n     (as adjusted, i.e., the entity contributes $5,000 per quarter \n     to the lobbying activities and in whole or in major part \n     plans, supervises, or controls the lobbying activities), \n     however, that entity must still be disclosed. Second, the new \n     rule makes clear that it does not require disclosure of \n     individuals that are members of or donors to a client or an \n     entity identified as an affiliated entity.\n       The provision requires disclosure only of organizations or \n     entities that ``actively participate'' in the planning, \n     supervision, or control of the lobbying activities described \n     in the report. Entities or organizations that have only a \n     passive role--e.g., mere donors, mere recipients of \n     information and reports, etc.--would not be considered to be \n     ``actively participating'' in the lobbying activities.\n\n[[Page S10710]]\n\n     Section 208. Disclosure by registered lobbyists of past \n         executive branch and congressional employment\n       This provision amends the requirement under the Lobbying \n     Disclosure Act that lobbyists disclose their executive or \n     legislative employment in the preceding two years. \n     Specifically, section 208 extends the disclosure to include \n     executive and legislative branch employment in the preceding \n     20 years.\n     Section 209. Public availability of lobbying disclosure \n         information; maintenance of information\n       Section 209 directs the Secretary of the Senate and the \n     Clerk of the House to maintain and provide online access to \n     an electronic database in a searchable, sortable, and \n     downloadable manner, that includes the information contained \n     in registrations and reports filed under this Act for a \n     period of 6 years after they are filed and provides an \n     electronic link to relevant information in the database of \n     the Federal Election Commission.\n     Section 210. Disclosure of enforcement for noncompliance\n       This section requires the Secretary of the Senate and the \n     Clerk of the House to publicly disclose on a semi annual \n     basis the aggregate number of lobbyists and lobbying firms \n     referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia \n     for noncompliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act. It also \n     requires the Attorney General to report semiannually to \n     Congress on the aggregate number of enforcement actions taken \n     by the Department of Justice under the Lobbying Disclosure \n     Act and the amount of fines and prison sentences imposed.\n     Section 211. Increased civil and criminal penalties for \n         failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements\n       Section 211 increases the civil penalty for violations of \n     the Lobby Disclosure Act from $50,000 to $200,000. It imposes \n     a criminal penalty of up to five years for knowing and \n     corrupt failure to comply with the Act.\n     Section 212. Electronic filing and public database for \n         lobbyists for foreign governments\n       This provision amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act \n     (FARA) to require that mandatory registration statements or \n     updates be filed electronically, in addition to any other \n     form that may be required by the Attorney General. It \n     requires the Attorney General to maintain a searchable and \n     sortable electronic database, made publicly available on the \n     Internet, that includes the information contained in \n     registration statements and updates filed under FARA.\n     Section 213. Comptroller general audit and annual report\n       Under Section 213, the Comptroller General will annually \n     review random samples of publicly-available registrations and \n     reports filed by lobbyists, lobbying firms, and registrants \n     and evaluate compliance by those individuals and entities \n     with the Lobbying Disclosure Act--i.e., it will review the \n     same registrations and reports that are available to the \n     public. The GAO is required to report annually to Congress on \n     its findings. The report will include recommendations to \n     Congress on improving compliance and providing the Department \n     of Justice with the resources and authorities necessary for \n     effective enforcement. Under this provision, it is intended \n     that the GAO audit lobbyist compliance with the Lobbying \n     Disclosure Act; the provision does not give the GAO authority \n     to audit the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the \n     House's activities under the LDA, including receipt, \n     compilation, dissemination and/or review of information filed \n     under the LDA.\n       Section 213(c) authorizes the Comptroller General to \n     request and receive information from lobbyists, lobbying \n     firms and registrants. This section provides the Comptroller \n     General with the tools necessary to evaluate whether the \n     information included by lobbyists, lobbying firms and \n     registrants in the reports filed under this Act is accurate \n     and complete, and thus whether these individuals and entities \n     are complying with the Act. Nothing in this section provides \n     authority for the GAO to obtain information protected by the \n     attorney-client privilege.\n     Section 214. Sense of Congress regarding lobbying by \n         immediate family members\n       Section 214 expresses the Sense of Congress that the use of \n     family relationships by a lobbyist who is an immediate family \n     member of a Member of Congress to gain special advantage over \n     another lobbyist is inappropriate.\n     Section 215. Effective date\n       Sections 201, 202, 205, 207, 208, 209 and 210 apply to \n     information in periods on or after January 1, 2008, and for \n     subsequent registrations and reports. Section 203 goes into \n     effect on the first semi-annual reporting period that begins \n     after enactment. Section 204 goes into effect 90 days after \n     the FEC has promulgated final regulations. Sections 206 and \n     211 go into effect upon enactment. Section 212 goes into \n     effect 90 days after enactment. Section 213 requires the \n     first audit to be done with respect to filings in the first \n     calendar quarter of 2008 and the report to Congress be \n     completed within 6 months after that quarter, with annual \n     reports thereafter.\n\n\n                 Title III Standing Rules of the House\n\n       Title III includes changes to the Rules of the House. \n     Information provided with respect to Title III simply \n     summarizes the provisions of the Act and is not meant to be \n     authoritative legislative history with respect to the \n     provisions in that Title.\n     Section 301. Disclosure by Members and staff of employment \n         negotiations\n       This provision prohibits House Members from engaging in any \n     agreements or negotiations with regard to future employment \n     or salary until his or her successor has been selected unless \n     he or she, within three business days after the commencement \n     of such negotiations or agreements, files a signed statement \n     disclosing the nature of such negotiations or agreements, the \n     name of the private entity or entities involved, and the date \n     such negotiations commenced with the Committee on Standards \n     of Official Conduct. It requires that Members recuse \n     themselves from any matter in which there is a conflict of \n     interest or an appearance of a conflict, and that Members \n     submit a statement of disclosure to the Clerk for public \n     release in the event that such a recusal is made. It requires \n     senior staff to notify the Committee on Standards of Official \n     Conduct within three days if they engage in negotiations or \n     agreements for future employment or compensation.\n     Section 302. Prohibition on lobbying contacts with spouse of \n         Member who is a registered lobbyist\n       Section 302 amends House Rules to require that Members \n     prohibit their staff from having any lobbying contact with \n     the Member's spouse if such individual is a registered \n     lobbyist or is employed or retained by a registered lobbyist \n     to influence legislation.\n     Section 303. Treatment of firms and other businesses whose \n         members serve as House committee consultants\n       This section clarifies that when a person is serving as a \n     House committee consultant, other members and employees of \n     that person's employing firm, partnership, or other business \n     organization, shall be subject to the same lobbying \n     restrictions that apply to that individual under the Rules.\n     Section 304. Posting of travel and financial disclosure \n         reports on public website of Clerk of the House of \n         Representatives\n       Section 304 directs the Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives to develop a publicly available, searchable, \n     sortable and downloadable website by August 1, 2008 to post \n     Members' travel information that is required to be disclosed \n     under rule XXV of the Rules of the House of Representatives.\n       It directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to \n     post on a publicly available website by August 1, 2008 \n     Members' financial disclosure reports required to be filed \n     under section 103(h)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act. \n     Allows Members to omit personally identifiable information \n     from these forms.\n     Section 305. Participation in lobbyist sponsored events \n         during political conventions\n       This section prohibits Members from attending parties held \n     in their honor at national party conventions if they have \n     been directly paid for by lobbyists, unless the Member is the \n     party's presidential or vice presidential nominee.\n     Section 306. Exercise of rulemaking authority\n       This provision acknowledges that the House adopts the \n     provisions in this title as an exercise of its rule making \n     power with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the House to change those rules at any time.\n\n\n             Title IV Congressional Pension Accountability\n\n     Section 401. Loss of pensions accrued during service as a \n         Member of Congress for abusing the public trust\n       Section 401 prohibits Members from receiving their pension \n     earned while serving in Congress if convicted of bribery, \n     perjury, conspiracy or other related crimes in the course of \n     carrying out their official duties as a Member of Congress.\n\n\n       Title V Senate Legislative Transparency and Accountability\n\n     Section 511. Amendments to Rule XXVIII\n       Section 511 amends certain provisions of Rule XXVIII of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, and adds a new provision to the \n     Rule. Rule XXVIII currently provides for a point of order to \n     be made against a conference report if the conferees add \n     ``new matter'' ``not committed to them by either House.'' \n     (The current rule also includes language purporting to \n     prevent conferees from ``strik[ing] from the bill matter \n     agreed to by both Houses.'' The bill authors, in consultation \n     with the Parliamentarian, could not identify a situation in \n     which this language could ever have effect. When there are \n     amendments in disagreement, the conferees have no authority \n     over matter not in disagreement, and thus could not strike \n     such material. When a disagreement to any amendment, \n     including an amendment in the nature of a substitute, has \n     been referred to conferees, nothing has been ``agreed to by \n     both Houses.'') As Rule XXVIII notes, conferees may include \n     in their report matter which is a germane modification of \n     subjects in disagreement, and the amendments made in this \n     section do not change that rule.\n       Section 511 does, however, change the parliamentary \n     consequences if conferees violate the rule by adding new \n     matter. Rule XXVIII currently provides a very blunt \n     instrument--if a point of order is sustained, the conference \n     report is rejected or recommitted to the conference if the \n     House has not already acted. Because many times the House \n     will have already acted, successful invocation of Rule XXVIII \n     would often spell the death knell for legislation. This \n     result has two negative consequences. When successfully \n     invoked, Rule XXVIII may derail legislation\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\n     that otherwise has strong bipartisan support. At the same \n     time, because of the dramatic consequences from making a \n     point of order under Rule XXVIII, it is rarely invoked. In \n     fact, some Senators believe that the very blunt nature of \n     Rule XXVIII has provided conferees more leeway to add new \n     matter on ``must pass'' bills.\n       Section 511 amends the current Rule XXVIII point of order \n     in two ways. First, it changes Rule XXVIII from a blunt \n     instrument to a ``surgical'' one--if new matter is added by \n     conferees, then a point of order may be made and, if \n     successful, the new matter shall be struck, and the Senate \n     will then proceed to consider whether to concur in the bill \n     as so amended by the removal of the material stricken on the \n     point(s) of order, and send it back to the House. Second, \n     Section 511 adds the possibility of 60-vote waivers for \n     points of order under the rule. The language in Section 511 \n     is similar to that used in the so-called ``Byrd'' rule and is \n     intended to be interpreted similarly--waivers may be as to \n     one, multiple, or all points of order under the rule; waivers \n     may be made after a point of order has been raised or \n     prospectively. Section 511 also ensures that appeals from \n     rulings of the Chair may be sustained only by an affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of all Senators (generally, 60 votes).\n       Separately, Section 511 adds a new paragraph 9 to Rule \n     XXVIII, which requires that all conference reports be posted \n     on a publicly accessible website controlled by Congress 48 \n     hours prior to the vote on adoption of the conference report, \n     as reported to the Presiding Officer by the Secretary of the \n     Senate. This new rule is enforceable via a point of order, \n     which may be waived by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of \n     all Senators. The requirements of the rule may be fulfilled \n     by posting the conference report on any publicly accessible \n     website controlled by a Member of Congress, committee of \n     either the House or Senate, the Library of Congress, another \n     office of the House, the Senate, or Congress, or the \n     Government Printing Office. Section 511 directs the Committee \n     on Rules and Administration, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, and the \n     GPO to issue regulations to help harmonize practice among \n     conference committees for the convenience of Senators and the \n     public. Paragraph 9 may be waived by an affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of all Senators. Waivers may be made after a \n     point of order is made or prospectively.\n       Under well-established Senate precedent, a new directed \n     spending provision added in conference does not constitute \n     ``new matter'' if it relates to the matter in conference. The \n     modifications to rule XXVIII do not change the well-\n     established rule. The new rule XLIV includes a separate \n     provision relating to the addition of ``new directed spending \n     provisions'' in conference.\n     Section 512. Notice of objecting to proceeding\n       Section 512 relates to the concept of so-called ``secret \n     holds.'' Section 512 provides that the Majority Leader or \n     Minority Leader or their designees shall recognize another \n     Senator's notice of intent to object to proceeding to a \n     measure or matter subsequent to the six-day period described \n     below only if that other Senator complies with the provisions \n     of this section. Under the procedure described in section \n     512, after an objection has been made to a unanimous consent \n     request to proceeding to or passage of a measure on behalf of \n     a Senator, that Senator must submit the notice of intent to \n     object in writing to his or her respective leader, and within \n     6 session days after that submit a notice of intent to \n     object, to be published in the Congressional Record and on a \n     special calendar entitled ``Notice of Intent to Object to \n     Proceeding.'' The Senator may specify the reasons for the \n     objection if the Senator wishes.\n       If the Senator notifies the Majority Leader or Minority \n     Leader (as the case may be) that he or she has withdrawn the \n     notice of intent to object prior to the passage of 6 session \n     days, then no notification need be submitted. A notice once \n     filed may be removed after the objecting Senator submits to \n     the Congressional Record a statement that he or she no longer \n     objects to proceeding.\n     Section 513. Public availability of Senate committee and \n         subcommittee meetings\n       Section 513 requires that, 90 days after enactment, Senate \n     committees and subcommittees shall make available through the \n     Internet a video recording, an audio recording or a \n     transcript of all public meetings of the committee not later \n     than 21 business days after the meeting occurs. This \n     requirement may be waived by the Rules Committee upon request \n     should the committee or subcommittee be unable to comply due \n     to technical or logistical issues. To be issued a waiver, a \n     committee will be expected to prove that none of the three \n     means of recording a committee meeting are technically or \n     logistically feasible in the space that the meeting is being \n     held.\n     Section 514. Amendments and motions to recommit\n       Section 514 amends Rule XV of the Senate to require that an \n     amendment and any instruction accompanying a motion to \n     recommit be reduced to writing and read, and that identical \n     copies be provided to the desks and the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders before being debated. Section 514 further amends Rule \n     XV to require motions to be reduced to writing if desired by \n     the Presiding Officer or any Senator, and be read before \n     being debated.\n     Section 515. Sense of the Senate on conference committee \n         protocols\n       Section 515 expresses the Sense of the Senate that \n     conference committees should hold regular, formal meetings of \n     all conferees that are open to the public, that conferees \n     should be given adequate notice of the time and place of such \n     meetings, and be allowed to participate in full and complete \n     debate on the matter before the committee, and that the text \n     of the report of a conference committee should not be changed \n     after the signature sheets have been signed by a majority of \n     the Senate conferees.\n     Section 521. Congressionally directed spending\n       Section 521 establishes a new Senate Rule XLIV, which \n     provides sweeping reforms to the treatment of so-called \n     ``earmarks,'' limited tax benefits, and limited tariff \n     benefits in legislation before the Senate. With respect to \n     ``earmarks,'' the Rule provides a more accurate term--\n     congressionally directed spending items--because \n     congressional ``earmarks'' merely reflect the spending \n     priorities of Congress, just as Presidential ``earmarks'' \n     reflect the spending priorities of the President. The \n     Constitution provides Congress control over the \n     appropriations of the federal government, and congressionally \n     directed spending constitutes a legitimate and important \n     exercise of that authority. Rule XLIV also creates rules for \n     ``limited tax benefits'' and limited tariff benefits in \n     legislation--essentially, tax provisions and tariff \n     suspensions that assist only a small number of beneficiaries. \n     The provisions of Rule XLIV fall into three main categories--\n     transparency, accountability, and discipline.\n       Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the new rule require the Chairman of \n     the committee of jurisdiction (or the Majority Leader or his \n     or designee) to certify that all congressionally directed \n     spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff \n     benefits in bills and joint resolutions (and accompanying \n     reports), have been identified through lists charts, or other \n     similar means, including the name of each Senate sponsor, on \n     a publicly accessible congressional website, in a searchable \n     format, at least 48 hours before the vote on the motion to \n     proceed to consider the bill or joint resolution. If a point \n     of order is sustained, then the motion to proceed shall be \n     suspended until the sponsor of the motion (or his or her \n     designee) has requested resumption and compliance with the \n     requirements of the relevant paragraph has been achieved. In \n     light of the possibility that it may take a day or more for \n     compliance to be achieved and/or for a request for \n     resumption, suspended motions under these paragraphs shall \n     not terminate when Congress adjourns.\n       Paragraph 3 establishes a similar rule for conference \n     reports the Chairman of the committee of jurisdiction (or the \n     Majority Leader or his or her designee) must certify that all \n     congressionally directed spending items, limited tax \n     benefits, and limited tariff benefits in bills and joint \n     resolutions (and the accompanying joint statement of \n     managers), have been identified through lists, charts, or \n     other similar means, including the name of each Senate \n     sponsor, on a publicly accessible congressional website at \n     least 48 hours before the vote on adoption of the conference \n     report. If a point of order is sustained under paragraph 3, \n     then the conference report shall be set aside.\n       The bill follows the basic approach taken by the House, \n     which has ensured broad transparency throughout the \n     appropriations process for the FY08 bills. In each case under \n     paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, the point of order lies as to the \n     existence or not of the certification. Especially given that \n     the definition of ``congressionally directed spending'' \n     requires that the item be included in the bill ``primarily at \n     the request of a Senator,'' the Parliamentarian has no \n     capacity to determine whether a given item is or is not a \n     ``congressionally directed spending'' item and thus is not in \n     a position to determine the accuracy of the list. Requiring \n     the Parliamentarian to make such a determination \n     independently is not only unworkable in practice (e.g., even \n     if the Parliamentarian could make a determination, it would \n     take a tremendous amount of time and resources to compile the \n     lists that are already compiled by numerous committees, each \n     with their own staff), it is impossible--the Parliamentarian \n     has no choice but to defer to the Committee Chair in \n     determining why a particular item was included in a bill. \n     Similarly, the Parliamentarian is not in a position to know \n     the number of individuals or entities impacted by a tax or \n     tariff provision, and so must defer to the relevant Committee \n     Chair on that information.\n       The authors fully expect that Committee Chairs (and in the \n     unusual case that the Majority Leader or his or her designee \n     must provide the certification, the Majority Leader or \n     designee) will fully, honestly, and in good faith, comply \n     with the requirements of the new Rule. Given the role of the \n     Ranking Member in compiling the bill and the list of \n     congressionally directed spending items, a Chairman may \n     request that the Ranking Member (and the Chair and Ranking \n     Member of a relevant subcommittee) join him or her in making \n     the certification. In addition, it is consistent with the \n     spirit of the rule if a Committee Chair chooses to identify \n     Presidential earmark requests.\n       Rule XLIV provides rules on waivers and appeals from \n     paragraphs 1, 2, and 3. Waivers may be made after a point of \n     order has been raised or prospectively. The rule also places \n     limits on appeals, because a successful appeal would \n     eviscerate the paragraph under\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\n     which the appealed ruling had been made, eliminating the new \n     transparency to which the Senate has committed itself. Rule \n     XLIV places limits on debate for appeals and waivers, so that \n     these are not used as dilatory measures.\n       Paragraph 4 of new Rule XLIV requires Senators that propose \n     amendments containing congressionally directed spending \n     items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits to \n     identify each such item, and the Senate sponsor, in the \n     Congressional Record as soon as practicable. Paragraph 4 also \n     directs Committees to make publicly available on the Internet \n     as soon as practicable after reporting a bill or joint \n     resolution, the list of congressionally directed spending \n     items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits \n     included in the bill, joint resolution or accompanying \n     report. Finally, paragraph 4 states that, to the extent \n     technically feasible, information provided under paragraphs 3 \n     and 4 shall be provided in a searchable format. The \n     electronic version of the Congressional Record constitutes \n     one option for a ``searchable'' publication.\n       Paragraph 7 provides that, for congressionally directed \n     spending items in classified portions of a report \n     accompanying a bill, joint resolution, or conference report, \n     the committee of jurisdiction shall, to the greatest extent \n     practicable consistent with the need to protect national \n     security, provide a general program description, funding \n     level, and name of Senate sponsor.\n       In addition to the requirement that Senate sponsors of \n     congressionally directed spending items, limited tax \n     benefits, and limited tariff benefits be identified, Rule \n     XLIV requires accountability through paragraphs 6 and 9. \n     Paragraph 6 requires Senators who request congressionally \n     directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited \n     tariff benefits to provide a written statement to the \n     relevant Chairman and Ranking Member that identifies the name \n     and location of the intended recipient or activity, the \n     purpose of the item, and a certification that neither the \n     Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary \n     interest in the item, consistent with the requirements of \n     paragraph 9. Paragraph 9 makes the requirements of Rule \n     XXXVII(4)--the longstanding Senate Rule against financial \n     interest by Senators and Senate employees relating to any \n     legislative action--specific to actions relating to \n     congressionally directed spending items, limited tax \n     benefits, and limited tariff benefits. It is anticipated that \n     the Select Committee on Ethics will apply the requirements of \n     paragraph 9 (including as incorporated by reference into \n     paragraph 6) identical to the way in which it has applied \n     Rule XXXVII(4).\n       Finally, Rule XLIV provides an important tool for \n     disciplining the conference process to ensure that new \n     directed spending provisions--i.e., directed spending \n     provisions not included in either the House or the Senate \n     bill committed to conference--are not added in conference. \n     Specifically, paragraph 8 allows any Senator to raise a point \n     of order against one or more new directed spending provisions \n     added in conference. (It is important to note that the term \n     ``new directed spending provision'' is defined differently \n     than the term ``congressionally directed spending item.'') \n     The term ``measure'' as used in paragraph 8 refers only to \n     the bill or amendment committed to the conferees by either \n     House. If the point of order is sustained, then the provision \n     is struck from the bill and the Senate will then proceed to \n     consider whether to concur in the bill as so amended by the \n     removal of the material stricken on the point(s) of order, \n     and send it back to the House. The rule includes the \n     possibility of 60-vote waivers for points of order under the \n     rule. The language is similar to that used in the so-called \n     ``Byrd'' rule and is intended to be interpreted similarly--\n     waivers may be as to one, multiple, or all points of order \n     under the rule; waivers may be made after a point of order \n     has been raised or prospectively.\n       Rule XLIV provides for a number of points of orders, and \n     sets out rules for accompanying waivers and appeals. If Rule \n     XLIV does not expressly provide for a point of order with \n     respect to a provision, then no point of order shall lie \n     under that provision. Rule XLIV also includes in paragraph \n     11, a waiver of all points of order under the rule with \n     respect to a pending measure. As with other waivers in the \n     rule, it may be made after a point of order has been made \n     or prospectively.\n     Section 531. Post employment restrictions\n       Section 531 amends the current ``revolving door'' \n     restrictions in Rule XXXVII of the Senate Rules. \n     Specifically, Section 531 amends the rule to prohibit \n     Senators from lobbying Congress for two years after they \n     leave office and prohibits officers and senior employees from \n     lobbying the Senate for one year after they leave Senate \n     employment. Senior employees of the Senate are those who, for \n     at least 60 days, during the 1-year period before they leave \n     Senate employment are paid a rate of basic pay equal to or \n     greater than 75 percent of the basic rate of pay payable to a \n     Senator.\n       The new ``revolving door'' restrictions are effective only \n     for Senate staff that terminate Senate employment on or after \n     the date that the 1st session of the 110th Congress adjourns \n     sine die or December 31, 2007, whichever is earlier. A \n     delayed effective date was deemed more reasonable and \n     practical than an immediate effective date.\n     Section 532. Disclosure by Members of Congress and staff of \n         employment negotiations\n       Section 532 amends Senate Rule XXVIII to add new disclosure \n     requirements for employment negotiations. This provision \n     requires Senators to disclose within 3 business days any \n     negotiations they engage in to secure future employment \n     before their successor is elected. The new addition to Rule \n     XXXVII also prohibits Senators from seeking employment at all \n     as a registered lobbyist until his or her successor has been \n     elected. It requires senior staff to notify the Ethics \n     Committee within 3 days of beginning negotiations for future \n     employment, and to recuse themselves from involvement in a \n     matter should employment negotiations create a conflict of \n     interest or the appearance of a conflict.\n     Section 533. Elimination of floor privileges for former \n         Members, Senate officers, and Speakers of the House who \n         are lobbyists or seek financial gain\n       This section amends Senate Rule XXIII to revoke floor \n     privileges and the use of the Members' athletic facilities \n     and parking for former Senators, former Secretaries of the \n     Senate, former Sergeants at Arms of the Senate and former \n     Speakers of the House who are registered lobbyists. The Rules \n     Committee will issue guidelines to allow those affected by \n     this provision to participate in ceremonial functions and \n     events on the Senate floor.\n     Section 534. Influencing hiring decisions\n       Section 534 amends Senate Rule XLIII to specifically \n     prohibit members from taking official action or threatening \n     to take official action in an effort to influence hiring \n     decisions of private organizations on the sole basis of \n     partisan political affiliation. This section is not intended \n     to preclude Senators from providing references or writing \n     letters of recommendation that speak to the credentials of an \n     individual.\n     Section 535. Notification of post-employment restrictions\n       Section 535 requires the Secretary of the Senate to notify \n     Members, officers or employees of the Senate of the beginning \n     and end dates of their post-employment lobbying restrictions \n     under the Senate Rules. It is expected that the Secretary of \n     the Senate will encourage Senators and staff to contact the \n     Ethics Committee for a full explanation of the terms of their \n     post-employment lobbying restrictions. This provision goes \n     into effect 60 days after the date of enactment.\n     Section 541. Ban on gifts from lobbyists and entities that \n         hire lobbyists\n       Section 541 amends the gift rules in Rule XXXV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate. This provision prohibits \n     Senators and their staff from accepting gifts from registered \n     lobbyists or entities that hire or employ them. The provision \n     does not alter the exceptions under Rule XXXV(1)(c).\n     Section 542. National party conventions\n       This provision prohibits Senators from attending parties \n     held in their honor at national party conventions if they \n     have been directly paid for by lobbyists, unless the Senator \n     is the party's presidential or vice presidential nominee.\n     Section 543. Proper valuation of tickets to entertainment and \n         sporting events\n       Section 543 specifies that the market value of a ticket to \n     an entertainment or sporting event shall be the face value of \n     the ticket, or in the case of a ticket without a face value, \n     the value of the highest priced ticket to the event. It \n     allows the ticket holder to establish that a ticket without a \n     face value is equivalent to a ticket priced less than the \n     highest priced ticket by providing information related to the \n     primary features of the ticket to the Ethics Committee. In \n     order for a ticket holder to have the option to establish \n     ``equivalency,'' he or she must provide information to the \n     Ethics Committee prior to attending the event. The Committee \n     may accept information obtained on the Internet from venues \n     and third-party ticket vendors.\n     Section 544. Restrictions on lobbyist participation in travel \n         and disclosure\n       Section 544 makes significant changes to the provisions in \n     paragraph 2 of Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     relating to reimbursement for travel for Senators and staff \n     from third parties. Section 544 prohibits certain types of \n     travel altogether, restricts other travel, and imposes new \n     requirements applicable to all privately funded travel.\n       Section 544 generally prohibits privately funded travel \n     paid for by entities that hire lobbyists or foreign agents. \n     It creates two exceptions from this general rule. First, \n     section 544 allows trips paid for by entities that hire \n     lobbyists or foreign agents if they are for one-day's \n     attendance/participation at an appropriate event (exclusive \n     of travel time and an overnight stay). The Select Committee \n     on Ethics is given authority to issue guidelines that would \n     allow a two-night stay when practically required to \n     participate in an event (e.g., an event requiring travel \n     across the country). With respect to these ``one day \n     trips,'' in addition to the other restrictions described \n     below, the new rule prohibits lobbyists from accompanying \n     the Member, officer, or employee on any ``segment of the \n     trip'' in other than a de minimis way, and requires a trip \n     sponsor to provide a certification to that effect. It is \n     intended that this language be interpreted identically to \n     the interpretation given similar language by the House \n     Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in its \n     memorandum dated March 14, 2007.\n       Second, section 544 allows trips paid for by 501(c)(3) \n     organizations, regardless of whether\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\n     the organization hires a lobbyist or foreign agent. The \n     Senate made the judgment that 501(c)(3)s, due to their non-\n     profit and often educational or public-interest nature were \n     not likely to be a source of abuse. In this respect, \n     501(c)(3)s are treated similar to entities that do not hire \n     lobbyists or foreign agents.\n       Section 544 also establishes new rules across the board for \n     all trips. It requires pre-approval from the Select Committee \n     on Ethics for all trips. The Select Committee on Ethics must \n     issue guidelines on the factors it will use to pre-approve a \n     trip.\n       Additionally, regardless of trip sponsor, section 544 \n     prohibits Senators, officers, or staff from participating in \n     trips planned, organized, or arranged by or at the request of \n     a lobbyist or foreign agent in other than a de minimis way, \n     and a trip sponsor must provide a certification to that \n     effect. As a general matter, the term ``de minimis'' means \n     negligible or inconsequential. It would be ``negligible or \n     inconsequential'' for a lobbyist to respond to a trip \n     sponsor's request that the lobbyist identify Members or staff \n     with a possible interest in a particular issue relevant to a \n     planned trip or to suggest particular aspects of a Member or \n     staffer's interest known to the lobbyist. For instance, if a \n     trip sponsor that was a 501(c)(3) asked a lobbyist which \n     staffers might be most interested in joining a trip to the \n     U.S.-Mexican border and the lobbyist knew that a potential \n     trip participant had a particular interest in the DEA's \n     activities at the border, or in a particular border facility, \n     then the conveyance and receipt of that information (in light \n     of the trip sponsor's request), in and of itself, would not \n     exceed a de minimis level of participation. Additionally, the \n     mere presence of one or more lobbyists on the board of an \n     organization does not exceed a de minimis involvement. If a \n     lobbyist solicits or initiates an exchange of information \n     with a trip sponsor, however, that would go beyond de \n     minimis. Additionally, if the lobbyist has ultimate control \n     over which Members or staff are actually invited on the trip, \n     or determines the trip itinerary, each of these would go \n     beyond de minimis. Certainly, if a lobbyist actually extends \n     or forwards an invitation to a participant, or if an \n     invitation mentions a referral or suggestion of a lobbyist, \n     each of these would go beyond de minimis.\n       For all trips other than one day trips paid for by entities \n     that hire lobbyists, the new rule prohibits a lobbyist from \n     accompanying the Member, officer, or employee ``at any point \n     throughout the trip'' in other than a de minimis way. This \n     language should be interpreted in a manner different--and \n     more broadly--than the concept of ``any segment of the \n     trip.''\n       Both lobbyist ``accompaniment'' standards include a de \n     minimis exception. The Act directs the Select Committee on \n     Ethics to issue guidance on what constitutes ``de minimis.'' \n     If the trip includes attendance at an event that meets the \n     definition of a ``widely attended event'' under Rule \n     XXXV(1)(c)(18), the trip sponsor is unlikely to know all \n     attendees at the event. Accordingly, a lobbyist's attendance \n     at a ``widely attended event'' also attended on the trip \n     would be a type of de minimis ``accompaniment.'' Similarly, \n     an organization cannot possibly know the other passengers \n     that might be on a common carrier used during a trip if the \n     organization has had no contact or coordination with these \n     other passengers. Accordingly, the new rule does not require \n     a sponsor to certify that it knows for certain that no \n     lobbyist will be on such a common carrier.\n       Section 544 also improves disclosure of privately funded \n     travel. It requires Members, officers and Senate employees to \n     disclose the expenses reimbursed by a private entity not \n     later than 30 days after the travel is completed and requires \n     disclosure of greater detail on the types of meetings and \n     events attended on the trip.\n       Section 544 includes a separate provision relating to \n     flights on private jets. This provision requires Senators to \n     pay full market value--defined as charter rates--for flights \n     on private jets, with an exception for jets owned by \n     immediate family members (or non-public corporations in which \n     the Senator or an immediate family member has an ownership \n     interest).\n       In general, the changes made by section 544 go into effect \n     60 days after enactment, or the date that the Select \n     Committee on Ethics issues the required guidelines under the \n     rule, whichever is later. Until the new rules take effect, \n     the existing rules for travel will remain in place. In light \n     of the transition to the new rule relating to reimbursement \n     for flights on private jets and the lack of experience in \n     many offices in determining ``charter rates,'' the Select \n     Committee on Ethics may treat reimbursement at current rates \n     as reimbursement at charter rates for a transition period not \n     to exceed 60 days.\n       Section 544 includes an important caveat--nothing in \n     section 544 or section 541 is meant to alter law or treatment \n     under Senate rules, of gifts and travel that fall under the \n     Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act or the Mutual Educational \n     and Cultural Exchange Act. Gifts and travel under those \n     provisions are governed by a separate regulatory regime.\n       Section 544 directs the Legislative Branch Appropriations \n     subcommittee, and the Committee on Rules to examine within 90 \n     days whether congressional travel allowances will need to be \n     adjusted in light of the new restrictions on privately funded \n     travel.\n     Section 545. Free attendance at a constituent event\n       Section 545 creates a new, narrow exception, to the gift \n     rule for small constituent events. Specifically, section 545 \n     allows Senators, officers or employees to accept free \n     attendance at a conference, convention, symposium, forum, \n     panel discussion, dinner event, site visit, viewing, \n     reception or similar event in their home state if it is \n     sponsored by constituents or a group of constituents, and \n     attended primarily by at least 5 constituents, provided that \n     there are no registered lobbyists in attendance, and that the \n     cost of any meal served is less than $50.\n     Section 546. Senate privately paid travel public website\n       This provision directs the Secretary of the Senate to \n     develop a publicly available, searchable website by January \n     1, 2008 to post Senators' travel information that is required \n     to be disclosed under rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n     Section 551. Compliance with Lobbying Disclosure\n       Section 551 makes clear that former members and staff who \n     are registered lobbyists may contact the staff of the \n     Secretary of the Senate regarding compliance with the \n     lobbying disclosure requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure \n     Act of 1995 despite post-employment lobbying restrictions.\n     Section 552. Prohibit official contact with spouse or \n         immediate family member who is a registered lobbyist\n       This provision prohibits Senate spouses who are registered \n     lobbyists from engaging in lobbying contacts with any Senate \n     office, but exempts Senate spouses who were serving as \n     registered lobbyists at least one year prior to the most \n     recent election of their spouse to office, or at least one \n     year prior to their marriage to that Member.\n       The provision also prohibits a Senator's immediate family \n     members (including a spouse) who are registered lobbyists, \n     from engaging in lobbying contacts with the Senator's staff.\n     Section 553. Mandatory Senate ethics training for Members and \n         staff\n       This section requires the Ethics Committee to conduct \n     ongoing ethics training and awareness programs for Senators \n     and Senate staff.\n     Section 554. Annual report by Select Committee on Ethics\n       Section 554 directs the Ethics Committee to issue an annual \n     report that describes the number of alleged violations of \n     Senate rules received from any source, a list of the number \n     of alleged violations that were dismissed, the number of \n     alleged violations in which the committee conducted a \n     preliminary inquiry, the number of alleged violations that \n     resulted in an adjudicatory review, the number of alleged \n     violations that the committee dismissed, the number of \n     letters of admonition issued and the number of matters \n     resulting in disciplinary sanction. Nothing in this section \n     requires or allows the Ethics Committee to violate the \n     confidential nature of its proceedings.\n     Section 555. Exercise of rule making power\n       This section acknowledges that the Senate adopts the \n     provisions in this title as an exercise of its rule making \n     power with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules at any time.\n     Section 556. Effective dates and general provisions\n       All sections in this title go into effect upon enactment \n     except for section 513, which goes into effect 90 days after \n     enactment; section 531: This title shall take effect on the \n     date of enactment unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n              Title VI--Prohibited Use of Private Aircraft\n\n     Section 601. Restrictions on Use of Campaign Funds for \n         Flights on Non Commercial Aircraft\n       Section 601 amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to \n     require that candidates, other than those running for a seat \n     in the House of Representatives, pay the fair market value of \n     airfare when using non-commercial jets to travel. Fair market \n     value is to be determined by dividing the fair market value \n     of the charter fare of the aircraft, by the number of \n     candidates on the flight. This provision exempts aircraft \n     owned or leased by candidates or candidates' immediate family \n     members (or non-public corporations in which the Senator or \n     his or her immediate family member has an ownership \n     interest). The bill prohibits candidates for the House of \n     Representatives from any campaign use of privately-owned, \n     non-chartered jets.\n       Many candidates are not accustomed to determining charter \n     rates. The FEC may, during a transition period of no more \n     than 60 days, deem reimbursement at current rates to be \n     charter rates while committees determine how to calculate \n     charter rates.\n\n\n                   Title VII Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n     Section 701. Sense of the Congress that any applicable \n         restrictions on Congressional branch employees should \n         apply to the Executive and Judicial branches\n       This section expresses the Sense of Congress that any \n     applicable restrictions on Congressional branch employees in \n     this title should apply to the executive and judicial \n     branches.\n     Section 702. Knowing and willful falsification or failure to \n         report\n       This provision increases from $10,000 to $50,000 the \n     penalty for knowingly and willfully falsifying or knowingly \n     and willfully failing to report financial disclosure forms\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\n     required by the Ethics in Government Act. It imposes a \n     criminal penalty of up to one year of imprisonment and/or a \n     fine for knowingly and willfully falsifying such report and \n     imposes a fine for knowingly and willfully failing to file \n     such report.\n     Section 703. Rule of construction\n       Section 703 provides that nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to prohibit any conduct or activities protected by \n     the free speech, free exercise, or free association clauses \n     of the First Amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 19 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to \nsay something in response.\n  Basically, the earmark language is formed on the DeMint language that \nwas in the Senate bill. What happened was that staff sat down with all \nof the Parliamentarians for several hours to determine the workability \nunder Senate rules and procedures of the language. Amendments were made \nthat would make the language workable.\n  Now the Senator from South Carolina contends that the \nParliamentarians should review the entire bill and rule on whether each \nand every earmark is listed by the Chair and vet that earmark.\n  When our offices spoke with the Parliamentarian's office, we realized \nthat this was not a workable situation and could lead to gridlock in \nthe Senate. Now, maybe that is what the junior Senator from South \nCarolina wants, but I, for one, believe the American people want us to \ncarry out their business.\n  There is full disclosure. There is full transparency. The committee \nchairs must certify that the earmark list is complete. It must be \npublished on the Internet 48 hours before it comes before the Senate. \nDisclosure and transparency is what earmark reform is all about. No \nmore dark of night additions to bills, even when the conference \ncommittee is often closed.\n  Once again, if the junior Senator from South Carolina had allowed a \nconference, Members would have been able to sit down in the full light \nof day and, Member to Member, House to Senate, discuss this. But \ninstead, he alone--he alone--despite importation after importation to \nallow the conference to go ahead, would not allow it to go ahead. One \nMember. That effectively would have stopped the bill--stopped the bill. \nInstead, the majority leader and the Speaker of the House, after the \nbill passed the House by a wide margin, believed this was too important \nto let one Member--one Member--stop it. So they figured a way to bring \na bill from the House, which is what is now before us.\n\n  To me, this is all sour milk, spoiled milk. He would have stopped the \nbill dead if he could have his way. But it didn't happen that way. And \nyou know, there is more than one Member of the Senate. There are more \nthan 2, 3, 4 or 5; there are 100 Members. Members' views have to be \ntaken into consideration.\n  Yes, there was some change in the language, but there is nothing in \nthe change of language that in any way, shape or form stops full \ndisclosure or the certification of the committee chair or stops putting \nit on the Internet 48 hours before it comes to the board. It is real \nreform.\n  I hope there will be the votes here for cloture. I urge the Senate of \nthe United States to vote for cloture on what is the most significant \nethics and lobbying reform bill since Watergate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this good and \nopen debate. I remind them that I supported this bill in the beginning \nand have asked unanimous consent a number of times that it go to \nconference. As many of us have pointed out, the earmark provision is a \nSenate rule that doesn't need to be conferenced with the House. The \nonly reason to make it part of a conference bill is so it can be \nchanged.\n  I offered all along that if there were changes the majority wanted to \nmake, we were very open to that. We wanted to end up with some real \nearmark transparency that all of us have voted on. As we have pointed \nout this morning, it is not disclosed, and it is not transparent if the \nmajority can simply say it is, without having to prove its accuracy. \nThat has been the cause of so much corruption. I think it is certainly \nworth stopping and looking at what we have done.\n  This language is hardly minor, as far as the change that has taken \nplace. If it were, the majority would not insist that their version \nrule today. I urge all my colleagues to vote against cloture--not to \nvote against ethics reform, which we all support, but to vote against \nthis process that will not allow us to reinsert something we all voted \nfor and we all said in public is the right way to handle earmark \nreform.\n  I thank the majority leader for all his work. I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, more than 6 months after the Senate \npassed its own lobby reform bill, we are now being asked to vote on a \nDemocrat-written alternative that promises to be less effective but in \nsome ways stronger than current law.\n  I was a cosponsor of the original version, and its passage by an \noverwhelming vote of 96 to 2 in January marked an early high point of \nbipartisanship in this session and it was an unmistakable sign of the \nstrength of that original bill.\n  Americans were right to be outraged by the scandals that surfaced \nlast year. They were right to hold their lawmakers to the highest \nstandards of conduct, and passing this bill will send a strong and \nnecessary signal that the Senate has recommitted itself to that trust.\n  As I said, in some key areas, this bill is an improvement over the \nstatus quo. But this isn't the bill I would have written, and it would \nhave benefited from a lot of Republican input.\n  The earmarks provision was passed unanimously in January and was \nsupported by every single Democrat in the Senate, and it was strong; \nthe earmarks provision in this bill is not.\n  Several new provisions make hardly any sense at all. My largest \nconcern is what we are doing to our own staff. It is unclear to me why \nin this bill we treat House staff more leniently than our most trusted \nadvisers in the Senate or even those in the executive branch, for that \nmatter. I find this provision particularly offensive.\n  The gift ban and the new travel restrictions are tricky and vague by \nextending the ban to not just lobbyists but also to any entities that \nemploy or retain them. Does that mean I have to refuse the key to a \ncity, since cities have their own lobbyists and mayors belong to \nassociations that employ and retain them?\n  How about a 22-year-old staff assistant who has to wait tables to \nmake ends meet? What happens when they wait on a lobbyist or someone \nwho works for an organization that retains one? Do they have to refuse \ntheir tips? You get the drift.\n  This provision is bound to create problems for well-intentioned \nMembers and staff. I look to the Ethics Committee to provide some \nclarity to what, at the very least, can be described as a rather murky \nand unworkable provision.\n  The new rule on charter flights is seriously deficient. Members who \nare rich enough, or have family members rich enough, to own their own \nplanes have nothing, of course, to worry about. Everybody else does.\n  For example, all Presidents, who are required by the Secret Service \nto travel on Air Force One, will have to reimburse the Government at \nthe full charter rate--which is roughly $400,000 per hour--if they use \nit for campaign travel. That not only means the end of Presidential \nfundraisers outside Washington for Democrats and Republicans, it means \nthe end of Presidents doing fundraisers for Members outside the \nDistrict of Columbia. You would have to have a $5 million fundraiser to \npay\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\nfor the trip. I assume this was not the intent of the authors of the \nbill, but it will be the effect of what they have written. I know some \nMembers, in particular, who might be surprised to learn about this. We \nhave many of them in this body running for President on both sides.\n  Every one of these weaknesses would have been improved with \nRepublican input, but we were unable to do so because there was not a \nconference.\n  I assure you we will return to the earmarks provision. It will be \nback. This bill isn't nearly as tough as it would have been on earmarks \nif Republicans had been involved in writing it. But weighing the good \nand the bad, many provisions are stronger than current law. I will \nsupport its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that all time has \nbeen used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last November, there was a call across this \ncountry that culminated in the November election. It was a call for a \nchange in the way Congress does its business. We had nine new \nDemocratic Senators. During the campaign, they called for change--and \nthey will achieve change today.\n  The legislation before us shows Congress heard this call for change. \nThe change we have in this legislation, in fact, is big-time change. It \nis the most significant change in lobbying and ethics rules in the \nhistory of our country--some have said since Watergate, but I say in \nthe history of our country.\n  This is S. 1, which was the first bill introduced in this body this \nyear--our first and most important bill of the new Congress. Why was it \nNo. 1? The American people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--\nknew our progress would depend on renewing the people's faith in the \nintegrity of Congress. What does this legislation do?\n  Among other things, it requires Senators to pay fair market prices \nfor charter flights, putting an end to abuses of corporate travel.\n  This legislation slows the revolving door by extending the ban on \nlobbying by former Members of Congress and senior staffers, and it \nprevents Senators from even negotiating for a job as a lobbyist until \ntheir successor has been elected.\n  It puts an end to pay-to-play schemes such as the notorious K Street \nProject. It shines the light of day on lobbying activities by vastly \nincreasing disclosure requirements, including disclosure of bundled \ncampaign contributions.\n  It requires the Senate to disclose all earmarks for the first time \never.\n  We originally passed it by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 96 to \n2.\n  In June, I tried to send the bill to conference. I tried and I tried, \nbut we were unable to go to conference because of objections by the \nminority. Some Republican colleagues expressed concern that this bill \nmight lead to legislation that doesn't achieve the goals of the \noriginal bipartisan bill. I assured them then, and I assure them now, \nthis bill has teeth. I asked them to withhold judgment until the final \nbill was complete.\n  I have heard a number of statements today about this bill from some \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle. They say we gutted \nearmark disclosure, that we have tried to hide earmarks, keep them in \nthe shadows. This claim is just absurd.\n  For the first time ever, Senate Democrats have required all \ncommittees to disclose their earmarks and earmark sponsors. We didn't \nhave to. It wasn't the law. But we did it. Last year, when the \nRepublicans controlled this institution, not one earmark was disclosed. \nI don't recall a single speech about that failure last year by any of \nthe Republicans who have spoken today.\n  Now, for the first time ever, we are already being transparent--fully \ntransparent--about earmarks, and we are here to talk about that. But we \nhear these breathless claims made today that earmarks are being hidden. \nHow can you describe how ridiculous that is? That is what it is.\n  Thirty-four pages of this legislation deal with earmarks. I might \nboast a little bit. Other staffs have worked on this, but I had two of \nthe finest legal minds in this community working on it: Ron Weich, a \ngraduate of Yale Law School, who worked on Capitol Hill for many years \nwith Senator Kennedy, went downtown and became a very successful \nlawyer. He decided he wanted to engage in more public service, so he \ncame back to Congress to work with me. He is an experienced attorney, \nand he worked on this. He also worked with a Harvard law graduate, Mike \nCastellano, a wonderful young man who has spent months--not weeks, not \ndays, not hours but months--working on this. So for anyone to castigate \nthis legislation, they are castigating these two fine men, who have \nworked with numerous people throughout this body.\n  For each of the 11 appropriations bills reported so far this year, \nsimilar earmark disclosure is available on the Internet. It is already \nsearchable. Those talking about earmarks, my Republican friends, are \neither ignorant of what is already happening or they are living in a \nparallel universe.\n  This legislation puts into the Senate rules the revolution in earmark \ndisclosure and accountability we began this year. It requires all \nearmarks in bills, joint resolutions, and conference reports be \ndisclosed on the Internet 48 hours prior to action on the floor. We \ndon't intend to have to wait until 48 hours, so the bill directs \ncommittees to issue earmark lists as soon as possible after the bill is \nreported.\n  The bill requires that earmarks and amendments be posted on the \nInternet as soon as possible after being introduced. The language \noriginating in S. 1 did not have any rules on amendments. We put them \nin there. If we were trying to hide amendments and hide earmarks, why \nwould we add that to the bill?\n  This legislation, for the first time ever, allows a point of order to \nbe raised against new earmarks added in conference.\n  One of the main arguments used by the opponents of reform is that the \ncertification required by the committee chair or the majority leader \nwould be a sham. We deal all the time with budget points of order. Do \nmy colleagues think the Parliamentarians will say: Let's see, does this \namendment exceed scoring levels? No, they have to depend on the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee reports to them. \nThey depend on the Budget Committee. The Parliamentarians--that is what \nthey do, they are referees but they get their information from the \ncommittee chairman.\n  The argument of my opponents is beyond the pale. If effect, these \nSenators are arguing that the committee chairs and the leaders would \ncheat and lie. Who other than the chairman of the committee, similar to \nthe Budget Committee, can tell the Parliamentarian where there are \nearmarks? It is impossible for the Parliamentarian to know if a Senator \nhas requested an item. Someone has to tell him. I'm sure these Senators \nare not saying that Senator Byrd or Senator Cochran would lie. That is \nnot a very good argument to use in this body. To say that would be an \naffront to what we do around here.\n  Further, the opponents have ignored a simple and unavoidable fact. \nThe definition of ``earmark'' requires that the provision be added \nprimarily at the request of a Senator. The Parliamentarian can't know \nthat. The only person who could ever know for sure how a provision got \nadded to the bill is the author of the legislation, the committee \nchair. The Parliamentarian has no capacity to figure out that a \nprovision was added primarily at the request of a Senator, or was added \nbecause the President wanted it, or because everyone agreed it was a \ngood policy. Under any circumstances, the Parliamentarian would have no \nchoice but to defer to the committee chair.\n  I ask my friend, the junior Senator from South Carolina, as an \nexample, to understand the hard work put into this legislation--hard \nwork, really hard work. If there is something that is wrong with the \nlegislation, talk to us about it. We will try to change it in \nsubsequent legislation if this doesn't work. If there is a problem, I \nam happy to work with him, but don't denigrate this bill. We worked \nhard on it.\n  I so appreciate the work of Chairman Feinstein. I so appreciate the \nwork of Chairman Lieberman. They both have reputations that are \nimpeccable. One may not always agree with their policy, but their \nability for honesty and integrity is above reproach.\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\n  I must also talk about Russ Feingold. When this session started, I \nasked Russ Feingold to draw up legislation, and he did that, and we \nhave worked around that. Does anyone question the integrity of Russ \nFeingold? You cannot question his integrity, Dianne Feinstein's, or Joe \nLieberman's integrity. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  Anyone saying this bill is an obscenity--that is what one Senator \nsaid in the press, that this legislation is obscene--is impugning the \nintegrity of three of the finest public servants we have in this \ncountry.\n  Another important leader on this issue is Senator Obama. He was in \nmany ways the face of this bill last year. He has played an important \nrole last year and this year, and I appreciate his input into this \nlegislation.\n  This bill is not just a little bit of reform. Just listen to the \noutside reformers. Fred Wertheimer, a man who has been in this town \nsince I have been here, talking about how we can improve this body in \nmany different ways, Fred Wertheimer said this is ``landmark \nlegislation.'' Those are his words, not mine.\n  The effort by opponents to try to denigrate this legislation is \nshameful. I don't care if they disagree with this legislation, but \ndon't impugn the integrity of the people who are trying to do something \nthat is positive and good.\n  This is good legislation. We have succeeded, the Democratic majority \nhas succeeded. I appreciate the support of the minority, but the \nDemocrats have succeeded in what Republicans couldn't do last year or \nthe year before, and they have seized on one issue, earmarks, and blown \nit way out of all proportionality or rationality and have ignored \nreality to create doubts in people's minds.\n  The fact is, we have sweeping reform legislation in a whole host of \nareas--gifts, travel, lobbyist disclosure, stealth coalitions, \nreporting of lobbyist contributions, the revolving door. It is \nsweeping. The bill will change the way we do business.\n  Our work on this issue is done for now. I am confident the judgment \nof Democrats and Republicans alike will be favorable. The vote was 411 \nto 8 in the House of Representatives. Let us do the same. Let us send a \nmessage from coast to coast that this Congress is serious about \ndelivering to the American people a government as good and as honest as \nthe people it serves.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment on S. 1, \nthe Ethics Reform bill.\n         Joe Lieberman, Harry Reid, Byron L. Dorgan, Patty Murray, \n           Mark Pryor, Jeff Bingaman, Jack Reed, Dick Durbin, Jon \n           Tester, Tom Carper, Pat Leahy, Benjamin L.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur in the House amendment to S. 1, an act to provide \ngreater transparency in the legislative process, and for other \npurposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMinnesota (Ms. Klobuchar) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Coleman).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, we have two Senators who have requested to \nspeak on this matter. Senator Byrd wishes 20 minutes, Senator \nMcCaskill, 10 minutes. Following that, we would return to SCHIP and the \nvote on this bill--cloture was just invoked--will occur at 1:50 this \nafternoon. The time between 1:30 and--the time after Senators Byrd and \nMcCaskill speak will be controlled by Senators Baucus and Grassley.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the motion to concur with the \namendments be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at the beginning of this Congress, I \ncommitted to adding transparency and accountability to the process of \nearmarking funds for specific projects.\n  I see my friend from Mississippi here, the ranking member, on the \nSenate floor. I will say that again. Hear me.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I committed to adding transparency \nand accountability to the process of earmarking funds for specific \nprojects. While awaiting action by the Congress on ethics reform \nlegislation, Senator Cochran, the able and very highly respected \nSenator from Mississippi who is on the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Cochran and I--Senator Cochran is on the Senate floor at this \npoint, I say for the record--Senator Cochran and I established rigorous \nstandards for increasing such transparency. Based on those standards, \nthe Appropriations Committee has reported, on a bipartisan basis, 11 \nappropriations bills that have identified the earmarks, and who--in \nother words, what Senator--requested them, meaning the earmarks.\n  We have required and we have received certification letters from \nevery Senator who has an earmark that he or she and/or their spouses--\nmeaning he or she and/or his or her spouse--that they have no financial \ninterest in their earmarks. We are talking about Senators, 100 of them, \nwho sit in this Chamber.\n  I want to say that once again. We, meaning the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, have required and received certification letters from every \nSenator who has any earmark--that Senator and his or her spouse--that \nthey have no financial interest in their earmarks. Is that clear?\n  I have always maintained the highest standards. I will say that \nagain. I have always maintained the highest standards for myself, \nRobert C. Byrd, myself, and for my staff, on ensuring that there are no \nconflicts of interest for\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\nearmarks that I include in any legislation. Consistent with the \nstandards that we established for the appropriations process, S. 1 now \nestablishes a new Senate rule that will impose requirements for \ntransparency and accountability for all bills.\n  In establishing these rules, the public should not conclude that the \nrules are somehow a sanction on the Congress for wasteful spending. In \nrecent months there has been considerable attention to the issue of the \nearmarking of funds by Congress for specific projects. Some Members \nhave asserted that all earmarked funding is wasteful spending or an \nabuse of power. All Senators endeavor--they had better. All Senators \nendeavor to weed out wasteful spending. But this notion that earmarked \nspending is inherently wasteful spending is flat-out wrong.\n  I am going to say that again. Hear me.\n  Some Members have asserted that all earmarked funding is wasteful \nspending or an abuse of power. Hogwash. All Senators endeavor to weed \nout wasteful spending. But this notion that earmarked spending is \ninherently wasteful spending is flat-out wrong. This notion that \nearmarked spending is inherently wasteful spending is flatout wrong.\n  Congress has the power of the purse and has had the power of the \npurse. That is the only real power that we Senators and Members of the \nother body and the President have. Congress has the power of the purse.\n  Since the beginning of the Republic, Congress has allocated money to \nspecific projects and purposes. Did you get that? Listen.\n  Since the beginning of the Republic, Congress has allocated money to \nspecific projects and purposes. For example, in 1798, $3,500 was \nappropriated for firewood and candles for the Treasury Department, and \n$454.41 was appropriated for rent of a house near Grays Ferry on the \nSchuylkill River.\n  Earmarks are arguably the most criticized and the least understood of \ncongressional practices. There is nothing inherently wrong with an \nearmark. There is nothing inherently wrong with an earmark. An earmark \nis an explicit direction from the Congress about how the Federal \nGovernment should spend the people's money. It is absolutely consistent \nwith the intentions of the Framers, codified in article I of the \nConstitution of the United States, giving the power of the purse, the \npower of the purse to the elected representatives of the people.\n  I shall quote:\n\n       All legislative powers herein granted--\n\n  That is the Constitution, the Framers speaking, the words of the \nConstitution--\n     legislative powers herein granted shall--\n\n  not may but shall--\n\n     be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall \n     consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Those are the words, the immortal words of the Constitution written \nby the Framers, the Framers of the Constitution. I quote it again:\n\n       All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  In using this power, Congress has an obligation to be good stewards \nof the Public Treasury and to prevent imprudent expenditures. Congress \nhas an obligation to guard against the corruption of any--I say any--\npublic officials who would sell their soul and the trust of their \nconstituency in order to profit from an official act.\n  But Congress does not err in using an earmark to designate how the \npeople's money should be spent. This is a power. This is a power that \ndoes not belong to the President of the United States or to any of the \nunelected bureaucrats in the executive branch. It belongs where and to \nwhom? It belongs to the people, the people out there on the hills and \nin the valleys, across this great land. It belongs to the people \nthrough their elected representatives in Congress. That is here. Their \nelected representatives. I am one of them, the elected representatives.\n  Earmarks are not specific to appropriations bills. Earmarks can be \nfound in revenue bills. Hear me now. Earmarks can be found in revenue \nbills. You get that? Hear me now. Earmarks can be found in revenue \nbills as tax benefits for narrowly defined constituencies. Earmarks can \nbe found in authorization bills. Did you get that? On authorization \nbills. Those are not bills that come out of the Appropriations \nCommittees in the House and Senate; they are authorization bills. They \nmay come out of the Committee on Ways and Means in the other body or \nout of the Senate Finance Committee. They can be found in authorization \nbills.\n  Earmarks can be found in the President's budget request. Hear that \nnow. Listen. Are you listening? Earmarks can be found in the \nPresident's budget request. I want to say that again. I want to hear \nthat again. Earmarks can be found in the President's budget request.\n  Well-intentioned though they may be, the civil servants making budget \ndecisions in the executive, in agencies and offices of the Federal \nGovernment, do not understand the communities Senators represent. They \ndo not meet with the constituencies of Senators. They do not know \nMembers' States and their people. They can be a poor judge of what is \nnecessary and what is frivolous from the perspective of the States and \nthe people. These bureaucrats are not elected; therefore, they are not \naccountable to the people. I will say that once more. These bureaucrats \nare not elected; therefore, they are not accountable to the people.\n  If the Congress does not specify how funds are to be spent, then the \ndecision falls to the executive branch--the executive branch--and the \nso-called experts at agencies to determine the priorities of this \nNation. In such cases, the American people may never know who is \nresponsible for a spending decision. The American people may never know \nhow a spending decision is made. The American people may never hear \nanything about it. And with the executive bureaucrats, there is far \nless accountability to the people.\n  Critics of congressional earmarks--hear me--critics of congressional \nearmarks often overlook the success stories from earmark spending \ndirected by Congress. Now, listen. Listen, all you skeptics, all you \ncynics, wherever you are. Do you hear me, the skeptics and the cynics? \nCongressional earmarks often overlook the success stories from earmark \nspending directed by Congress.\n  Let me give an example of earmark spending. Hear me. In the 1969 \nAgriculture appropriations bill, Congress earmarked funds for a new \nprogram to provide critical nutrition to low-income women, infants, and \nchildren. This program--are you listening? This program, which is now \nknown as the WIC Program, has since provided nutritional assistance to \nover 150 million women, infants, and children, a critical contribution \nto the health of the Nation. That, I say, that is not--n-o-t--wasteful \nspending.\n  In 1969 and 1970, Congress earmarked $25 million for a children's \nhospital in Washington, DC--that is here in Washington, DC, a \nchildren's hospital--even overcoming a Presidential veto. In 1969 and \n1970, Congress earmarked $25 million for a children's hospital in \nWashington, DC, even overcoming a Presidential veto. That funding \nresulted in the construction of what is now known as the Children's \nNational Medical Center. That started out with an earmark, the \nChildren's National Medical Center. The hospital has become a national \nand international leader in neonatal and pediatric care. Since the \nhospital opened, over 5 million children have received health care. \nLast year, Children's Hospital treated over 340,000 young patients and \nperformed over 10,000 surgeries, saving and improving the lives of \nyoung children. That is not wasteful spending.\n  Let me go on. In 1983, Congress earmarked funds for a new emergency \nfood and shelter program. In 2005 alone, the program served 35 million \nmeals and provided 1.3 million nights of lodging to the homeless. The \nhomeless. Have you ever been homeless? That is not wasteful spending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for an additional 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators.\n  In 1987, Congress earmarked--hear me--funds for the mapping of the \nhuman gene. This project became known as the human genome project. This \nresearch has led to completely new strategies for disease prevention \nand treatment. The human genome project has led to discoveries of \ndramatic new methods of identifying and\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\ntreating breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and colon cancer. I will say \nthat once more: The human genome project has led to discoveries of \ndramatic new methods of identifying and treating breast, ovarian, and \ncolon cancer, saving many, many lives. Senators, hear me: This is not \nwasteful spending.\n  In 1988 and 1995, Congress earmarked funds for the development of \nunmanned aerial vehicles. I have to say that once more. In 1988 and \n1995, Congress--that is us, your representatives, out there in the \nland, in the hills and valleys of this country--earmarked funds for the \ndevelopment of unmanned aerial vehicles. These efforts produced the \nPredator and the Global Hawk, two of the most effective assets that \nhave been used in the global war on terror. This is not wasteful \nspending. I am talking about earmarks, the word ``earmarks.'' A lot of \nthings have been said about the word ``earmarks.''\n  Each of these earmarks was initiated by Congress and produced lasting \ngains for the American people--not for me, not for you, but for all of \nus, the American people. In the rush to label earmarks as the source of \nour budgetary woes and amid calls to expand the budgetary authorities \nof the President, Members should remember why deficits have soared to \nunprecedented levels. Senators will recall that the President has not \nexercised his current constitutional authority. The President has not \nsubmitted a single rescission proposal under the Budget Act. The \nPresident has signed every regular appropriations bill that has \nproduced the unprecedented growth in earmarks. What has wrought these \nominous budget deficits is the administration's grossly flawed and \nimpossible budget assumptions.\n  The war in Iraq has required the Congress--that is us--to appropriate \n$450 billion--billion, I say, billion dollars; there have been \napproximately 1 billion minutes since Jesus Christ was born; so the war \nin Iraq has required the Congress to appropriate $450 for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born. I am talking about the war in Iraq. I \ndidn't get us into that war. I was against going into Iraq. The war in \nIraq has required the Congress to appropriate $450 billion of the \npeople's money. Only 2 to 3 percent of discretionary funds is \nearmarked. Earmarking is hardly the fiscal wedge driving the deficit. \nRather than dealing with these fiscal failures, too many would rather \npropagate specious argument that enlarging the President's role in the \nbudget process and doing away with congressional earmarks will somehow \nmagically reduce these foreboding and menacing deficits. It will not.\n  There is no question that the earmarking process has grown to \nexcessive levels in recent years. From 1994 to 2006, the number of \nearmarks nearly tripled. Between 1956 and 2002--I was here during all \nof those years--Congress passed 20 highway bills that contained a total \nof 739 earmarks. In 2005, the Republican Congress passed and the \nPresident signed a single highway bill that contained 5,000 earmarks. \nTalk about earmarks. There is no question that the earmarking process \nhas run amok. There was a single highway bill that contained 5,000 \nearmarks. This kind of excess in earmarking must end. It must go. That \nis why the Appropriations Committee took the lead to add transparency \nand accountability to the process.\n  In the joint funding resolution for fiscal year 2007, enacted in \nFebruary, we implemented a 1-year moratorium on earmarks for fiscal \nyear 2007. In that joint resolution, we eliminated over 9,300 earmarks \nfrom the fiscal year 2006 bills and reports. No new earmarks were \ncontained in the bill for fiscal year 2007. While awaiting final action \non S. 1, the Appropriations Committee took the lead by establishing \nguidelines for approving earmarks in the fiscal year 2008 bill. The \nAppropriations Committee has reported 11 of the 12 appropriations \nbills. For earmarks contained in the fiscal year 2008 bills and \nreports, the committee reports identify the names of any Member making \na request or, where appropriate, the President, and the name and \nlocation of the intended recipient of such earmark.\n  Let me say that once again. The Appropriations Committee has reported \n11 of the 12 appropriations bills. For earmarks contained in the fiscal \nyear 2008 bills and reports, the committee reports identify the name of \nthe Member--maybe it is Robert C. Byrd; perhaps it could be the \ndistinguished Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania, a great Senator--making \nthe request or, where appropriate, the President, Mr. Bush, and the \nname and location of the intended recipient of such earmark.\n  For each earmark contained in the fiscal year 2008 bills and reports, \na Member is required to certify in writing that he or she has no \npecuniary interest in such earmark, consistent with Senate rule XXXVII, \nparagraph 4. Such certifications are available to the people, the \npublic. All committee bills and reports, including all of the above \ninformation, are available to the people, available to the public, on \nthe Internet and in printed form prior to floor action, meaning action \nhere on this Senate floor.\n  Through the 11 committee reports, we have identified over 5,700 \nearmarks, totaling about $28 billion. Of the $28 billion in earmarks, \nover $23 billion, or over 80 percent of the earmarks, was requested by \nthe President. Now, let me say that once again, please. Through the 11 \ncommittee reports, we have identified over 5,700 earmarks, totaling \nabout $28 billion. Of the $28 billion in earmarks, over $23 billion, or \nover 80 percent of the earmarks, was requested by the President--the \nPresident of the United States, President Bush.\n  The level of nonproject-based earmarks is a substantial reduction \nbelow the level approved for 2006. We are not hiding these earmarks. We \nare highlighting them for the scrutiny of the American people. We are \naccountable for the decisions in these bills and reports.\n  The status quo is not satisfactory, and the Appropriations Committee \nhas taken the lead in adding transparency and accountability to the \nprocess. Eliminating waste and abuse in the Federal budget process is \nimportant. Protecting the character and design of the Constitution is \nessential. Get it, get it, now. Let us not lose our heads--but keep our \nheads on our shoulders--let us not lose our heads, and subsequently the \nsafeguards of our rights and liberties as American citizens.\n  S. 1 strikes the right balance. I urge its adoption.\n  Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Section 511 of S. 1 \namends rule XXVIII concerning out-of-scope matter in conference \nreports, and section 521 establishes a new rule XLIV concerning \ncongressionally directed spending in all legislation pending before the \nSenate. Specifically, section 521 contains rules concerning new \ncongressionally directed spending that might be included in a \nconference report.\n  Madam President, am I correct that points of order concerning new \ndirected spending will be considered pursuant to the new rule XLIV, \nrather than the amended rule XXVIII?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Excuse me, Madam President.\n  I will repeat that. Am I correct that points of order concerning new \ndirected spending will be considered pursuant to the new rule XLIV, \nrather than the amended rule XXVIII?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Inquiring further, Madam President, am I correct that in paragraph \n8(e) of the new rule XLIV--the new rule XLIV--the term ``measure'' \nrefers to the bill or amendment committed to the conferees by either \nHouse, and not to the statement of managers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Inquiring further, Madam President, the new rule XLIV requires the \nchairman--this is the new rule XLIV--requires the chairman of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to certify that mandated information on \ncongressionally directed spending, limited tax benefits, and limited \ntariff benefits is available on a publicly accessible congressional Web \nsite at least 48 hours before a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Am I correct, Madam President, that the Parliamentarian will rely on \nthat certification for determining compliance with paragraphs 1, 2, and \n3 of rule XLIV?\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10719-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10719-S10723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 976, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 976) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide tax relief for small businesses, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Baucus amendment No. 2530, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 2534 (to amendment No. 2530), to \n     revise and extend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n       McConnell/Specter amendment No. 2599 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to express the sense of the Senate that Judge Leslie \n     Southwick should receive a vote by the full Senate.\n       Thune amendment No. 2579 (to amendment No. 2530), to \n     exclude individuals with alternative minimum tax liability \n     from eligibility from SCHIP coverage.\n       Grassley (for Ensign) amendment No. 2541 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to prohibit a State from providing child health \n     assistance or health benefits coverage to individuals whose \n     family income exceeds 200 percent of the Federal Poverty \n     Level unless the State demonstrates that it has enrolled 95 \n     percent of the targeted low-income children who reside in the \n     State.\n       Grassley (for Ensign) amendment No. 2540 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to prohibit a State from using SCHIP funds to provide \n     coverage for nonpregnant adults until the State first \n     demonstrates that it has adequately covered targeted low-\n     income children who reside in the State.\n       Grassley (for Graham) amendment No. 2558 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to sunset the increase in the tax on tobacco products \n     on September 30, 2012.\n       Grassley (for Kyl) amendment No. 2537 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to minimize the erosion of private health coverage.\n       Grassley (for Kyl) amendment No. 2562 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \n     and modify the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for \n     qualified leasehold improvements and qualified restaurant \n     improvements and to provide a 15-year straight-line cost \n     recovery for certain improvements to retail space.\n       Baucus (for Specter) amendment No. 2557 (to amendment No. \n     2530), to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reset \n     the rate of tax under the alternative minimum tax at 24 \n     percent.\n       Webb amendment No. 2618 (to amendment No. 2530), to \n     eliminate the deferral of taxation on certain income of \n     United States shareholders attributable to controlled foreign \n     corporations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 1:40 will be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2557\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have consulted with both of the \nmanagers about bringing up amendment No. 2557. I consulted with Senator \nGrassley, who advised that we would be going back on the bill at 12:45, \nbut the distinguished Senator from West Virginia had extended his time. \nBut I have been waiting here now for more than an hour. It would be my \nhope we could proceed with the consideration of this amendment. I am \nadvised the managers want to see the amendment.\n  I am advised, Madam President, that the Democrats are fine with my \ncalling it up. I just want to be sure--\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, my understanding is that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is correct. He can proceed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In that event, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be set aside so we may consider amendment \nNo. 2557.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has already been offered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes. Fine.\n  This amendment would eliminate the 1993 alternative minimum tax rate \nincrease, a remedial step which I suggest to my colleagues is long \noverdue. The alternative minimum tax was created in 1969 in response to \na small number of high-income individuals who had paid little or no \nFederal income taxes.\n  Today, because of a lack of indexing for inflation, and the higher \nAMT tax rates relative to the regular income tax system, we have a \nparallel tax system which has grown far beyond its intended result.\n  If there is no legislative action, the number of taxpayers subject to \nthe alternative minimum tax will rise sharply from approximately 3.5 \nmillion filers in 2006 to some 23 million in 2007.\n  This issue has been before the Senate four times this year already. \nIt will hit taxpayers in the moderate range excessively hard. The \nalternative minimum tax was increased in 1993 from 24 percent to 26 \npercent for taxable income under $175,000, and from 24 to 28 percent \nfor taxable income in excess of $175,000.\n  There has been some question as to what is the offset and there is no \noffset, and none should be looked for where you have a tax which \nessentially was not expected to be imposed. There was no anticipation, \nno intention that this alternative minimum tax was going to produce \nadditional revenue. So when the tax law is corrected so the additional \ntaxes will not be imposed because of bracket creep--and this is \ndesigned to avoid that, and to redirect the alternative minimum tax to \nits original intent--that is exactly what tax fairness requires.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n                        Specter Amendment #2557\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss an \n     amendment to H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief bill. \n     H.R. 976 will serve as a vehicle for legislation to \n     reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) in the Senate. My amendment is identical to \n     legislation (S. 734) I offered on March 1, 2007, to bring the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) back ``in line'' with the \n     regular individual income tax by reducing its rate back to 24 \n     percent. The 1993 AMT rate increase has contributed greatly \n     to the problem of unintended taxpayers seeing increased tax \n     liability.\n       The AMT is a flawed income tax system and there are many \n     arguments for full repeal. It is important to keep in mind \n     that the first version of the AMT was created in 1969 in \n     response to a small number of high-income individuals who had \n     paid little or no federal income taxes. Today, between a lack \n     of indexing for inflation and higher AMT tax rates relative \n     to the regular income tax system, we have a tax system which \n     has grown far beyond its intended result. Absent legislative \n     action, the number of taxpayers subject to AMT liability will \n     rise sharply from 3.5 million filers in 2006 to 23 million in \n     2007. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), \n     874,000 taxpayers in Pennsylvania will pay the AMT in 2007 if \n     no action is taken.\n       The Senate has had ample opportunity to address AMT in \n     2007. The Senate has already rejected four efforts to provide \n     taxpayers with meaningful relief from the AMT in this first \n     session of the 110th Congress. However, all attempts have \n     been rejected: on July 20, 2007, I voted in support of a Kyl \n     amendment to the Education Reconciliation Bill, which would \n     have fully repealed the AMT; on March 23, 2007, I voted in \n     support of a Lott amendment to the Budget Resolution, which \n     would have allowed for repeal the 1993 AMT rate increase; on \n     March 23, 2007, I voted in support of a Grassley Amendment to \n     the Budget Resolution, which would have allowed a full repeal \n     of the AMT; and On March 23, 2007, I voted in support of a \n     Sessions Amendment to the Budget Resolution, which would have \n     allowed families to deduct personal exemptions when \n     calculating their AMT liability.\n       This onerous tax is slapped on average American families \n     largely because the AMT is not indexed for inflation (while \n     the regular income tax is indexed) and taxpayers are \n     ``pushed'' into the AMT through so-called ``bracket creep.'' \n     Temporary increases in the AMT exemption amounts expired at \n     the end of 2006. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of2001 increased the AMT exemption amount \n     effective for tax years between 2001 and 2004; the Working \n     Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended the previous \n     increase in the AMT exemption amounts through 2005; and the \n     Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 \n     increased the AMT exemption amount for 2006.\n       In addition to the well-known issue of the need to index \n     the AMT exemption amount for inflation, the AMT tax rate \n     relative to the regular income tax must also be addressed to \n     keep additional taxpayers who were never intended to pay the \n     AMT from being subject to its burdensome grasp. In 1993, \n     President Clinton and a Democrat-controlled Congress imposed \n     a significant tax hike on Americans through the regular \n     income tax. At the same time, the AMT tax rate was also \n     increased from 24 percent to 26 percent for taxable income \n     under $175,000 and from 24 percent to 28 percent for taxable \n     income that exceeds $175,000. These changes are now slamming \n     the middle-class and have only been made worse by the tax \n     relief enacted in 2001 and 2003. Ironically, by reducing \n     regular income tax liabilities without substantially changing \n     the AMT, many new taxpayers were pushed into these higher AMT\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\n     tax rates created in 1993. However, the problem is not the \n     2001/2003 tax relief, it was the 1993 tax increase.\n       According to revenue estimates calculated by the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation, repeal of the 1993 AMT rate increase \n     would cost $425 billion over the 2007-2017 period. In tax \n     year 2007, 7.6 million filers would be removed from the AMT \n     if the '93 AMT rate is repealed; and 13.2 million filers will \n     be spared in 2017.\n       Millions of taxpayers have been sucked into AMT liability \n     as a result of the 1993 AMT rate increase, and it would be \n     the wrong approach to ``fix'' the AMT by increasing taxes yet \n     again. In addition, some may argue that this amendment is \n     fiscally irresponsible because the lost revenue is not fully \n     offset. However, it is highly questionable to justify raising \n     taxes elsewhere to account for lost revenue that was never \n     intended to be collected.\n       The AMT is a flawed income tax system and there are many \n     arguments for full repeal. At the very least, we should take \n     steps to undo past mistakes, most notably the 1993 AMT rate \n     increase. In what will likely be the final attempt to address \n     AMT before we head home to speak with our constituents during \n     the August recess, I implore my colleagues to cast an aye \n     vote for my amendment. Twenty-three million Americans are \n     counting on it.\n       I ask consent to enter into the record several articles \n     published in the Wall Street Journal advocating for a repeal \n     of the 1993 AMT rate increase. This legislation is supported \n     by Americans for Tax Reform and by the National Taxpayers \n     Union. I ask consent to enter into the record letters of \n     support from Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) and the National \n     Taxpayer Union (NTU).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is a pretty simple, open-and-shut matter, and it does \nnot take a whole lot of time to explain. I know the managers are not on \nthe floor, but I did want to have the amendment considered, setting \naside the other amendments, so we could engage in argument and be \nprepared to debate it further.\n  Unless the Senator from Vermont indicates--with a hand gesture, a \ntimeout, no argument at this time--I will be available to return to the \nfloor when the managers consider it appropriate. But I wanted to get \nthis on the record.\n  Before departing, might I add my words of congratulations and \nadmiration for the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I hadn't \nplanned to listen to his extended speech, but I wanted to be here at \nthe moment it concluded, because sometimes when you are not here, half \na dozen Senators precede you.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2627 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that children and pregnant women whose family \n income exceeds 200 percent of the poverty line and who have access to \n        employer-sponsored coverage receive premium assistance)\n\n  Madam President, I have been asked to ask unanimous consent to \ntemporarily set aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. \n2627 for Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as my colleagues know, this \nlegislation, the SCHIP legislation, includes a $3 billion incentive \npool, and the purpose of this pool is to provide States with the \nfunding they need to do outreach efforts in order to attract children \ninto the program. The reality is, however, a number of States today \nhave already enrolled 90 percent of their kids into the SCHIP program, \nand with the passage of this bill, more States will soon be at that \nlevel.\n  Further, we want to provide strong incentives for States below the \n90-percent enrollment to reach that level.\n  This amendment, in order to incentivize States to reach that level of \n90 percent, would allow States to apply for multiple grants of up to $2 \nmillion each when they achieve an enrollment rate of greater than 90 \npercent of children below 200 percent of poverty. These grants would \nhelp assure the children we enroll in SCHIP have a place to go to \nreceive medical care and to find the personnel they need to provide \nthat care. These grants would come from a pool of money--the State \nHealth Access Innovations Pool--of $250 million, about 8 percent of the \n$3 billion incentive pool. This money will be used to find innovative \napproaches to increasing the availability of health and providers and \nservices and would result in the direct provision of health services.\n  The reason for this initiative is pretty clear. In Vermont and in \nmany other parts of this country, one can, in fact, have health \ninsurance and yet find it quite difficult to buy or to find providers \nof that service. So what we are saying is let us make sure that when \nour kids do have health insurance, there will be doctors, there will be \ndentists, and there will be other health care providers. This is a good \namendment, and I certainly hope it will be supported.\n  The other amendment I have offered, amendment No. 2600, is a simple \namendment to Section 111 of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nreauthorization. Section 111, as my colleagues know, applies to certain \nqualifying States that expanded their Medicaid Program to cover kids \nprior to the enactment of CHIP in 1997. I wish to commend the Finance \nCommittee for working language into the current bill that will no \nlonger penalize these ``early expansion States'' and will allow States \nto cover children between 133 percent and 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty level to be covered under the CHIP program.\n  My amendment simply states that payments to States to cover these \nchildren who were previously covered under Medicaid be used solely to \nfund health care-related activities. Specifically, the language states \nthat payments may only be used to provide coverage or to expand access \nfor health care infrastructure, including but not limited to the \nprovision of school-based health services, dental care, mental health \nservices, federally qualified health centers, and educational debt \nforgiveness for health care practitioners in fields experiencing local \nshortages.\n  This amendment is a simple provision that will specify that States \nbenefiting from an increased match must use these funds for health care \nand will allow States to address coverage issues as well as the crucial \narea of expanding access to services, something that particularly \naffects rural and inner city communities. I urge support for this \namendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Drug Company Payments to Physicians\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes \ntoday to discuss an important issue that affects all Americans who take \nprescription drugs. Specifically, I am going to speak about the need \nfor greater transparency in the payment that doctors who bill Medicare \nand Medicaid receive from drug companies.\n  Over the past few years, it became apparent during my inquiries into \nthe Food and Drug Administration that drug companies pay physicians for \na variety of different reasons. Indeed, some of our leading \nphysicians--doctors who have significant influence in their medical \nfields--receive tens of thousands of dollars every year from drug \ncompanies. For some, these payments can make up a considerable amount \nof their annual income.\n  The payments can take the form of honoraria for speaking engagements, \npayments to sit on advisory panels, and funding for research. Further, \ndrug companies spend about $1 billion a year to fund educational \ncourses that doctors are required to take every year called Continuing \nMedical Education, or CME.\n  In April, the Finance Committee staff prepared a report on \npharmaceutical companies' support of Continuing Medical Education. This \nreport found that some educational courses supported by drug companies \nhave become veiled forms of advertising that encourage off-label use of \ndrugs.\n  Let's review how this works. Right now, it is possible for a doctor \nto attend a CME--continuing medical education--course sponsored by a \ndrug company. That same company can make payments to doctors who will \nteach the course, and the doctor who teaches the course can discuss the \nfindings of research paid for by the company. Now, that may sound like \na conflict and unethical, but that is how it happens. The whole field \nis connected by a tangled web of drug company money.\n  To try and understand this a little better, I have been exploring the \nmoney doctors get from drug companies, especially the doctors who work \nas academic researchers. Most universities require their academic \nresearchers to report outside income. I have sent letters to a handful \nof universities to understand how well such a reporting system actually \nworks. I haven't received all the information yet, but I can comment on \nsome of the things I have already found.\n  Most universities require professors to report outside income that \nmay create a conflict of interest with their research. This means that \nif a doctor at a university is receiving money from a company either \nfor research, speaking fees or to sit on an advisory panel, then they \nhave to report that income. But there appears to be a couple of \nproblems, and let's say a couple of problems with the whole system, as \nI found out.\n  The only person who knows if the reported income is accurate and \ncomplete is the doctor who is receiving the money. The university \ndoesn't necessarily police its own people to make sure they are \nreporting everything they are supposed to report. It seems that some of \nthese academics are getting so much money coming in from so many \ndifferent companies they need an accountant to be sure everything is \nreported accurately.\n  Second, these disclosures are usually kept secret. So if there is a \ndoctor getting thousands of dollars from a drug company, payments that \nmight be affecting his or her objectivity, the only people outside the \npharmaceutical industry who will probably ever know about this are the \npeople at that very university, if they are even keeping track of it, \nand we don't know that they are keeping track of it. But most Americans \nnever get a fair chance to see this information.\n  To give one example, I sent a letter to the University of Cincinnati \nasking about how much money the drug companies have been paying one of \ntheir psychiatrists, Dr. Melissa DelBello. Back in May, The New York \nTimes reported on the research done by Dr. DelBello to see if \nadolescents could be treated for bipolar disorder with a powerful drug \ncalled Seroquel, which is manufactured by Astra Zeneca. The study was \nfunded by Astra Zeneca and showed that Seroquel was a good choice for \ntreating bipolar disorder in children. Dr. DelBello's study was later \ncited by a prominent panel of experts who concluded that drugs such as \nSeroquel should be a first-line treatment for children with bipolar \ndisorder.\n  Here is where it gets interesting. After Dr. DelBello released her \nstudy, Astra Zeneca began hiring her to give several sponsored talks. \nAnother doctor told The New York Times he was persuaded to start \nprescribing drugs\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\nsuch as Seroquel after listening to Dr. DelBello. But when the reporter \nfrom the New York Times asked Dr. DelBello how much money she got from \nAstra Zeneca, she told the paper: ``Trust me. I don't make much.''\n  Well, I decided to find out how much, and I went directly to the \nUniversity of Cincinnati who, by the way, has been extremely \ncooperative, helpful, and responsive. Soon I figured out just how much \n``not that much'' money is. Dr. DelBello's study, which helped put \nSeroquel on the map, was published in 2002. That next year, she got \nmore money than she has ever received from the pharmaceutical \ncompanies--at least that is what the documents that I have say.\n  In 2003, Astra Zeneca alone paid her a little over $100,000 for \nlectures, consulting fees, travel expenses, and service on advisory \nboards. In 2004, Astra Zeneca paid her over $80,000 for the same \nservices.\n  Now I am not saying this money was a payoff or suggesting there is \nsomething inherently bad with accepting drug company money, but let me \ntell you what Dr. Steven E. Hyman, provost, Harvard University and \nformer Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said.\n  He said these payments could encourage psychiatrists to use drugs in \nways that endanger patients' physical health. Specifically, he said of \ndoctors:\n\n       We don't connect the wires in our own lives about how money \n     is affecting our profession and putting our patients at risk.\n\n  I think this is a rather interesting assessment by Dr. Hyman.\n  But let me continue. Just last March, several leading physicians \nreleased a study on pharmaceutical company payments to physicians. They \npublished this study in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, one of the most prestigious journals in medicine. I would \nlike to quote what they concluded about the need to provide public \ndisclosure of these payments to doctors:\n  Full disclosure would better allow the public to appreciate the \nrelationship between industry and the health profession.\n  And so, for the sake of transparency and accountability, shouldn't \nthe American public know who their doctor is taking money from? After \nall, anybody can go on the Internet and see who is funding the \ncampaigns for federally elected officials. Because doctors are expected \nto look out for the health and well-being of their patients, shouldn't \nwe hold doctors to similar standards?\n  In fact, some of this is already occurring. Minnesota requires drug \ncompanies to report any payments they give to doctors in that State. I \nthink that is a good thing. Apparently, so do the citizens of \nMinnesota.\n  I think what we really need is a national program that will require \nall drug companies to report when they make payments to doctors. I \ndon't think it would be all that hard for those companies to do. After \nall, companies have to make sure they know where every penny is going. \nSo it should not be that hard to report some of it to the Federal \nGovernment and to the American people. Besides, they are already doing \nit in Minnesota.\n  In closing, I plan to continue my inquiry into drug company payments \nto doctors. In addition, I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the Senate, as well as members of the pharmaceutical industry, to \nestablish a national reporting system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 7 minutes, and if the Chair would notify me when I have used 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so. Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak in favor \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program and its reauthorization, \nwhich is the legislation that is before us. We hear the numbers that 6 \nmillion children benefit from the program today--over 6 million--and \nthis will provide for an additional 3 million children.\n  I want my colleagues to know that each one of these people are \npeople, they are families, and they are affected by what we do here \ntoday. I take this time to acquaint my colleagues to Deamonte Driver. \nHe was a 12-year-old who didn't live far from here--6 miles from here--\nin Prince Georges County, MD. He had a tooth problem. His mother tried \nto get him help. He had no insurance, and he fell through the cracks. \nHe had a brother, Dashawn Driver, who had six decaying teeth. They \ntried to get help for him. The mother thought the older brother was in \nworse shape than Deamonte. He started having headaches and was rushed \nto the emergency room. They found out his problem--he could not get to \na dentist--was an abscessed tooth.\n  Before this, a social worker made 20 phone calls in an effort to try \nto get dental care for the Driver family, without success. They could \nnot find a dentist willing to treat someone without insurance or in the \nMedicaid system. Deamonte ended up needing emergency surgery, which \ncost $250,000, and he ended up losing his life because the system did \nnot provide care for a 12-year-old.\n  Mr. President, we can certainly do better than that. Dr. Koop, a \nformer Surgeon General of the United States, said, ``There is no health \ncare without oral health.'' Medical research has shown the linkage \nbetween plaque and heart disease. We know now that gum disease can be a \nsignal of diabetes or a liver ailment or a hormone imbalance. We have \nto do better than we are doing today.\n  Dental disease is the most common childhood ailment in the United \nStates to date. One out of five children between the ages of 2 to 4 \nwill have some form of decaying teeth. By the time they reach 15, three \nout of five will have tooth decay.\n  There is an imbalance as far as the racial effects. Racial minorities \nare much more likely to sustain untreated tooth decay. Forty percent of \nAfrican-American children have untreated tooth decay.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Bingaman, for his leadership on these \nissues and for introducing legislation and moving forward to try to \nprovide better oral health care for children. I thank Senator Snowe for \nher leadership. I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \nincluding initiatives in the legislation that is before us that will \nhelp the States meet this challenge--the $200 million included in the \nbill. That will have a major impact to try to help American families.\n  We have an important opportunity before us in the legislation that we \nare considering to help our children, not only to continue the benefits \nfor 6.6 million children but so that we can add another 3 million out \nof the 9 million who currently have no health insurance.\n\n  We have to do more, but this is our opportunity today, and we have to \ntake advantage of it. Our health care system is in crisis.\n  Earlier this week, I introduced the Universal Health Coverage Act, \nwhich would require everybody in this country to have health insurance. \nI think it is essential that we address the major problems in our \ncountry of so many people being without health insurance. We should \nstart with the children, and we can do that with the legislation that \nis before us.\n  Why is that important? Well, we know that children who are enrolled \nin the Children's Health Insurance Program or have insurance are much \nmore likely to get primary health care. They won't use the emergency \nrooms as much. If you don't have insurance, you have no choice but to \ngo to the emergency room. We have improved health care outcomes if the \nchild has health insurance. We know they are much more likely to have \nimmunization and primary health care.\n  I want to comment that--again, talking about families and \nindividuals--the Finance Committee held a hearing on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. The Bedford family from my city of Baltimore \ncame down here and testified.\n  Mrs. Bedford said:\n\n       We no longer have to decide whether a child is really sick \n     enough to warrant a doctor's visit.\n\n  The Bedford family enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in Maryland. The program is working. Without this legislation, \nwe will have to reimpose freezes on enrollments and people will lose \ncoverage. It happened\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\nin my State. This is a bipartisan bill, and I compliment my colleagues \nfor bringing forward a bill that we can get enacted into law.\n  In Maryland, we started a program on July 1, 1998. About 38,000 \nchildren were enrolled at first, and we are up to 101,000 children \nenrolled today. Maryland will get an increase in this bill from $67 \nmillion to $189 million. We will be able to enroll 42,000 more children \nin the State of Maryland. It is an important program.\n  I also compliment the committee for including outreach so that we can \nreach families who don't know how to enroll, or whether they are \nqualified to enroll, so we can get more families and children enrolled \nin the children's health care program.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take advantage of the \nopportunity that we currently have before us. This is an opportunity in \nwhich we can make major progress in dealing with those children in our \ncommunity who will either lose their coverage because we take no \naction, and those who currently have no insurance whom we can get \nenrolled in this program. It is a valuable program. We have an \nopportunity to move forward. So I urge my colleagues to support the \nfine effort of the Senate Finance Committee in bringing forward this \nlegislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                       Ethics and Lobbying Reform\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to say I am proud, very \nproud. I came to Washington hoping that we could make a difference in \nterms of the way business is done here. And I will be honest, I had \nsome moments of doubt over the last 6 months. There were times that I \nwandered around the floor of the Senate, and even among my own party \nand the other party, and I heard kind of a murmuring of discontent over \nthe ethics reform that we passed back in January. I got nervous that we \nweren't serious about it, that we really weren't going to push the kind \nof cleansing of things that we have done in the legislation before us \non which we are about to vote.\n  This isn't hard, what we are doing. We are trying to live like \neverybody else in America. Most Americans don't have a corporation they \ncan call for a ride on a jet plane. Most Americans don't have somebody \nwho wants to pay for a fancy trip. Most Americans really don't have the \nability to decide that one group in their State gets money when others \ndon't. But we did here. That was wrong.\n  That is why I am so proud of this legislation. Is it perfect? No. I \nwill wait--probably in vain--for that piece of legislation that we pass \nthat is perfect. But because of our process, because of the glorious \nnature of a democracy, it is always a matter of give and take, always a \nmatter of finding compromise to find that piece of legislation that can \nget enough votes so that we can send it to the President's desk. That \nis what this process was.\n  Now, I have some friends--and, frankly, some people I agree with--on \nthe other side of the aisle who are unhappy with some of the provisions \nin this bill. They are willing to look at the bundling provisions, the \nban on travel and gifts, and the ban on corporate jets. They are \nwilling to overlook the revolving door reforms--reforms in terms of \nsneaking provisions into conference bills without them ever being in \neither piece of legislation in the House and Senate, and focus in on \njust the inadequacies of the earmark reform.\n  Well, would I have liked it to be a 67-vote point of order rather \nthan a 60-vote point of order? Yes, I would have. Would I have wished \nfor a system maybe that was even more transparent? Yes. But this is \nmajor reform. I will tell you that there are a few Senators who do not \nparticipate in the earmarking process, and I am not here to pat them or \nmyself on the back for the fact that we do not do that.\n  I will say I think it is interesting that the phrase ``the fox in the \nhenhouse'' was used as to the provisions in this bill. You know, there \nis a saying, ``all hat and no cattle.'' Well, I think that maybe this \nis the time to use the phrase ``all foxes and no hens,'' because if you \nstep back from this issue of earmark reform, it is not complicated. It \nis pretty easy. As one of the cartoons said, ``We have met the enemy \nand it is us.''\n  All we have to do to achieve the transparency that we need is for \nevery Senator to put every earmark request that they are making on \ntheir Web site. I will say it again. All we have to do is have every \nSenator put every earmark request they are making on their own Web \nsite. And then it won't be hard to make sure that the chairman of the \ncommittee or the majority floor leader have, in fact, certified all of \nthe earmarks. I am a little offended that there is some assumption that \nthese chairmen and the majority leader would go out of their way to not \ntell the public there is a congressionally directed expenditure in the \nbill and will try to hide it. They are going to be caught if they do \nthat. It is going to become public.\n  Then you will have the kind of accountability that really works \naround here. So I was disappointed when I heard that one of the Members \nof the other Chamber said he thought he could put earmarks in this \nconference report because we needed to vet it. It is not our job to vet \nthem. It is not the Parliamentarian's job. They don't have the staff to \ndo this. That is the job of the people of the United States because, \nguess what. It is their money.\n  This is a strong ethics bill. Even though I was a cosponsor along \nwith the Senators who spoke against this on the earmark reform, I want \nto say this goes a long way in the right direction. It is a great \neffort. I am proud of Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Obama, and all of the other Senators who worked on \nthis bill, and many on the Republican side have as well. I think we are \ngoing to pass it by a big number today. It is a moment we should all be \nproud of, an accomplishment we should herald, and we should remember \nthat if we are worried about foxes, we ought to check in our own closet \nfor that fox outfit before we start pointing the finger at anybody.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10723-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10723-S10724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2934 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, early in the consideration of the \nchildren's health insurance bill we are now considering, I offered an \namendment, No. 2534. The amendment was to reauthorize the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act, a piece of legislation we have moved through the \nIndian Affairs Committee, an authorization for Indian health care \nmatters that has been proposed 11 times before in the last 8 years but \nhas not passed the Congress.\n  We have a full-scale emergency and crisis with respect to Indian \nhealth care. I will not go on at great length except to say this: This \nGovernment has a responsibility for health care for Federal prisoners, \nand we also have a trust responsibility for health care for American \nIndians. We spend twice as much per person on health care for Federal \nprisoners as we do to meet our trust responsibility to provide health \ncare for American Indians. I believe I can say without hesitation that \nthere will be people who will die today and tomorrow in this country \nbecause we do not have adequate health care and have not kept our \npromise to the American Indians with respect to the trust \nresponsibility for health care on Indian reservations.\n  I have determined we are going to pass this legislation this year. \nWith the cooperation of my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, who \nindicated yesterday the Finance Committee will mark up this bill on \nSeptember 12--it is a very important commitment from someone who shares \nmy passion on this and who is a very strong supporter of American \nIndians and Indian health care--and with a commitment from Senator \nReid, who similarly is a very strong supporter of these issues, that he \nwill bring that bill to the floor of the Senate in this session of the \nCongress--with those commitments, I believe we will now, finally, in \nthe Senate, pass the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, at long last.\n  With those commitments, I am confident we are on the road to getting \ndone what we need to get done to meet our responsibility. Because of \nthat, I will withdraw my amendment to reauthorize the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act on this Children's Health Insurance Program bill, \nand I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 2534.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much compliment the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. He is absolutely correct. This legislation is on a must-\npass list. I have given my commitment to mark the bill up on September \n12 in the Finance Committee. The leader has indicated he will give \nevery assurance to try to get the legislation up on the Senate floor \nand go on to pass it. It has passed before, but it got hung up in the \nlast Congress. It is high time we get this legislation passed, and I \nthank the Senator for, first, pushing the issue so hard and, second, \nworking with the Senate to find an expeditious way to get this \nlegislation passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Vitter is \nrecognized, Senator Kohl be recognized for 5 minutes and Senator Allard \nbe recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 2596, as Modified, to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside any \npending business so that amendment No. 2596 may be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER.

The clerk will \nreport.\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. DeMint, proposes an amendment No. 2596, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2596), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator DeMint as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is an important amendment in the \ncontext of what we are doing with regard to the SCHIP program. It will \nensure that families who are now covered by health insurance stay \ncovered and are not, in fact--perhaps unintentionally but are \nnonetheless--kicked off or encouraged to leave their current health \ninsurance for the SCHIP program. It is an issue called crowding out.\n  The goal of the amendment is very clear. We want to encourage \nchildren who are eligible for SCHIP but currently have access to \nemployer coverage to use that employer coverage. If they have \ndifficulty maintaining that because of costs, we want to give States \nthe flexibility so they can maintain that coverage. What we do not want \nto do--certainly what I do not want to do, what Senator DeMint does not \nwant to do, and I hope what the huge majority of Members of this body \ndo not want to do--is create a mechanism to push people off good \nprivate insurance or to encourage them to drop good private insurance \nor to encourage employers to drop that coverage simply because we are \nreauthorizing and perhaps expanding SCHIP. No child and no family \nshould be forced onto any Government health insurance program if they \nare currently insured otherwise through the private sector, through the \nemployer, et cetera.\n  CBO's own numbers show that 40 percent to 50 percent of the kids \ncovered under SCHIP and 40 percent to 50 percent of those who would \nbecome eligible under this SCHIP expansion are, in fact, kids who are \nshifted out of private\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\ncoverage into SCHIP. The CBO analysis on this issue is very clear on \nthis point. In my mind, there is no reason the taxpayers should be \npaying for that insurance for folks already on good private sector \ninsurance. We should not be encouraging this very significant shift, \nthis very significant crowding out.\n  As I suggested, opponents of this amendment might say: We are not for \nthat because it may be too costly for some of these families to pay \npremiums in private plans even if they are currently on them. We \nrecognize that argument and that reality. Our amendment--this is very \nsignificant--our amendment allows premium subsidies for these \nindividuals who need that to keep them on their current private \ncoverage and to ensure that coverage is affordable. We maintain State \nflexibility in implementing those subsidies. We give the States enough \nleeway, enough flexibility to create and maintain those subsidies to \nkeep folks on good private insurance. The Vitter-DeMint amendment \nrequires individuals who are eligible for SCHIP but currently have \nemployer coverage to continue to use that coverage. If they truly need \nhelp, truly need premium subsidies, States have the flexibility to do \nthat.\n  I believe the clear majority of the public and the majority of those \nin Congress support Government help to those who need it. But just as \ntrue, a clear majority of the public, a clear majority of us do not \nwant to create an incentive to kick people out of insurance they have. \nWe do not want to create an incentive for employers to end or limit \ninsurance they have. That would be a very negative consequence of these \ngood intentions. Our amendment prevents that to a great extent. In \ndoing so, I have to say I think it draws a clear philosophical divide: \nDo we give people the resources, the ability to continue with their \ncurrent quality care in the private sector or are we, in fact, all for \npushing people into a one-size-fits-all Government-run program rather \nthan allowing them that choice and that quality care in the private \nsector? My amendment says absolutely, if they are covered in the \nprivate sector, we want to encourage that to continue. We want to make \nsure that can work. We don't want to kick them out. We don't want to \nencourage employers to kick them out. But part of that is assisting \nfamilies who really do need help to maintain that. That is a very \nimportant part of the Vitter-DeMint amendment also.\n  I think this is an idea which should have broad consensus and \nbipartisan support. I look forward to that on the floor of the Senate \nand invite my colleagues to look at this and then support the Vitter-\nDeMint amendment, No. 2596.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about putting our country on \na path to insuring all of its children. For the past decade, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--CHIP--has given kids in working \nfamilies the doctor's visits and medicines they need when they are \nsick, and the checkups they need to stay well.\n  Skyrocketing health care costs combined with a decline in employer-\nsponsored health insurance means that thousands of kids and families \nwould go without basic medical care if CHIP did not fill the need. \nThere are now more than 46 million uninsured Americans--9 million are \nchildren. This is simply unacceptable--every child needs health \ninsurance.\n  Without health insurance, many families must forgo routine checkups, \ncrossing their fingers that their children will stay healthy. If their \nson or daughter becomes ill, they wait to see if the symptoms go away. \nBut delay can be tragic. If those symptoms linger or get worse, parents \nare forced to take their kids to the emergency room for help. When a \ncommon cold turns into pneumonia, what would have been a simple, cheap \nfix if caught early, mushrooms into a complicated, lengthy and \nexpensive treatment.\n  Wisconsin's CHIP program, called BadgerCare, serves 67,000 working \nfamilies and makes all the difference in a child's future. BadgerCare \nkids are healthier and more likely to succeed in school--including \nincreased school attendance and a greater ability to pay attention in \nclass.\n  However, there are over 100,000 kids in Wisconsin who are eligible \nfor BadgerCare, but are left out--in danger of having a small health \nproblem becoming a life threatening illness. In order to reach these \nkids, Wisconsin received a waiver from this administration to cover \ntheir parents. Secretary Leavitt recognized that when the family is \ninsured, children have better access to health care and get the \npreventative health services they need saving expensive trips to the \nemergency room. BadgerCare provides seamless coverage for families and \nworks to reduce the number of uninsured children. Strengthening \nBadgerCare will ensure that this successful program can continue to \ncover working families in Wisconsin. It is a good investment of our \nscarce Federal dollars.\n  The bipartisan Senate Finance Committee agreement to renew CHIP is \nthe right approach. It provides an investment of $35 billion over 5 \nyears to strengthen CHIP and it is completely paid for. No one loses \nhealth coverage as a result of this reauthorization. It keeps coverage \nfor the 6.6 million low-income children currently enrolled in CHIP and \ngives States the resources necessary to reach an additional 3.2 million \nuninsured children eligible but not enrolled in CHIP.\n  The initial price tag may seem steep, but, in the long run, it will \nsave money. By catching and treating childhood illnesses early, we will \nsave money that would be spent on emergency care. I want to thank \nSenators Baucus and Grassley for their tireless work on this \ncompromise. It is my hope that the Senate will act to put kids first \nand support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2535, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment No. 2535.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been called up.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I call up amendment No. 2535 and then ask unanimous \nconsent that it be modified, and the modified version is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment No. 2535, as modified, to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TREATMENT OF UNBORN CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Codification of Current Regulations.--Section \n     2110(c)(1) (42 U.S.C. 1397jj(c)(1)) is amended by striking \n     the period at the end and inserting the following: ``, and \n     includes, at the option of a State, an unborn child. For \n     purposes of the previous sentence, the term `unborn child' \n     means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of \n     development, who is carried in the womb.''.\n       (b) Clarifications Regarding Coverage of Mothers.--Section \n     2103 (42 U.S.C. 1397cc) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Clarifications Regarding Authority to Provide \n     Postpartum Services and Maternal Health Care.--Any State that \n     provides child health assistance to an unborn child under the \n     option described in section 2110(c)(1) may continue to \n     provide such assistance to the mother, as well as postpartum \n     services, through the end of the month in which the 60-day \n     period (beginning on the last day of pregnancy) ends, in the \n     same manner as such assistance and postpartum services would \n     be provided if provided under the State plan under title XIX, \n     but only if the mother would otherwise satisfy the \n     eligibility requirements that apply under the State child \n     health plan (other than with respect to age) during such \n     period.''.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask Senator McConnell be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss my \namendment to codify the unborn child rule in the pending SCHIP \nlegislation. This needs to be done, and it needs to be done in this \nreauthorization. The unborn child rule is a regulation that since 2002 \nhas allowed States to provide prenatal care to unborn children and \ntheir mothers. It recognizes the basic fact that the child is in the \nwomb--the child in the womb is a child.\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\n  When a pregnancy is involved, there are at least two patients; there \nis the mother and there is the baby. It only makes sense to cover the \nunborn child under a children's health program. The bill before us \nmodifies the SCHIP statute to allow States to cover pregnant women of \nany age. It also contains language that asserts that the bill does not \naffirm either the legality or illegality of the 2002 ``unborn child'' \nrule. My amendment would codify the principle of the rule by amending \nthe SCHIP law to clarify that a covered child:\n\n       includes, at the option of a State, an unborn child.\n\n  The amendment further defines ``unborn child'' with a definition \ndrawn verbatim from Public Law 108-212, the Unborn Victims of Violence \nAct. So it is not new language in our statute.\n  My amendment would also clarify that the coverage for the unborn \nchild may include services to benefit either the mother or unborn child \nconsistent with the health of both. In addition, the amendment \nclarifies that the States may provide mothers with postpartum services \nfor 60 days after they give birth.\n  Many States' definition of coverage for pregnant women leads to the \nstrange legal fiction that the adult pregnant woman is a child. Surely \nit was not the intent of anyone to develop a State Children's Health \nInsurance Program to allow a loophole for States to define a woman as a \nchild. Surely we can agree that the child in the womb who receives \nhealth care is a child receiving care along with his or her mother.\n  My amendment will also allow for coverage of the mother, whereas the \npending legislation only allows for pregnancy-related services. There \nare many conditions that can affect the mother's health during \npregnancy that are not related to her pregnancy. Under the pending \nlegislation, a pregnant mother could not get coverage for any condition \nthat is not related to her pregnancy. We should be allowing mothers to \nstay healthy so they will have healthy babies.\n  This also leads to reduced costs associated with premature or low \nbirth-weight babies. Eleven States are already using this option to \nprovide such care through the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. If the intent of the sponsors is to provide coverage for the \npregnant woman and her unborn child, then they should have no problem \nsupporting my amendment.\n  We should ensure that pregnant women and their unborn children are \nboth treated as patients. This is a matter of common sense. Every \nobstetrician knows that in treating a pregnant woman, he is treating \ntwo patients, the mother and her unborn child.\n  Keeping this coverage in the name of the adult pregnant woman alone \nis bad for the integrity of a children's health program, bad for the \nchild, and even bad for some of the neediest of pregnant women.\n  I am urging my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, as I have said many times in this \ndebate, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act is \ngood for America. I wish to take a few minutes to talk about why this \nchildren's health bill is good for my home State of Montana.\n  Montana ranks fifth highest in the Nation for the percentage of \nchildren without health insurance. In 2006, 37,000 Montana children did \nnot have health insurance. That is one in every six children. More than \nhalf of those uninsured children, that is 19,000, were either eligible \nfor Medicaid or for CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, but \nnot enrolled.\n  One of the reasons for our higher rate of uninsured kids is because \nthe percentage of employers offering health care to Montana's working \nfamilies is quite low. Less than half of all employers in the State of \nMontana offered health coverage in 2005. This means many working \nfamilies do not have access to health coverage. Although families who \ndo not have access to coverage through work could buy it on their own, \nhealth coverage is often priced out of reach for lower income families. \nThe average cost of a family health plan on the open market in Montana \nis about $8,000 a year. That is nearly one-fifth of the family's income \nfor a family of four earning $41,300, which is twice the poverty level. \nAgain, the average cost is about $8,000, which is about one-fifth of a \nfamily's income for a family of four earning $40,000, and most families \nsimply obviously cannot afford that cost.\n  CHIP, the legislation before us, offers affordable, comprehensive \nhealth coverage for working families. CHIP works, and it has helped \nthousands of Montana families.\n  Abigail Tuhy's family is one of those families. Abigail's mom, Fawn, \nis a mother of four, and Fawn's story tells volumes about why we need \nCHIP. She writes:\n\n       I don't know what our family of six would do without \n     [CHIP]. . . . In one year, my 2\\1/2\\-year-old had nine \n     stitches because she split her head open and my 6 year old \n     broke his arm two times. CHIP paid for the surgery, hospital \n     stay and all of the care provided. CHIP has also paid for all \n     of my children to receive all of their shots and their check-\n     ups. Without CHIP, I would not have insurance for my \n     children.\n\n  Abigail is only one of the more than 38,000 children helped by CHIP \nover the past decade. Today more than 14,000 Montana children are \ncovered by it and the number is growing.\n  This year, the Montana legislature, for example, took a positive step \nforward, changing the CHIP eligibility level from 150 percent to 175 \npercent of the Federal poverty line. That is just over $36,000 for a \nfamily of four. Montana started implementing this expansion in July, \nwhich will bring an additional 2,000 children next year.\n       This is clearly good news, but we cannot rest on our \n     laurels. There are more uninsured children who need our help. \n     The CHIP Reauthorization Act will provide Montana with the \n     funding it needs to maintain current CHIP enrollment, fund \n     its expansion, and make significant strides toward covering \n     more of the uninsured children.\n  Under this legislation, Montana would receive about $28 million next \nyear. That is $12 million more than its allotment for last year. New \nCHIP allotments, combined with new funds in the State to expand \ncoverage to low-income children, could allow the State to cover as many \nas 12,000 children who are uninsured today.\n\n  The legislation before us also includes new funding to help Montana \nimprove access to health care, including $200 million in new Federal \ngrant money for States to improve the availability and \ncomprehensiveness of dental health for children, and $100 million in \nFederal grants to improve outreach and enrollment, especially in rural \nareas.\n  This bill also includes provisions that specifically target Indian \nCountry. Although Indian children are eligible for coverage through the \nIndian Health Service and tribal facilities, the IHS, the Indian Health \nService, is only funded at 60 percent of need today, leading to tragic \ndenials of care when funds run out. I mean it is abominable. This bill \nmakes important changes to improve the health of Indian children. It \nprovides new funds for outreach and enrollment in Medicaid and in CHIP. \nIt also allows those Indians to use tribal documents to prove \ncitizenship for Medicaid. It gives States a higher Federal match for \ntranslation and interpretation services in the program. And it requires \nthe Secretary to monitor racial and ethnic disparities in care. All \nmove us to a healthier future for Indian children in Montana.\n  As we debate CHIP today, let us remember the uninsured children in \nour home States, those kids who need help. In Montana, there are \nmothers whose daughters have cystic fibrosis. There are Native American \nchildren without health care coverage because they do not have a birth \ncertificate. So let's keep in mind the children of Montana and every \nother State who need and deserve our help. Let's reauthorize this \nChildren's Health Insurance Program today and improve the health of all \nAmerican children.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the following Senators be \nrecognized for the following amounts of time: first, Senator Dodd for 5 \nminutes; Senator Clinton for 5 minutes; and Senator Coburn for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I wish to inquire, have we gotten an agreement in place for \nwhen the next block of votes could come?\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is being written up right now.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We do have a block of votes. It has been agreed to.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2631 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n      (Purpose: To expand family and medical leave in support of \n              servicemembers with combat-related injuries)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator Clinton, \nSenator Dole, Senator Graham, Senator Mikulski, Senator Chambliss, \nSenator Brown, Senator Cardin, Senator Menendez, Senator Salazar, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Reed and Senator Boxer, I send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Graham, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Chambliss, \n     Mr. Brown, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2631 to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator Clinton \nand the others I have mentioned here, I seek to, as soon as possible, \nmeet the suggestions that have been recommended by the President's \nCommission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. I want to \nexpress my gratitude to my colleague from New York as well as to others \nwho have joined with us on this effort. This report was submitted to \nthe President by our former colleague, Senator Dole, former Secretary \nof Health Donna Shalala, and this report is rather extensive on their \nrecommendations on how we might better serve our returning soldiers \nfrom the theaters of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The President's Commission on Care for the Returning Wounded \nrecommended:\n\n       That Congress should amend the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     to allow up to 6 months of leave for a family member of a \n     servicemember who has a combat-related injury and meets the \n     other eligibility requirements in the law.\n  I am very proud of many things I have done over the last 25 years in \nthe Senate. None exceeds my sense of pride more than passage of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. Along with Senator Bond, Senator Dan \nCoats, Senator Specter, Senator Kennedy, and many others, after 7 \nyears, three American Presidents, and two vetoes, we were able to adopt \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act which, since its passage, has assisted \nmore than 60 million Americans in being away from their jobs to be with \nfamily members during critical times in their lives without losing that \njob. These important life situations include the joyous occasion of a \nbirth or adoption and the difficult circumstance of an illness of a \nchild or another family member for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. It \nhas been a remarkable asset to many people.\n  I suspect there is not a single American family who would not relate \nto the importance of being able to be with a family member during a \ntime of significant crisis. Obviously, as our wounded warriors coming \nback from Afghanistan and Iraq are recovering from their injuries, \nhaving their families and others with them could be of immeasurable \nhelp. Senator Dole and Donna Shalala and other members of the \nCommission rightly made the recommendation that we should amend the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act to provide for up to 6 months' leave for a \nfamily member to be with these individuals without losing their job. \nThat is what we have done with the amendment we are offering to this \nbill.\n  Clearly, this bill has nothing to do with family medical leave. My \ncolleagues from Montana and Iowa, have a tremendous responsibility in \nadopting the legislation before us, of which I am a strong supporter. \nBut, knowing that we only have a short time before we adjourn for more \nthan a month, there is a sense of urgency about providing for these \nfamilies. I would hope all of us would support this amendment. This is \na bipartisan suggestion that will make a difference in the lives of \nfamilies who are assisting in the recovery of a wounded warrior.\n  I commend former Senator Dole, former Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Donna Shalala, and the distinguished members of the Commission \nfor their thoughtfulness and thorough work on this matter. As the \nauthor of the underlying law, I have worked to maintain its protections \nand extend its protections to assist more employees. I agree with the \nCommission that FMLA is the best method for providing critical support \nfor our returning heroes who are recovering from their war wounds. I am \npleased to be joined, as a principal cosponsor, by Senator Clinton of \nNew York. After more than 7 years of work, as I mentioned earlier, this \nproposal I made more than 20 years ago became law. It became law within \ndays after January 20, 1993, when President William Jefferson Clinton, \nas his very first act, signed into law the Family and Medical Leave \nAct.\n  I remember with great clarity that bright day overlooking the rose \ngarden at the White House, President Clinton signing that bill into \nlaw. Pat Schroeder of the other body was the principal author in the \nHouse of Representatives and too often gets neglected in talking about \nthe history of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I will be eternally \ngrateful to Pat Schroeder for the tremendous job she did in the other \nbody in seeing to it that this proposal became the law of the land.\n  The Commission's findings indicate the critical role that family \nmembers play in the recovery of our wounded servicemembers:\n\n       In their survey, 33 percent of active duty, 22 percent of \n     reserve component, and 37 percent of retired/separated \n     servicemembers report that a family member or close friend \n     relocated for extended periods of time to be with them while \n     they are in the hospital.\n       Twenty-one percent of active duty, 15 percent of reserve \n     component and 24 percent of retired/separated servicemembers \n     say friends or family gave up a job to be with them or act as \n     their caregiver.\n       More than 3,000 servicemembers have been seriously injured \n     during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In virtually every \n     case, a wife, husband, parent, brother, or sister has \n     received the heart stopping telephone call telling them that \n     their loved one is sick, or injured, halfway around the \n     world.\n       Family or close friends stayed to assist recovery of almost \n     66 percent of active duty and 54 percent of reserve component \n     servicemembers.\n\n  The Support for Injured Servicemembers Act provides up to 6 months of \nfamily and medical leave for spouses, children, parents and next of kin \nof servicemembers who suffer from a combat-related injury or illness. \nFMLA currently provides for 3 months of unpaid leave to a spouse, \nparent or child providing care for a person with a serious illness. Our \nservicemembers need more. These are extraordinary circumstances. The \npoint of the Commission and the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors \nAct that the Senate recently passed is to take care of our wounded \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan with combat-related injuries. We should support their \nfamilies in caring for these heroes.\n  It is essential we do everything possible to support our troops, to \nallow their loved ones to be with them as they recover from combat-\nrelated injuries or illnesses. That is why we should expand and improve \nbenefits for those caring for our servicemembers.\n  Let me emphasize the major points: You have to have been injured in \nthe theater of combat, Afghanistan or Iraq or in preparation for \ndeployment. Our amendment allows for a parent, spouse, child or next of \nkin to provide that care-giving role. It would allow them to be with \nthem for up to 6 months without losing their jobs. The leave is without \npay. What is the universe we are talking about? It is not the entire \nNation, obviously, or anyone who is wearing a uniform who happens to \nhave been injured. You have to have been injured or acquired the \nillness as a result\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\nof being in the combat theater or when preparing to be deployed.\n\n  The amendment is specific as to who could be the caregiver. It is \nvery specific about the amount of time an employee acting as a \ncaregiver would be covered. We have tried to narrow this down in a way. \nI am grateful to Bob Dole. He called me last Thursday early on and \nremembered that I had spent such as inordinate amount of time, with the \nhelp of Senator Kennedy and others, to adopt the Family and Medical \nLeave Act so many years ago. Most would agree today it has made a \ndifference in the lives of people. I can't think of any better \nconstituency to serve with expanded family medical leave than our \nservice men and women.\n  I see my colleague from Georgia. I thank him as well for being a \ncosponsor of this proposal. Those preparing for deployment obviously \nwould be covered, if they end up being affected as a result of their \ninjuries or illness suffered while in the theater of combat.\n  Again, as someone who has been a floor manager of many bills over the \nyears, I understand that is not easy to get a particularly difficult \nbill like this done. I applaud the commitment my colleague from Montana \nhas brought to this legislation. It is my hope that we can achieve the \nkind of unanimity around this idea of supporting military families, \ngiven the fact that the President's Commission is calling for this, our \nformer colleagues calling for it. We have a strong bipartisan group of \nSenators who believe this is worthwhile to do for this limited group of \nour fellow citizens who have suffered immeasurably as a result of their \ncontribution. I would hope before we leave here in these next 24 or 48 \nhours that the very least we could do would be to provide this kind of \nbenefit for them and their families.\n  I truly appreciate the work of our cosponsors. In particular, their \nwillingness to adopt a provision that would expand the pool of typical \ncaregivers under current law for this specific purpose. Those \ncaregivers are limited to spouses, children, and parents. Our amendment \nextends the caregiver role to next of kin, a brother, sister or other \nrelative, perhaps.\n  I gather my colleague from New York, who was very helpful in pulling \nthis together, is on her way to the floor. She might want to be heard \non this as well. I was drawing this out while we wait for her arrival.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say to my good friend, we have noticed.\n  I don't see the Senator from New York here yet, but she is on her \nway. In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nGeorgia be recognized and, following the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nClinton be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chair.\n  Since the Senator is running for President, we are glad to \naccommodate him for what time he needs. He is serious and very \nemotional about this issue, and he should be. We all should be. I \ncommend the Senator from Connecticut for spending a good bit of time on \ntalking about this issue. I commend the Senator from New York for \nbringing this issue to the forefront. We are in a war unlike any war we \nhave ever been in before. We are in different times today with respect \nto military conflicts, and the inclusion of our wounded warriors in the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act is certainly well deserved and something \nthat I hope we get passed before we leave.\n  I rise to commend the President's Commission on Care for America's \nReturning Wounded Warriors for their hard, high-quality work in \nanalyzing and recommending improvements for our Nation's treatment of \nwounded warriors. The Dole-Shalala Commission has boldly addressed one \nof the most important issues facing our military today and has created \na simple roadmap that will help make monumental improvements to the \nmilitary health care system. I am pleased the Commission's \nrecommendations span agencies, cross services, and take into \nconsideration the needs of both veterans as well as their families.\n  During their review, they visited 23 health care facilities, \nincluding military and VA hospitals and treatment centers nationwide, \nheld 7 public meetings, heard testimony from military health care \nexperts, and communicated directly with servicemembers, their families, \nand health care professionals. This dialog is greatly needed and must \ncontinue. I provided my own input directly to the Commission regarding \none of Georgia's own success stories in providing care to wounded \nwarriors through a partnership between the Eisenhower Army Medical \nCenter at Fort Gordon, GA, and the Augusta VA hospital. This Commission \nuntangled a web of complex issues and provided six recommendations \nbased on their findings. Former Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala did \nwhat others have been trying to do since World War II. Their joint \nstatement succinctly describes the culmination of these efforts.\n  The face of our military has changed, as have their needs. Some \nreturning servicemembers, injured in the line of duty, have complex and \noften multiple injuries placing greater challenges on the DOD and VA as \nwell as family members. Well-meaning attempts over the years to reform \nhealth care in the military and VA have produced many positive results \nthat have also made the system more complex and confusing in some \nareas. In these cases, it is difficult for servicemembers, their \nfamilies, and caregivers to understand how to navigate the system. The \nevents that brought us to this point were inexcusable and could have \nbeen prevented. However, I would be remiss if I did not mention a \nletter I received from a constituent whose son was a patient at Walter \nReed Medical Center, after being evacuated from Iraq due to injuries he \nsustained in an IED attack. The letter said to the commander and staff \nat Walter Reed:\n\n       You and your staff are a remarkable team that has the \n     welfare of our soldiers and families foremost in mind as you \n     execute your critically important duties. My family and I owe \n     you and your team our heartfelt thanks and debt of gratitude \n     we can never repay.\n\n  This kind of feedback tells me the Army's improvements are taking \nhold. Through the Commission and recent legislation, these improvements \nwill continue. I applaud the Commission's work and am equally pleased \nthat much of it parallels the initiatives set forth by the Senate's \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act. The President's Commission \nrecommended that seriously wounded servicemembers receive a patient-\ncentered recovery plan developed by a cadre of highly skilled recovery \ncoordinators. Such a plan can only increase the level of support given \nto our wounded warriors.\n  Along these same lines, the Wounded Warrior bill requires development \nof a unified and comprehensive policy between the VA and the Department \nof Defense that addresses personnel strength, training, access, \nstandards, family counseling, and creation of a DOD-wide ombudsman. Of \ncentral importance, the Commission recommends a complete restructure of \nthe disability and compensation systems. We have all heard case after \ncase of lost paperwork, endless waste, bureaucratic delays, and \nconfusing redundant processes. Both the Commission and the Wounded \nWarrior bill provide guidance to consolidate systems and streamline \nthis process.\n  One of the most important recommendations made by the Commission, \nalso addressed in the Wounded Warrior bill, concerns increased support \nto the families of our Wounded Warriors. Although the Commission did \nnot visit Georgia, I have spent time at Fort Stewart and Fort Benning \nwith family members of deployed troops, and I have spent as much time \nwith the troops themselves in my five visits to Iraq. I can tell you \nthat when it comes to taking care of our servicemembers, the well-being \nof their families is of paramount, if not greater, importance to them \nthan their own well-being. These troops can count on their families. \nThe more we support the families, the better we are taking care of our \ntroops.\n  Among other things, the Dole-Shalala report recommends extending \nprivileges under the Family and Medical Leave Act from 12 weeks to 6 \nmonths, which will allow family members to take up to 6 months of leave \nto care for a wounded servicemember. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis bill that introduces legislation that enacts this recommendation.\n  The bill Senator Pryor and I cosponsored on this subject, the Wounded\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\nWarrior Assistance Act, S. 1283, also contains provisions along these \nlines, such as advocating counseling and job placement services for \nfamily members, as well as the creation of an ombudsman's office which \nwill provide support to members and their families.\n  So, once again, I commend Senator Clinton for her initiative in \ngetting this bill on the Family Medical Leave Act introduced and I \nconcur again with the Senator from Connecticut. I hope this legislation \nis completed before we leave here in the next couple of days.\n  The global war on terror has brought recognition of the enormous \nimpact of two previously silent and little-noticed conditions to the \nforefront: post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. \nAccordingly, both the Commission and the Wounded Warrior bill address \nthese issues. The Dole-Shalala report advocates the most aggressive \ntreatment for both conditions by the DOD and the VA, and also \nrecommends private-sector involvement to capitalize on the most recent \nand valuable findings and treatments.\n  Similarly, the Wounded Warrior bill provides comprehensive and \ncoordinated policies between DOD and the VA on PTSD and TBI. The \nWounded Warrior bill creates a level of accountability for the DOD and \nVA by requiring an annual report on PTSD and TBI expenditures and \nreports assessing progress in the overall treatment of these \nconditions.\n  The bill also includes a provision I proposed that builds upon a \nstudy at Emory University for TBI treatment and the use of progesterone \nand directs collaboration between DOD and other Federal agencies in \nTBI-related research and clinical trials.\n  The approach taken by the Commission and in the Wounded Warrior Act \ncapitalizes on cooperation among Federal agencies, as well as between \nthe Federal Government and private sector. As part of the fiscal year \n2008 National Defense Authorization Act, I proposed a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment that DOD continue to encourage collaboration between \nthe Army and the VA in the treatment of wounded warriors.\n  A prime example of this type of collaboration is in Augusta, GA, \nbetween the only Active-Duty rehabilitation unit, located at the \nAugusta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and the \nbehavioral health care services program at the Eisenhower Army Medical \nCenter at Fort Gordon, GA. This unique, unprecedented collaboration \nbetween the Augusta VA and the Eisenhower Army Medical Center has been \ngrowing since its inception in 2004, assisted by GEN Eric Schoomaker, \nnow the head of Walter Reed and former commander of the Eisenhower Army \nMedical Center. Our wounded warriors deserve the best possible care. \nThe recommendations of the President's Commission and the requirements \nset forth in the Dignity for Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act pave a \nclear path for the type of medical treatment and support the people \ndefending our Nation deserve.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Wounded Warrior Act, unanimously \napproved by the Senate. I am pleased with the comprehensive \nrecommendations provided by Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala. I \nespecially thank the servicemembers and their families who have shared \nopenly and bravely about their experiences to this body as well as to \nthe Commission. Their stories made the need for this reform real to all \nof us, and their experiences can help us transform the quality of \nmilitary health care. Doing so will be one small way of saying thank \nyou to the men and women in the U.S. military for their service and \ntheir sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 additional \nminutes to address the bill before the Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, the bill that currently is before the Senate. I have \nbeen a strong advocate of this particular program. We, in Georgia, I \nthink, have one of the model SCHIP programs in the country. We call it \nPeachCare. It provides health insurance to 290,000 uninsured poor \nchildren in my State. We cover no adults in Georgia. Every single dime \nthat is spent on this program in Georgia is spent on children, and that \nis the way it should be.\n  That is one of the problems I have with the reauthorization of this \nbill as it came out of committee. It does three things that really \nbother me.\n  First of all, the bill that came out of committee does not take all \nparents off of coverage under the SCHIP program on a national basis. It \ndoes remove, over a 2-year period, all adults who are not parents of \nsome of the children who are eligible for this particular subsidy, and \nthat is good. The problem is, it still covers any number of adults. \nThis is a children's program, and that is where the money ought to be \nspent. Every single dollar we spend on an adult takes money away from \nchildren.\n  Secondly, under this bill, States are authorized to go up to 300 \npercent of the Federal poverty level for coverage. The previous bill \nauthorized up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. In Georgia, \nwe are at 235 percent of the Federal poverty level, which means that a \nfamily of four making $48,000 is eligible for coverage under our \nPeachCare program.\n  Unfortunately, once you reach the level of 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, you are at almost $62,000 for a family of four in \nincome, and you are still eligible under this program.\n  Lastly, I would simply say the bill out of the Finance Committee is \nfinanced by the creation of new and additional taxes. I think the \nAmerican taxpayers--I do not care in what form the taxes are--are \nalready an overburdened group of citizens.\n  From the standpoint of trying to find funding for this program, the \nLott amendment did exactly what we needed to do in Georgia to cover all \n290,000 of our existing children who are covered, plus all who will be \ncoming on within the next 5 years, which is the term of this bill.\n\n  Senator Lott found offsets in his amendment that would not have \nrequired the raising of any taxes to cover those children. That is the \ntype of sensible approach that should have been taken. I regret that it \ndid not pass.\n  Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to support this bill in its \ncurrent form.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the chairman for being generous, \nand thank the Senator from New York for allowing me to extend my time, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 4:30 p.m. today be for debate with respect to the amendments \nlisted below, and that they be debated concurrently; that all time be \nbetween the managers; that no amendments be in order to any of the \namendments covered in this agreement prior to the votes; that the votes \nwith respect to the amendments occur in the order in which the \namendments are listed here; further that after the first vote, the time \nfor votes be limited to 10 minutes, and there be 2 minutes of debate \nprior to each vote; and that at 4:30, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendments; that the Graham amendment No. 2558 be \nmodified with the changes at the desk; that Senators Kyl and Graham be \nrecognized respectively at 3:45 and 4 p.m. The amendments are Specter \namendment No. 2557, Graham amendment No. 2558, Ensign amendment No. \n2540, Thune amendment No. 2579, and Kyl amendment No. 2537.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it sounds as \nif maybe what I understood--what I have here that was going to be in \nthe agreement--was altered a little bit when the Senator read the UC. \nFor instance, on the third line, beginning after the semicolon: ``that \nall time be between Senator Baucus and amendment sponsor; that no \namendments be in order to any of the amendments''--is that the way you \nread it?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes--well, I struck some of those words you read and \ninserted ``the managers.'' The thought was, it gives more flexibility \nso the two managers of the bill could then work with the sponsors of \nthe amendments to allocate time. Some may want to speak longer than \nothers. I felt that was just a way to better organize the time.\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I just want to make sure the manager on this side really \nwants to work with the sponsors of these various amendments.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am sure he does.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, I am not sure he does. That was the point. But I just \nwanted to get that clarification.\n  With that clarification, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The amendment (No. 2558), as modified, is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 218, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through page 220, line 2, and insert the following:\n       (a) Cigars.--Section 5701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``($1.594 cents per thousand on cigars \n     removed during 2000 or 2001)'' in paragraph (1) and inserting \n     ``($50.00 per thousand on cigars removed after December 31, \n     2007, and before October 1, 2012)'',\n       (2) by striking ``(18.063 percent on cigars removed during \n     2000 or 2001)'' in paragraph (2) and inserting ``(53.13 \n     percent on cigars removed after December 31, 2007, and before \n     October 1, 2012)'', and\n       (3) by striking ``($42.50 per thousand on cigars removed \n     during 2000 or 2001)'' in paragraph (2) and inserting \n     ``($10.00 per cigar removed after December 31, 2007, and \n     before October 1, 2012)''.\n       (b) Cigarettes.--Section 5701(b) of such Code is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``($17 per thousand on cigarettes removed \n     during 2000 or 2001)'' in paragraph (1) and inserting \n     ``($50.00 per thousand on cigarettes removed after December \n     31, 2007, and before October 1, 2012)'', and\n       (2) by striking ``($35.70 per thousand on cigarettes \n     removed during 2000 or 2001)'' in paragraph (2) and inserting \n     ``($104.9999 per thousand on cigarettes removed after \n     December 31, 2007, and before October 1, 2012)''.\n       (c) Cigarette Papers.--Section 5701(c) of such Code is \n     amended by striking ``(1.06 cents on cigarette papers removed \n     during 2000 or 2001)'' and inserting ``(3.13 cents on \n     cigarette papers removed after December 31, 2007, and before \n     October 1, 2012)''.\n       (d) Cigarette Tubes.--Section 5701(d) of such Code is \n     amended by striking ``(2.13 cents on cigarette tubes removed \n     during 2000 or 2001)'' and inserting ``(6.26 cents on \n     cigarette tubes removed after December 31, 2007, and before \n     October 1, 2012)''.\n       (e) Smokeless Tobacco.--Section 5701(e) of such Code is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(51 cents on snuff removed during 2000 or \n     2001)'' in paragraph (1) and inserting ``($1.50 on snuff \n     removed after December 31, 2007, and before October 1, \n     2012)'', and\n       (2) by striking ``(17 cents on chewing tobacco removed \n     during 2000 or 2001)'' in paragraph (2) and inserting ``(50 \n     cents on chewing tobacco removed after December 31, 2007, and \n     before October 1, 2012)''.\n       (f) Pipe Tobacco.--Section 5701(f) of such Code is amended \n     by striking ``(95.67 cents on pipe tobacco removed during \n     2000 or 2001)'' and inserting ``($2.8126 on pipe tobacco \n     removed after December 31, 2007, and before October 1, \n     2012)''.\n       (g) Roll-Your-Own Tobacco.--Section 5701(g) of such Code is \n     amended by striking ``(95.67 cents on roll-your-own tobacco \n     removed during 2000 or 2001)'' and inserting ``($8.8889 on \n     roll-your-own tobacco removed after December 31, 2007, and \n     before October 1, 2012)''.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my understanding under the previous \norder Senator Clinton is the next to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Baucus, and I thank \nboth Senators Dodd and Senator Chambliss for their vigorous explanation \nand advocacy of the bill which we have introduced that we are proposing \nto have as an amendment to the current legislation pending before the \nSenate because we think the duty to honor our veterans, our \nservicemembers, and their families is urgent. This is a duty we take \nvery seriously.\n  Clearly, based on the recently released report by the Commission on \nCare for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, chaired by former \nSenator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services \nDonna Shalala, it is a matter of grave urgency for our Nation to do \neverything we can to improve support for our servicemembers and \nveterans.\n  The Commission found that one of the most important ways to improve \nthat care is to improve support for families. That is why Senator Dodd \nand I have offered an amendment to the CHIP legislation, the Support \nfor Injured Servicemembers Act.\n  We are proud to have the bipartisan support of Senators Dole, Graham, \nMikulski, Chambliss, Brown, Salazar, Cardin, Menendez, Kennedy, Boxer, \nand Jack Reed because this is a matter that goes way beyond politics as \nusual. It is certainly way beyond partisanship.\n  During the course of the Dole-Shalala Commission work, they showed \nwhat many families across the country already knew, that the Family and \nMedical Leave Act--which Senator Dodd worked so hard on for so many \nyears, and which was the first piece of legislation signed by my \nhusband--has been a godsend to 60 million Americans over the course of \nthe last years--people taking care of newborn babies, a family member \nwith an accident or illness, caring for an aging relative. It has made \nit possible for so many Americans to balance the difficult \nresponsibilities of family and work.\n  But what has been abundantly clear--with all of our wounded warriors \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan--is it has not been sufficient for \nfamily members to care for those young servicemembers who have \nsustained a combat-related injury.\n  Currently, spouses, parents, and children can receive only 12 weeks \nof leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. All too often, as we \nhave now learned, that is insufficient, as injured servicemembers \ngrapple with traumatic brain injuries, severe physical wounds, learning \nhow to use a prosthetic, trying to understand what post-traumatic \nstress disorder means to them and to their futures. Indeed, family \nmembers have dropped everything. They have tried to be at the bedside, \nstayed in the area to help their loved one, given up jobs even. That \nseems to us to be more than the sacrifice their loved one has already \nmade demands.\n  Imagine if your husband or your wife or your son or your daughter had \nbeen injured. You would want to be with them. You would want to take \ncare of them. But you would not want to lose your job in the process. \nIt is not a choice that military families should have to make. \nTherefore, that is why we are asking our colleagues to join with us to \npass the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act, and to allow us to \nfulfill this duty we all feel to our military families.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Dodd's leadership on this issue for \nmany years, and on this particular piece of legislation. We invite even \nmore cosponsors from both sides of the aisle to join us, and we hope we \nwill have a vote on this legislation before we leave, before we finish \nthe CHIP legislation, so we can go home and tell military families that \nhelp is on the way.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Texas is seeking \nrecognition. I ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to speak next \nfor--10 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, 10 minutes would be fine. I ask to \nbring my amendment up, set aside the pending, and continue to speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2620 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 2620 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2620 to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2620\n\n    (Purpose: To increase access to health insurance for low-income \n     children based on actual need, as adjusted for cost-of-living)\n\n       Strike section 110 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 110. COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN HIGH COST \n                   AREAS WITH FAMILY INCOME ABOVE 200 PERCENT OF \n                   THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2105(c) (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(c)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(8) Coverage of individuals residing in high-cost \n     areas.--\n       ``(A) In general.--For fiscal years beginning with fiscal \n     year 2008, a State shall receive payments under subsection \n     (a)(1) with respect to child health assistance provided to an \n     individual who resides in a high cost\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\n     county or metropolitan statistical area (as defined by the \n     Secretary, taking into account the national average cost-of-\n     living) and whose effective family income exceeds 200 percent \n     of the poverty line (as determined under the State child \n     health plan), only if such family income does not exceed 200 \n     percent of the poverty line as adjusted for the cost-of-\n     living in the State under subparagraph (B)).\n       ``(B) Adjusted poverty line.--The Secretary shall adjust \n     the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved \n     with respect to each State to take into account the cost-of-\n     living for each county or metropolitan statistical area in \n     the State, based on the most recent index data from the \n     Council for Community and Economic Research (previously known \n     as the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association),the \n     2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey of the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the \n     Department of Commerce.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 2105(a)(1) ( 42 U.S.C. \n     1397dd(a)(1)) is amended, in the matter preceding \n     subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or subsection (c)(8)'' after \n     ``subparagraph (B)''.\n       (c) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall \n     promulgate interim final regulations to carry out the \n     amendments made by subsections (a) and (b).\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nthat would help address what some view as a serious problem in the \nunderlying legislation, and what others might view as a matter of \nfairness in the underlying legislation.\n  The purpose of the SCHIP program is to provide health insurance \nbenefits to children in families who make too much to qualify for \nMedicaid but not enough to afford private insurance. We define that \ncriteria as families up to 200 percent above the Federal poverty line. \nThe current Federal poverty line for a family of four is $20,650. The \nFederal poverty line for Hawaii and Alaska is a little higher. Two \nhundred percent, then, would be $41,300.\n  My State of Texas maintains its SCHIP program consistent with the \noriginal purpose and therefore allows a family of four making $41,300 \nto qualify for SCHIP coverage. When my constituents see the bill before \nus allowing families of four making up to 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty line, which is $61,950, to qualify for Government-supported \nhealth care, many believe this is going too far. They certainly take \nissue with families making up to 400 percent of the poverty line, which \nwould be $82,600, receiving Government-funded health insurance.\n  I have heard the supporters say that allowing coverage above 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty line argue that the cost of living in \ncertain areas necessitates higher Federal poverty level coverage. One \nonly has to utilize the various cost-of-living calculators on the \nInternet such as those found on bankrate.com or CNN/Money to see that a \nsalary in one area of the country can be worth a very different amount \nthan in another. The cost-of-living calculators adjust income by \ncomparing the cost of housing, utilities, and transportation, all of \nwhich have a significant impact on the actual need of the family.\n  For example, in this chart, you see that the cost of living in \nAustin, TX, would be $40,000, whereas after you add housing, utilities, \nand transportation, if you compare that to the cost in Washington, DC, \nit would be $58,697, or rather the salaries would be commensurate after \nyou add the cost-of-living indicators in it.\n  The bill before us does not make a direct connection between the \ncost-of-living standards and approvals of SCHIP plans beyond the 200 \npercent Federal poverty line restrictions. It doesn't seem right to \narbitrarily allow coverage of families beyond 200 percent of the \nFederal line if there is no relationship to the cost of living. If \n$41,300 of family income in one State is equal to a higher amount in \nanother due to a cost of living that exceeds the national average, my \nproposal would accommodate that. Why don't we say in this legislation \nthat similarly situated families will be treated similarly. That is \nwhat my amendment would do.\n  Under my amendment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will \nbe required to factor in the cost of living in States that are seeking \nto cover families above 200 percent of the poverty line. Utilizing the \nmost recent index data from the Council for Community and Economic \nResearch, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis, the Secretary shall adjust the Federal poverty line \nthroughout specific areas in those States that reflect the actual cost \nof living in those specific areas. The Secretary could then approve \nfamilies up to twice the new adjusted Federal poverty line, accounting \nfor a higher cost of living in that area.\n  The Secretary would break down the analysis by county or metropolitan \nstatistical area to ensure that States with high-cost areas in some \nparts of the State and low-cost areas in other parts of the State would \nnot receive the same amount. This does what I think everybody has said \nwe need to do, and that is adjust if there is a cost-of-living \nincrease, but not lump it State by State.\n  In my State of Texas, there will be metropolitan areas with a higher \ncost of living. So if my State wanted to go above the 200 percent, the \nSecretary could factor in where there needed to be an adjustment. If it \nwere over the 200 percent in a metropolitan area such as Dallas, it \nmight be a different calculation than if it is in a rural area, say \nLubbock. This seems to me to equalize the unfairness of a whole State \ngetting the higher rate through a waiver which the bill before us is \ntrying to mitigate by putting a limitation on the percent above the \npoverty line that a State may go, but why not do it by SMSA--the \nStatistical Metropolitan Area--or by county, where you can get the \nadjustment that is right and fair.\n  My amendment is very simple. The 200 percent of the poverty line, \nwhen adjusted for the cost of living in a specific area, could equal \n$45,000, it could equal $50,000, or it could be right at the poverty \nline. If you needed to go above it, the Secretary would be able to say \nin New York City, for instance, there should be an adjustment, but in \nupstate New York, perhaps not.\n  So this is the amendment. I think this brings reasonableness, \nrationality, and equity to approvals beyond the nonadjusted Federal \npoverty limits. If you do not go above the 200 percent which is in the \nlaw, you would never have to make these adjustments. There are \ncertainly metropolitan areas that have a legitimate claim to a higher \ncost of living, but it does not necessarily mean the whole State should \nbe given that kind of adjustment, and it would be more reasonable for \nthe taxpayers throughout America to know that the people were getting \nthe adjustment if they needed it, but not if they didn't.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut also for the process, and I \ncertainly would urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which I \nthink is what should end up in the final bill. It is simple, it is \nclear, and it is fair.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that the time consumed by the \nSenator from Texas be charged against the time controlled by the \nminority, and further, that the time for the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes from our side. Is that \nsufficient time, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If I need more time, I will ask for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2540\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about my amendment. My \namendment says that the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is \ndesigned to cover low-income children, should first cover low-income \nchildren. Many of the States today are covering nonpregnant adults and \nI believe this is at the expense of low-income children. This program \nis called the State Children's Health Insurance Program and it is \ncalled that for a reason. It is supposed to be for low-income kids. It \nwas not intended for nonpregnant adults.\n  My amendment says that you cannot cover nonpregnant adults until you \ncover 95 percent of the targeted low-income children's population. Some \nStates have extended their SCHIP coverage to nonpregnant adults. \nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, SCHIP covered 6 \nmillion individuals, including more than 600,000 adults in the year \n2005. This means that 1 out of every 10 people covered by SCHIP was an \nadult. GAO indicated that in Wisconsin, two-thirds of the total SCHIP \nenrollees in 2005 were adults. Almost half of the enrollees in Rhode \nIsland were adults. It also found that shortfall States are likely to \ncover a high proportion of adults.\n  The GAO wrote:\n\n       Adults accounted for an average of 55 percent of enrollees \n     in shortfall States, compared with 24 percent in nonshortfall \n     States.\n\n  Covering adults is not the primary purpose of SCHIP. I am seriously \nconcerned that nonpregnant adults may be benefitting from SCHIP funds \nat the expense of low-income children. We need to refocus the SCHIP \nprogram to its original intent--to make low-income children the \npriority. My amendment today will ensure that SCHIP funds are used to \nprovide health insurance coverage to low-income children. In my \nopinion, that is the intent of the original law and the way in which \nSCHIP dollars should be allocated.\n  This proposal does not deprive States of Federal dollars. What it \ndoes say is that a State can't use its SCHIP money to provide health \nbenefits to nonpregnant adults until it has enrolled 95 percent of its \ntargeted low-income children.\n  We have heard a lot about the need to cover low-income kids, about \nkeeping them healthy, and giving them a chance in life. If the States \naren't forced to cover 95 percent of the low-income kids first, they \nwill continue the current policies and many low-income kids won't be \nreached out to and brought into the SCHIP program. If we require the \nStates to cover 95 percent of low-income kids, we will be amazed at how \nmany of these kids the States will find.\n  I believe it is important for us to adopt this amendment. If we are \ngoing to expand SCHIP, let us make sure low-income children are the \npriority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a couple of words with respect to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. I might as well finish \nthem now, since he spoke. Basically, his amendment means that no State, \nafter the date of enactment, could provide for adults--childless adults \nor parents, parents of kids. No State. That is what this is.\n  I also point out that the standard of 95 percent is an impossible \nstandard. No State can meet that standard. There is no State in the \nNation that could meet 95 percent. We have mandatory driver's license \nrequirements in States, and even those mandatory requirements average, \nnationwide, about 85 percent. That is mandatory, and we are talking \nabout something voluntary here.\n  So no State can possibly reach 95 percent compliance, which would \nmean, at the beginning of the date of enactment, all adults would be \noff--right now, immediately; all parents off--right now, immediately. \nAnd I don't think that is what we want to do. Why? Because the \nadministration has granted lots of waivers to a lot of States for a lot \nof adults, and States are reliant on them.\n  In this legislation, over a 2-year period, we are stopping that, but \nwe give States 2 years to stop providing coverage for childless adults \nand for parents. States can provide for parents with those waivers, but \nit is written in a way to discourage the use of CHIP money for parents \nunless States go the extra mile and seek out more low-income kids to \nprovide coverage for them.\n  The legislation before us is a good compromise, but the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada is way too Draconian. I might also \nadd that all experts say if you cover parents, you will cover more \nkids. If you don't cover more parents, you are going to cover fewer \nkids. There is a very strong correlation between health insurance \ncoverage for parents and parents getting good health care for their \nchildren. Put in reverse, there is a strong correlation of parents who \ndo not have health insurance--we are talking low-income families here--\nwho will not provide good health care, on average, for their kids.\n  On the basis of policy, I don't think it is a good idea. It totally \ndisrupts the compromise worked out on both sides of the aisle on this \nlegislation. Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, myself, and Senator \nRockefeller worked very hard to get a compromise here. This legislation \nstarts to squeeze down on adults, but it doesn't cold turkey say no. \nThat would be unfair, especially with respect to parents, because \nparents who have health insurance themselves will tend to provide \nbetter health care for their kids.\n  When the appropriate time comes to vote on this amendment, I think \nthe right thing to do would be not to support this amendment because of \nthe reasons I indicated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't believe there is any other Senator \nwishing to speak right now, so I will rise in support of the amendment \nby the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  I believe that Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and \nthose who put together this compromise did want to try to begin to get \nsome control on the explosion of this program. But there are a lot of \nothers who don't want to do that. They want it to go the other way.\n  Yes, the administration is to blame for a lot of the problems here. \nThey granted the waivers for these States, and they shouldn't have. \nThey started granting waivers for higher and higher and higher income \nchildren to be covered, for adults to be covered--and not just pregnant \nmothers but parents and, in some States, even beyond that.\n  As I have said before, there is no ``A'' in SCHIP. It is the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--for children, SCHIP as we refer to \nit here in this Chamber. But I do have every reason to believe there \nare many who fully intend for this program, the CHIP program, to be the \nprogram that covers not only low-income children, middle-income \nchildren, but all-income children and adults. That is the goal here.\n  I voted for this program 10 years ago because I thought there was a \nneed to make sure that truly low-income children had access to health \ncare. A lot of them were not covered, obviously, by private insurance \nor Medicaid, and I thought there was a need to address this particular \narea. But it is like so many Washington programs; once they get \nstarted, they never end. And once they get started, they grow and grow \nand grow.\n\n  Who is going to help get a grip on this program? Who is going to pay \nfor this program? This is a $60 billion, 5-year program this bill would \nprovide for--the underlying bill. The House just passed a bill that I \nthink is close to at least $80 billion over the next 5 years. They pay \nfor it in the House partially by taxes but also by cutting Medicare. So \nwe are taking elderly off of the Medicare Program so we can put more \nmoney into the SCHIP program not just for low-income children but for \nmiddle-income children and for adults.\n  I think the Senator is absolutely right. Let us make sure these \nStates provide at least 95 percent of what they are supposed to supply \nto the low-income children before any adults can get in it. Yes, they \nwill have to take adults off. Exactly. They should have to. They should \nhave never put them on there.\n  Now, again, I acknowledge we are hopeful this bill will begin to get \nthis under control. It does take away the waiver that is being used, \nand has been abused by this administration. But I cannot believe that \nSenators are ignoring the fact that this program is being exploded, \ncovering people who were never intended to be covered, and paying for \nit by damaging low-income people or elderly people.\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\n  I am glad we have this amendment. If we could at least get the adults \noff this program, even if it does cover some increased level of \nchildren below the 200 percent of poverty, I could see that it would be \nmore acceptable. But that is not what this does.\n  I fear what is going to happen in conference. I don't know, maybe the \nSenator from Montana and Senator Grassley can sit there and say, oh, \nno, no, no, we are not going above what we passed in the Senate. But I \nthink the reverse is going to be true. This is the base. The $60 \nbillion is the beginning. It is obvious, if you have a classic \nconference, which we are not going to have, and we are at $60 billion \nand the House is at $80 billion, what is it going to be? Oh, $70 \nbillion. That is the way it works around here. That is the way it used \nto work, although we don't have conferences anymore now. We dished up a \nproduct such as we had on this lobbying and ethics fiasco a while ago.\n  I don't know how we get through this and help the people we want to \nhelp, intend to help, and keep it from covering more and more children \nand more and more adults. If we want to go to Washington bureaucratic-\ncontrolled and managed health care, if we want to go ahead and go to \nGovernment-run socialistic medicine, fine, this is it. This is the way \nit is going to happen.\n  A few years ago, there was an attempt to come in the front door and \nsay, oh, no, we are only going to provide free health care to \neverybody. It failed miserably, right here. And by the way, it failed \nin August of that year, I believe it was 1993. Well, here we are coming \nthrough the back door this time. And incredibly, even my colleagues on \nthe Republican side of the aisle are buying this deal.\n  I will be back. I don't know whether I will be on the floor of the \nSenate, but I will be back in years to come and say, I warned you. This \nthing is going to continue to grow. It won't be $60 billion, $70 \nbillion, or $80 billion, it will be $140 billion over 10, or more.\n  I appreciate the amendment Senator Ensign came up with. I support it, \nand I hope we can pass it. And I wish the managers good luck in trying \nto keep control of this thing. If you pull it off, even though I still \nthink you have way too big a program here, I will be first in line to \ncongratulate you if you can hold it to where it is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator is always interesting, \nsometimes entertaining, but the Senator from Mississippi raised a \ncouple of good questions. The real question is what are the answers to \nthe questions.\n  One question is, what about adults? This is a children's program, and \nI think most Senators react a little adversely to covering adults. This \nSenator does too. It is a children's program, not an adult program. The \nSenator acknowledged graciously that most of the adult coverage problem \nis due to waivers this administration has given the States. The States \nwant to cover adults. Why do they want to cover adults? Well, \nbasically, because of the match rate, the money the States get under \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program is higher, so they want to \ncover adults. What we are trying to do is figure how are we going to \nput the lid back on this. That is what we are trying to do here. It \nprobably gets to the question of what is a fair transition period. What \nis the fair way to wean the States off of covering adults?\n  I guess it is important to remember there are a lot of people, adults \nout in the country who are getting health insurance, and they do not \nknow what we are debating here in Washington, DC. They do not know the \ndifference between CHIP, Medicaid, and match rates. All they know is \nthey are getting some health insurance. And I don't know if it is right \nto just willy-nilly, automatically, cold turkey cut them off entirely, \nbecause they are depending on it.\n  I do think it is right, however, to wean States off this, and the \nStates can, when their legislatures meet, figure out ways to cover \nadults they wish to but not on this program. That is what we are doing. \nThat is what this legislation does. It says in the first year you can \nget a free ride, but in the second year your match rate is way down to \nthe Medicaid match rate, which is basically about 30 percent less than \nthe match rate under the Children's Health Insurance Program. A 30-\npercent cut will have a real effect on a lot of these States and \ndiscourage them from proceeding further.\n  In addition, legislation not too long ago repealed waivers so the \nStates could no longer apply for waivers to get childless adult \ncoverage. So question No. 1 is, what is the right thing to do about \nsome States adding adults? Let us not forget, 91 percent of \nbeneficiaries under the Children's Health Insurance Program today, 91 \npercent, are kids under 200 percent of poverty. Today. The vast bulk \nare kids. So when we talk about adults, we are talking about less than \n9 percent, because some States have up to 200 percent of poverty. We \nare talking not too many people when we are talking about adults. This \nis kind of a philosophical question as much as anything else.\n\n  What is the best way to put the lid back on the can, to keep States \nfrom providing it for too many adults? We think we have a fair way to \ndo it, as I just described, a fair transition period, and that is why \nwe negotiated out this position.\n  Point No. 2 is, what is going to happen in conference. I have no \nidea. Senators know there are lots of ways to skin a cat around here. \nOn the surface it looks like maybe if the Senate and House go to \nconference on these two bills--the Senate bill is much less, the House \nbill is much larger. They contain the Medicare provisions, physicians \nupdate provisions, and they are two different animals. When that \nhappens, generally some other solution presents itself. That is why I \nsay to my good friend from Mississippi, I hear what he is saying about \nthe views of many Senators who do not want the conference report to \ncome back with a number that is too difficult for many Senators to \nswallow, especially on the Republican side of the aisle. But I also say \nto my good friend, there are ways to do this. We may not go to \nconference exactly; the House may send back something else, maybe just \na CHIP bill, and we will do the physicians update at a later date. \nThere are many kinds of ways to do things around here.\n  Our goal is to help low-income kids who do not have insurance today \nso a few more get it. This is not a huge, massive expansion. This has \nnothing to do with national health insurance, none of that.\n  We are saying: Here is a program passed in 1997, it is bipartisan, \nSenators on both sides of the aisle like this program, there have never \nbeen any problems with it, it has worked real well, it just came up \nwith reauthorization. The only slight problem is waivers for adults, \nbut we are managing that. That is not a big deal. We can take care of \nthat. So let's just reauthorize it, give it a little bump up to help a \nfew more--not a lot, a few more kids get health insurance, and it costs \na few dollars because health care costs are going up so much in this \ncountry.\n  While we are helping a few kids get health insurance, at a later \ndate, next year, the following couple of years--clearly, Congress has \nto address the rising cost of health insurance in this country. But as \na bottom line, this is a good thing to do, to help low-income kids get \nsome health insurance.\n  Let's remember, in the United States of America there are about 48 \nmillion people without health insurance. We are the only industrialized \ncountry with that many people without health insurance. It is an \noutrage. The very least we can do is help our kids get some health \ninsurance, particularly those who are low-income kids. That is what we \nare trying to do in a fair and reasonable way.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Montana will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am honored to yield to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I understand it, this legislation is paid for. The \nFinance Committee reported out a piece of legislation to provide health \ncare coverage for about 3 million more children, and it is fully paid \nfor; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't know what is in second place with respect to what \nis important in people's lives, but if your children are not in the \nfirst place, something is wrong. Everybody who is a parent ought to \nunderstand the priority is your child--the children of this country.\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\n  I ask the Senator from Montana, the circumstances are that we have a \nlot of people in this country who do not have health insurance \ncoverage. We have substantial problems with respect to dramatically \nincreasing costs of health care. The fact is, we have sick kids in this \ncountry who do not get health care. They ought to get health care, but \nthey do not because their parents do not have enough money in their \npocketbook or their checkbook, and they are worried what it is going to \ncost if they take their kid to the doctor.\n  One of my colleagues and I held a hearing a couple of years ago, and \na mother held up a poster with a colored picture of her son. He was \ndead. He died because he didn't get the health care he needed when he \nneeded it. The fact is, that is happening in our country and, I say to \nmy colleague from Montana, this is not a giant leap forward, but it is \na significant step, to say we can do this. We can help children. We can \nprovide health insurance for children who do not have it. We can fully \npay for that bill, as the Senator from Montana has done, and his \ncolleagues in the Finance Committee.\n  I ask my colleague, this is not a health insurance bill that is going \nto cover all Americans, that is going to dramatically expand, is it? \nIsn't this just a piece of legislation that takes a step forward in \nsaying to 3 million kids that the days they are sick, no longer will \ntheir parents have to make a decision about whether they can afford to \ntake them to a doctor? Isn't that what this is about?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. But not only is it 3 million, it \nis 3 million low-income kids.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might further inquire, that answer means these are \nkids who come from families who do not have the resources?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And they usually do not have health insurance because \nthey can't afford it, even if their employer provides it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Further inquiring, in circumstances where they might \nbelieve they have no choice, they don't have any money, and they have a \ndesperately sick child, they are going to show up in an emergency room. \nIf that emergency room doesn't turn them away--and some will--that \nchild will get the most expensive or the costliest health care because \nthat is where it costs the most to provide health care--in the hospital \nemergency room. That is why this approach is so important.\n  I hear people say, what a radical thing to do, what an awful thing to \ndo. This ought to be considered a baby step forward, but an important \nbaby step, nonetheless, in doing what we are required to do in this \ncountry. Again, that is putting our children first, especially putting \nsick children first, sick children who come from families that do not \nhave the money to find a way to get them to the doctor. That is what \nthis is about. This ought to be a no brainer.\n  One final question, if I might. We have been on this for a while, and \nit has been a wide open discussion, and there have been a lot of \namendments. I believe we have four or five additional votes scheduled \nat 4:30 today. I would like to inquire, what next? What do we \nanticipate? How many additional amendments might exist?\n\n  I hope we can work through this. It is a bipartisan bill. It makes so \nmuch sense. What does the Senator from Montana anticipate after the \nnext batch of votes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I expect, frankly, the Senate will finish \ntonight, late tonight, and get this legislation passed--as well it \nshould. In addition to the five amendments pending beginning at 4:30, \nthere could be at least about 10 more later today--maybe a package \nabout 8:00, another about 10 o'clock, something like that. My hope is \nsome of those will not all be offered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is important to finish the bill tonight. It is a \nbipartisan bill with strong support. It is a matter of giving everybody \nan opportunity to offer their amendments, which we have done. At that \npoint I think it will be a significant achievement for all Americans, \nwhat we have done for poor, sick children in this country. I thank my \ncolleague from Montana for the leadership he and Senator Grassley and \nso many others have shown on this bill. This is a very important step \nfor this Congress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't know if we have much time left. I \nam trying to figure out how much time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Each Senator has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure. How about 3 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could ask the Senator a question or two?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was listening to the floor earlier today. I heard \ncolleagues say this SCHIP program is a first step toward socialized \nmedicine. Is this Children's Health Insurance Program a new program?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my good friend, this is not a new program. We \nare just reauthorizing a current program. It is not new.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How many children are covered under this program?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Currently, there are about 6.6 million children covered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As I understand it, this would add several million \nchildren?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. About 3.3 million, roughly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. About 3.3 million, and there are already 6 million. I am \nwondering if they are suggesting this program should be eliminated, \nwhich would mean 6 million children currently covered would no longer \nbe covered?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Actually, the Senator is making another point, which is \nabout 6 million kids are eligible today under the current law but just \nare not covered. So we are saying we are not increasing the \neligibility, we just want to help give a little stimulus so those who \nare currently eligible but not covered--a few more of them will be \ncovered by health insurance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is it my understanding the American Medical Association \nhas endorsed this legislation?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. There are many medical \nassociations that support this bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator know of anytime in the history of this \ncountry where the American Medical Association has endorsed socialized \nmedicine?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know if I want to answer that question, because I \ncan think of one major bill that many thought was socialized medicine \nbut they now strongly support.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say the argument being made out here is one of the \nmost far-fetched arguments I have seen on this floor; No. 1, that this \nis somehow socialized medicine. Isn't this care provided by private \ndoctors?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a very good point. I might say, this legislation \nreceived endorsements from over 50 different organizations, major \norganizations--AARP, pharmaceutical companies, the American Medical \nAssociation. This bill has wide endorsements.\n  As the Senator has just implied--yes, this program says: OK, States, \nyou figure out how you want to administer it. It is up to you, the \nStates, not Uncle Sam.\n  Most States say we are going to utilize health insurance companies, \nprivate health insurance companies to administer this, with copays and \ndeductibles, and so forth.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The fact is, this care is provided by private physicians \nusing private insurance companies, endorsed by the American Medical \nAssociation and many other national organizations, including many \nbusiness organizations; is it not?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. This legislation also provides \nassistance for States to provide--the fancy term is ``premium \nassistance''; that is, to help families pay the insurance companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2557 offered by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S10736]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have five votes now. Senator Specter is \ndetained. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first \namendment we vote on in the package would be the Kyl amendment. I see \nSenator Kyl on the floor. I make that request that we proceed \nimmediately to the Kyl amendment, with 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote, and subsequent to the Kyl amendment, that we go back in \nthe same order; that 10 minutes be allotted between votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object. Were you making a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Kyl would like to defer to Senator Specter, who \nshould be here momentarily. They are all on the Judiciary Committee. He \nwould like to let Senator Specter go first, if he could.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy. Because we have \nbeen held in the Judiciary Committee until now, I was not able to \ndebate my amendment. Given the fact there are not many people on the \nfloor, I would want my 2 minutes when there are people on the floor. \nFor that reason, if we could set it at one of the later votes, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. I am trying to move this along. The \nJudiciary Committee did break up some time ago.\n  Mr. KYL. Thirty seconds ago.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, longer than that.\n  Mr. KYL. Well, I was there.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2557\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote in relation to amendment 2557 offered by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the core issue is the repeal of the 1993 \nalternative minimum tax rate increase. The alternative minimum tax was \nput into effect in 1969 in order to catch people who paid little or no \ntaxes; people in high brackets who had sufficient loopholes to avoid \ntaxation.\n  Regrettably, it has grown by bracket creep to be very expansive. In \n2006, it covered 3\\1/2\\ million people. If it is not changed, it will \ncover 23 million people this year. The tax was increased in 1993 from \n24 to 26 percent for people making under $175,000, to 2 percent more \nfor people in the upper bracket.\n  This is a matter that can be explained in a minute. It is a tax which \nnever should have occurred, and now we can correct it for the people in \nthe lower brackets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much share the concerns of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, I think every Member of this body does. That \nis, no one wants the Americans who currently do not pay the alternative \nminimum tax to have to pay it next year. They will have to unless this \nbody, this Congress, makes the appropriate change in the adjustment.\n  I am fully committed to finding a solution so anybody who has not \npaid alternative minimum tax in 2006, when he or she files their tax \nreturns next April, does not have to pay it for 2007.\n  This is not a good solution. Frankly, with this solution by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, many more Americans are going to have to pay \nthe AMT; it is not paid for, it is at a cost of about $420 billion.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 201 of the Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, the \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, the Finance Committee's proposal \nreauthorizing the SCHIP program for 5 years is funded by a permanent \ntobacco tax increase. That is a $35.2 billion expansion of SCHIP, which \nis above the $25 billion in the baseline budget. The money for this \ncomes from a cigarette tax increase of 61 cents to $1 per pack. There \nwill be a tax increase on cigars by 53 percent, with the sales price up \nto $10 per cigar.\n  Despite being a 5-year reauthorization, the tax part of it goes in \nperpetuity. So it is a very simple amendment. When the program itself \nis sunset to be reviewed, let's sunset the tax part of it to be \nreviewed. That is all it is. If you are going to sunset the program, \nsunset the tax increases and make an intelligent decision at that \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator clearly described his \namendment. There is a slight problem that the cost of about $36 billion \nover 10 years is not paid for. I think we should adhere to the Budget \nAct and pay for provisions we enact.\n  So, Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 201 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to amendment \nNo. 2540 offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It says we \nshould focus on low-income kids before adults. The original intention \nof the program was the Children's Health Insurance Program. This says \n95 percent of all of those targeted--whether they are 200 or 300 \npercent of poverty; whatever your State is--they have to be covered \nbefore you can cover nonpregnant adults.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee is going to say no State can \nmeet this. Well, if we don't set the goal for them and don't make them \nmeet it, they won't meet it, of course. So if we are going to have a \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, the money should be focused on the \nchildren. This says you cannot spend money on the adults unless they \nare pregnant adults until 95 percent of those targeted kids are \nenrolled in the program, and that is where the money is spent. I urge \nthe adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a poison pill. The effect of it is \nto kill this legislation.\n  The Senator is correct, no State can meet 95 percent. No state \ncurrently meets 95 percent. Driver's license participation, which is \nmandatory and not voluntary, is 85 percent. Participation in Medicare \nPart D, which is voluntary and not mandatory, is only 56 percent. There \nis no way in the world any State can meet a voluntary compliance rate \nof 95 percent, so this is a killer amendment. It kills the bill. It \nostensibly applies to adults, but it kills the bill. I urge Senators \nnot to kill the SCHIP program and vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2579, offered by \nthe Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me start by saying this amendment is \nnot a poison pill. By voting for this amendment, it doesn't impact any \nother part of the legislation, except to limit the expansion of SCHIP \nin the following ways:\n  To show you how expansive in nature this bill is, this bill would not \nprevent a State, such as New York, from going to the 400 percent of \nFederal poverty level, which in New York is about $82,000, which, \ninterestingly enough, would subject over 12,000 people in New York--\ntaxpayers--to the alternative minimum tax.\n  So, essentially, what we are saying is you are poor enough to qualify \nfor SCHIP, but you are wealthy enough to be subject to the AMT.\n  My amendment says that for children or adults from families with \nincomes so high they are going to be subject to the AMT, they cannot \nalso be eligible for SCHIP. Families should not be considered low-\nincome for the purpose of receiving taxpayer-funded health insurance \nand, at the same time, wealthy enough to have to pay the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scores this amendment as achieving \nsavings because there will be fewer people qualifying for SCHIP than \notherwise under this bill.\n  This helps us get back to the original intent of the bill, which is \nto cover low-income children, which I strongly support. I hope Members \nwill support the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator raises two issues, the AMT and \nthis legislation. They are two entirely separate, independent issues. \nWe will deal with the AMT at the appropriate time, not on this bill. \nThe AMT is a huge problem. This Congress and the committee are going \nto, as sure as I am standing here, make sure we have some kind of AMT \npatch so taxpayers who did not pay the AMT tax in 2006 will not have to \npay it for 2007.\n  We should not try to solve the AMT problem on the backs of the low-\nincome kids. It is wrong, dead wrong. I strongly urge Senators to keep \nfirst things first. This is a kids bill, not an AMT bill. We deal with \nkids today and help low-income kids and we will deal with the AMT at a \nlater date. Believe me, we will find a solution to that.\n  I urge Senators to keep their eye on the ball with kids and not to \nsupport the amendment.\n\n[[Page S10738]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment says that the program is \nimplemented as long as no more than 20 percent of the beneficiaries are \ncrowded out of private insurance; in other words, no more than 20 \npercent of the beneficiaries already have private insurance.\n  Here is the problem: The Congressional Budget Office says that \nbetween 25 and 50 percent of the people who are going to be covered \nunder this program already have private insurance. What is worse, every \none of the newly eligible is already insured. In other words, CBO says \n100 percent of the newly eligible, the people we are adding to this \nprogram, already have insurance. Now why should the American taxpayer \nhave to pay for people who already have insurance?\n  Surely, in response to the argument of the other side that it is as \nefficient as we can get, we can be more efficient than 100 percent \ninefficient. My amendment says that when we get it down to only 20 \npercent inefficiency, then the program takes effect; in other words, \nwhen only 20 percent of the people we are paying for already have \ninsurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is plainly, simply, clearly a killer \namendment. There is no way in the world that CBO can certify 20 percent \ncrowd-out. They cannot do it.\n  There are many organizations trying to figure out what is the so-\ncalled crowd-out rate. They are all over the lot. It is almost \nimpossible to tell what it is. That is the reason for the big range to \nwhich the Senator referred. The one to one is not accurate. If you read \nthe CBO table closely and go down to the next line, you will see it is \nmuch less, about one-third under the table. There is no way CBO can \ncertify this. It cannot happen.\n  If this amendment is adopted, you are basically saying no State can \nhave a Children's Health Insurance Program. This is clearly a killer \namendment. We should not kill the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nWe should help more kids get health insurance, kids who are not now \ngetting it.\n  I urge refusal of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, before we vote, I wish to set up a series of \ncolloquies among several Senators after this vote. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following Senators be recognized for the following \namounts of time on the Lincoln amendment No. 2621: Senator Lincoln, 5 \nminutes; Senator Nelson of Nebraska, 3 minutes; and Senator Snowe, 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND \n                   MEANINGFUL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) There are approximately 45 million Americans currently \n     without health insurance.\n       (2) More than half of uninsured workers are employed by \n     businesses with less than 25 employees or are self-employed.\n       (3) Health insurance premiums continue to rise at more than \n     twice the rate of inflation for all consumer goods.\n       (4) Individuals in the small group and individual health \n     insurance markets usually pay more for similar coverage than \n     those in the large group market.\n       (5) The rapid growth in health insurance costs over the \n     last few years has forced many employers, particularly small \n     employers, to increase deductibles and co-pays or to drop \n     coverage completely.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the necessity to improve affordability and \n     access to health insurance for all Americans;\n       (2) acknowledges the value of building upon the existing \n     private health insurance market; and\n       (3) affirms its intent to enact legislation this year that, \n     with appropriate protection for consumers, improves access to \n     affordable and meaningful health insurance coverage for \n     employees of small businesses and individuals by--\n       (A) facilitating pooling mechanisms, including pooling \n     across State lines, and\n       (B) providing assistance to small businesses and \n     individuals, including financial assistance and tax \n     incentives, for the purchase of private insurance coverage.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask one more unanimous consent request \nand that is to add Senator Hatch as an original cosponsor to our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be here today, \noffering this amendment to affirm this body's commitment to move \nforward with health care reform in the small group and individual \nmarkets this year. We certainly know our focus here is on children. We \nwant it to be. We know that is a priority. We know if we take things \none step at a time, we do a much better job at it, so we are glad to be \nhere working on children's health care and the availability and \naccessibility to that.\n  But we are also excited with the group of Members who have expressed \ntheir concern about the small group market, those of our small \nbusinesses and our self-employed, and the real concerns and needs they \nhave in terms of access to health insurance. As is evident from this \ndistinguished list of cosponsors joining me in offering this amendment, \nit is an extremely important issue, one that Members across the \npolitical spectrum in this body are committed to addressing in the \ncoming months.\n  I know this week has been about children's health care, and rightly \nso. But we must not get ourselves into believing we are nearly done, \nbecause we are not. Much more work is required of us to ensure all \nAmericans have access to affordable and quality health care.\n  There are now approximately 45 million Americans without health \ninsurance. In my home State of Arkansas, 20 percent of working age \nadults are uninsured. Additionally, more than half of our uninsured \nworkers are employed by businesses with less than 25 employees or are \nself-employed. These small business employees are almost always in a \nsmall group and individual health insurance market, where similar \ncoverage usually costs more than it would in a large group market. \nActually, they end up without anything, in terms of health insurance, \nbecause it becomes so costly.\n  Addressing this problem must be a national priority. That is why we \nhave come together as a group. Those who lack health insurance do not \nget access to timely and appropriate health care. They have less access \nto important screenings and state-of-the-art technology and \nprescription drugs.\n  This is not a new problem and none of us see it as that, but it is a \ngrowing problem and it is one that we must address and we must begin to \nstart to find the solution, the solution using new and innovative ideas \nto this age-old problem. I, along with each of these distinguished \ncosponsors on this amendment, have been working for a long time, trying \ndesperately to make progress on this issue. We have not all approached \nit in the very same way, and, no, we have not necessarily seen the same \npath to a solution, but that is all right because what is important is \nthat through this amendment we are recognizing and affirming our \nresponsibility to come together in a bipartisan way, to use our \nindividual expertise and perspectives, and to find a workable solution \nthat is going to move the ball down the field and start providing real \nrelief for our working families in this great country this year.\n  I take a moment to thank my partners on this amendment. I thank them \nfor their determination to move forward in a bipartisan fashion, to \nmake real progress on health insurance reform, specifically for small \nbusinesses and the self-employed. I thank them for all their tireless \nefforts, because each person in this cosponsorship list has taken a \ntremendous amount of their time over the past several years to devote \nattention to this critical issue: Senator Snowe, who is on the Senate \nFinance Committee and also on the Small Business Committee; Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley have been wonderful, in the midst of \nall the things they have been facing, to work with us as a group to \ntalk about what we can and cannot do in the Finance Committee; Senator \nBen Nelson, who has a tremendous history in dealing with this issue, \nfrom the perspective of his State but also here on the HELP Committee; \nHELP Committee Chairman Kennedy; and Ranking Member Enzi, who comes \nwith tremendous background; and Senator Durbin and Senator Crapo, with \nwhom I have worked on so many different issues, as well as Senator \nSmith and Senator Hatch.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I look forward to rolling up my sleeves, \nalong with each of these cosponsors and each of our colleagues, to make \nthe small businesses and the self-employed working families of this \ncountry a priority, as we have the children of this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2621\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my \ncolleague from Arkansas, my friend Senator Lincoln, to speak on a \nseparate but overlapping issue related to the challenge of providing \nhealth care coverage for the 9 million uninsured American children. Our \ncolleagues Senators Baucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch have \nforged a bold agreement to cover millions of children through the SCHIP \nprogram, the health program for our kids.\n  However, another problem remains. These children, by definition, live \nin households that have not been adequately covered by the private \nmarket. In fact, of the 45 to 46 million Americans who are currently \nuninsured, over 80 percent are employed. These people get up every day \nand work hard to support their families and keep our economy moving \nforward but are left praying their family doesn't face a bankrupting \nhealth crisis. Fifty percent of these Americans work for small \nbusinesses with fewer than 24 employees. The small business workforce \nis especially important in my State, and I know it is critical for many \nof my colleagues from other States as well.\n  I applaud the hard work which has gone into SCHIP, and I intend to \nvote for this important package. But I am also glad we have the \nopportunity to show our commitment toward providing market-based \nrelief, which will afford additional coverage for the remaining \nuninsured Americans.\n  This is indeed one of our country's greatest challenges. I look \nforward to turning our focus to solutions for small business, alongside \nthe leaders of the Finance and HELP Committees who have joined us \ntoday. I thank the floor managers for affording us this time. I am \nencouraged by the progress made today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2577 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \n cooperative governing of individual health insurance coverage offered \n                        in interstate commerce)\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and amendment No. 2577 be called up for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2577.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, one of the best ways we can help millions \nof American children access quality health coverage is to lower the \ncost of insurance for their families. Two-thirds of the uninsured have \nincome at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, and they \ncite a lack of affordability as a top reason for why they do not have \ncoverage.\n  Our Tax Code already discriminates against Americans whose employers \ndo not offer health benefits. I applaud a number of my colleagues, \nSenator Wyden, Senator Burr, and many others, who have talked on the \nfloor extensively about how we can equalize the Tax Code and make \nhealth insurance available to everyone.\n  Another driver of rising health insurance prices is excessive State \nregulation. These State mandates raise the cost of insurance, which, in \nturn, increases the number of Americans who are priced out of the \nhealth insurance market.\n  Current law traps Americans by only allowing them to buy health \ninsurance in the State where they live. This is not fair, and it makes \nvery little sense in a time when we are trying to lower the cost of \nhealth insurance. My amendment, which we call the Health Care Choice \nAct, will help millions of American children by allowing their parents \nto shop for health insurance the same way they shop for many other \nproducts: online, by mail, over the phone or in consultation with an \ninsurance agent in their hometown.\n  This amendment will empower consumers by giving them the ability to \npurchase an affordable health insurance policy with a full range of \noptions. This amendment would reform the individual health insurance \nmarket by allowing individuals and families who reside in one State to \nbuy a more affordable health insurance plan that is offered and \nlicensed in another State. That is an important point.\n  We are not talking about insurance that is not licensed. Every State \nhas regulatory processes, and insurance products would have to be sold \nunder one of those regulatory regimes in one of our 50 States. Health \ninsurance plans would be able to sell their policies to individuals and \nfamilies in every State, as other companies do in the sale of a wide \nvariety of goods and services in other sectors of our economy.\n  Under this amendment, consumers would no longer be limited to picking \nonly those policies that meet their States' regulations and mandated \nbenefits. Instead, they could examine the wide array of insurance \npolicies qualified in States across the country.\n  Consumers could finally choose the policy that best suited their \nneeds and\n\n[[Page S10741]]\n\ntheir budget without being tripped up by State boundaries. This \napproach would provide more choices and more freedom to all Americans. \nIf they want to purchase a basic, low-cost policy without hundreds of \nbenefit mandates that they do not need, they will be allowed to do it.\n  Likewise, those Americans who are interested in a particular benefit \nwould be allowed to do that as well. The Health Care Choice amendment \nwill help the uninsured find affordable health insurance while also \nproviding every American with better insurance choices. This amendment \nharnesses the power of the marketplace to allow Americans to tailor \ntheir insurance choices to their individual needs. That is something we \nshould all be able to support.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, this \namendment will broaden and intensify competition across health care \nplans and medical providers, encourage a serious review of existing \nhealth care regulations in every State, and expand the choice of \nmillions of Americans of more affordable health insurance policies.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very interested in what the Senator has \nto say.\n  Are you telling me that if I am in Mississippi and I want to buy a \nhealth insurance policy in South Carolina, I cannot do that?\n  Mr. DeMINT. You can't. Your State limits you. The way we have this \nset up federally, there is really no national market for health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. LOTT. What is the possible explanation for that, or \njustification?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I wish I knew. I think many years ago we didn't have a \ngood regulatory structure for insurance. It was provided to the States. \nBut clearly health insurance is an interstate commerce issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DeMINT. People move all over the place. Companies have offices \nall over the place. For us to continue to limit the purchase of health \ninsurance to the State one lives in makes no sense.\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly agree. I thank the Senator for bringing this to \nthe attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate the question. I appreciate the support of \nthe Senator.\n  In New Jersey, the average cost for a single person to buy health \ninsurance is over $4,000 a year. Right across the river in \nPennsylvania, the average is less than $1,500 a year. This amendment \nwill give consumers the option of buying the health insurance that \nmeets their needs and is right for them, even if it is right across the \nborder. This amendment will result in significant cost savings.\n  A recent study found that consumers would save an estimated 77 \npercent in New Jersey, 22 percent in Washington, 21 percent in Oregon, \nand 16 percent in Maryland, if those States eliminated some of their \nmandates.\n  There will also be cost savings from cutting redtape because \ninsurance plans won't have to go through 50 different certification \nprocesses.\n  By mandating benefits, State legislators have swelled the number of \nAmericans without health insurance, making each health policy's \ncoverage very different. They have added things such as acupuncture and \nmarriage therapists and in vitro fertilization, things that may be \nimportant to some people but not to everyone. They should not be \nmandated to everyone.\n  Finally, this amendment is widely supported by Americans across the \npolitical spectrum. A poll conducted by Zogby International in \nSeptember of 2004 found that 72 percent of respondents support allowing \nan individual in one State to buy health insurance from another State, \nif the insurance is State regulated and approved, as it would be under \nthis amendment. The poll showed that only 12 percent of Democrats \nopposed it.\n  People understand intuitively that it doesn't matter. As the Senator \nfrom Mississippi just said, it doesn't make sense that we limit people \nto buying health insurance in only one State.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is one that certainly \ncannot be accepted. Essentially, it allows insurance companies to race \nto the bottom, race to the State with the lowest level of standards of \ninsurance regulation, to market and sell in any State, irrespective of \nwhat the standards would be in the other States. I don't think that is \ngood policy. I understand what the Senator is driving at but certainly \nnot tonight. Without a closer examination of what our State insurance \nregulation policies should be, this is not the time to get into this \nissue.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Are there particular States that you think the \nregulations are unacceptable for the people who live there?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is up to people in those States and their insurance \ncommissioners, the decisions they make with respect to how their State \nsets up insurance regulation and sets up insurance commissioners.\n  Mr. DeMINT. My amendment does not change any of the State \nregulations. States continue to control their own regulations. It would \nallow the residents of the State, if they did not feel that the \nmandates were appropriate for their family needs, to look at another \nState for a policy where it was also regulated.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. And that is the problem with the \namendment. It would encourage companies to race to the bottom. I don't \nthink we want that encouragement. We want a national program.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I believe we have had a second on a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At the appropriate time, if the Senator wishes to spend \nmore time--I don't know where we are right now, frankly.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Parliamentary inquiry: I believe we had a second on the \nrollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor. Does \nhe yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator would like to have a vote \non his amendment, we will at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  Who yields time? Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                         Tragedy In Minneapolis\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, and I \nwish to thank our colleagues in the Senate for their thoughts and \nprayers for the victims in the almost unconscionable tragedy that \nstruck our State yesterday.\n  We just returned from the scene of an unprecedented disaster in our \nState's history. As my colleagues have watched on the news over the \nlast 24 hours, one of the busiest bridges in Minnesota--the I-35W \nbridge near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis--collapsed into \nthe Mississippi River yesterday evening.\n  The Mississippi is not just a river in Minnesota; it is our identity. \nRight near where the bridge went down, in 1680, Father Louis Hennepin, \nthe first European in the region, first spotted the Falls of St. \nAnthony. A few years earlier, he ``discovered'' Niagara Falls as well. \nAs the head of navigation of one of the world's great rivers, the Falls \nof St. Anthony became the focal point for Minnesota's lumber, textile, \nand flour-milling businesses that put us on the map.\n  Many Minnesotans have visited the spot far upstream in northwestern \nMinnesota, where the ``Mighty Mississippi'' is a little stream, flowing \nout of Lake Itasca, that you can walk across. It is why we call \nourselves the Headwaters State and pride ourselves of being a place of \ninvention and innovation.\n  So when the bridge came down 24 hours ago, part of Minnesota's soul \nfell with it as well. Having visited the site firsthand today, there \nare three things I would like to join Senator Klobuchar in asking of \nour colleagues, our fellow Minnesotans, and all Americans this \nafternoon.\n  First, and most importantly, please keep the victims of this tragedy \nand their families in your thoughts and prayers. The courage of the \nfirst responders and other citizens who joined together last night in \nthe noblest of rescue efforts will receive our unending respect. \nUnfortunately, our mission is no longer rescue but recovery.\n  The days ahead will be incredibly difficult for the families of the \nvictims of those who we know have already left us and the many more who \nremain missing. For comfort in this time of unspeakable tragedy, we \nimplore each and every one of you to honor their loss by keeping them \nnear to your heart and in your prayers.\n  Secondly, let us acknowledge the skill, coordination, and courage of \nthose responding to the scene of this horrific event. I was the mayor \nof St. Paul, Minneapolis's twin city and proud neighbor, when we \nexperienced the tragedy that will define our era--the attacks of 9/11. \nI remember the challenges we had with communication, with logistics, \nand with overall preparedness.\n  Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the State of Minnesota learned the lessons \nof preparation that day and set out to ensure that if any major \nemergency should happen again, we would be ready. Mr. President, you \nhope that day never comes, but yesterday it came for the ``Mill City.''\n  Our Governor, Mayor Rybak, Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek's \noffice, other local first responders--police and fire--and hundreds of \nTwin City residents responded in a manner which those of us who \nwitnessed will carry with us forever.\n  Mr. President, Senator Klobuchar and I saw the living definition of \nheroism and leadership today.\n  We saw and heard stories of bystanders linking arms to pull victims \nfrom submerged automobiles, rescue divers braving the dangerous current \nof the Mississippi to reach vehicles beneath shredded concrete and \njagged steel, and the faces of moms and dads reunited with their \nchildren after their miraculous escape from a trapped schoolbus. These \nimages will reverberate across our State for years to come, and we owe \nall those who contributed to those stories of survival our eternal \ngratitude.\n  Finally, as we move forward in the coming days and weeks, let us \ncommit ourselves to rebuilding this critical artery in our heartland \nand to protect against another tragedy such as this from ever occurring \nin our great Nation. This process will take time, energy, and \ndedication.\n  Next, it is absolutely critical we begin a comprehensive evaluation \nof our Nation's infrastructure immediately. The one thought many of my \ncolleagues have conveyed to me over the last 24 hours is the fear this \ncould have happened to any bridge in their home State or hometown. We \nneed to make sure it never will.\n  We also need to rebuild. Our Federal Highway Administration operates \na program to assist in this type of disaster, providing emergency \nrelief for Federal highways in the wake of tragedy.\n  Our Governor made a request today to the Secretary of Transportation. \nSenator Klobuchar and I will join the entire Minnesota delegation in \nworking with the Department of Transportation to transfer this funding \nas quickly as possible. My colleague will talk a little bit about some \nof the details of what we are asking. We need, in sum, to make the \nfunding as expeditious as possible. We have some legislative hurdles we \nbelieve we can correct.\n\n  Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced a bill to waive the cap on \nemergency highway funds that can be transferred in such a scenario and \nto allow those funds to be used to help transit routes and facilities \nin the meantime, as an interim measure.\n  We do not have much time to rebuild in Minnesota. The construction \nwindow is extremely small because of our difficult winters. We need to \npass this waiver before we recess, hopefully, tomorrow.\n  As Minnesota has come to the aid of other States in their time of \ndisaster, we are going to need a lot of help in our home State. I am \nhappy to hear from around this Capitol and throughout the \nadministration that help will be coming very soon.\n  We must wrap our arms around those who have lost and grieve.\n  There will be the temptation to turn pain and agony and suffering \ninto anger and blame. Unfortunately, blame will come--responsibility \nfor this tragedy may lie in many places--but I ask all of us today, let \nprayers and support be the order of the day.\n  Our obligation and commitment to the victims of the horror of \nyesterday's tragedy must be to recognize that we can no longer put off \nour commitment and obligation to our Nation's infrastructure.\n  I am committed to that cause on behalf of Minnesota and reach out to \nmy colleagues to ask you to join with me in making that commitment to \nall of America.\n  At one of the darkest moments of the American Revolution, George \nWashington wrote these words in a letter:\n\n       Perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages.\n\n\n[[Page S10743]]\n\n\n  The people of Minnesota are writing a new chapter in that American \nstory in the aftermath of one of the worst disasters my State has ever \nseen.\n  I am honored to be a Minnesotan today, and I look forward to what I \ntrust we will accomplish together tomorrow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Coleman, \nfor those fine words and for his description of the history of the \nMississippi River, which is such an important part, as he noted, of our \nState's history. But for me it is personal. I live only 8 blocks from \nwhere this bridge buckled under. This is a place where every day I \ndrive with my husband and our 12-year-old daughter.\n  As I looked down at that bridge, when I stood on the side and saw \nthat schoolbus barely hanging to the side of that fallen concrete, I \nthought of those drivers, I thought of those other moms with their kids \nin the backseat--that on an August day, maybe they were going to a \nTwins game or maybe they were driving home from work--and never did \nthey expect that a massive eight-lane interstate highway bridge would \nsuddenly buckle to the ground. That is what we saw when we went there \nthis morning.\n  But the other thing I saw that I come back to tell the Nation is \nthere are little miracles every day--the miracle of that schoolbus, \nwhere kids from a very poor neighborhood in Minneapolis were sitting \nand somehow saved, and acts of heroism. People saw on the news the \nwoman diver who went in and back in and back in, without any safety \nequipment on, among the concrete and the shards looking for survivors.\n  This was a disaster that no one expected, but it was something our \ncity and our State had planned for. We learned the lessons from 9/11, \nand we had many practices for these kinds of disasters. I was the \nformer prosecutor for this area. I remember meeting with the sheriff \nand the police chief and we planned these drills and we went through \nthem. You could see the results today. You could see the lives that \nwere saved.\n  When we got in today and drove on this highway, there were actually \nbillboards--actual billboards--already up telling people how to get \naround the scene. There were actually 24 buses added to the transit \nservice, already, at 6 a.m. in the morning and advertised in the \nnewspaper so people could get to work. This is going to be a model as \nwe go forward for how to handle national disasters.\n  The Mississippi River starts in Minnesota. In fact, you can walk \nacross it by Lake Itasca, as Senator Coleman noted. But then you go \ndown and it gets bigger and bigger and pretty soon it ends in New \nOrleans.\n  When I think about what happened today, I think of a much bigger and \nmore massive disaster with Katrina and how that was handled and how \npeople in Washington responded. In some ways, I always think of those \npeople stranded on those roofs. I think the mirror of those people was \na reflection of leadership and a lack of leadership. We are not going \nto let that happen in Minnesota.\n  We know this is not the massive disaster of Katrina. But it is a huge \nmess, and it involved a loss of life. So we are coming together, \nbipartisan, with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Senator \nReid is fully behind this. Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, Senator \nMurray--they all talked to me already this morning, and they pledged \ntheir support.\n  So what we have proposed, working with Senator Coleman--we are \nworking together on this--and working with the Republican leadership, \nis we get a bill passed tonight to at least authorize a lifting of the \ncap so we can move forward for emergency disaster relief.\n  But I think this is also a reminder, as we go forward, that we have \nto invest in our Nation's infrastructure. We do not know what the cause \nof this disaster was. One thing I learned as a prosecutor is, you do \nnot come to conclusions unless you know the cause. But this is a \nreminder that we need to invest in our long-term infrastructure, and we \nneed to have those emergency funds in place, because a bridge such as \nthis in the middle of America should not fall into a river on an August \nday.\n  We need to get to the bottom of this and we will rebuild this bridge \nand we will rebuild this country.\n  Our prayers are with the families, our thoughts are with the rescue \nworkers. We thank them for working throughout the night. We thank our \nhospital personnel and our firefighters and our police officers and the \nordinary citizens who were walking by--it is right in the middle of the \nUniversity of Minnesota campus--and dove into that river to help.\n  This was the true spirit of Minnesota, and the world watched last \nnight.\n  Thank you, and I thank my colleagues for their support and all the \nhelp they have given us as we move forward. This is going to be a long \nprocess. It is not going to end tonight. Our goal is to get this bridge \nrebuilt and to get our city moving again.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2621\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, having visited with certainly the \nmanaging Senators for this bill, I would like to call up my amendment \nNo. 2621. I believe it is appropriate at this time to ask unanimous \nconsent for its acceptance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her efforts on \nthis amendment. She has worked very hard on it, and I urge the adoption \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2621) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for possibly 10 \nminutes to have Senator Burr, Senator Bennett, and myself engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as my colleagues have stated, we have to \nmake health insurance more affordable. One thing Democrats and \nRepublicans can agree on is that there are inequities in the tax \ntreatment of health insurance. We all agree that Congress should level \nthe playing field and expand access to health insurance; the question \ngets down to how.\n  Proposals which have been introduced so far include the President's \nproposal, which includes a standard deduction for health insurance. \nSenator Burr, Senator Coburn, Senator Martinez, Senator Corker, and \nSenator Dole have formally introduced a tax credit proposal. Each \nproposal contemplates eliminating the exclusion for employer-provided \ncoverage to meet this end. Currently, a taxpayer who receives health \ninsurance through his or her employer is not taxed on the cost of the \nhealth coverage. Individuals who do not receive health coverage through \ntheir employer and are not employed and purchase health insurance on \nthe individual market generally do not receive a tax benefit. As we \njust discussed, this problem is most acute in the small business \ncontext.\n  Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett are also interested in fixing the \nhealth care system and making health insurance more affordable. Their \nproposal also contemplates amending the Tax Code for that purpose. I \ncommend Senators Wyden and Bennett for their work in this area.\n  I wish to ask Senator Burr if he would take an opportunity at this \ntime to comment on this and explain where he is coming from, and then I \nwill call on Senator Bennett.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for, as a key \nmember of the Finance Committee, acknowledging the fact that it is time \nwe treat all Americans the same; that if you give a tax break on one \nside, you should give a tax break on the other side; that you should \ntreat everybody alike. I think we approach this in a bipartisan way \nwith Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett, and though we disagree about \nexactly how to implement it, this is tremendous progress.\n  As the chairman described the difficulty we have today and the \nchallenge in front of us, I think all of us say: When are we going to \nfix it? Today, we are on the floor talking about an expansion for \nuninsured children. What we are attempting to do is\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\nto take care of the whole uninsured population. Through refundable tax \ncredits, which I believe reach all Americans--not some and not just \nthose with incomes that have tax deductibility at the end of a calendar \nyear but all Americans--I think we accomplish that commitment to say we \nwant to go out and make sure every American has coverage. We want to \nmake sure they have the resources to go in the private marketplace and \nnegotiate coverage that reflects their age, their income, their health \ncondition. We want health care to be portable so you are no longer \nlocked to an employer because of health care. We want individuals to \nhave the capacity to take it with them, regardless of where they work.\n  We propose that once we reach tax equity, every individual in this \ncountry would receive annually a $2,160 refundable flat tax credit, and \nevery family would receive a $5,400 annual refundable flat tax credit, \nmore than enough money to cover the tax consequences of a benefit that \nis not treated as wages, and for any extra money that is left over if \nyou are on employer plans, it would be deposited in a health savings \naccount where those additional funds could only be used for health \ncare.\n  For individuals in the market today who don't have coverage, all of a \nsudden we have provided the money for them to go into the marketplace \nand to negotiate coverage for themselves or for their families. That \ncheck would go directly from the U.S. Treasury to the insurer that is \nproviding that coverage. If there is something left over from their tax \ncredit after they have negotiated for coverage, it would go into their \nhealth savings account.\n  We are maximizing the amount of dollars just by treating Americans \nthe same--not by giving one special favors and others being deprived of \nthat but saying we are going to treat all Americans the same. Then, an \namazing thing happens: We no longer have a debate on uninsured \nAmericans because every American has the opportunity through that--it \nis not under the Government plan--to receive that refundable flat tax \ncredit.\n  Some may be at home saying: This really doesn't apply to me. But it \ndoes because when you eliminate the uninsured in this country, you \neliminate the cost shift each one of us who has health insurance today \npays for. I tell my colleagues that the cost of every American's health \ninsurance will come down if, in fact, we solve this problem once and \nfor all.\n  I think the commitment from the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee is an important first step for us treating the tax side of \nthis in an equitable fashion, and I look forward to working with our \nother colleagues on exactly what the solution is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I apologize for my voice. Some people may \nsay I need a little health care, but, in fact, I am in good shape.\n  I wish to thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee for his \ndiligence in this situation as well as his attention to this issue over \nmore than a decade. As a very freshman Senator in 1994, I participated \nin the debate we had on comprehensive health care that ended up in a \nsituation President Clinton described in his State of the Union Message \nthe following year. He said: Last year, we almost came to blows over \nhealth care, and he wanted to know why we couldn't get together on \nbipartisan lines.\n  Well, the ranking member of the Finance Committee has signaled his \nwillingness to get together along bipartisan lines. Senator Wyden, a \nmember of the committee, has talked to me about this, and I have been \nmore than happy to join with Senator Wyden, and I thank him for his \nstatesmanship and his willingness to deal with this question in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Senator Burr has talked about how universal coverage--the term \nRepublicans always used to hate to use--is now a legitimate concept. \nUniversal coverage used to be code word for a single-payer, government-\nrun system, which Republicans opposed. We now understand that everyone \nin the country should have access to health care so that the cost \nshifting Senator Burr talked about can stop and the debates over what \ncan be done for the uninsured can stop, and it can be done if we change \nthe tax laws in an intelligent way.\n  Our tax laws for the coverage of health insurance go back to the \nSecond World War. I think the economy has changed sufficiently since \nthe Second World War that we can recognize that the tax laws need to be \nchanged. Senator Wyden's leadership on this issue, opening up the \nquestion of how we can use tax credits now to achieve what Democrats \nhave wanted to achieve for a long time, which is universal access to \nhealth care, and at the same time provide what Republicans have wanted \nfor a long time, which is real market forces in health care, to me is \nan idea whose time has come.\n\n  So I am looking forward to the opening the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee has suggested, where the Finance Committee can have \nhearings on this issue when we come back after August. I know that will \nrequire the cooperation of the chairman of the committee, and I am not \nbeing presumptuous to try to suggest what the schedule should be. But I \nam grateful that the conversation is taking place, that the recognition \nthat hands must be joined across the aisle to deal with this question \nthat has been raised, and I look forward to participating in the debate \nin any way that I can be helpful.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to not say any more, but I ask unanimous \nconsent for 3 additional minutes, and then I will be done because there \nare three other Members whom I forgot to mention whom I promised a \nminute to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 1 minute to Senator Corker and then 1 minute to \nSenator Martinez and then 1 minute to the Senator from Oklahoma, or \nwhoever wants to use the last minute.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to \nthis issue. Certainly, Senator Bennett and Senator Wyden, Senator \nCoburn, Senator Burr, and Senator Martinez and a number of people have \njoined in this debate, and we have spent a great deal of time talking \nabout the important health care bill, the one we are voting on right \nnow tonight. But the fact is, we all know we need to reform health care \nso that we have equal tax treatment, so that people have the \nopportunity to actually buy private health insurance and choose the \nphysicians of their choosing.\n  We can continue to have these short-term fixes--we now have a fix \nthat takes us through 2012 on this program--or we can have reform that \nreally works. I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member having \nhearings for us to be able to talk about this in a real way. I hope \nwhat has happened with Senators Wyden, Bennett, and Burr, and Senators \nCoburn and Martinez and others, including myself, is that hopefully we \nwill have an opportunity to have a real debate on health care reform so \nthat we can really move toward what this country ought to do, and that \nis to make sure Americans have the opportunity for affordable, quality \nhealth care, and we can move beyond these short-term solutions we are \nfaced with today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to rise also to speak on this \nissue. It is very important that we talk about children's health care, \nas we have been doing over the last several days, but it is equally \nimportant that we talk about all Americans. In the State of Florida, 17 \npercent to 20 percent of the people are uninsured on any given day. \nThat is unacceptable. We as a country have to deal with this issue. I \nwant to deal with it in a way that allows for there to be tax equity, \nfor one thing, for those who purchase health insurance through their \nemployer and have tax equity for those who choose to buy a single \nindividual policy of their own. We need to find a way through the tax \ncredit program we have introduced with this bill so that we then make \nit possible for people to buy health insurance.\n  So the goal is not to create a single-payer system, to create a \ngovernment-run system--which we know is not ideal and which we know has \nnot been the way to provide the greatest and best care--but to provide \na way for people to become insured and for those\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\nwho cannot afford it to have an opportunity through the Tax Code to get \nthe help they need so they can purchase it.\n  I believe there are a lot of good ideas we need to discuss, a lot of \ndebate that needs to take place. At the end of the day, I don't think \nwe should fear a discussion, and we should not fear the possibility \nthat we all are coming to a consensus on the idea that all Americans \nhave to have a place where they can go for their health care. A lot of \nhealth care dollars can be saved if people have that kind of \nmaintenance and care all along so that they are not only going to a \nhealth care facility in a crisis, in a medical crisis. We would save a \nlot of dollars in the end, and the quality of life of the American \npeople would increase as well.\n  I thank the ranking member for his courtesy and yield the remainder \nof my time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I just want to make two points on the \nEvery American Insured Act, and that is that every American ought to \nhave access to health care, and if we do that, the average American's \nhealth care policy right now would go down $1,000 a year. There is over \n$250 billion in cost shifting that is in the system today that will go \naway. We ought to be thinking about that. We ought to be looking at it.\n  What we do know from around the world is that a true competitive \nmarket will yield the best quality and the best results and the best \noutcomes for every American.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the underlying intent of any of these \nproposals is to put downward pressure on insurance costs, thereby \nreducing the cost of health care.\n  If Congress goes in the direction of a tax credit, the tax credit \nmust be structured so that low-income individuals have a meaningful tax \nsubsidy to purchase health insurance.\n  If Congress goes in the direction of a standard tax deduction, any \ndeduction must be structured to ensure that taxpayers who continue to \nreceive health care coverage through their employer do not see a \nsignificant increase in their taxes.\n  Congress should also contemplate a combination of a tax credit and a \ndeduction.\n  A combination effectively marries these tax concepts and may serve as \na viable compromise.\n  I believe that the Senate Finance Committee should hold hearings on \nthe various ways we can reform the health care system. We may even be \nable to mark up a proposal that could be acted upon by this body before \nthe end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is only about 17 minutes before voting \nstarts. I have an amendment I would like to speak to for 4 or 5 \nminutes. If there is not somebody else who needs that time right now, \nlet me do that.\n  This relates to an amendment that will be, I believe, the last one we \nvote on in this next tranche that simply reinserts into the code the \nvery minimum wage tax provisions the Senate voted on and approved. It \nwas--if not unanimous, it was a very strong vote in favor of those \nprovisions.\n  Recall that when the minimum wage bill was dealt with in the House, \nthey originally had a bill, but they ended up putting it in the Iraq \nsupplemental appropriation because that was a must-pass bill. So the \nminimum wage provisions were attached to that bill, and they passed but \nwithout all of the Senate-passed tax provisions.\n  The bill we are literally debating tonight came from the House of \nRepresentatives and is that tax bill. Now, we have amended it to \ninclude the SCHIP provisions, but what we need to do is to use that \nHouse shell bill for its original purpose, also, and that is to add \nback the exact provisions we passed in this body to help small \nbusinesses offset the costs of the minimum wage requirements we imposed \nupon them. They have to do with depreciation for leaseholds, \nrestaurants, and for some retail construction. I will explain what each \nof them is.\n  Under the leasehold restaurant renovation provision, under current \nlaw, leasehold and restaurant improvements and renovations are \ndepreciated over a 15-year period, but that only applies through the \nend of this year. What we did here in the Senate was to extend that \ntreatment through the end of 2008--very reasonable.\n  New restaurant construction. Current law requires that components of \na new restaurant be depreciated over as long as 39 years, if you can \nbelieve it. It doesn't make sense to depreciate restaurant renovations \nover 15 years but new construction over 39. So what the Senate did was \nto fix this inconsistency and provide for the same appreciation, a 15-\nyear period, and to extend that again through the end of the year 2008. \nThis applies to things such as convenience stores. A direct competitor \nof a quick-service restaurant can use the 15-year depreciation schedule \nfor all construction, and it is permanent in our Tax Code. If you have \na different kind of restaurant, you don't have that same tax treatment. \nThe Senate recognized that inconsistency and put that into the law and \nextended it until 2008.\n  Finally, an owner-occupied retail. Improvements made to that were \ndepreciated for as long as 39 years. The Senate recognized that owner-\noccupied retail space is not renovated and maintained as often as \nleased space. So our minimum wage bill provided a 15-year recovery \nperiod for improvements made to owner-occupied retail spaces. We \nextended that same treatment through the end of the year 2008.\n  My point is those three provisions, which we passed in this body--I \nthink they are all supported by members of the Finance Committee--are \nnot law only because they got dropped in the very bill we are debating \ntoday that came over from the House. It is, therefore, the perfect \nopportunity for us to put them back in.\n  I am sure my friend, the chairman of the committee, will say this is \nthe wrong bill to do it; this is the SCHIP bill. Well, I say we should \nnot have put the SCHIP bill on the tax bill. We should use that tax \nbill for its original purpose--to have the House have to pass the same \ntax provisions we passed. We have to deal with these expiring \nprovisions sometime this year. Right now, they expire at the end of \nthis year. We have to do it. We might as well do it in the very bill it \nwas intended to be done on right now.\n  There may be a commitment to do all of these so-called extender \nprovisions sometime before the end of the year. When we come back in \nSeptember, things are going to get pretty dicey with the issues \nrelating to foreign policy and, ultimately, probably tax bills such as \nAMT relief. We have the FAA reauthorization and all these other things, \nwith time running out.\n  There is no reason we cannot do it now. I suggest that we do it. All \nthis amendment does is extend the current law provisions for \nrestaurants and leaseholds through the end of 2008--the same thing we \nwould be doing with the usual extender package--and adding the new \nrestaurants construction and owner-occupied retail space to the 15-year \ndepreciation category, as we already did when we passed the minimum \nwage bill in the Senate.\n  Remember, we have now imposed the minimum wage burden on small \nbusinesses, and they are going to expect some relief so they don't have \nto bear all of the expense of it. They expected that relief. They are \nnot going to get it if we are not able to extend it before the end of \nthis year. This is the place to do it. I hope my colleagues, when they \nget to this last amendment, No. 2562, relating to depreciation for \nretail and restaurants and construction, will recall that they have \nalready supported this once before. We have this commitment to our \nsmall business constituency, and I think this is the perfect vehicle \nfor us to ensure that that relief actually gets to them and that they, \ntherefore, can take advantage of it beyond the end of this current \nyear.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, under the previous order, at 7:45, I had 5 \nminutes reserved. I wish to start on that amendment now, and that would \ngive me a total of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand we have worked on another \namendment, a Senator Wyden amendment, on juvenile diabetes. I \nunderstand it has been worked out all the way around. I urge the \nSenator to offer it now so we can get that out of the way, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma can then speak.\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I withdraw my request.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 2570, As Modified, to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman from the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up my amendment No. 2570, and I send \nit to the desk with a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2570, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 217, after line 25 insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS RELATING TO DIABETES \n                   PREVENTION.\n\n       There is authorization to be appropriated $15 million \n     during the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to fund \n     demonstration projects in up to 10 states for over 3 years \n     for voluntary incentive programs to promote children's \n     receipt of relevant screenings and improvements in healthy \n     eating and physical activity with the aim of reducing the \n     incidence of type 2 diabetes. Such programs may involve \n     reductions in cost-sharing or premiums when children receive \n     regular screening and reach certain benchmarks in healthy \n     eating and physical activity. Under such programs, a State \n     may also provide financial bonuses for partnerships with \n     entities, such as schools, which increase their education and \n     efforts with respect to reducing the incidence of type 2 \n     diabetes and may also devise incentives for providers serving \n     children covered under this title and title XIX to perform \n     relevant screening and counseling regarding healthy eating \n     and physical activity. Upon completion of these \n     demonstrations the Secretary shall provide a report to \n     Congress on the results of the State demonstration projects \n     and the degree to which they helped improve health outcomes \n     related to type 2 diabetes in children in those States.\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S10746, August 2, 2007 the following appears: SEC. _. \nDEMONSTRATION PROJECTS RELATED TO DIABETES PREVENTION.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. The amendment has \nbeen accepted by the leadership on the Senate Finance Committee. We \nhave been talking a lot about health care. We have a lot of health care \nin our country, but, unfortunately, not enough prevention or wellness.\n  This amendment is designed to deal with epidemic juvenile diabetes. \nWe can effect it by encouraging people to change behavior through \npersonal responsibility with a bipartisan agreement to promote that.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as the Senator indicated, it has been \nagreed to by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2570), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2618 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before the Senate proceeds, I ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 2618 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2627\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2627, and I ask unanimous consent that Senator Vitter be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a fairly straightforward \namendment. I am not sure what the chairman thinks about it. One of the \nthings we know--even from the chairman's words earlier--he rejected the \nCBO evaluation of the new enrollees in this system. What we do know is \nthat a large number of children who now have insurance with their \nparents are going to be moved out of that insurance to somewhere else.\n  In the old SCHIP program, we had a concept of premium assistance. In \nthe two States that have gotten through the very tough parameters of \nthat assistance and have met it to meet the requirements of SCHIP, we \nfound fewer kids go away from their parents' insurance and stay unified \nin the same clinic, with the same doctors, with continuity of care. And \n77 percent of the children between 200 and 300 percent, which is what \nwe are addressing with the new bill, are already covered. For the fully \neligible kids up to 200 percent, CBO tells us for every one we add, we \nwill take one off.\n  This amendment says let's not take them off. Let's use the money for \npremium assistance to help those parents keep the insurance with them. \nIn Oregon--and the Senator from Oregon might know this--those families \nwho chose the premium assistance option were more likely to receive \ncare in a doctor's office or HMO, rather than a public health clinic or \na hospital clinic. Families using the premium assistance option also \nreported fewer unmet primary and specialty care needs than those in \ntraditional SCHIP. The premium assistance option works. We need to \nremove the difficulties and barriers so that more individuals eligible \nfor SCHIP have the freedom to access it.\n  Ensuring that newly eligible populations under the Baucus-Grassley \nproposal are covered with a premium assistance model will ensure the \npreservation of market-based health care, rather than decline that \nsystem.\n  Many lower income families already participate in the private health \ninsurance market. Seventy-seven percent, as I said, of those in the 200 \nto 300 percent of the Federal poverty level are already covered in a \nprivate insurance market. So if the purpose of SCHIP is to get kids \ncovered and we are worried that some in this group--those at 200 to 300 \npercent--why not use premium assistance to help them stay in a \ncontiguous family policy and help the parents maintain them within that \npolicy?\n  We accomplish the same goal and we do a couple other things. No. 1, \nwe let parents make a decision on who their doctor is going to be for \ntheir child, rather than a Government bureaucrat. In many SCHIP \nprograms, there is a limited number of providers, and the child may not \nbe seen now. What this does is use the funds to allow them to stay with \ntheir parents, still reaching the goal of covering more kids; but, \nalso, CBO has scored this amendment as saving money because we will \ncover more children at a lower cost.\n  It is a fairly commonsense amendment. There are problems with the \nrequirements on the premium assistance model in the old SCHIP program. \nAs a matter of fact, four other States had gone to it and then left \nbecause of the complications of getting the waivers and meeting the \nrequirements of the SCHIP, which forced children away from the primary \ncare doctor they and their parents wanted to have.\n  There is one other thing that I think is important. Whether we like \nto admit it or not, 60 percent of the primary care doctors in this \ncountry don't take SCHIP or Medicaid. So we have limited it down to 40 \npercent. If we want to have equal access for these children under the \nSCHIP program, we need to take the Medicaid SCHIP stamp off their \nforehead. We need to give to them the market so they can go where they \nwant to go. By doing premium assistance, you allow that freedom of \nchoice by the parents of the children. When we don't allow premium \nassistance, we take choice away--here is what I had and now I don't \nhave the choice. I submit to the body that this will discourage a large \nnumber of children from going into the SCHIP program. So if our goal is \nto increase it from 200 to 300 percent, and over 77 percent of those \nare already insured, why would we not want to keep those already \ninsured and do a premium assistance model and help the other 23 percent \nwith the SCHIP program?\n  It is a straightforward amendment. The Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology economist Amy Finkelstein recently released research about \nthe unintended effect of what happens when the Government controls \nhealth care. The summary of that is we pay more, but we don't get \nbetter results.\n  I showed a chart here the other day, actually, of the fully absorbed \ncost of us buying insurance through the SCHIP program versus what you \ncan buy in the private market. The difference is astounding. It is \nabout $1,800 more to buy a $1,352 policy versus the other.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes, as I \ndid when I requested it from the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What did the Senator request?\n  Mr. COBURN. I requested to start 5 minutes early so I could still \nhave the 7:45 to 7:50 time slot. I will finish up faster than that. I \nneed 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, America spends 16 percent of its gross \ndomestic product on health care, and that doesn't take into account any \nresearch and development. It is important to know that, through the \nprivate sector, M.D. Anderson, in Texas, spends more on research than \nthe entire country of Canada. We don't want to disrupt that.\n  So keeping these children in a private program with their parents, \nwith the continuity of care, I can tell you that as a practicing \nphysician, when you have one child go one place and one child going \nsomewhere else, and a parent going somewhere else, the ability to \naccess health care declines. So I hope the chairman will consider \naccepting this and look on it favorably. We will actually make the \nBaucus-Grassley bill much more effective, much like we are seeing in \nOregon, which has been effective with children staying on the same \nhealth care with their parents.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are close to 7:45. I suggest that the \nvoting begin now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand there is 2 minutes allowed \nequally divided prior to the vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator wish to speak for 1 more minute?\n  Mr. COBURN. I just spoke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is not wise. I do not think we should \nadopt this amendment. What does the amendment do? Basically it would \nrequire at least 34 States would have to resign their successful \nChildren's Health Insurance Programs in ways that force children into \npotentially inferior coverage; that is, their health insurance coverage \nwould be worse than under SCHIP. Why? Because sometimes private health \ninsurance requires deductibles or limits hospital stays, may prevent \ninsulin from being available for diabetes. It forces premium \nassistance. It forces people into coverage they may not want. I don't \nthink we want to do that.\n  Second, it would force children to take the premium assistance to \npurchase HSAs. That is not a good idea. HSAs work better for wealthier \nAmericans, healthier Americans. We are talking about low-income kids, \nand they have to spend a lot of money on high-deductible HSAs. I don't \nthink it is a good thing to do.\n  We are here to help kids. We are not here to force kids into private \ncoverage plans and use their premium assistance to buy HSAs.\n  I urge the amendment not be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I note a couple points. This does not \nforce any kid, 200 percent or under, to go into the premium assistance \nprogram. A family making $62,000 a year--that is not a low-income kid. \nAs a matter of fact, 21 States in this country have less income than \nthat. It is working well where it is being utilized, and it does not \nforce anyone into inferior care.\n  I understand the chairman's objection. I take that, but the record \nshould show that of those who are on premium assistance today, they \nhave adequate or greater care than the SCHIP program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, since the Senator took an extra minute, I \nask to respond and then get to the vote.\n  Essentially, this amendment forces kids to use premium assistance in \ntwo negative ways. One, it forces them into private coverage. They may \nnot want it because the private coverage might be worse. Second, this \namendment has the effect of forcing premium assistance to buy HSAs.\n  I don't want to encourage it at this point because HSAs are better \nfor the healthier and wealthier and not low-income kids. I urge the \namendment not be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2596, as modified, \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is also a crowding-out issue, which I \nthink is a very important and central issue in this debate. I am for a \nsafety net. I am for insuring children who aren't insured, who can't \nget health insurance otherwise. What I am not for is pushing kids who \nare on perfectly solid ground off that solid ground and into the safety \nnet. That is what, in part, this very large SCHIP expansion would do, \nperhaps 50 percent of the new SCHIP enrollees being folks--kids--who \nhave private insurance. Now, that is wrong and it is also very \nexpensive to the taxpayer.\n  What this amendment does is simple: It says we are for a safety net, \nbut we are not for pushing people who are on solid ground into the \nsafety net. And if they have difficulty staying on that solid ground in \nterms of affording their premiums, we are going to allow States to have \npremium subsidization, premium support to be able to keep those folks \non good private insurance. That is what we should do, rather than push \npeople off solid ground into the safety net at great taxpayer expense.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't think we want to do this. This \nrequires--it mandates--that States deny kids coverage under the program \nif their employer offers health insurance. It requires it. I don't know \nwhere we have those kinds of requirements today in the health care \narea. Senior citizens are not required to sign up for Medicare Part B. \nThere is no requirement. Why should we require States to prevent \nchildren's health insurance coverage if by chance the child's family is \noffered private health insurance? The private health insurance may be \ninferior to what the child would otherwise get in the program. The \nbenefits might be much less. Who knows what doctors are available. Who \nknows?\n  I don't think we want to require States to prevent families and low-\nincome kids from getting CHIP coverage simply because an employer \noffers health insurance. That is not a fair choice. I think we should, \ntherefore, reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2535, as modified, \noffered by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this amendment codifies the ``unborn \nchild'' rule. The purpose of this amendment is to provide health care \nservices to benefit either the mother or unborn child, consistent with \nthe health of both.\n  It has been reported that some States denied health care to the \nmother for disorders not directly affecting the unborn child. This is \njust a commonsense amendment. Obstetricians recognize that you are \ndealing with two separate individuals, that you have to deal with the \nunborn child as well as the mother. Obviously, you need to have a \nhealthy mother in order to have a healthy unborn child.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. \nThis amendment is an effort to inject a very highly contentious \nabortion rights issue into this children's health insurance \nlegislation. I think it is a mistake for us to do that.\n  The underlying bill which came out of the Finance Committee protects \nthe right of any State in the country to provide health care to \npregnant women. It protects the rights specifically of the 11 States \nthat are currently providing coverage under this unborn fetus \nregulation to continue to do that. So there is no need for this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this is not unprecedented action. We have \npassed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, and so this is basically \nwhat we are trying to do, to make sure the mothers have the health care \nthey need.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2620 offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have been talking about having one \nState or another State have a different cost of living, and therefore \nhaving to have a waiver for the whole State. My amendment says the \nSecretary will look at the cost of living in an area of the State, a \ncounty, or a statistical metropolitan area, so you don't have to have a \nwaiver for a whole State, if it is only one city or one area in that \nState that needs the extra help. That is my amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just assume that you are a person who is \nmaybe in one city and move to another town or have relatives in one \ncity or town in the same State. You don't know what the match is going \nto be. You don't know whether you qualify or don't qualify. I don't \nunderstand this amendment at all. I am really quite astounded that we \nwould want to even countenance doing something like this. Essentially \nit says: OK, MSA, State, you don't get the 300 percent match rate in \nMedicaid. You get 200 percent. You get Medicaid which is adjusted by \ncost of living, and MSA with a county or a State. I don't get it. I \nthink we have to get some simplicity, some continuity, allow some \npeople to have some idea of what the law is. I urge Senators to not \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it just makes common sense that you \nwould want to help the areas that have a clear cost-of-living \nadjustment need, but you don't have to do it for a whole State if it \nisn't needed in the whole State. It would save taxpayer dollars. It is \nequitable. It is fair, and it is responsible. I hope we can adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with the two \nmanagers of the bill, and we have two or three amendments left, and one \nof those could go away, which means we will have a couple of votes, \nmaybe three votes before final passage.\n  The managers, I think we would all acknowledge, have done a very \noutstanding job on a difficult piece of legislation.\n  I would also say, Mr. President, we are going to have to be in \nsession tomorrow. At 9:30 in the morning--I told Senator Byrd it would \nbe a 9:45 vote--there will be a 9:30 vote in the morning. We will vote \non a judge at 9:30. Then we will proceed on some other matters. We are \ngoing to try to complete the WRDA conference. We are going to have a \nreal yeoman's try at completing the competitive matter. I understand \nthere is a hold on that now. We would hope we could complete that by \nunanimous consent; if not, a short timeframe within which to debate \nthat and vote. It is something that is bipartisan and Members have \nworked on for well more than a year.\n  We also have, of course, good news tonight. The mental health parity \nis being hot-lined tonight. I hope we can complete that tonight. That \nis legislation Senator Domenici and others have been pushing for a long \ntime. I am not going to mention all the people who have been pushing \nit, but Senator Domenici has been talking about it a lot in recent \ndays, and I appreciate his advocacy for that.\n  The big issue tomorrow is to see what we can do to complete the \nproblems that everyone has read about dealing with the surveillance \nprogram that is going on to listen to these bad people who are trying \nto create problems in our country and around the world. We do not have \nthat worked out yet. I have had a conversation with the distinguished \nRepublican leader. Hopefully, we can have that set up so there is some \nway of disposing of that issue tomorrow.\n  Now, that is what we have left before we leave here. It is not an \neasy agenda, but it is one we can complete with a little cooperation \nfrom both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2600 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Sanders \namendment No. 2600 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2562\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on amendment No. 2562, offered by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment simply has us do something we \nhave already done. We passed, I believe, unanimously some provisions to \nhelp small businesses pay for the minimum wage increase. We all did \nthat. The bill went over to the House of Representatives. You will \nrecall they attached the minimum wage bill to the Iraq supplemental, \nand they dropped out these tax provisions.\n  This amendment simply reinstates the same tax provisions for small \nbusinesses in three areas: leasehold and restaurant depreciation, \nextending them from the end of this year through 2008; new restaurant \nconstruction, a 15-year depreciation period; owner-occupied retail, a \n15-year depreciation period--all just through the end of the year 2008.\n  As to the first one, it has to be done this year because it expires \nat the end of this year. As I said, we adopted this. We checked the \nrecord. I think it was by unanimous consent. In any event, I believe it \nwas unanimous. We already passed it.\n  Here is the irony. The underlying bill that the SCHIP bill has been \nattached to is that minimum wage bill. So to the argument that this is \nnot the right bill, I would say, actually, this is not the right bill \nfor SCHIP, but it is the right bill for this amendment. So I hope we \ncan repeat what we have already done and adopt this small business \nrelief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this world is filled with irony. It is \nironic, frankly, that we are here in this situation. But, essentially, \nfirst, I support what the Senator is trying to do. We reported this \nsame provision out of the Finance Committee, as the Senator stated, at \nan earlier time as part of that small business-minimum wage package. It \nwas then paid for.\n  I say to my friends and my colleagues that we will find a time to do \nthis provision. It is part of the extenders package. Extenders are \ntaken up at the end of the year. That is when we put them all together \nand find out what we want to do, not here on this legislation. It is \nnot paid for. This costs $5 billion. I do not think it belongs on this \nbill. I, frankly, have to now raise a point of order.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable provisions \nunder the Congressional Budget Act with respect to the amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside, and I further ask to call up amendment No. 2552 \nand dispense with its reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, may I read this before he objects? I wonder \nif my colleagues would indulge me.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is the outgrowth of a bill I introduced \nwith Senator Kohl this year. As many of my colleagues know, Congress \nmodified the Supplemental Security Income Program to include a 7-year \ntime limit on receipt of benefits for disabled refugees and asylees. \nThis policy was intended to balance a desire to have people who \nimmigrate to the United States to become citizens, with an \nunderstanding that the naturalization process also takes time to \ncomplete.\n  Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than 7 \nyears. Applicants are required to live in the United States for a \nminimum of 5 years prior to applying for citizenship. In addition to \nthat time period, their application process often can take 3 or more \nyears before resolution. Because of this time delay, many individuals \nare trapped in the system and faced with the loss of their SSI \nbenefits. In fact, we know that to date, more than 7,000 elderly and \ndisabled refugees have lost their SSI benefits and another 16,000 are \nthreatened to lose their benefits as well in the coming years.\n  Many of these individuals are elderly refugees who fled persecution \nor torture in their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious \npersecution from the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing from \nSaddam Hussein's regime, Cubans, and Hmong people from the highlands of \nLaos who served on the side of the U.S. military during the Vietnam \nwar. They are elderly and unable to work and have become reliant on \ntheir SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of \ndelays encountered through the bureaucratic process is unjust and \ninappropriate.\n  The Bush administration in its fiscal year 2008 budget acknowledged \nthe necessity to correct this problem, this injustice, by dedicating \nfunding to extend refugee eligibility for SSI beyond the 7-year limit.\n  This legislation builds upon those efforts by allowing an additional \n2 years of benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, asylees, and \nother qualified humanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits \nhave expired in the recent past.\n  Additionally, benefits could be extended for a third year for those \nsame refugees who are awaiting a decision on a pending naturalization \napplication.\n  These policies are limited to 2010 and are completely offset in cost \nby a provision that will work to recapture Federal Government funds due \nto unemployment insurance fraud.\n  The offset that is provided was also taken from the President's own \nbudget.\n  By reducing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, the provision \nwould effectively reduce taxes on employers by $326 million over the \nnext 10 years, according to the CBO estimate.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. I hope for your support and ask \nthat this amendment be accepted by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerry \nbe recognized now to offer a sense of the Senate, which will be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2529 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this will be very brief. Senator Snowe and \nI have joined together, as the chair and ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, to put together a task force effort between the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Labor, Secretary \nof the Treasury, and the Small Business Administrator to coordinate and \nassist in trying to effectively reach out to small businesses to help \nthem be aware of how they can take advantage of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  This has been cleared on both sides. It doesn't cost any additional \nfunds whatsoever. It simply is an effort to try to coordinate and \nimplement this as effectively as possible. I ask for its adoption.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself and \n     Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 2529.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a multiagency nationwide campaign to educate \n  small business concerns about health insurance options available to \n                               children)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To improve the provisions relating to dental health)\n\n       Strike section 608 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 608. DENTAL HEALTH GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title XXI (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.), as \n     amended by section 201, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2114.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley who helped on this amendment. It has been cleared. It deals \nwith the dental, or oral, health care in the underlying bill. The bill \nprovides for $200 million to help States expand dental care within the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  This amendment adds additional provisions that would require the \nStates to describe these benefits as they do other benefits and how \nthey would improve the benefits to our children. It expands Web \ninformation so individuals will have a better understanding as to what \nproviders are available for dental care in their community. It has \ncertain studies as to the status of dental health care and oral health \ncare for our children.\n  Again, I thank the leadership of the committee for their help. I also \noffer this amendment on behalf of Senators Mikulski, Bingaman, and \nCollins. I thank them for their help in putting this amendment \ntogether.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Maryland.\n  The amendment (No. 2567) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be withdrawn, with the exception of the DeMint amendment No. \n2577; that no further amendments be in order, except a managers' \namendment which has been cleared by the\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\nmanagers and the leaders; that upon disposition of the DeMint amendment \nand the managers' package, Senator Dole be recognized for 5 minutes to \nmake a budget point of order against the substitute amendment; that \nonce the point of order has been raised, Senator Baucus be recognized \nto move to waive the applicable point of order; that upon disposition \nof waiver, if waived, then the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time, and without \nfurther intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is pretty clear we have one more vote \nthat I am aware of before final passage. There will be a little bit of \nintervening business that should not take much time. So we are about \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2577\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, as I have talked about this amendment \ntoday, I have been surprised that several colleagues were not aware \nthat Americans are not allowed to buy health insurance, except in the \nState where they live. Americans can buy anything from all over our \ncountry. Yet they are limited to where they can buy health insurance.\n  One way we can lower the cost of health insurance and create more \nchoices for all Americans is to allow each and every American the \nopportunity to buy a health insurance policy in any State where those \npolicies are certified. Some will say this is a race to the bottom. But \nI ask those critics, which State does not have the regulations that you \napprove of? Every State legislature has a set of regulations they have \napproved. So these products would be safe, but they create more choice.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment that would allow \nAmericans to buy health insurance all over the country, to help create \na national market and make health insurance more affordable for every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment effectively eliminates \nState insurance protections. The States with the least regulation would \nbecome the home of private health insurers who sit back and watch a \nrace to the bottom. States would be inclined to--and encouraged to--\npass regulations that are very weak, and that would mean the insurer \ncould qualify in that State and then market anyplace else in the \ncountry. It is totally opposed to the current system, where each State \nhas its own insurance regulations. One can argue whether that is a good \nsystem, but that is what it is.\n  We should not, at this point, adopt this amendment, which has the \neffect of appealing the current structure and allowing a race to the \nbottom in health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. We don't change any of the State regulations. We only \nallow the people not to be regulated anymore. They get to buy insurance \nwherever they want to buy it. But regulations in the States don't \nchange.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator made my point. It is a race to \nthe bottom. I urge rejection of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2645) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, this bill seeks revenues for the very \nlaudable State Children's Health Insurance Program by unfairly taxing \ntobacco products. I urge my colleagues to acknowledge the reality that \nthis tax increase is an irresponsible and fiscally unsound policy.\n  Tobacco sales have been declining 2 to 3 percent per year and are \nexpected to be slashed by another 6 percent if the Federal excise tax \nis increased. But in order for this tax increase trick to work, more \nthan 22 million additional Americans will need to take up smoking to \nkeep the SCHIP program running over the next decade.\n  In addition, according to the Tax Foundation, no other Federal tax \nhurts the poor more than the cigarette tax. Of the 20 percent of the \nadult population who smoke, around half are in families earning less \nthan 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. In other words, many of \nthe families SCHIP is meant to help will be disproportionately hit by \nthe Senate's proposed tax hike.\n  I oppose this tax hike plan not only because it is fiscally unsound \nbut also because it unfairly hurts the economy of my home State of \nNorth Carolina. A massive and highly regressive tax increase on an \nalready unstable product is an irresponsible way to fund such an \nimportant program.\n  Mr. President, section 203 of the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution \nmakes it out of order for the Senate to consider legislation that \nincreases the deficit by more than $5 billion in any of the four 10-\nyear periods starting in fiscal year 2018 through 2057. The pending \nsubstitute amendment would increase the long-term net deficit in excess \nof $5 billion. I, therefore, raise a point of order under section 203 \nof S. Con. Res. 21 against the pending substitute amendment. This \nlegislation clearly violates the Budget Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the words of the \nSenator from North Carolina. I know she means well, and is fighting \nvery hard for her State. But pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purpose of the consideration of this \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 67, nays 32, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 306 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--67\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Johnson\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nFinance Committee chairman in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would be happy to have a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I want to express my appreciation for the chairman's \nefforts, and those of Ranking Member Grassley, in working to ensure the \nhealth and well-being of our Nation's children.\n  As the chairman knows, more than 1,700 schools offer on-site, \ncomprehensive well care, illness-related care, and dental care to \nnearly 2 million students from rural, suburban, urban, and Native \nAmerican communities where access to such care is limited or \nnonexistent. A recent article in the March issue of Health Affairs \ndiscusses the role of school-based health centers as\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\nan effective means of helping children get the care they need.\n  I was prepared to offer an amendment to the pending Children's Health \nInsurance Program bill that would ensure that school-based health \ncenters are recognized as a provider under both Medicaid and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. While the vast majority of these \ncenters receive Medicaid reimbursement, only one in four receives \nreimbursement under the Children's Health Insurance Program for the \nproviding the exact same quality services that a child might receive at \nanother provider.\n  After discussing this with the chairman, we noted that my amendment \nis included in section 121 of the House version of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program reauthorization bill. Therefore, to finish the \nSenate reauthorization as quickly as possible, I am prepared to not \noffer my amendment. But before I do that, I wanted to ask the chairman \nif he would support the House provision recognizing school-based health \ncenters in conference?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I first thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nleadership on the Healthy Schools Act and school-based health centers. \nI, too, recognize the importance of school-based health centers. \nClearly, efforts must be made to ensure that not only children have \ncoverage but also access to health care providers. I support this \namendment and will work with my colleague to address this issue in \nconference.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the chairman for his support and assurance. I \nwill not offer my amendment.\n\n\n                                diabetes\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to begin by complimenting the \nchairman, the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the ranking member, \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, for all their work on this \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. You have taken a very difficult \nand contentious issue and produced legislation that will help many \nfamilies. You should be congratulated.\n  I would like to raise the issue of diabetes as part of the \nreauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I \nhave offered an amendment along with my colleague Senator Dorgan, which \nwould reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program for Indians and the \nSpecial Funding Program for type 1 diabetes research. This amendment is \nidentical to the language in S. 1494, which I also introduced with \nSenator Dorgan.\n  Diabetes is one of the most serious and devastating health problems \nof our time. Although diabetes occurs in people of all ethnicities, the \ndiabetes epidemic is particularly acute in our Native American \npopulations. That is why during the negotiations on the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act, the same bill that created this SCHIP program, I helped \ncraft an agreement to finance diabetes programs of the Indian Health \nService and help raise the profile of tribal health programs. The \nSpecial Diabetes Program for Indians began with funding of $30 million \nannually for 5 years and was later expanded to $150 million a year. \nThis funding has been used widely in Indian country, including among \nthe Navajo Nation and the 19 Pueblos in New Mexico.\n  These programs are set to expire in 2008, and I believe they need to \nbe a priority in this Congress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to thank the Senators from New Mexico and North \nDakota for their leadership on this important issue. I have worked hard \nin previous Congresses to support this program and helped shepherd its \nlast reauthorization as part of the 107th Congress. It is important \nthat we work together to make sure our Native American and rural \ncommunities have the resources they need to provide treatment and \nprevention programs. It is important to support research to work to \nfind a cure for this disease. Although we were not able to include this \nprovision in the bill that is before us on the floor, I am aware that \nthese critical programs expire in 2008; and that the reauthorization of \nthese programs is a priority for the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would also like to thank my colleagues for their \nleadership on this issue. I share your concern with the diabetes \nepidemic in the United States and especially the effect it is having on \nour Native American communities. I support the reauthorization of the \nSpecial Diabetes Program for Indians and also the reauthorization of \nthe Special Funding Program for type I diabetes research. The \nprevention and treatment of diabetes has improved greatly over the past \ndecade. These programs have clearly played a major role in these \nimprovements. I also look forward to working with my colleagues to \nreauthorize these programs during this Congress.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would also like to speak in support of the \nreauthorization of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians and the \nSpecial Funding Program for type I diabetes research. My record as an \nadvocate for diabetes research and treatment programs is well \ndocumented. I have helped to lead the efforts in past years to \nreauthorize these programs and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to make the reauthorization of these programs a priority for \nthe Finance Committee this Congress.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to thank the Senators for their time. With that \nI will withdraw my amendment and I ask the chair that my amendment No. \n2629 be withdrawn.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2535\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I voted against the Allard Amendment for \nthe following reasons.\n  This amendment sought to codify in law the treatment of unborn \nchildren, therefore establishing the fetus as protected separately from \nthe mother. Under the current bill, SCHIP States may treat pregnant \nmothers. In 2002, the Bush administration issued a regulation that gave \nStates the option of extending SCHIP coverage to unborn children \nwithout a waiver.\n  While I support the waiver policy in the pending legislation, this \namendment is an effort to advance a political cause rather than provide \na medical necessity because pregnant women are now covered. Under \ncurrent law, there is ample ground for coverage during pregnancy. In \nfact, the Senate bill allows States to provide coverage for pregnant \nwomen without denominating them as unborn children to advance a \npolitical cause.\n  While the amendment failed by a vote of 49 to 50, there is no \npractical effect in terms of health care coverage for pregnant women.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2557\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while I opposed the Specter amendment, I do \nbelieve that the alternative minimum tax needs to be reformed. In the \ncoming months, I hope to support efforts to do away with the inequities \nof the alternative minimum tax that unfairly burden West Virginians.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2621\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate adopted a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that small business owners should \nhave some help when it comes to providing health insurance for their \nemployees. I am an original cosponsor of the resolution adopted by \namendment and strongly support its goals.\n  The current health insurance system is simply not working for small \nemployers and the self-employed. Employees of small businesses are much \nmore likely to be uninsured than employees of large businesses. They \nare charged higher premiums for similar coverage. Their premiums can \nincrease dramatically from year to year when a fellow employee gets \nsick. And employees rarely have a choice when it comes to their health \nplan.\n  Over the past several months, I have sought out the opinions of \npeople with a variety of viewpoints, which has resulted in constructive \ndialogue on how Congress can respond to these challenges. We are making \nprogress. I think a workable compromise can be found.\n  There is general agreement on what we want to accomplish. We need to \ncreate opportunities for small businesses to group together in a large \npool. We need to ensure there are choices in private health plans that \nemployees can choose from. And some form of subsidies will be needed to \nmake health coverage more affordable.\n  We know what we need to put in place, and we are working on how to \nreach these goals. The resolution demonstrates the Senate's commitment \nto finding a consensus this year. We won't end up with a Democratic \nbill, and we won't end up with a Republican bill. It will have to be a \nbipartisan bill.\n  We need to work together, take the best ideas that are offered, and \ndevelop\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\na proposal that has bipartisan support. That is the only way this \nCongress can address the need to help small business manage rising \nhealth care costs, while making health care coverage available for \ntheir employees.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is debating \nthe reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nSCHIP. This is a vital safety net program that offers health care \ncoverage to one of our most vulnerable populations, low-income \nchildren. I support a timely, fiscally responsible reauthorization of \nthis program.\n  The SCHIP program has served a critical purpose for many years. In \n1997, Congress created SCHIP to come to the aid of the millions of \nchildren who were going without health insurance because their families \nwere stuck between earning too much money to qualify for Medicaid and \nnot having enough money to purchase private health care coverage. I was \npleased to join many of my colleagues in supporting its establishment. \nThanks to this program, low-income children have been able to count on \na safety net program that can provide them with health care coverage \nthat they might otherwise go without.\n  I strongly support the central purpose of SCHIP and believe that \nchildren of low-income families should have health insurance coverage. \nIn some ways, this program has been a great success, as we have been \nable to drop the rate of uninsured children by nearly 25 percent from \n1996 to 2005 and SCHIP covered about 6.6 million children last year. At \nthe same time, however, I am greatly concerned that the program has \nexpanded beyond what Congress first intended. In some cases, SCHIP \ncoverage has been extended to middle-income children and to certain \nadult populations. I don't believe that was the intention of Congress \nwhen we created this program. This has complicated SCHIP \nreauthorization, and I believe that if we allow SCHIP to grow beyond \nits original purpose, SCHIP spending will grow exponentially and \njeopardize its future success.\n  Several options have been proposed to reauthorize the SCHIP program. \nOne, the CHIP Reauthorization Act, which was reported by the Finance \nCommittee, would greatly expand SCHIP beyond its original framework, \nlead to an explosion in new spending, and reduce private health \ncoverage in our country. The other, the Kids First Act, which I \nsupport, would keep SCHIP's focus on providing low-income children with \nhealth insurance in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  I am concerned over the direction that the CHIP Reauthorization Act \nwould take SCHIP and the precedent it would set for future \nauthorization bills. The current SCHIP baseline is currently $25 \nbillion; however, under the Finance Committee's proposal, spending \nwould explode by an additional $35 billion and will end up costing $60 \nbillion over 5 years. Not only that, according to CBO, at the end of 5 \nyears, in order to comply with pay-go rules, this bill reduces the \nSCHIP allotment in the fifth year 2013 from $8.4 billion to $600 \nmillion. If there is anyone who seriously believes Congress will cut \nSCHIP funding by $8 billion in 1 year and cause millions who would then \nrely on SCHIP to lose coverage, I have got some beachfront property in \nYuma, AZ, that I am willing to sell.\n  The CBO report also points out that if the costs of the program \ncontinue to grow according to enrollment projections, the total cost of \nthe program over the fiscal year 2008-2017 period would be $112 \nbillion. Even the massive tobacco tax increase included in the bill, \nwhich would raise about $71 billion from fiscal year 2008-2017, can't \ncover that cost. I am not sure where the extra money will come from to \ncover the cost of the bill, and it is unfair that we leave this for a \nfuture Congress to figure out how to cover our overspending. In other \nwords, let's put a halt to business as usual.\n  The CHIP bill also represents a change in the mission of SCHIP by \nfurther eroding private health coverage of children. With expanded \neligibility for SCHIP, we are likely to see families who already have \nprivate coverage drop that coverage and opt for a Government-run, \nGovernment-subsidized program. CBO estimates that, among newly eligible \npopulations covered under this bill, each additionally enrolled \nindividual in SCHIP will be matched by one individual leaving private \ncoverage. We will be spending billions and billions of dollars \nproviding coverage for children who already have coverage, and I \nbelieve this is a dangerous step toward Government-run health care \ninsurance.\n  Instead, Congress should remember the central mission of SCHIP and \nfocus the program reauthorization on providing low-income children with \nhealth insurance coverage if they don't otherwise have it. Several of \nmy colleagues offered the Kids First Act as a substitute amendment to \nthe CHIP bill. It would reauthorize SCHIP, provide an increase in \nfunding, and avoid a costly regressive tax increase. This bill would \nensure that SCHIP mission remains covering low-income children and will \nfocus efforts on enrolling children who are already eligible for SCHIP \nand Medicaid but are not currently enrolled. It also recognizes that \nmillions of children receive private health coverage and would improve \ncurrent laws that allow States to offer premium assistance for coverage \nthrough private plans. Additionally, the Kids First Act also includes \nsmall business health plan reforms. Unfortunately, the Kids First Act \nfailed after it was offered as an amendment during debate earlier this \nweek.\n  At this time, I cannot support the CHIP Reauthorization Act. While I \napplaud the sponsors efforts to reauthorize SCHIP, I believe that bill \ndiffers drastically from the original intention of the SCHIP law and is \nfiscally irresponsible. I support the ideas contained in the \nalternative bill, the Kids First Act, which I believe would keep SCHIP \nfocused on providing health insurance coverage to low-income children \nand would do so without dramatic increases in Federal spending or \nhigher taxes on Americans.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program has reduced the number of uninsured \nchildren by one-third since its enactment in 1997. The administration's \nopposition to this legislation is a vital mistake that threatens the \nhealth and well being of our Nation's children. This program is not \npartisan and debate on this issue should not be ideological. We simply \nwant children to have access to health care. Making investments in the \nhealth care of children will help ensure that they grow up into healthy \nadults. In order to learn and lead active and healthy lives, children \nmust have access to health care.\n  As of June 2007, 17,512 children were enrolled in Hawaii's Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. An estimated 5 percent of children in Hawaii \ndo not have health insurance. This is approximately 16,000 children who \ndo not have health insurance. I am proud that my home State, Hawaii, \nhas continued to develop innovative solutions to help increase access \nto health care. This year, Hawaii enacted legislation establishing the \nKeiki Care Program. The Keiki Care Program is a public-private \npartnership intended to make sure that every child in Hawaii has access \nto health care.\n  Now is not the time to cut Federal resources provided to States to \nprovide health care for children. The legislation currently before the \nSenate will preserve the access of health care for the 6.6 million \nchildren currently enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nIt will also expand health care access to an estimated 3.2 million \nchildren.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act must be \nenacted. This administration's opposition to this program is \nshortsighted and threatens the well-being of our Nation's children.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to not \nonly the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or \nCHIP, but also to the expansion of this successful program.\n  CHIP was created a decade ago on a bipartisan basis with the support \nof a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. Members of both \nsides of the aisle came together to address the problem of uninsured \nchildren across this country. In 1997, over 22 percent uninsured low-\nincome children were uninsured. In 2005, that percentage had\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\ndecreased to less than 15 percent. It is clear that CHIP has \nsignificantly lowered the percentage of low-income children that are \nuninsured. Overall, CHIP has led to a one-third reduction in the \npercentage of low-income uninsured children in America.\n  CHIP covers a total of 6 million children today, and research shows \nus that these children are doing better than those without insurance. \nCHIP kids are more likely to have seen a physician, and to have had a \nwell-child visit than uninsured children. They are more likely to \nreceive hospital care and prescription medications for their health \nconditions. Most importantly, CHIP kids have better health and academic \noutcomes, such as improved care for asthma; declines in infant \nmortality, childhood deaths, and low-birth weight; and improved \nacademic performance. These facts make it clear that our bottom line \nshould not be dollar amounts, but the health and success of our \nchildren, and it is clear that children enrolled in CHIP are healthier \nand doing better in the classroom. I see no greater reason than that to \nexpand this successful program.\n  CHIP is a national success story that we should all take pride in. \nUnfortunately, it is one the few success stories that we have to report \nin health care over the last decade. Health care costs are rising at \never increasing rates, employer sponsored coverage is decreasing, the \nnumbers of uninsured is rising, health care quality is not where it \nshould be given the amount we spend on health care, and patients are \nnot involved enough in their own care.\n  As families, businesses, and providers confront these realities, \nWashington is in a deadlock about how to solve one of our most daunting \ndomestic challenges. CHIP, however, offers this Congress another \nopportunity to reduce the number of uninsured children in this country \nnow. Just as importantly, we have an opportunity to also make an \ninvestment in our future by improving the health status of our Nation's \nchildren. It is imperative to our Nation's future health security to \nprovide these children with the coverage they need to be healthy and \nproductive for years to come.\n  I know that members of both parties want to cover uninsured children \nin their States and across the country. Members of both parties want \nCHIP to function as efficiently as possible and to reach those most in \nneed. Members of both parties want to provide States with flexibility \nto address their States' unique concerns. Now, we are all faced with a \nnew challenge--to cover the 9 million children that remain uninsured \nacross America, 6 million of whom are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. \nThis challenge brought a core group of Senators from the Finance \nCommittee together around these common goals, which they used as a \nfoundation for reauthorizing and expanding this successful program to \nmove towards covering all of the 9 million uninsured children that \nremain in this Nation.\n  Both sides worked tirelessly together and compromised so that the \nlegislation we are now considering could be brought to the Senate floor \nand so that we could move towards bringing health security to more of \nAmerica's uninsured children. If enacted, this legislation would \nprovide coverage to over 3 million more children, again reducing the \nnumber of uninsured children by one-third. States would receive new \nfunding for reaching out to eligible children and enrolling them. \nStates will also receive funding based on their spending projections, \nthereby reducing the likelihood of budget shortfalls as we have seen \nincreasingly in recent years. States will receive incentives to lower \nthe rates of uninsured children in their State. Lastly, States will \ncontinue to have the flexibility to design programs that meet their \nunique needs. In Connecticut, children up to 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty level are eligible for CHIP and this legislation would allow my \nState to continue to build on its success and enroll even more children \ninto this successful program. This legislation also establishes a new \nframework for improving quality, which should be a priority as we \nconsider ways of containing health care costs, by creating a quality \ninitiative to develop, implement, collect measurement data on quality \nof care.\n\n  I know there are some in the Senate that are opposed to this \nlegislation and to the expansion of this program. This week they have \nspoken extensively on their proposals for health care reform and their \nwillingness to move forward on that larger issue. However, while we \nwait to reform the health care system in this partisan environment, \nchildren in this country are living without access to health care. We \nhave a moral obligation to care for these children and give them the \nbest chance to succeed in school, and at life, by keeping them healthy. \nThere are others that say the program should be expanded even more \nsignificantly. While I agree with this latter sentiment, the nature of \nthe work of this body is bipartisan. To progress, we each may have to \ngive something up to our colleagues. I urge them to continue on this \ncourse and support this legislation.\n  The legislation before this Senate body is the product of months of \nbipartisan negotiation, compromise, and a shared vision and goal across \nboth parties. CHIP reauthorization should be an example to all in this \nChamber of what can be accomplished when we put partisanship aside and \nfocus on what we have in common.\n  Most of all, I urge the President to not veto CHIP reauthorization if \na bill were to reach his desk. It would signal a colossal missed \nopportunity to provide health security to those that are most \nvulnerable in our Nation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or what folks on Capitol Hill are \ncalling S-CHIP.\n  SCHIP was created by a Republican Congress in 1997 to help low income \nkids get health insurance. The goal of the program is to help kids that \ndon't qualify for Medicaid, but also can't afford to get health \ninsurance on their own, receive the care they need. This program \nexpires on September 30, 2007, and I am here today to speak about how \nimportant it is to reauthorize this critical program in a way that \nprotects private health insurance and keeps kids healthy.\n  I would like to speak for a few minutes about the how the program \nworks today and how the proposals the Senate is discussing will change \nwhat currently happens.\n  Currently States have three options: they can enroll kids in \nMedicaid, create a new separate program, or devise a combination of \nboth approaches. SCHIP is financed jointly by the Federal Government \nand the States, and States receive a higher percentage of Federal money \nfor their SCHIP beneficiaries than they do for their Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. This was originally designed to encourage States to \ncreate SCHIP programs. States have 3 years to spend their SCHIP \nallotments. Funds that aren't spent within 3 years are usually \nredistributed to States that have spent their allotment and need \nadditional money.\n  When the Republican-led Congress enacted SCHIP in 1997, the program \nauthorized $40 billion for 10 years. I will come back to this point in \na bit, but the underlying bill before us today authorizes $60 billion \nover 5 years--the baseline spending is $25 billion over 5 years and \nthis bill authorizes an additional $35 billion over 5 years. The budget \nresolution contained a deficit neutral reserve fund to spend $50 \nbillion over 5 years in addition to the $25 billion in the baseline, so \na total in the budget resolution is $75 billion over 5 years. This is a \nlot of money and Congress needs to ensure the money is being used to \npay for health insurance for kids that don't currently have health \ninsurance.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Senator \nBaucus' bill will reduce private coverage--that is kids will move from \nprivate health insurance to taxpayer-funded public health insurance. \nThis is a highly inefficient policy--especially given how bureaucratic \nsome State programs are structured. This is not an efficient use of the \ntaxpayer's money.\n  Part of the reason why the crowd out effect is so great under the \nFinance bill is because the bill allows States to expand coverage to \nkids up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level--which by the way \ntranslates to an annual income of $82,000 for a family of four. The \nhigher the income expansion, the greater the crowd out effect. This is \nsimple economics.\n  Now I would be remiss if I didn't mention what a great job my home \nstate of Wyoming is doing in administering SCHIP. Wyoming first \nimplemented its SCHIP program, Kid Care\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\nCHIP, in 1999 and in 2003, Wyoming formed a public-private partnership \nwith Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming and Delta Dental of Wyoming to \nprovide the health, vision, and dental benefits to nearly 6,000 kids in \nWyoming. These partnerships have made Kid Care CHIP a very successful \nprogram in Wyoming. All children enrolled in the program receive a wide \nrange of benefits including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, \nlab and x-ray services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance \nabuse services, durable medical equipment, physical therapy, and dental \nand vision services. Families share in the cost of their children's \nhealth care by paying copayments for a portion of the care provided. \nThese copays are capped at $200 a year per family.\n  Wyoming is also engaged in an outreach campaign targeted at finding \nand enrolling the additional 6,000 kids that are eligible for Kid Care \nCHIP but aren't enrolled.\n  As Congress works to finalize a bill to reauthorize this program, it \nis essential that we focus on the kids first. Some states SCHIP \nprograms cover parents of kids that are on SCHIP and some States even \ncover childless adults. Adults without health insurance are a problem \nin this country, but not a problem this program was originally intended \nto address. I think there are responsible, market-based things Congress \ncan do to help more American adults get health insurance, but this \nbill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, should focus on \nthe C for Children.\n  Not only does this bill need to focus on kids, we need to focus on \nlow income kids. In July 2005, Wyoming's Kid Care CHIP began covering \nkids up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level--those with family \nincomes below $42,000. The median family income in the United States is \nabout $46,000, so the Wyoming benefit is very generous. Some of my \ncolleagues are advocating for expanding SCHIP to cover kids and adults \nat 400 percent of the Federal poverty level. That means families making \nas much as $82,000 a year would have their kid's health insurance paid \nfor by the government. Again, this is an inefficient use of taxpayer \ndollars. Why should the government provide health care for kids that \ncome from families making $82,000 a year? I'll tell you why my \ncolleagues are advocating for it--they see this as the first step \ntoward government-run health care. They want the U.S. to be more like \nCanada and Great Britain. They want to take the private sector out of \nhealth care. They want to put the government in the exam room and tell \nyou what doctors you can see and when you can see them and what drugs \nthey can prescribe for you. I don't believe in this. Not only do I not \nbelieve in this, I think this goes against all the principles upon \nwhich this country was founded.\n\n  Now I do agree that our health care system is breaking down, and in \nfact I don't think we have a health care system, I think we have a sick \ncare system. That is why, earlier this month, I introduced ``Ten Steps \nto Transform Health Care in America,'' a bold and comprehensive \nsolution that addresses our health care crisis by building on market \nbased ideas to expand access to health insurance for all Americans. I \nwould like to take just a little bit of time to discuss each of Ten \nSteps.\n  The first of the Ten Steps is eliminating unfair tax treatment of \nhealth insurance, expanding choices and coverage and giving all \nAmericans more control over their own health care. The Joint Committee \non Taxation estimated that removing this tax bias and a few related \nhealth care tax policies will save the Federal Government $3.6 trillion \nover the next ten years. That is a lot of money that can and should be \nused to expand choices and access and give individuals more control \nover their health care. Ten Steps ensures every American can benefit \nfrom this savings--whether they get their health care from their \nemployer, from the individual insurance market, or they decide they \nwant to get off Medicaid and switch to private insurance. Everyone \nshould be treated equally.\n  The second step of Ten Steps would increase affordable options for \nworking families to purchase health insurance through a standard tax \ndeduction. The national, above-the-line standard deduction for health \ninsurance will equal $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for an individual.\n  The third step of Ten Steps is what makes this a hybrid approach--I \ncouple the standard deduction with a refundable, advanceable, \nassignable tax-based subsidy. The tax subsidy is equal to $5,000 for a \nfamily, $2,500 for an individual. The full subsidy amount is available \nto individuals at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level, \nFPL, which is $20,650 for a family of four. The subsidy is phased out \nas an individual's salary increases, with individuals at 200 percent \nreceiving half of the subsidy and individuals at 301 percent receiving \nthe standard deduction instead of the subsidy.\n  The fourth key step for health care reform is to provide market-based \npooling to reduce growing health care costs and increase access for \nsmall businesses, unions, other kinds of organizations, and their \nworkers, members, and families. Those of you who know me well recognize \nhow central this would be to any health care reform proposal of mine.\n  The fifth step blends the individual and group market to extend \nimportant HIPAA portability protections to the individual market so \nthat insurance security can better move with you from job to job.\n  The sixth step emphasizes preventive benefits and helps individuals \nwith chronic diseases better manage their health. America should have \nhealth care, not sick care. Prevention. Prevention. Prevention. This \nstep is modeled after a very successful program in Wyoming. In 2005, \nWyoming EqualityCare, our Medicaid Program, began providing one-on-one \ncase management for Medicaid participants with a chronic illness, such \nas diabetes, asthma, depression, and heart disease, to encourage better \nself-management of these conditions. The program provides educational \ninformation on self-management as well as a nurse health coach that \nfollows up with each patient to ensure they have what they need to take \ncare of themselves.\n  The seventh step gives individuals the choice to convert the value of \ntheir Medicaid and SCHIP program benefits into private health \ninsurance, putting them in control of their health care, not the \nFederal Government. This is very pertinent to the underlying bill we \nare discussing today. The rationale for this step is simple. If the \nmarket can provide better coverage at a lower price, then why not allow \nAmericans to access that care? This gives low-income individuals more \noptions about where they receive their care and what care is available \nto them. It is time for people to start making decisions about their \ncare--let's get the government out of the doctor's office.\n\n  The eighth step in Ten Steps is a bipartisan proposal which the HELP \nCommittee approved last month--the Wired for Health Care Quality Act. \nThis bill will encourage the adoption of cutting-edge-information \ntechnologies in health care to improve patient care, reduce medical \nerrors and cut health care costs. Some of the most serious challenges \nfacing healthcare today--medical errors, inconsistent quality, and \nrising costs--can be addressed through the effective application of \navailable health information technology linking all elements of the \nhealth care system.\n  The ninth step of Ten Steps helps future providers and nurses pay for \ntheir education while encouraging them to serve in areas with great \nneed. The ninth step also ensures appropriate development of rural \nhealth systems and access to care for residents of rural areas and \ngives seniors more options to receive care in their homes and \ncommunities.\n  The final step decreases the sky-rocketing costs of health care by \nrestoring reliability in our medical justice system through State-based \nsolutions.\n  I realize that I have talked for quite a bit about Ten Steps to \nTransform Health Care in America and that, the underlying legislation \nis the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. I believe it is important to think bigger than just one \nprogram and think about the health care system as a whole. I have \nspoken a few times on the Senate floor about what I call the 80/20 \nrule. I always believe that we can agree on 80 percent of the issues \nand on 80 percent of each issue, and that if we focus on that 80 \npercent we can do great things for the\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\nAmerican people. I believe that if we work together on these proposals \nwe can find that 80 percent. I would like to work with my colleagues on \nthat 80 percent. I want action--real action to provide real coverage \nfor Americans. I support reauthorizing this program in a way that \nprotects private health insurance and keeps kids healthy. I also \nsupport looking beyond this single program at reforming the entire \nhealth care system.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud that we have produced a \nbipartisan bill to continue to provide health care insurance to \nchildren of low-income parents. The Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, which we created 10 years ago, has been a great success, but \nit is set to expire on September 30. This bill to reauthorize and \nexpand the program deserves our strong support.\n  I urge the President to approve the bipartisan compromise my \ncolleagues worked so hard to achieve and not to carry out his threat to \nveto a bill, a veto which could result in denying health care coverage \nto many uninsured children from working families.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a children's health insurance \nprogram under title XXI of the Social Security Act. This program allows \nstates to insure children whose families are above Medicaid eligibility \nlevels through block grants, and it allowed states flexibility in \ndesigning how CHIP would be implemented.\n  Since 1997, CHIP has received about $40 billion in appropriations and \nhas been widely successful. Currently, 6.6 million children are \nenrolled in CHIP. Seventy percent of those children came from families \nwith incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level, and more than 90 \npercent were from families with incomes below 200 percent of the \npoverty level.\n  CHIP coverage leads to better access to preventative and primary care \nservices, better quality of care, better health outcomes and improved \nperformance in school. Some experts estimate that families with insured \nchildren are five times less likely to delay health care because of \ncosts than families with uninsured children. Michigan has had \nparticularly impressive results from CHIP and currently has the second \nlowest rate of uninsured children in the nation.\n  Although CHIP has been successful, it still fails to address the \nproblem fully. Too many children qualify for the program but are unable \nto receive insurance because of inadequate funding. There are still 9 \nmillion uninsured children nationwide, 6 million of which are eligible \nfor either Medicaid or CHIP. In Michigan, while 55,000 children are \ncovered under CHIP, 90,000 Michigan children are currently eligible for \nMedicaid or MIChild, Michigan's CHIP program, but are not receiving \nservices. In addition, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, \nthe recent decline in employer-sponsored health care coverage is \nthreatening the access to private health care coverage for many more \nchildren.\n  With CHIP set to expire this year, the path we need to take is clear \nwe need to reauthorize and to also expand CHIP.\n  This bill before us was reported by the Senate Finance Committee with \na bipartisan majority of 17-4. It will reauthorize CHIP and increase \nfunding for the program by $35 billion over 5 years. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 would ensure that \nthere is sufficient funding to cover the children currently enrolled \nand to expand the program to additional children in need. This plan \nwould increase outreach and enrollment for uninsured low-income \nchildren of the working poor, enhance premium assistance options for \nlow-income families, and improve the quality of health care for our \nNation's children.\n  This reauthorization would also provide $200 million in grants for \nstates to improve access to dental coverage; require that states \nproviding mental health services provide those services on par with \nmedical and surgical benefits under CHIP; and allow states to use \ninformation from food stamp programs to find and enroll eligible \nchildren. This bill would also help to reduce racial and ethnic health \ncare disparities by improving outreach to minority populations and \nprovide new funding for state translation and interpretation services.\n  The additional $35 billion in funding is expected to reach an \nestimated 3.2 million additional uninsured American children from low-\nincome families. Up to 50,000 more Michigan children would be covered \nover the next 5 years.\n  There are two aspects of the bill that are disappointing. The current \nCHIP program allows for flexibility at the State-level in how the \nprogram is implemented. The administration has encouraged this \nflexibility by approving waivers to some States that would allow them \nto cover services to other needy populations after ensuring that it is \nnot at the expense of enrolling eligible children into CHIP.\n  Michigan has had a waiver that allows it to cover adults who make \nless than $3,500 a year--adults who are the ``poorest of the poor.'' \nBut under the bill we passed today, some of these waivers will be \nphased out\n  The second disappointment is that this bill does not go as far as we \ncould have to fund and expand CHIP. In the fiscal year 2008 budget \nresolution, the Senate included an increase of $50 billion for CHIP. \nHowever, the bill, as a result of compromises made, provides $35 \nbillion.\n  I voted for an amendment offered by Senator Kerry that would have \nprovided the additional $15 billion that would have taken us back to \n$50 billion. With this additional funding, the Kerry amendment would \nhave provided more incentives to increase the enrollment of uninsured \nchildren. Unfortunately, this amendment was not agreed to.\n  On balance, however, this is a strong bill. President Bush's approach \nwould be far worse. The President wants to add only $5 billion over 5 \nyears, which many believe will not even sustain the current levels of \ncoverage and certainly would not help the millions of children still \nliving without health insurance.\n  President Bush has threatened to veto the Senate's CHIP \nreauthorization bill, but I hope the Senate's action today will send a \nstrong message to the President that this program has broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Here are just a few examples of the way in which CHIP fills a need. A \ncourageous and hardworking mother from Royal Oak, MI, wrote:\n\n       As a single working mother, I could not afford the family \n     insurance that my employer offered, and definitely could not \n     afford private pay. Without this insurance I do not know what \n     I would have done. [SCHIP] offered us options, doctors \n     instead of emergency rooms, less time missed at work and \n     school. Please continue and increase funding for this \n     valuable program. Thank you.\n\n  A registered nurse from Berkley, MI wrote:\n\n       I work in Detroit with impoverished, uninsured and \n     underinsured adolescents and the SCHIP program has helped \n     tremendously in getting them the health care they so \n     desperately need.\n\n  And a registered nurse from Pleasant Ridge, MI, wrote:\n\n       It is an imperative to continue to support, and expand, \n     health care services to children. These services are the \n     building blocks of personal health leading to healthy, active \n     adults. Health promotion and disease prevention programs have \n     been shown to save significant healthcare dollars later in \n     life by assuring that each individual grows and develops to \n     their fullest potential. Healthy children become healthy \n     adults who then support the growth of communities and the \n     economy.\n\n  We have a moral obligation to provide Americans access to affordable \nand high quality health care. No person, young or old, should be denied \naccess to adequate health care, and the expanded and improved \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is an important step toward \nachieving that goal.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, one of the first bills that I sponsored \nwhen I came to the Senate 10 years ago was the legislation that \nestablished the State Child Health Insurance Program--or SCHIP--which \nprovides health care coverage for children of low-income working \nparents who cannot afford health insurance yet make too much money to \nqualify for Medicaid.\n  Since 1997, SCHIP has contributed to a one-third decline in the \nuninsured rate of low-income children. Today, over 6 million children--\nincluding 14,500 in Maine--receive health care coverage from this \nremarkably effective health care program.\n  According to a recent assessment by the nonpartisan Center for \nChildren and Families at Georgetown University, ``While the coverage \nnews for the nation is generally bleak, the story for\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\nchildren's health coverage stands apart. Of all the health reform \nefforts, covering children has been resoundingly successful. Since its \ncreation, SCHIP has partnered with Medicaid to help ensure that \nchildren have the health care that they need.''\n  Still, there is more that we can do. While Maine ranks among the top \n4 States in the Nation in reducing the number of uninsured children, we \nstill have more than 20,000 children who don't have coverage. \nNationally, about 9 million children remain uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, the authorization for SCHIP, which has done so much to \nhelp low-income American families to obtain the health care that they \nneed, is about to expire. As the cochair with Senator Rockefeller of \nthe nonpartisan Alliance for Health Reform, I have long been concerned \nabout the need to extend the SCHIP program in order to renew our \ncommitment to meeting the health care needs of children in our Nation's \nlow-income working families.\n  That is why I am pleased to support this legislation to extend and \nstrengthen this important program. This bipartisan bill increases \nfunding for SCHIP by $35 billion over the next 5 years, a level which \nis sufficient to maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children \ncurrently enrolled, and also allows the program to expand to cover an \nadditional 3.3 million low-income children.\n  The legislation the Senate is currently debating also improves SCHIP \nin a number of important ways. I am particularly pleased that the bill \nincludes a requirement for States that offer mental health services \nthrough their SCHIP program to provide coverage that is equivalent in \nscope to benefits for other physician and health services. Treating \nbehavioral and emotional problems and mental illness while children are \nyoung is critical to preventing more serious problems later on.\n  Despite the demonstrated need, children's dental coverage offered by \nStates isn't always all that it should be. Low-income and rural \nchildren suffer disproportionately from oral health problems. In fact, \n80 percent of all tooth decay is found in just 25 percent of children. \nI am, therefore, cosponsoring amendments with Senators Snowe, Bingaman, \nCardin, and Mikulski to strengthen the dental coverage offered through \nSCHIP to ensure that more low-income children have access to the dental \nservices that they need to prevent disease and promote oral health. I \nam hopeful that these amendments will be included in the final package.\n  In recognition of the fact that good health begins before birth, the \nSenate bill also gives States the option of covering low-income \npregnant women under SCHIP. Current regulations do permit States to \ncover unborn children, making reimbursements available for prenatal, \nlabor, and delivery services. Medically necessary postpartum care, \nhowever, is not covered. The Senate bill will change that.\n  The Senate bill will also eliminate the State shortfall problems that \nhave plagued the SCHIP program, and it also provides additional \nincentives to encourage States to increase outreach and enrollment, \nparticularly of the lowest income children.\n  In short, Mr. President, the bill before the Senate is a prescription \nfor good health for millions of our Nation's working families, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley, as well as Senators Rockefeller and Hatch, for \ntheir visionary leadership and tireless perseverance in crafting an \nSCHIP package that has received so much bipartisan support. I also want \nto thank them for never losing sight of the single over-arching goal--\nobtaining health insurance for uninsured children.\n  I rise today to strongly support a Senate resolution I have filed \nwith Senator Lincoln and a host of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle which contains a resounding and inescapable message: Congress \nmust unite to address the small business health insurance crisis--this \nyear.\n  I am encouraged by the unprecedented level of constructive, \nbipartisan dialogue currently taking place on the issue of small \nbusiness health insurance reform. The roster of support on our Small \nBusiness Resolution speaks volumes about its viability: Senators Baucus \nand Grassley, Kennedy and Enzi and Senators Ben Nelson, Durbin, Smith, \nand Crapo. This diverse, bipartisan group tells me that the will is \nthere. We can get this done--if we don't retreat to partisan corners \nand if we work together and make tough compromises just as we have done \non the SCHIP bill--which this body will soon likely pass--where we sat \ndown, rolled up our sleeves, and worked together to fashion a consensus \npackage.\n  As past chair and now ranking member of the Small Business Committee, \nif there is one concern I have heard time and again, it is the \nexorbitant cost to small businesses of providing health insurance to \ntheir employees. Health insurance premiums have increased at double-\ndigit percentage levels in 4 of the past 6 years--far outpacing \ninflation and wage gains. Is there any question that the small business \nhealth insurance crisis is real?\n  We could not be at a more pivotal juncture on this threshold issue. \nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, last year the average group-\nsponsored health insurance policy for an individual was $4,242--the \naverage family plan cost $11,480. And the figures are dramatically \nworse for those purchasing health insurance in the individual market. \nFor example, in my home State of Maine, a health insurance plan on the \nindividual market can cost a family of four in excess of $24,000 per \nyear. Funds which could be used for other expenses such as saving for \ncollege tuition or retirement security or a down payment on a home--not \nfor one year of health care.\n  This phenomenon perpetuates a cycle of spiraling costs and declining \naccess as fewer and fewer small businesses offer health insurance to \ntheir employees. Only 48 percent of our smallest businesses are able to \nprovide this workplace benefit--a 10 percent drop from 5 years ago. \nClearly, it is time we started heading in the opposite direction.\n  Of course, this is easier said than done as small group markets such \nas those in Maine have no real competition and represent major \nimpediments. No competition means higher costs, and higher costs mean \nno health insurance.\n  Making matters more challenging is the fact that across the country, \nthe largest insurers now control 43 percent of the small group markets. \nIn Maine, a sum total of four large insurers now control 98 percent of \nthe small group market.\n  So the issue isn't whether the United States has the greatest health \ncare system in the world--we do. But with nearly 45 million uninsured \nin this country, our goal should be nothing less than providing health \ncare access for all. It is all the more incumbent upon this Congress to \nconsider every possible viable avenue and reach across the partisan \ndivide to solve this crisis, an approach that reflects the undeniable \nwill of the American people on this matter.\n  That is why I have advocated for and championed Small Business Health \nPlan legislation which would allow small businesses to ``pool'' \ntogether across state lines to provide their employees with health \ninsurance at significantly lower costs. It is an idea which is gaining \ngrowing support. A recent study published by the National Association \nof Realtors concluded that an overwhelming majority of voters--89 \npercent, including 93 percent of Republicans and 86 percent of \nDemocrats--favor legislation that would allow small businesses to pool \ntogether to negotiate lower health insurance costs.\n  I continue to believe that Small Business Health Plans are a logical \nsolution to the small business health insurance crisis, and I thank \nSenator Enzi for all of his tremendous efforts in getting legislation \npassed through the HELP Committee last year, and for having them \nconsidered on the Senate floor for the first time ever.\n  As we move forward in this debate, we must leave no stone unturned in \nour search for consensus solutions to this crisis as we seek to reform \nthe small group and individual health insurance markets.\n  We must address how to allow health insurers to provide lower-cost \nproducts to small businesses across state lines\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\nwhile maintaining the most widely accepted and necessary benefits and \nservices.\n  We must figure out how to ``rate,'' or price, these products--and \nalso how and whether this can be done in a uniform manner, without \njeopardizing consumer protections.\n  Finally, we should examine ways to use the tax code as a mechanism \nfor increasing access to health care and injecting competition into the \nstate small group markets.\n  In conclusion, Congress must consider small business health insurance \nreform legislation this year, in a bipartisan, comprehensive way that \ncan secure significant consensus support. In the coming months, I look \nforward to a robust and productive debate on this issue in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \npassage of the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization. \nThis is a vitally important program that ensures some of the most \nvulnerable among us, our children, have access to the health care they \ndeserve. There is no question that we are a country with a health care \ncrisis. In the richest, most powerful country in the world, it is a \ndisgrace that we have 47 million people with no health coverage. \nAddressing this national priority is long overdue, so I am especially \npleased that this new Congress will take action by extending health \ncare coverage to millions of children.\n  Congress created this program 10 years ago to provide coverage to \nchildren whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, but \nlacked health care coverage through their employer or the private \nmarket. At that time, there were more than ten million children who \nwere uninsured. In the last decade, we have seen the success of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program; it has covered over 6 million low-\nincome children, providing consistent quality health care.\n  With the success of this program, it is appropriate that we renew it \nfor 5 more years, but also extend it so that millions of additional \nlow-income, uninsured children will now have health coverage. This \nexpansion is critically important because through CHIP children have \nfar better access to preventive and primary care services than they \nwould if they were uninsured. With more routine health care, we know \nthat kids have better health outcomes and perform better in schools.\n  Studies have also shown that approximately 6 million children are \neligible for public coverage but are not enrolled in CHIP. I am pleased \nthat the Finance Committee has been able to craft a bill that would \ncover 3.2 million children, but I do hope that we can go even further \nand expand this coverage to additional children. Because uninsured \nchildren are nine times less likely to receive needed health care on \ntime and are more likely to go without a visit to a doctor's office, we \nneed to cover as many of them as possible.\n  My State of Vermont has been a leader when it comes to covering kids. \nWe are referred to an early expansion State because prior to the \ncreation of this program, Vermont extended Medicaid coverage to low-\nincome children through a program known as Dr. Dynasaur. The bill \nbefore the Senate would allow Vermont to maintain coverage for the kids \ncurrently covered, but also reach out to the remaining children that \nare eligible but not enrolled in the program.\n  The Finance Committee proposal would also have a positive impact on \nhealth care by increasing the tobacco tax. This action will have a \nsignificant affect on our country's health, reducing the rate of \ncancer, strokes and heart attacks. Further, an increase in the tobacco \ntax will also reduce the prevalence of smoking, especially among \nadolescents. We know that when cigarettes become more expensive, both \nkids and adults will change how much they smoke. This is a positive \noutcome and one that I support.\n  I appreciate the hard work that has gone into crafting this \nbipartisan legislation. I believe it puts the country on the right \ntrack towards ensuring all children have health insurance and I \nstrongly support it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is a monumental day for all \nAmericans but especially children and their families. I am proud of the \nwork we have accomplished over the past few days in the Senate on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--or CHIP--Reauthorization Act of \n2007. Renewing this program for another 10 years is a fitting way to \nmark this Sunday, August 5th's 10-year anniversary of the day the first \nCHIP bill was signed into law.\n  As you know, this legislation was the result of countless hours of \nnegotiations between Senators Baucus, Grassley, and Hatch and I. CHIP \nlegislation has a history of bipartisanship, I am quite proud of it.\n  Many Members of this Chamber had hoped for something different in \nthis bill.\n  There were some on the other side of the aisle who wanted to place \nfurther restrictions on those covered by this bill and decrease the \nfunding to $15 million. I know that there were others on this side of \nthe aisle who wanted to add benefits and increase the funding to $50 \nbillion. Individually, we were each tempted by some of the suggested \nchanges in the more than 86 amendments to this bill.\n  But the fundamental goal has been sustained throughout our debates \nand votes--expanding access to health care for millions of children, \nincluding those eligible children who are not yet enrolled.\n  Each of us knows the statistics in our own State. I am proud that \nnearly 39,000 West Virginians were enrolled in the program last year.\n  These kids can see a doctor when they get sick, receive necessary \nimmunizations, and get the preventative screenings they need for a \nhealthy start in life, because of this important program. The passage \nof this bill means 4,000 more West Virginia children will have \naffordable and stable health insurance coverage including access to \nbasic preventative care and immunizations.\n  Bipartisan passage in the Finance Committee was our first ``win.'' \nSenate passage is the next bold step. Our conference, like all of the \nCHIP negotiations, will be intense. But if we keep our focus on \ncovering children and bipartisanship, I am confident that we will \nachieve our vital goal of continuing this successful program for \nchildren.\n  Many individuals have worked long and very hard on this legislation \nfor months. I truly appreciate the efforts of Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley and their professional staff. Senators Hatch \nand Snowe and their staff played an essential role in our negotiating \nteam.\n  But I also want to take a moment to mention the extraordinary work of \nmy health care legislative assistant, Jocelyn Moore. She is enormously \ndedicated and she has a deep commitment to health care policy, \nespecially the needs of children. Jocelyn is a talented professional \nwho have been working around-the-clock for many months. My legislative \ndirector, Ellen Doneski, has also been involved throughout the process \nand is a real leader. I am grateful for their dedication and commitment \nand inspired by the intellect and mastery of the issue of children's \nhealth policy.\n  I thank my staff, and my colleagues. Let's get ready for conference \nnegotiations and stay focused on what matters most--covering children.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when this debate first began, I came to \nthis floor to say that SCHIP has proved to be, in many ways, a \nremarkable success for this Nation.\n  Thanks to a program passed by a Republican-led Congress 10 years ago, \nthe rate of uninsured children in America has dropped by 25 percent \nfrom 1996 to 2005. Last year, 6.6 million children had health care \nbecause of SCHIP--and over 50,000 of them were in my home State of \nKentucky.\n  SCHIP has accomplished what it was designed to do: protect children \nin low-income families, families too well off to qualify for Medicaid \nbut still needy enough to have difficulty affording private insurance.\n  When the program came up for reauthorization, this Senate's goal \nshould have been to retain what works, and to strengthen the law in \nareas where it has been misused.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what happened. SCHIP was originally \ncreated to help the needy. But it is clear the authors of this new \nproposal have overreached.\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\n  Some have seized the reauthorization of SCHIP as a license to raise \ntaxes, increase spending, and take a giant leap forward into the land \nof government-run health care.\n  The problems with this bill are numerous, and I have spelled them out \non this floor before. Because of a budgeting gimmick, the current bill, \nH.R. 976, will end up costing $41 billion more than advertised.\n  It will raise taxes at a time when the American people are already \ntaxed too much by more than doubling the Federal tax on tobacco.\n  It will leave open loopholes allowing some States to raid their kids' \nhealth funds and use the money for adults. The ``C'' in ``SCHIP'' \nstands for children.\n  It will allow families in certain States who make as much as four \ntimes the Federal poverty level to still qualify for SCHIP insurance. A \nfamily of four in New York City making as much as $82,600 could \nqualify.\n  That means thousands of families in New York alone will be poor \nenough to receive SCHIP--yet also rich enough to pay the alternative \nminimum tax, a tax designed specifically to target the so-called \n``wealthy.''\n  By luring people away from the private market, H.R. 976 will \neventually remove 2 million people from private health coverage.\n  Senators Lott, Kyl, Gregg, Bunning and I saw the problems with this \nbill, and proposed an alternative. The Kids First Act would have \nreauthorized SCHIP and ensured that states had sufficient resources to \ncover all of the kids already enrolled.\n  It would have added an additional 1.3 million children to the program \nby 2012. And it would have done all of this without raising taxes or \nincreasing the deficit.\n  The Kids First Act kept the focus on SCHIP's true goal: protecting \nlow-income children.\n  Many States, including Kentucky, would actually have had more SCHIP \nfunds to spend on kids under the Kids First Act than under the bill on \nthe floor. I am sorry the Senate did not see fit to adopt our proposal.\n  I know many Senators worked their hardest during this debate to craft \ncomprehensive solutions for the uninsured in America. I appreciate \ntheir efforts. I look forward to continuing that work.\n  Unfortunately, so much effort has not produced an answer. This bill \nis unlikely to receive a Presidential signature. Nothing will have been \naccomplished. We will have to pass a temporary extension of SCHIP, and \nthen go back to the drawing board for a long-term reauthorization.\n  When we do, I hope the Senate can stay focused like a laser beam on \nwhat SCHIP is truly all about: providing a safety net for kids in low-\nincome families.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to craft \nlegislation that can meet that goal, pass this Senate, and be signed \ninto law.\n  But for now, the bill on the floor will not accomplish that. I intend \nto vote ``no.'' And I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are about to vote final passage \ntonight. I am not going to take the time of Senators for all the \ncustomary thank-yous. I will do that at a later date. But I do very \nmuch want to thank Senators Grassley, Hatch, and Rockefeller and all \nthe great team who helped make this possible.\n  I also thank the parents across the country who love their children \nand are determined to provide the best possible health care for them. I \nsay to the parents, to all Americans, I hope this bill helps you \nprovide that health care, and I think it will. I thank all Senators for \ntheir cooperation in helping make this happen tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I want to take a brief opportunity to thank the senior \nSenator\n\n[[Page S10762]]\n\nfrom Tennessee, who was the brains behind this effort on the Republican \nside. It did enjoy broad bipartisan support. But the leader clearly on \nour side in developing and pushing for this accomplishment was the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee. I just want to, on behalf of all of us \nwho were enthusiastic about this piece of legislation, congratulate him \nfor a spectacular job.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly also applaud the Senator from \nTennessee. He worked hand in glove with Senator Bingaman, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Inouye.\n  I think it is appropriate to send a bouquet to my friend, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. This is something \nhe has believed in for a long time. He has worked with a number of \nindividuals, and he has been out front on this going on for well more \nthan a year.\n  The Republican leader and I have left off people who deserve \nattention, but we all deserve some credit. As we have said before, when \nwe do something that is good, there is credit to go around. When we \nfail to accomplish things, there is blame to go around. Tonight, we can \nall claim a little bit of the credit, and rightfully so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, which I \nwill not do, while the majority leader and the Republican leader are on \nthe floor, I would simply like to say that this is the Reid-McConnell \nbill we are passing, which represents the fact that so many Members of \nthis body have been a part of it.\n  After the Senator from Iowa makes his remarks, after wrap-up, I plan \nto make some remarks about this bill. But I would just simply say now \nthat they have created an environment, in a bipartisan way, that \npermitted this bill to pass. It has been worked on for 2 years. It has \nhad 70 Members--35 Democrats, 35 Republicans--cosponsoring it. I would \njudge that there will be no more important piece of legislation to the \nfuture of the country that passes the Congress in this session. I wish \nto thank Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, and Senator Frist from the \nlast session for creating the environment that made it possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I go to further remarks, I want \nto give some credit on the passage of H.R. 976 the bill we just had and \nthe cooperation.\n  The Grassley-Baucus cooperation has been mentioned here. I really \ncompliment Senator Baucus for his leadership in working with us. But, \nalso, it took us 3 or 4 months to put together a bill, and Senator \nHatch and Senator Rockefeller were very much involved in that effort \nwith many long hours. So I thank them.\n  I do wish to make the point that what the Senate has done over the \npast few days has genuinely served the interests of the American \npeople. The Senate passed this bipartisan legislation which will cover \nan additional 3.2 million children.\n  The Senate has proceeded in regular order to process amendments. \nEvery amendment that was offered was defeated--I mean every one on \nwhich we had a rollcall vote was defeated. So this bill basically has \ncome out of the Senate the same way it came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  This is how we should do business in the Senate. Amendments were \ndebated and voted upon. Members had the opportunity to consider a \nvariety of changes to the Senate Finance Committee bill. Some were \nadopted by voice vote. Those that took a rollcall, none of those were \nadopted. But regular order was followed, and the Senate worked its \nwill.\n  I am pleased with the Senate Committee product, which is a bipartisan \nproduct.\n  I am also pleased with how the majority and minority leaders have \nhandled the process. This has been a tough, complicated piece of \nlegislation. A lot of Members and staff have worked very hard to get us \nto this point.\n  I thank the chairman for his tireless efforts and how he worked in a \nbipartisan manner. I wish to thank his staff: Alice Weiss, Michelle \nEaston, Bill Dauster, Russ Sullivan, David Swartz, and Rebecca Baxter. \nI also thank Senator Rockefeller and his staff: Jocelyn Moore and Ellen \nDoneski. Much is also owed to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and his \nstaff. Finally, I wish to thank the staff of the minority--I should say \nthe Republicans on the Finance Committee: Chris Condeluci, Mark Prater, \nBecky Shipp, Rodney Whitlock, Mark Hayes, and Kolan Davis.\n  Now, I would like to address the Senate since we passed our bill, \nsince the House last night passed their bill, and soon there will be a \nconference between the House and Senate. I wish to speak about some \nthings I think the House of Representatives has done that are damaging \nto Medicare Advantage.\n  People are saying that Medicare Advantage plans are overpaid. They \ntalk about cutting payments, and that is what the House of \nRepresentatives has done in their SCHIP bill. But they do not talk \nabout why Congress set up the payment structure, which was to create \nchoices of plans in Medicare and to expand private plan choices in \nrural America. They do not talk about why Congress set up that choice. \nIt worries me that those arguing about the plan payments are losing \nsight of the Medicare beneficiaries.\n  These beneficiaries, the seniors and disabled of America, are the \nones who benefit from having Medicare Advantage plans available to \nchoose from. Congress, in 2003, enacted the Medicare Modernization Act. \nThat is the act that included the prescription drug program as an \nimprovement in Medicare. A major goal of the MMA, the Medicare \nModernization Act, was to expand beneficiaries' choice of Medicare \nplans. Before MMA, rural beneficiaries, such as my people in Iowa and a \nlot of States that are more sparsely populated than Iowa, rarely had a \nprivate Medicare plan to choose from. Now rural and urban Medicare \nbeneficiaries can decide whether a private plan option or traditional \nMedicare works best for them.\n  I want to tell you why Medicare Advantage can be a good option for \nbeneficiaries and why the program should not be touched, as it was \nrecently by the House of Representatives in their SCHIP bill. I want to \nexplain at the same time why Congress thought all beneficiaries, \nwhether you were in rural America or urban America, should have a \nchoice of plans.\n  The original Medicare benefit is set up based on how medicine was \npracticed in 1964, meaning in 1964 the fee for service that is the \ntraditional Medicare was set up at a time when you went to the doctor. \nIf you were very sick, then you went to the hospital. Medicine was much \nless specialized.\n\n[[Page S10763]]\n\nPatients were treated by one doctor at a time, not the teams of people \nwho treat patients now. Under traditional Medicare, dating from 1964, \nhospital benefits are in Part A of Medicare; physician benefits are \nfinanced and delivered separately in Part B of Medicare. Each set of \nbenefits has its own deductible. A hospital deductible alone is a lot \nhigher than most working people have in their health insurance. It is \n$992, and it goes up a little bit every year. That is a pretty \nsignificant amount. That deductible alone can impose a big hardship on \na family, if they are relying solely on Medicare for their health \ncoverage. Medicare also only covers a limited number of hospital days \neach year. It is not great protection if you are severely injured or if \nyou have an illness that has a long hospital stay. Say you happen to \nend up in the hospital for months at a stretch, you might end up \nexhausting your Medicare coverage. A lot of people don't realize how \nlimited Medicare benefits can be.\n  Medicare also does not actually have catastrophic coverage. \nTraditional fee-for-service Medicare, the Medicare since 1964, by \nitself does not provide protection against the cost of catastrophic \nillness. Some beneficiaries then buy Medigap insurance for this \ncatastrophic insurance. Medigap insurance can be expensive for those on \nfixed incomes. In contrast, and hence why the House of Representatives \nshould not change Medicare Advantage, Medicare Advantage plans have \ncatastrophic coverage for those seniors who want to choose it, and they \ndo it for a much lower premium than the Medigap add-on to traditional \nfee-for-service Medicare. That is one of the many reasons Medicare \nAdvantage should be an option, not just in metropolitan areas, as it \nwas before we passed the prescription drug bill in 2003. We need rural \nequity. And through the MMA, we brought rural equity so that people in \nmy State and more sparsely populated States can have a choice between \nfee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage, which can be a \npreferred provider organization, HMOs, or fee-for-service Medicare \nAdvantage. Prior to 2003, in my State of Iowa, only 1 of 99 counties \nhad the Medicare Advantage option. That was Pottawatomie County right \nacross the river from Omaha, because they could work in with Omaha, but \nthe other 98 counties did not have choice as they have in Los Angeles \nand Texas and Arizona, New York and New Jersey, Philadelphia, and \nFlorida. There may be some others but not really rural States. You are \nstuck with fee-for-service traditional Medicare written in 1964, not \nmuch for the practice of medicine in the year 2007.\n  So I am very concerned that what the House of Representatives did in \ntheir SCHIP bill is such that it is going to put in danger the choices \nwe now have in rural America between fee-for-service traditional \nMedicare and Medicare Advantage such as some of the more metropolitan \nStates have had for a couple decades.\n  If you are in Medicare Advantage, you don't have to have the Medigap \nadd-on to your traditional Medicare. Another plus is that most Medicare \nAdvantage plans also have a limit on out-of-pocket costs. In Iowa the \nplans often have a limit of $1,000 or less. In other States, Montana, \nmuch of New York and California, that is true as well. In some States \nand counties, out-of-pocket limits are higher. Traditional Medicare has \nno out-of-pocket limits. In original Medicare, to keep costs down, \nCongress imposed caps on types of care. For example, there is a $1,780 \nannual cap on physical therapy. Once a patient hits that cap on \nphysical therapy, he must pay out of pocket if he needs more therapy, \nunless he gets approved for an exception. Many patients hit the cap \nearly in the year. These are patients who have had a stroke or a \nserious accident. After that they have to pay themselves for the \nservice unless they succeed in appealing for more therapy services. \nThen by contrast, Medicare Advantage plans can base coverage for \nphysical therapy on what the patient needs, not what some bureaucrat in \nWashington says there is a limit on. They can avoid these arbitrary \ncaps.\n  In original Medicare, patients may see a doctor whenever they like. \nThat may seem like a good idea. Many patients see a lot of doctors and \nare prescribed many different drugs. In original Medicare, physician \ncare can be disjointed. No one oversees all the care a patient \nreceives. Some patients prefer it that way. Others welcome having help \nnavigating the health care system. They would like to choose a plan \nthat would help them coordinate their care, and most Medicare Advantage \nplans do just that. So that is why we don't want the House of \nRepresentatives to cripple Medicare Advantage.\n  Let's say a patient has diabetes. In Medicare fee for service, there \nis no one to help monitor that she is testing her blood sugar. No one \nchecks to see if she is getting her eyes and feet checked, which are \nthe result of diabetes. And in most Medicare Advantage plans, somebody \ndoes that oversight. Somebody does that checking. Plans use teams of \npeople, ranging from doctors to pharmacists to nurses to dieticians to \ncase managers, all to make sure enrollees are getting the care they \nneed. Four out of five Medicare beneficiaries have a chronic illness. \nIn many Medicare Advantage plans, one doctor oversees their care. The \nplan assigns a case manager. Patients don't have to navigate the system \nalone. For many patients, this can be preferable, and it is because of \nMedicare Advantage. We don't want that plan crippled, as the House of \nRepresentatives bill does.\n\n  Medicare Advantage is a great program for poor and low-income people. \nCritics of the program argue that poor people qualify for Medicaid. \nThey say Medicare Advantage doesn't help them. I want to make it clear \nthat this is not true. I am going to get to that point later. But even \nthe critics cannot argue with the statistics about lower income or near \npoor beneficiaries. These beneficiaries can't afford a Medigap policy. \nFor them, Medicare Advantage is a godsend. According to the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, the average Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiary gets $86 a month in extra benefits. Most of those extra \nbenefits are in reduced cost sharing. Medicare Advantage plans often \nreduce copays and deductibles that beneficiaries otherwise would have \nto pay.\n  As I noted, Medicare Advantage plans offer catastrophic coverage. If \nan enrollee ends up in the hospital for weeks or even a year, the plan \ncovers it. That is not true of traditional Medicare fee-for-service, \nstarted in 1964. It doesn't fit the practice of medicine today. But \nMedicare Advantage offers medicine delivered on the practice of \nmedicine in 2007. The benefits may include an annual physical. They may \ninclude lower copays for enrollees needing kidney dialysis. They \ninclude unlimited physical therapy based upon patient need.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the beneficiaries have access to a Medicare \nAdvantage plan that plugs the gap in the Part D drug coverage; 98 \npercent have access to a plan that offers preventive dental benefits. \nBeneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans are more likely to get \npreventive services. Almost all Medicare beneficiaries have access to a \nplan with no-cost cancer screening. And for this, many beneficiaries \npay no extra premium. They pay only the regular Part B premium, as \neverybody else does. Eighty-four percent of beneficiaries had access to \na zero premium Medicare Advantage plan last year.\n  Many seniors live on fixed incomes. Medicare Advantage may be the \nonly way they can afford these benefits. It is also easy to use. Many \nMedicare Advantage plans let seniors use one health care card, their \nMedicare Advantage plan card, for all of their health care needs. \nInstead of three cards, they have one card. They pull the same card out \nwhen they go to the doctor, same card they use for the hospital, the \nsame card they use for the pharmacist. They don't have to worry about \ndealing with claim forms from two or three different insurance plans. \nBut that is not the case for beneficiaries in the original 1964 type \nMedicare. If they have Medigap and Part D prescription drug coverage, \nthey have to deal with multiple plans that don't coordinate their \ncoverage or coordinate their benefits.\n  I said I would get back to why Medicare Advantage is good for lower \nincome seniors. It is true that many lower income beneficiaries are \nalso covered by Medicaid. These individuals are referred to as dual \neligibles, because they are under both Medicare and Medicaid. But we \nhave a program\n\n[[Page S10764]]\n\nin Medicare Advantage for people who are eligible for both. This \nprogram is called a special needs plan. It coordinates the care and the \nbenefits between the Medicaid Program which is run by the States and \nthe Federal Government. It should be seamless to the beneficiaries. \nHave these special needs plans worked perfectly? Not always. The \nprogram is a work in progress. Surely it is a lot better than what \nhappens without it. Without it, health care for poor beneficiaries is \nsiloed. The parts covered by Medicare are never coordinated with the \nparts Medicaid is responsible for.\n  Let's say a frail senior is in a nursing home. She has exhausted her \nsavings so Medicaid is paying. She has Medicare for her health \ncoverage. She enrolls in one of these special needs plans. When she \ngets a fever or an infection, the Medicare Advantage special needs plan \ncan treat her at the nursing home. In the original Medicare, the \nnursing home would send her to the more expensive hospital environment. \nThe hospital, after 3 days, would discharge her to a skilled nursing \nhome facility. For her, the Medicare Advantage plan reduces disruptions \nand keeps her from being exposed to additional infections in the \nhospital. At the same time, you save a lot of money in Medicare. Both \nshe and Medicare are spared the cost of hospitalization--the most \nexpensive health delivery.\n\n  So the critics who say that Medicare Advantage is not helping poor \npeople are mistaken. While the program is small, that is because the \nprogram is new. It can be a model for all of us. This is how we want \nour care to be delivered to us when we are very old and when we are \nvery frail.\n  So Medicare Advantage can be a good choice for very sick people. It \ncan be a good choice for people with chronic illness. It can be a good \nchoice for lower income people. It can be a good choice for people who \nwant some extra benefits. It can be a good choice for people on fixed \nincomes. It can be a good choice for rural beneficiaries as well as \nurban ones.\n  When the House of Representatives gets done with it all, we will not \nhave it in rural America. But they will still have it in urban America, \nand that is very unfair. That inequity was meant to be taken care of \nwhen we passed the prescription drug bill in 2003, and I am not anxious \nto let that sort of equity between rural and urban America go away. But \nit can also be a good choice for seniors.\n  All Medicare beneficiaries, whether they live in a city, a small \ntown, or on a farm, ought to be able to choose their own plan. They \nknow best what suits their needs--the original 1964 Medicare or the \n2003 Medicare Advantage plan. The House bill would gut the Medicare \nAdvantage program. It would take these choices away from our \nbeneficiaries. The Senate SCHIP bill avoids this.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember why we decided to give Medicare \nbeneficiaries a choice of health plans. I urge my colleagues to reject \nefforts to cut Medicare Advantage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, let me ask, through the Chair, the \nmanager of the previous bill, is he finished with what he would like to \ndo this evening? If I could ask the Senator from Iowa, does he need any \nmore time on the subject he has been talking about? I will be glad to \nwait.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No. I am going home.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Congratulations.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for listening to me.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10764-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10764-S10772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this evening the Senate unanimously \npassed a piece of legislation which we call the America COMPETES Act. \nEarlier today, the House of Representatives passed it by a vote of 367 \nto 57. So anyone watching the work of the U.S. Congress must think: \nWell, that must either be not very important or not very hard to do.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. I would suggest that the \nAmerica COMPETES Act will be as important as any piece of legislation \nthe Congress passes in this session, and it has taken as much work as \nany piece of legislation that has been passed in this session.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes acknowledging the work and \ndescribing the importance of the bill, but I think the first thing to \ndo is to say actually what the bill does. The point of the America \nCOMPETES Act is very simple. It helps America keep its brainpower \nadvantage so we can keep our jobs from going overseas to China and \nIndia and other countries.\n  The Presiding Officer is from a State that has benefitted greatly \nfrom America's brainpower advantage. There is a great deal of higher \neducation and research in his State, and, as a result of that, a number \nof jobs. I have been in the Edison Museum in New Jersey, which is a \ngood reminder of exactly what we are talking about.\n  Thomas Edison used to say he failed 10,000 times until he succeeded \nonce. That one success was the lightbulb, and then a number of other \ninventions, which created millions of jobs in the United States.\n  The United States, this year, is producing about a third of all the \nmoney in the world. The International Monetary Fund says that almost 30 \npercent of all the wealth in the world is produced in our country, \nmeasured in terms of gross domestic product, for just 5 percent of the \nworld's population. That is how many Americans there are.\n  So imagine if you are living in China or India or Ireland or any \ncountry in the world, and you are looking at the United States. It is \nnot so hard to look at other countries today with the Internet and \ntravel and television the way they are. Someone in one of those \ncountries could say: How can those Americans be producing 30 percent of \nall the wealth for themselves when they are only 5 percent of the \nworld's population? They have the same brains everybody else does. They \ncannot work any harder than anybody else does.\n  What is it? There are a variety of advantages we have in this \ncountry. But most people who look at this country, since World War II, \nbelieve our standard of living, our family incomes, our great wealth \ncomes primarily from our technological advances, from the fact that it \nhas been in this country that the automobile, the electric lightbulb, \nthe television set, the Internet, Google have been invented. Or the \npharmaceutical drugs that help cure disease all over the world, they \nalso have come mostly from this country.\n  It is that innovation that has given us our standard of living and \ngiven the rest of the world a high standard of living. That brainpower \nadvantage we have is located in some pretty obvious places. One place, \nof course, is our system of higher education, the great university \nsystem. We not only have many of the best universities in the world, we \nhave almost all of them. Another place is in the great National \nLaboratories, from Oak Ridge National Laboratory to Los Alamos and \nacross our country.\n\n  Another is in the great corporations of America where research is \ndone whether it is in pharmaceuticals or whether it is in agriculture. \nThose great engines of research and innovation and the entrepreneurial \nspirit and free market that we have have given us this great advantage.\n  We, therefore, talk a lot about progrowth policies. What causes our \neconomy to grow? We, on this side--we Republicans--talk a lot about low \ntaxes. I believe that is important and vote that way. When I was \nGovernor of Tennessee, we had the lowest tax rates in the country. But \nI found very quickly that low taxes by themselves do not create a high \nstandard of living because we had the lowest taxes in our State but we \nalso were the third poorest State. I also found that better schools and \nbetter research were the keys to better jobs. That is what this bill is \nabout. So as a result of the America COMPETES Act, over the next few \nyears, we will have done something pretty remarkable.\n  We asked the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of \nEngineering, the Institute of Medicine, as well as other business \nleaders in our country, exactly what it would take to keep our \nbrainpower advantage, and they have told us, and tonight we have done \nit. All that has to happen now is for the President of the United \nStates to sign it, and I feel confident he will.\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nI hope what he does is sign it and take credit for a lot of it, because \nin his State of the Union Address President Bush emphasized the \nimportance of this and talked about his American Competitiveness \nInitiative 2 years ago.\n  But this is what we have done. We have authorized the spending, over \nthe next 3 years, of $43 billion to help keep our brainpower advantage \nby investing in science and technology. Most of that--and this was a \npart of the President's recommendation--helps to grow research at our \nmajor scientific laboratories and Departments by doubling their \nresearch budgets over a 7-year term. That would be the National Science \nFoundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the \nDepartment of Energy Office of Science, which among other things, \nsupervises the great National Laboratories in our country.\n  As I said, the act authorizes a total of $43.3 billion, over the next \n3 fiscal years, for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \nresearch and education programs across the Federal Government. It will \nhelp to prepare thousands of new teachers and provide current teachers \nwith content and teaching skills in their area of education. It will \nestablish an advanced research projects agency for energy--a nimble and \nsemi-autonomous research agency at the Department of Energy--to engage \nin high-risk, high-reward energy research. This is modeled after what \nwe call DARPA at the Department of Defense which produced stealth \ntechnology and the Internet. Perhaps we can do the same as we look for \nnew energy technologies.\n  It expands programs at the National Science Foundation to enhance the \nundergraduate education of our future science and engineering \nworkforce, including at our community colleges. There are many \nprovisions in the bill to broaden participation in science and \nengineering fields at all levels.\n  There are new competitive grant programs to enable partnerships to \nimplement courses of study in math, science, engineering, technology, \nand critical foreign languages. There are competitive grants to \nincrease the number of math and science teachers serving high-need \nschools. The bill expands access to advanced placement courses and \ninternational baccalaureate courses by increasing the number of \nqualified teachers in high-need schools. In other words, in plain \nEnglish, it will help more children, including those who come from \nfamilies with less money, have a chance to take the advanced placement \ncourses that will give them a route into college, high achievement, and \nthe ability to produce jobs not just for themselves but for the rest of \nus.\n  It expands early-career research grant programs. It strengthens \ninteragency planning for research infrastructure. It does all of this.\n  Now, one might say: Where did all these ideas come from? Did the \nSenator from New Jersey just wander in one day and say, ``I have a \ngreat idea. Let's stick it in''? Or did the Senator from Arkansas say, \n``Well, we have a little program over at Little Rock that we all like, \nso let's have some money for it''? Or did the Senator from Tennessee \nsay, ``I was down at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory yesterday, and \nsomeone gave me an idea, so let's have $10 million for that''?\n  That is not the way we did it. What we did is, 2 years ago, Senator \nBingaman and I, and Representatives Bart Gordon and Sherwood Boehlert \nof the House of Representatives--two Democrats and two Republicans--we \nliterally went to the National Academy of Sciences and we asked this \nquestion: Tell us exactly what we need to do to keep our brainpower \nadvantage, to keep our jobs from going to China and India? And they \ntook us seriously.\n  The National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of \nEngineering and the Institute of Medicine appointed a distinguished \ncommittee of 21 Americans chaired by Norm Augustine, the former \nChairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin and a member of the National \nAcademy of Engineering. On that committee were some of America's most \ndistinguished business leaders, three Nobel laureates, the president \nemeritus of MIT, teachers, and others, who gave up their summer, \nreviewed hundreds of proposals, and, in priority order, told us the 20 \nthings we needed to do to keep our brainpower advantage.\n  All of that was presented to us in a booklet called ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm,'' which is now well-known at universities, in \nschools, and in the business community as a wakeup call for the United \nStates of America. It says we have been good--in fact, we have been way \nahead of the rest of the line--but if we do not watch out, China, \nIndia, Ireland, England, and many of the other countries in the world, \nare going to catch up with us because there is no preordained right for \nAmericans--no matter how bright we think we might be--to produce 30 \npercent of the world's wealth for just 5 percent of the people. Other \npeople can do the very same thing in their colleges and universities, \nif they wish.\n  The members of this commission had countless stories to tell that \nevery American who confronts these issues will find. Every Senator who \ntravels to China sees they have recruited a distinguished professor of \nChinese descent at an Ivy League university to come home and help \nimprove a Chinese university. That is happening all over the world, and \nit is creating a much more competitive environment.\n  Last summer, Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens led a delegation of \nSenators to China. We were very well received because Senator Stevens \nwas the first to fly a cargo plane into Beijing in 1944 at the end of \nWorld War II. He was flying with the Flying Tigers. Senator Inouye, of \ncourse, was a Congressional Medal of Honor winner in World War II. The \nChinese remember well their affection for Americans in that war. So we \nwere treated well and got to see President Hu, and the No. 2 man, Mr. \nWu, the Chairman of the National People's Congress, for an hour each. \nThese were interviews that many American delegations had not had \nbefore.\n\n  What was interesting to me was that in those sessions with the No. 1 \nand No. 2 man in China, where our conversations ranged from Iraq to \nIran to North Korea to Taiwan, all the issues one might expect, the \nissue that animated the leaders of China the most was their efforts \nover the next 15 years to create an innovation economy. They wanted to \ntalk about how China caught up with America's brain power advantage \nbecause they know their skills, they know they are good, they know they \ncan do it and they did it in their way.\n  The month before, President Hu had walked over to the Great Hall of \nthe People and assembled their National Academies of Science and \nEngineering and said: We are going on a 15-year innovation plan. We are \ngoing to invest 4 percent of our gross domestic product in research and \ntechnology. We are going to improve our colleges and our universities \nand our schools. We are going to create a brain power advantage for \nChina that gives us a higher standard of living. They understand that.\n  We did it a little different way. Two years ago, we walked down to \nour National Academy of Sciences. We invited them to give us this \nreport, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm''. We took the \nrecommendations of the Council on Competitiveness which was already \nworking. The President of the United States gave his recommendations in \nhis American Competitiveness Initiative. And then we went to work in \nthe American way. We don't announce 15-year plans here; our way is a \nlittle messier. So we had to go through three committees here in the \nSenate and two in the House of Representatives.\n  I have to thank the senior Members of this body for the attitude they \ntook toward this. For example, Senators Stevens and Inouye, Senators \nKennedy and Enzi, Senators Domenici and Bingaman, Democrats and \nRepublicans who put aside 3,000 years of seniority and 200 \njurisdictional prerogatives and said: Let's just work together and see \nif we can get this done across party lines. That is not very \ninteresting to people across the country, all this inside baseball \nabout how the Senate works. But it has to work in order for something \nsuch as this to happen.\n  It is not a simple thing to take the recommendations of the National \nAcademy of Sciences and actually do them in both bodies, and yet that \nis what we have done. Not only did we start 2 years ago, when this was \na Republican Congress, but we passed this legislation during a \nDemocratic Congress almost without missing a step.\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\nWhat happened was a bill that was sponsored by the leaders--last time \nit was Frist and Reid; now it is Reid and McConnell. They just changed \nthe names because we had worked so well together--not only with \nourselves but also with the Bush administration--that it was hard to \ntell whose bill it was.\n  At one time, this legislation that Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman first introduced had 35 Republican cosponsors and 35 \nDemocratic cosponsors, and the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, when \nshe was the Democratic leader, was one of the first out to support it. \nIt is especially gratifying to me that Tennesseans, if I may say so, \nhave taken such a role in it in the House of Representatives. \nRepresentative Bart Gordon, who is now chairman of the Science \nCommittee, was the lead conferee on this piece of legislation. \nRepresentative Zach Wamp, who represents the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory, gave I thought the best speech on the House floor today on \nthe Republican side. So again, it was bipartisan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks an overview of the conference report we \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I mentioned a number of the Senators who had been so \ndeeply involved in this. I mentioned the committee chairmen and the \nranking members. But I would like to especially acknowledge the work of \nSenator John Ensign of Nevada, who was especially effective in \nreminding Republicans that investments in research and technology and \nscience is as pro-growth as tax cuts. Senator Ensign was powerful on \nthat subject. I believe it as strongly as he does. I believe he was \nmore effective than I was. Senator Hutchison had been working with \nSenator Bingaman for years on advanced placement courses. Senator \nMikulski was out front from the very beginning on this. There is an \nenormous list of Senators who made this happen.\n  There is also a long list of Democratic and Republican staff members \nwho deserve thanks. The list is too long for me to read all those names \ntonight, but I ask unanimous consent that this list of staff members be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks, with the thanks of all of \nus for their work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to especially thank Matt Sonnesyn who is \nsitting here beside me. When I was permitted to be on the faculty of \nthe Kennedy School of Government at Harvard at the time when the \nSenator from Arkansas's father was the Director of the Institute of \nPolitics, Matt Sonnesyn was my course assistant. He came with me to my \ncampaign, and then he came with me to the Senate. For the last 2 years, \nhe has worked on this legislation with Senator Bingaman's staff and \nSenator Ensign's staff on this side--a tremendously effective staff \ngroup who has made this bill possible.\n  I see the Senator from Arkansas here, and I know he is going to close \nout in a few minutes, and I think I am coming toward the end of my \nremarks.\n  I would like to conclude by emphasizing two points--one about \nsubstance and one about process. I know the Senator from Arkansas and I \nhave talked about this often. We are working together right now on a \nbipartisan project that has to do with the Iraq war. We believe there \nshouldn't be any partisan votes on the Iraq war. For example, we, \nSenator Salazar and I, are joined by 6 Republicans and 7 Democrats in \ncosponsoring legislation that would make the bipartisan Iraq Study \nGroup the law of our country. If the Congress and the President would \nagree on this bill, we could send to our enemy and our troops and the \nworld the message that as we go forward to wherever we go next in Iraq, \nwe go together; we are united.\n  Each Tuesday we have a breakfast that Senator Lieberman and I host--\nno staff, no media, no policy positions adopted--so that in the midst \nof all our team meetings among Republicans and Democrats, when we talk \nabout what to do to each other, we can have a session where we build \nrelationships and talk about how we move the country ahead. We have had \nas many as 40 Senators at those breakfasts.\n  It is important for the people of this country to know that we spend \na lot of time working that way. We did tonight on the Children's Health \nInsurance bill with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley working \ntogether in a bipartisan way. For 2 years, we have done that on \nlegislation that goes straight to the heart of how we keep our jobs \nfrom going to China and India, which is what we passed tonight.\n  So the word I wish to say about process is that when the Senate tries \nand when we focus on big issues, we are perfectly capable of acting the \nway the rest of the country would hope we would act. We compromise on \nour differences and come up with a result that benefits family after \nfamily.\n  This legislation, the America COMPETES Act, will mean, for example, \nin my home State of Tennessee, opportunities for hundreds of math and \nscience teachers and for thousands of students to go to summer \nacademies and institutes of math and science. It will mean \nopportunities for thousands of students who now can't afford to take \nadvanced placement courses in science and technology to be able to do \nso and for hundreds of teachers who aren't trained to teach those \ncourses to have that training.\n  It will mean distinguished scientists will hold joint appointments at \nthe University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for \nexample. It will mean support for a residential high school for science \nand math, which we have wanted to do in our State ever since I was \nGovernor 20 years ago but didn't feel like we had the money. Now other \nStates have it, and this bill provides some support for such a school.\n  It will mean a steady growth over 7 years in research funding, new \nsupport for early-career research grants in science and technology, and \nmore support for all those kinds of studies that create the jobs that \nwill keep our standard of living. That is what it means for my State. \nIt means the same for New Jersey, and it means the same for Arkansas. \nSo that bipartisan consensus we have seen here happens more often than \nmost Americans know, but it doesn't happen as often as it should.\n  So this has been a privilege for me to work, especially with Senator \nBingaman and Senator Domenici on the committee that I was a part of, to \nhelp get this started with Bart Gordon, my colleague from the House, \nthe Democratic Congressman who is chairman of the Science Committee, \nand with all the other Senators. This is the kind of thing I hoped to \ndo when I came to the Senate. I think each of us hopes when we come \nhere to get up every day and do a little something constructive and \nthen go home at night and come back the next day and see if we can find \nsomething more to do along that way. If all of us participate in that \nway in other big issues, as we have in this, the America COMPETES bill, \nthe Senate will be a stronger institution and the country will be a \nbetter country.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their support and for the time tonight. \nI thank the Senator from Arkansas for staying late so I can make these \nremarks. This legislation, the America COMPETES Act which passed the \nHouse today overwhelmingly and passed the Senate unanimously, is at \nleast as important as any piece of legislation that passes in these 2 \nyears because we have accepted the advice of the wisest men and women \nin our country about what we ought to do to keep our brain power \nadvantage so we can keep our jobs.\n  The President has done a big part of it. I am sure he will sign it. I \nhope he takes some credit because he deserves it. There is plenty of \ncredit to go around. I think the country will be glad we acted.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Overview of the Conference Report on H.R. 2272, the America Creating \n    Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, \n                 Education, and Science Act (COMPETES)\n\n       Earlier this year, both the U.S. House and Senate passed \n     comprehensive legislation (H.R. 2272, S. 761) to ensure our \n     nation's competitive position in the world through \n     improvements to math and science education and a strong \n     commitment to research.\n       The Conference Agreement follows through on a commitment to \n     ensure U.S. students,\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\n     teachers, businesses and workers are prepared to continue \n     leading the world in innovation, research and technology--\n     well into the future.\n       In summary, the Conference Agreement:\n       Keeps research programs at National Science Foundation \n     (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n     (NIST) and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science \n     on a near-term doubling path;\n       Authorizes a total of $43.3 billion over fiscal years 2008-\n     2010 for science, technology, engineering and mathematics \n     (STEM) research and education programs across the federal \n     government;\n       Helps to prepare thousands of new teachers and provide \n     current teachers with content and teaching skills in their \n     area of education through NSF's Noyce Teacher Scholarship \n     Program and Math and Science Partnerships Program;\n       Creates the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) at NIST \n     (replacing the existing Advanced Technology Program or ATP) \n     to fund high-risk, high-reward, pre-competitive technology \n     development with high potential for public benefit;\n       Establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy \n     (ARPA-E), a nimble and semiautonomous research agency at the \n     Department of Energy to engage in high-risk, high reward \n     energy research;\n       Expands programs at NSF to enhance the undergraduate \n     education of the future science and engineering workforce, \n     including at 2-year colleges;\n       Includes provisions throughout the bill to help broaden \n     participation in science and engineering fields at all \n     levels;\n       Authorizes two new competitive grant programs that will \n     enable partnerships to implement courses of study in \n     mathematics, science, engineering, technology or critical \n     foreign languages in ways that lead to a baccalaureate degree \n     with concurrent teacher certification;\n       Authorizes competitive grants to increase the number of \n     teachers serving high-need schools and expand access to AP \n     and IB classes and to increase the number of qualified AP and \n     IB teachers in high-need schools;\n       Expands early career grant programs and provides additional \n     support for outstanding young investigators at both NSF and \n     DOE; and\n       Strengthens interagency planning and coordination for \n     research infrastructure and information technology (i.e. \n     high-speed computing).\n       Following are more detailed summaries of the conference \n     agreement's eight titles:\n\n\nTITLE I--Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)/Government Wide \n                                Science\n\n       The conference agreement directs the President to convene a \n     National Science and Technology Summit to examine the health \n     and direction of the U.S. STEM enterprises; requires a \n     National Academy of Sciences study on barriers to innovation; \n     changes the National Technology Medal to the National \n     Technology and Innovation Medal; establishes a President's \n     Council on Innovation and Competitiveness (akin to the \n     President's Council on Science and Technology); requires \n     prioritization of planning for major research facilities and \n     instrumentation nationwide through the National Science \n     and Technology Council; and expresses a sense of Congress \n     that each federal research agency should support and \n     promote innovation through funding for high-risk, high-\n     reward research.\n\n\n        TITLE II--National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n       The conference agreement establishes the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a full \n     participant in all interagency activities to promote \n     competitiveness and innovation and to enhance science, \n     technology, engineering and mathematics education. The \n     agreement also affirms the importance of NASA's aeronautics \n     program to innovation and to the competitiveness of the \n     United States. It urges NASA to implement a program to \n     address aging workforce issues at NASA and to utilize NASA's \n     existing Undergraduate Student Research program to support \n     basic research by undergraduates on subjects of relevance to \n     NASA. Finally, the conference agreement expresses the sense \n     of Congress that the International Space Station (ISS) \n     National Laboratory offers unique opportunities for \n     educational activities and provides a unique resource for \n     research and development in science, technology, and \n     engineering which can enhance the global competitiveness of \n     the U.S.\n\n\n       TITLE III--National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\n       The conference agreement authorizes a total of $2.652 \n     billion over fiscal years 2008-2010 for NIST. This includes \n     funds for the NIST labs, for lab construction, the TIP \n     program, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) \n     Program: This funding level keeps the NIST labs on a path to \n     doubling in ten years.\n       The conference agreement funds the NIST Labs at $502.1 \n     million for FY08 and increases the funding by 8% per year \n     (10-year doubling), which result in $541.9 million in FY09 \n     and $584.8 million in FY10. The conferenqe agreement provides \n     $150.9 million in FY08 for lab construction. This funding is \n     reduced in each of the next two fiscal years, with funding \n     provided at $86.4 million in FY09 and $49.7 million FY10. \n     These out-year funding levels will allow the completion of \n     construction projects at NIST's Boulder, CO and Gaithersburg, \n     MD facilities. The MEP program is funded at $110 million in \n     FY08, $122 million in FY09 and $131.8 million FY10.\n       The conference agreement creates a new initiative, the \n     Technology Innovation Program (TIP) which is based on the \n     proven success of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), but \n     better reflects global innovation competition by funding \n     high-risk, high-reward, pre-competitive technology \n     develoment, focusing on small- and medium-sized companies. \n     The TIP allows for greater industry input in the operation of \n     the program, allows university participation for the first \n     time, and firmly focuses the program on small- and medium-\n     sized high-tech firms.\n       TIP will replace ATP and bridge the funding gap between the \n     research lab and the marketplace. The conference agreement \n     provides an authorization of $100 million FY08, $131.5 \n     million FY09 nd $140.5 million in FY10. These funding levels \n     will allow for a viable program, with approximately $40 \n     million per year for new awards.\n       The agreement includes language to clarify that the focus \n     of TIP is to support, promote and accelerate innovation in \n     the U.S. through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of \n     critical national need. It specifies that large companies may \n     not receive any TIP funding.\n       Further, it provides a list of award criteria to ensure \n     that the proposed technology has a strong potential to \n     address critical national needs through transforming the \n     nation's capacity to deal with major societal challenges that \n     are not currently being addressed; that the applicant \n     provides evidence that the research will not be conducted \n     within a reasonable time period without TIP assistance; that \n     reasonable efforts were made by the applicant to secure \n     funding from alternative sources and that no other \n     alternative funding sources were reasonably available; and \n     that other entities have not already developed, \n     commercialized, marketed, distributed or sold similar \n     technologies. In addition, the NIST Director shall issue an \n     annual report on the program's activities. TIP may accept \n     funds from other federal agencies, and these funds will be \n     included as part of the federal cost share of any TIP \n     project.\n\n\n       TITLE IV--National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n       The conference agreement establishes a coordinated ocean, \n     Great Lakes, coastal and atmospheric research and development \n     program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration NOAA) in consultation with NSF and NASA. In \n     addition, NOAA is required to build upon existing educational \n     programs and activities to enhance public awareness and \n     understanding of the ocean, Great Lakes, and atmospheric \n     science. As a result, a science education plan is to be \n     developed that would set forth the goals and strategies for \n     NOAA, and be reevaluated and updated every 5 years. NOAA \n     would also be recognized for their historic contributions to \n     the innovation and competitiveness of this country, as well \n     as be recognized as a full participant in interagency efforts \n     to promote innovation and competitiveness.\n\n\n                     TITLE V--Department of Energy\n\n       The conference agreement provides nearly $17 billion to \n     Department of Energy (DOE) programs over fiscal years 2008-\n     2010, keeping Office of Science on a seven-year doubling path \n     and establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency for \n     Energy, or ARPA-E.\n       ARPA-E will address long-term and high-risk technological \n     barriers in energy through collaborative research and \n     development that private industry or the DOE are not likely \n     to undertake alone. Because of its autonomy within DOE, and \n     the flexibility and resources afforded to its technical \n     personnel, ARPA-E is structured to respond very quickly to \n     energy research challenges, as well as terminate or \n     restructure programs just as quickly. A fund is established \n     in the U.S. Treasury separate and distinct from DOE \n     appropriations, as will be the budget request for ARPA-E. \n     With this separate fund, ARPA-E will be independent of the \n     DOE bureaucracy, and likewise should not operate at the \n     expense of other programs at DOE, particularly the Office of \n     Science. The conference agreement authorizes $300,000,000 in \n     FY 2008, and such sums as are necessary thereafter for fiscal \n     years 2009 and 2010.\n       As the nation's largest supporter of the physical sciences, \n     the DOE Office of Science funds basic research and world-\n     class facilities that play an integral role in the effort to \n     maintain the technological competitiveness of the U.S. The \n     conference agreement contains an authorization for the Office \n     of Science which extends the 7 year doubling track prescribed \n     in Energy Policy Act of 2005 by authorizing Fiscal Year 2010 \n     at a funding level of $5.8 billion.\n       The conference agreement provides $150 million for K-12 \n     science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) \n     education programs that capitalize on the unique scientific \n     and engineering resources of the national laboratories. These \n     programs include a pilot program of grants to states to help \n     establish or expand statewide specialty high schools in STEM \n     education; a program to provide internship opportunities for \n     middle and high-school students at the national labs, with \n     priority given to students from high-needs schools; a program \n     at each national lab to help establish a Center of Excellence \n     in STEM education in at least one high-need public secondary \n     school in each lab region in order to develop and disseminate \n     best practices in STEM education; and\n\n[[Page S10768]]\n\n     a program to establish or expand summer institutes at the \n     national labs and partner universities in order to improve \n     the STEM content knowledge of K-12 teachers throughout the \n     country.\n       All of these programs would be coordinated by a newly \n     appointed Director for STEM Education at the Department, who \n     would also serve as an interagency liaison for K-12 STEM \n     education. In keeping with ongoing efforts to improve \n     coordination and evaluation of K-12 STEM education programs \n     across the federal government, all of the programs authorized \n     in this conference agreement require evaluation and reporting \n     of program impact.\n       In addition, the conference agreement highlights the \n     critical role of young investigators working in areas \n     relevant to the mission of DOE by establishing an early \n     career grant program for scientists at both universities and \n     the national labs; and a graduate research fellowship program \n     for outstanding graduate students in these fields. The \n     agreement also brings attention to research and education \n     needs in the nuclear sciences and hydrocarbon systems \n     sciences by establishing programs of grants to Universities \n     to establish or expand degree programs in these areas.\n       Finally, the conference agreement helps DOE recruit \n     distinguished scientists to the national labs and foster \n     collaboration between universities and the labs by providing \n     competitive grants to support joint appointments between the \n     two.\n\n\n                   TITLE VI--Department of Education\n\n       To enhance teacher education in the STEM fields and \n     critical foreign languages, the conference agreement \n     authorizes two new competitive grant programs. The programs \n     will specifically enable partnerships to implement courses of \n     study in STEM fields and critical foreign language that lead \n     to a baccalaureate degree with concurrent teacher \n     certification and at the graduate level the conference \n     agreement implements 2- or 3-year part-time master's degree \n     programs in these areas for current teachers to improve their \n     content knowledge and pedagogical skills. The conference bill \n     authorizes $151,200,000 for the baccalaureate degree program \n     and $125,000,000 for the master's degree program for fiscal \n     year 2008 and the two succeeding fiscal years.\n       The conference agreement authorizes competitive grants to \n     increase the number of highly qualified teachers serving \n     high-need schools and expand access to AP and IB classes; as \n     well as authorize the Secretary of Education to contract with \n     the National Academy of Sciences to convene a national panel \n     within a year after the enactment of this Act to identify \n     promising practices in the teaching of science, technology, \n     engineering and mathematics in elementary and secondary \n     schools. It also authorizes appropriations of $65,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2008 and such sums as may be necessary for each \n     of the two succeeding fiscal years.\n       The conference agreement authorizes new grant programs to \n     enhance math education in elementary and middle school \n     mathematics and provides grants to support the following \n     activities to assist states to implement programs for \n     secondary schools and in addition to other best practices and \n     in-service training, the bill provides targeted help to low-\n     income students who are struggling with mathematics. The \n     conference agreement also authorizes a competitive grant \n     program to increase the number of students studying critical \n     foreign languages, starting in elementary school and \n     continuing through postsecondary education programs.\n       The Secretary of Education is authorized to award \n     competitive grants to states to promote better alignment of \n     elementary and secondary education with the knowledge and \n     skills needed to succeed in academic credit-bearing \n     coursework in institutions of higher education, in the 21st \n     century workforce and in the Armed Forces. The Secretary is \n     also authorized to award grants of $50,000 to three \n     elementary and three secondary schools, with a high \n     concentration of low-income students in each state, whose \n     students demonstrate the largest improvement in mathematics \n     and science.\n\n\n                 TITLE VII--National Science Foundation\n\n       The conference agreement provides $22 billion to the \n     National Science Foundation (NSF) over fiscal years 2008-\n     2010, putting it on a path to double in approximately 7 \n     years. Particularly strong increases are provided in fiscal \n     year 2008 for K-12 STEM education programs at NSF. These \n     programs, including the Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and \n     the Math and Science Partnerships program will help to \n     prepare thousands of new STEM teachers and provide current \n     teachers with content and pedagogical expertise in their area \n     of teaching.\n       In addition to providing increased support for programs \n     that address the earliest stages of the STEM workforce \n     pipeline, the conference report will help create thousands of \n     new STEM college grduates, including 2-year college \n     graduates, through increased support for the STEM talent \n     expansion (STEP) program and the Advanced Technological \n     Education (ATE) program.\n       For those STEM graduates who continue on the path toward \n     academic careers, the conferece agreement provides critical \n     support for young, innovative researchers by expanding the \n     graduate research fellowships (GRF) and integrative graduate \n     education and research traineeship (IGERT) programs, \n     strengthening the early career grants (CAREER) program, and \n     creating a new pilot program of seed grants for outstanding \n     new investigators. Such programs have an additional benefit \n     of helping to stimulate high-risk, high-reward research by \n     identifying and taking a chance on the best and brightest \n     young minds.\n       Finally, the conference agreement includes provisions \n     throughout the bill to help broaden participation in STEM \n     fields at all levels, from kindergarten students through \n     academic researchers. These include several programs of \n     outreach and mentoring for women and minorities, a request \n     for a National Academy of Sciences report to identify \n     barriers to and opportunities for increasing the number of \n     underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, and an emphasis \n     on inclusion of students and teachers from high-needs \n     schools.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                     TITLE VIII--General Provisions\n\n       The conference agreement includes several general \n     provisions related to the purposes of the legislation, but \n     unrelated to any of the agencies above.\n       Specifically, the agreement requires the Secretary of \n     Commerce report to Congress on the feasibility, cost and \n     potential benefits of establishing a program to collect and \n     study data on export and import of services; expresses a \n     Sense of the Senate that the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n     should promulgate final regulations implementing the section \n     of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are designed to reduce burdens \n     on small businesses; directs the Government Accountability \n     Office, after three years, to assess a representative sample \n     of programs under this Act and make recommendations to ensure \n     their effectiveness; expresses a Sense of the Senate that \n     federal funds should not be provided to any organization or \n     entity that advocates against a U.S. tax policy that is \n     internationally competitive; directs a National Academy of \n     Sciences study on the mechanisms and supports needed for an \n     institution of higher education or non-profit organization to \n     develop and maintain a program to provide free access to on-\n     line educational content as part of a degree program, \n     especially in science, technology, engineering, mathematics \n     and foreign languages, without using federal funds; expresses \n     a Sense of the Senate that deemed exports should safeguard \n     U.S. national security and basic research and that the \n     President and the Congress should consider the \n     recommendations of the Deemed Exports Advisory Committee; and \n     lastly, expresses a Sense of the Senate that U.S. decision-\n     makers should take the necessary steps for the U.S. to \n     reclaim the preeminent position in the global financial \n     services marketplace.\n\n\n                       Democratic Staff to Thank\n\n       Jonathan Epstein (Bingaman).\n       Sam Fowler (Energy Committee).\n       Chan Lieu (Commerce).\n       Carmel Martin (HELP Committee).\n       Melanie Roberts (Bingaman).\n       Craig Robinson (Lieberman).\n       Roberto Rodriguez (HELP Committee).\n       Missy Rohrbach (HELP Committee).\n       Ilyse Schuman (HELP Committee).\n       Colleen Shogan (Lieberman).\n       Bob Simon (Energy).\n       Rachel Sotsky (Lieberman).\n       Jean Toal Eisen (Commerce).\n       Jason Unger (Reid).\n       Trudy Vincent (Bingaman).\n       Michael Yudin (Bingaman).\n\n\n                       republican staff to thank\n\n       Jeff Bingham (Commerce).\n       Adam Briddell (HELP Committee).\n       Beth Buehlmann (HELP Committee).\n       Kathryn Clay (Energy).\n       David Cleary (HELP Committee).\n       Ann Clough (HELP Committee).\n       Hugh Derr (Commerce).\n       Floyd DesChamps (Commerce).\n       Lindsay Hunsicker (HELP Committee).\n       Libby Jarvis (McConnell).\n       Christine Kurth (Commerce).\n       Jason Mulvihill (Commerce).\n       Sharon Soderstrum (McConnell).\n       Matt Sonnesyn (Alexander).\n       Jack Wells (Alexander).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our increasingly global economy is \ncreating numerous challenges for America's families nationwide. Across \nthe country, hardworking citizens are being left behind. The value of \ntheir wages is declining, their cost of living is going up, and many of \ntheir jobs are being shipped overseas.\n  As a result, the Nation is falling behind in the world economy. Study \nafter study tells us the answer is to invest more in education, \nresearch and innovation, if we hope to keep up with other countries \nwhose economies are soaring.\n  We know that a sound education is more important than ever for \ntoday's youth to succeed. Yet studies show, for example, that 15-year-\nold U.S. students score below average in math and science compared to \nthe youth of other industrial nations. In one study, our 15-year-olds \nranked only 24th in math. High school and college graduation rates are \nalso falling behind. Our college graduation rate today has now dropped \nbelow the average graduation rate for OECD countries.\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\n  We know that Federal investments in research lead to medical, \nscientific, and technology breakthroughs. But these investments have \nbeen shrinking as a share of the economy. In real terms, government \nspending for research has been flat. Since 1975, we have dropped from \nthird to 15th in the production of scientists and engineers.\n  It is a serious problem and we can't just tinker at the margins. We \nhave a responsibility to our people, our economy, our security, and our \nNation to make the investments to achieve the progress we need in the \nyears ahead.\n  The America COMPETES Act is a step in the right direction. It will \nhelp put America back on track.\n  It invests in research by doubling the support for research at the \nDepartment of Energy and the National Science Foundation over the next \n7 years, and will increase funding for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology as well.\n  It invests in innovation by creating a President's Council on \nInnovation and Competitiveness to determine the most effective ways to \ncreate jobs and move our economy forward.\n  Above all, it will invest in education, especially in math and \nscience, engineering, and technology from the elementary school through \nhigh school and beyond, in order to attract more young people to pursue \ncareers in these fields in the years ahead.\n  The problem today is especially serious for our low-income and \nminority students. Teachers are the single most important factor in \nimproving student achievement and narrowing the achievement gap. One \nstudy found that having a high quality teacher for 5 years in a row can \nclose the average 7th grade achievement gap in math between lower \nincome and higher income children. Yet too often, low-income and \nminority students are taught by the least prepared, least experienced, \nand least qualified teachers. Math and science classes in high-poverty \nschools are much more likely to be taught by teachers who do not have a \ndegree in their field.\n  We know what we need to do, and this bill will help us do it. We must \nmake sure all students are getting the teachers they need and deserve \nin the subjects that matter most in the new economy.\n  This bill addresses the teacher challenge head on by taking strong \nsteps to ensure that all children have access to a high quality teacher \nwith strong content knowledge in math, science, engineering and \ntechnology--particularly in high need schools, where such teachers are \nneeded most.\n  The bill expands the Robert Noyce Teacher Program of the National \nScience Foundation, NSF, by creating a new NSF teaching fellows program \nto prepare accomplished math, science, technology and engineering \nprofessionals to teach in high need schools. It also creates a master \nteaching fellows program to leverage the talents of the best teachers \nto improve instruction in high need schools. Teaching fellows in the \nprogram will receive annual salary supplements of $10,000 a year in \nexchange for a commitment to teach for at least 4 years in a high need \nschool.\n  The bill also expands the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century \nProgram at NSF, which provides cutting-edge professional development \nprograms throughout the school year and during the summer for teachers \nin high-need schools.\n  In addition, the bill supports impressive new programs in colleges \nand universities to prepare math, science, technology, engineering and \nforeign language teachers. These programs will combine bachelor's \ndegrees with concurrent teacher certification in their subjects, and \nwill create master's degree programs for teachers to improve their \nknowledge in these subjects and to encourage math and science \nprofessionals to go into teaching.\n  Too often today, elementary and secondary school standards are not \naligned with the expectations of colleges and employers. In many cases, \nhigh school graduates are struggling to keep up in college and the \nworkplace. Remedial education and lost earning potential costs the \nNation $3.7 billion a year, because so many students are not adequately \nprepared for college when they leave high school.\n  Our bill will help States align their standards with the demands of \nthe 21st century workplace. Grants to States to create P-16 Councils \nwill bring the elementary and secondary schools, college, businesses, \nand the Armed Forces together to ensure that education standards are \nbetter aligned with the expectations of colleges, the workforce, and \nthe military. This alignment is essential if we hope to remain \ninternationally competitive. Support will also be available for new \ndata systems in states to track students' achievement and help them \ngraduate prepared to succeed.\n  The bill will help give students in low-income districts the same \nopportunities as those in wealthier districts to enroll and succeed in \ncollege preparatory classes by expanding access to advanced placement \nand international baccalaureate classes.\n  This bill invests as well in foreign language education, to ensure \nthat students are exposed to foreign languages and cultures. More than \n80 Federal agencies now use tens of thousands of employees with skills \nin 100 foreign languages, and our businesses need the same.\n  For students to become proficient in foreign languages, they need \nsustained study, beginning in the early grades. But only a third of \nstudents in grades 7 through 12 today and only 5 percent of elementary \nschool students study a foreign language. The bill provides grants to \ncolleges and local educational agencies to create partnerships for \nstudents from elementary school through college to study such \nlanguages.\n  Finally, the bill will encourage new interest in nuclear science. \nMassachusetts has long been a leader in this research. Of three dozen \nlicensed research reactors in the United States, three are located in \nMassachusetts universities The University of Massachusetts in Lowell, \nWorcester Polytechnic Institute, and MIT. These colleges will have an \nincreasingly important role as nuclear science expands, and our bill \nwill expand existing programs and establish new ones to meet the \ngrowing demand.\n  All of these programs and investments are designed to help prepare us \nto compete in the 21st century, but there is more we must do if we \nintend to keep our nation and our workforce truly competitive. \nSignificant new investments are needed to expand opportunities for \nhigher education. College is more important than ever today, but it is \nalso more expensive than ever. In the Senate 2 weeks ago, we passed the \nlargest increase in student aid since the G.I. bill, and I look forward \nto delivering that aid for low-income students as quickly as possible.\n  We must also address the increasingly demanding impact of the global \neconomy on American workers and their families. Our hard-working men \nand women deserve greater job security today and greater job \nopportunities in the future.\n  This bill puts first things first. Increased investments in \neducation, research, and innovation are indispensable to our success as \na nation. We have done it before and we must do it again. Let's begin \nwith this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President. I want to add my thanks and \ncongratulations to the conference leaders and the dedicated staff for \ncompleting the negotiations on the America Competes Act. This \nlegislation is an important investment in our Nation's strategy to \npromote competitiveness. It is a bipartisan package with broad support, \nbased on the National Academy of Sciences report known as The Gathering \nStorm. Many members deserve our thanks and praise, and the report is a \nstrong example that Congress can come together to develop comprehensive \npublic policy.\n  America Competes is a comprehensive package that includes major \nsections covering math and science research and education initiatives. \nI am particularly pleased and proud that the legislation will \nreauthorize the National Science Foundation, NSF, at $22 billion from \nfiscal 2008 to fiscal 2010, to support several grant programs intended \nto encourage more students to teach math and science, as well as grants \nfor college and graduate student science research. I have worked long \nand hard on programs within NSF. This bill supports the principle that \nthe Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR, \nincreases in proportion with the overall budget of NSF. Earlier this \nyear, I introduced a bipartisan bill, S. 753, the\n\n[[Page S10770]]\n\nEPSCoR Research and Competitiveness Act of 2007 which makes a similar \nrecommendation. In my view, if our country seeks to broadly promote \ncompetitiveness, every state needs to be part of the effort. The EPSCoR \nprogram helps enhance the competitiveness of the 24 States, including \nWest Virginia, that have historically not received as many NSF grants. \nThe NSF continues its strong, peer-reviewed, merit-based competitive \ngrants, but underserved States get support to achieve NSF's high \nstandards.\n  EPSCoR is an essential part of our national competitiveness strategy. \nOur country will not do as well if only half of our States are \ncompetitive. It is also important to recognize that the EPSCoR States \nare home to 20 percent of the population and 25 percent of doctoral and \nresearch universities. Our States host 18 percent of academic \nscientists and engineers, and their institutions train nearly 20 \npercent of science and engineering graduate students. Even more \ninteresting is the fact that 7 of the top 10 energy producing States \nare EPSCoR States. To be competitive, we must continue to invest in the \nEPSCoR program and our EPSCoR States for the long term. It is good for \nthe States, but it is also a fundamental building block for our \nnational policy. EPSCoR will enhance science and competitive which will \nhelp increase the number of scientists and engineers. It will encourage \ngood science projects in States with unique aspects such as energy \nresources, proximity to our oceans, and other helpful scientific \nresources.\n  Two other programs that received generous support in the final \npackage are the NSF's Math and Science Partnerships and the Noyce \nScholarships. Both initiatives were including in the 2001 \nreauthorization of the National Science Foundation. Having sponsored \nlegislation years ago to develop both programs, I am thrilled by \ncurrent success of the programs in training teachers and recruiting top \nmath and science majors into teaching. Expanding these programs will \nhelp improve math and science education which will be the cornerstone \nfor our future competitiveness. This is a good investment for the \nfuture of West Virginia, and our entire country.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the America \nCOMPETES Act. I applaud the bipartisan group that put together the \nAmerica COMPETES Act, an extraordinary bill that will provide \ninvaluable resources to ensure that the United States does not lose \nstep with our global competitors.\n  We live in a global marketplace and if our students are to compete \nwith students from around the world, they must have the benefit of a \nfirst rate math and science education taught by first rate math and \nscience teachers. This new program will vastly improve the chance that \nour high school students are taught math and science by the best and \nthe brightest.\n  That is why I am particularly proud of one provision that I authored \nthat has been included in this conference agreement. This provision \nwill establish a new program called the National Science Foundation \nTeaching Fellowship within the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship \nProgram. I wish to express my deep gratitude to Senators Kennedy, \nBingaman, Alexander and Enzi for including this important provision in \nthe bill. I would also like to thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nClinton, for her valuable support.\n  The provision creating the NSF Teaching Fellowship is modeled on a \nbill I introduced last Congress, the Math and Science Teaching Corps \nAct. The Math and Science Teaching Corps was in turn modeled after a \nhighly successful New York City program called Math for America.\n  Math for America's mission is to improve math education in our \nNation's public schools by recruiting top math and science college \ngraduates to become teachers and providing financial incentives to make \nthese jobs competitive with the graduates' other opportunities.\n  The program has made tremendous strides. Over 100 teachers teach in \nnearly 60 New York City public schools. By 2011 the program will \nsupport at least 440 teachers. I can only hope that the new NSF \nTeaching Fellowship will be so successful.\n  The NSF Teaching Fellowship program is about paving the way for the \nfuture. It will ensure that leaders in math and science train the next \ngeneration of innovators--instead of leaving the classroom for research \nor other jobs. This model program is working in New York City, and now, \nwith the America COMPETES legislation, it will be expanded to the rest \nof the country.\n  We need this program to reverse a dismal trend. Our students are not \ncurrently prepared to compete in a technology-intense economy. In the \n2003 PISA math assessment that compared 15-year-old students across the \nworld, American students ranked 24th out of the 29 participating \ncountries--here in the U.S., in math, 24th out of 29. How can we \ncompete when our students are falling behind?\n  A 2005 mathematics assessment of twelfth graders by the National \nAssessment of Education Progress found that 61 percent of high school \nseniors performed at or above the basic level, and 23 percent performed \nat or above the proficient level. For science, 54 percent of twelfth \ngraders scored at or above the basic level. Eighteen percent performed \nat or above the proficient level. This is unacceptable.\n  Students currently studying math and science will be the fuel that \npowers our economy for the next century, and we must give them every \nchance to achieve, excel and thrive. The NSF Teaching Fellowship is a \nsignificant step.\n  Inspirational and brilliant teachers will make an enormous \ndifference. To attract these role models, we need to level the playing \nfield, and ensure that these future teachers can afford to teach. Only \none-third of math teachers and less than two-thirds of science teachers \nmajored or minored in the subject they teach. It is not hard to \nunderstand why. Starting salaries for math and science majors can be as \nmuch as $20,000 higher in the private sector than they are for public \nschool teachers.\n  The NSF Teaching Fellowship will help reduce these barriers. The \nprogram's structure has a rigorous selection process and incentives \nbuilt in to improve retention. NSF teaching fellows will have to take a \ntest to prove their strengths in math or science. Then they enroll in a \n1-year master's degree program in teaching that will give them teaching \ncertification, and it is all paid for. They will agree to teach for at \nleast 4 years, and for those 4 years, they will receive bonuses on top \nof their salaries. These individuals will infuse our schools with a \ndeep passion for and an understanding of math and science and will \nshare their knowledge with other teachers in their school.\n  To retain our current teachers who are outstanding at what they do \nand can provide expertise in the classroom that our teaching fellows \nwon't yet have, there is another category called NSF master teaching \nfellows. Master fellows are current teachers who already have a \nmaster's degree in math or science education. They will also take a \ntest demonstrating they have a high level understanding of their \nsubject area. For the next 5 years they will serve as leaders in their \nschool, providing mentorship for other teachers in their department as \nwell as assisting with curriculum development and professional \ndevelopment. For these 5 years they also will receive bonuses on top of \ntheir salaries.\n  We all agree that every child deserves effective, high-quality \nprofessional teachers. And there are thousands of wonderful teachers in \nour country. But we need more. Without them, children will have \ndifficulty reaching the high standards we want them to achieve. The \nfederal government has long worked to ensure that all children have \nequal access to a quality education, no matter where they live. We must \nencourage and fund well-designed programs, such as the NSF Teaching \nFellowship to incite rapid improvement in the quality of the Nation's \nfuture teaching workforce.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this monumental bill, the America \nCOMPETES Act.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof supporting the conference report on the America COMPETES Act. This \nreport represents a unique bipartisan, bicameral collaboration among \nthree committees on the Senate side and our House counterparts to \nenhance American competitiveness in the 21st century global economy.\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\n  This conference report demonstrates that when we set partisan \npolitics aside and work together, we can do great things for the \nAmerican people. The core of this conference agreement is the Senate's \nAmerica COMPETES Act, which was the product of bipartisan negotiations \nand input from the Members of the Senate Commerce, Energy, and Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committees. Work on this legislation \nbegan last year in response to the National Academy of Sciences report \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which was chaired by Norman \nAugustine, the ``Innovate America'' report, and the President's \nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative. I want to thank all those who \nworked on this legislation for their hard work and dedication and \ncommend them for the collegial manner in which this bill was crafted.\n  The focus of the programs in this bill is where it should be: on the \nknowledge and skills the American people need to have to be successful \nin the 21st century global economy. I am pleased we were able to keep \neducation as one of the key priorities in this legislation. However, I \nhave said consistently from the beginning that I wanted to hold \nprograms to reasonable funding levels and to avoid duplication of \nprograms. I think we could have gone further toward reducing \nduplication and overlap of programs, but this bill represents a strong \nbipartisan, bicameral effort and moves us in the right direction.\n  Why is this important? This year marks 50 years since Sputnik was \nlaunched. That launch sparked huge turmoil in this country and worry \nabout the knowledge and skills necessary to keep our country safe and \nour economy growing and competitive. I was in junior high at the time. \nIt was a shock to our Nation. Every one of us could recognize it--\nteachers, parents, and, probably as important, students, recognized it. \nRussia was beating us. They had put a satellite into orbit. It was hard \nto accept that we were behind. But it also brought out that American \ncompetitive spirit. We said they were not going to beat us. It launched \na change in education such as we had not seen in the United States in \ndecades, maybe centuries.\n  We were ultimately the winners of the space race, but it wasn't just \na space race; it was an education race. It was the broad range of \neducation that the United States delved into and the innovation that \nwas brought about at the time that put us ahead of Russia.\n  Sputnik had a dramatic effect on our education system and made us \nrecognize that a high school diploma was no longer just a nice thing to \nhave. We could no longer rest on our past successes as a nation. We met \nthe challenge of Sputnik through the National Defense Education Act. We \nlooked to education as a path to continued success, and we supported an \nincrease in the number of people who would continue their education \nbeyond high school, particularly in science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics.\n  Today, we are again being challenged. In the 1950s, skilled jobs \ncomprised 20 percent of the U.S. job market. In 2000, 85 percent of all \nU.S. jobs were categorized as skilled. For millions of Americans, \naccess to an affordable college education is the key to their success \nin the 21st century global economy. The United States has one of the \nhighest college enrollment rates but college completion rate is average \nto below average among developed countries in the world. Four out of \nevery five jobs will require postsecondary education or the equivalent, \nyet only 52 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have achieved this \nlevel of education.\n  We have a huge challenge, not just in K-12 and higher education but \nin continuing education. It is estimated the average person leaving \ncollege will change careers 14 times. I didn't say ``change jobs'' 14 \ntimes, I said ``change careers'' 14 times. Of those 14 career changes, \n10 of them don't even exist now. That is the pace at which things are \naccelerating.\n  So we are educating people for a level of jobs that do not exist at \nthe present time. That is quite a challenge. Technology is demanding \nthat everybody continue to learn and gain skills to remain competitive \nin the workplace. Learning is never over; school is never out. Those \nwho do not get the knowledge and the capability to make the transfer to \nnew careers will be left behind. We do not want that to happen. \nEducation at all levels, including lifelong learning opportunities, is \nvital to ensuring that America retains its competitive edge in the \nglobal economy. Every American can and should be part of our Nation's \nsuccess.\n  Because higher education is the on-ramp to success in the global \neconomy, it is our responsibility to make sure everyone can access that \non-ramp and reach their goals. This bill includes provisions that \nimprove science, mathematics, and critical foreign language education \nin our Nation from elementary school through graduate school. It \nsupports improvements to teacher preparation, establishes stronger \nlinks between graduate schools and employers, provides funding to \nsupport students trained at the doctoral level in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, and enhances Federal programs that \nsupport students in graduate school.\n  The American system of higher education is renowned throughout the \nworld. I can attest to that after having gone to India. I saw how their \neducational system works and how it is becoming very competitive with \nthe United States. In India, only 7 percent of their children go on to \nhigher education. That creates a very high level of competition among \nstudents to get into higher education. Despite the rigorous emphasis on \nscience, mathematics, engineering and technology, however, India \ncontinues to send its graduate students to the United States because it \nis here that they learn creativity and innovation.\n  In most of the other countries around the world they learn the \nbasics, can do excellent calculations and have a vast amount of rote \nknowledge. But what our colleges specialize in is teaching people to \nthink, to come up with new ideas. To date, that is what has kept \nAmerica ahead. However, the success story of American higher education \nis at risk of losing the qualities that made it great, which are \ncompetition, innovation, and access for all, if we do not invest in \nthose core principles.\n  It is important to ensure that more students enroll in college \nprepared to learn and that more students have the support they need to \ncomplete college with the knowledge and skills to be successful. \nSlightly less than one-third--31 percent--of all public high school \nstudents are prepared for postsecondary education, as demonstrated by \nthe academic courses they pursue. Well-prepared and well-supported \nstudents are more likely to persist to a degree completion and obtain \nthe knowledge and skills they need.\n  If our students and workers are to have the best chance to succeed in \nlife and employers to remain competitive, we must ensure that everyone \nhas the opportunity to achieve academically and obtain the skills they \nneed to succeed, regardless of their background. To accomplish this, we \nneed to build, strengthen and maintain our educational pipeline, \nbeginning in elementary school. We must also strengthen programs that \nencourage and enable citizens of all ages to enroll in postsecondary \neducation institutions and obtain or improve their knowledge and \nskills. The decisions we make about education and workforce development \nwill have a dramatic impact on the economy and our society for \ngenerations to come.\n  The America COMPETES Act is a good starting point, but we need to do \nmore. Maintaining America's competitiveness requires that all students \nhave the opportunity to continue to build their knowledge and skills. \nWe need to find ways to encourage high school students to stay in \nschool and prepare for and enter high-skill fields such as math, \nscience, engineering, health, technology and critical foreign \nlanguages. For many, including those at the cutting-edge of science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, acquiring a postsecondary \neducation or training will be the key to their success.\n  Our Nation needs to make sure that every person has the opportunity \nto access quality education and training throughout their lives, which \nis why the America COMPETES bill is only the beginning. I remain \ncommitted to reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, the Head Start \nAct, and the Workforce Investment Act. In addition, we need to focus \nour efforts on taking\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\nwhat we have learned from 5 years of experience to improve the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. Together these laws form the path for success, so that \nevery American can have the knowledge and skills necessary to be \nsuccessful in the 21st century global economy, which is only going to \nbecome more competitive.\n  The call for education and skills training is loud and clear. \nIngenuity, knowledge, and skills are a beacon for jobs; therefore, we \nmust keep the beacon of innovation shining brightly on our shores. I \nask my colleagues to support passage of the conference report on the \nAmerica COMPETES Act and to work with me to move the companion \neducation and workforce bills through Congress this year.\n  Mr. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconference report on the America COMPETES Act, and I congratulate \nSenators Bingaman, Alexander, Domenici, Ensign, Kennedy, Enzi, Inouye, \nStevens, and Nelson and their staff for their tireless and dedicated \nwork to bring this vital and important legislation to final passage.\n  There is much in this legislation that will enable the United States \nto secure its leadership position in science, technology, engineering \nand mathematics education and enhancing our competitiveness and \ncapacity for innovation.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference report contains the \nlanguage I included in the original Senate bill, reported last year by \nthe Commerce Committee and eventually incorporated into S. 761, as \npassed by the Senate.\n  That provision directs that NASA be included in activities \ncollectively referred to as the American Competitiveness Initiative, or \nACI. This corrects what many of us believe was a serious oversight in \nthe original announcement of the ACI, which failed to recognize the \nlong-standing history of NASA's role in inspiring young people to \npursue academic and professional careers in science and engineering.\n  The report also contains new language recognizing the potential \ncontribution to education and competitiveness that can be made by the \nInternational Space Station National Laboratory and directs NASA to \ndevelop specific plans to realize that potential.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Bill Nelson, chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences, in drafting \nreauthorization legislation for NASA next year, in which we can provide \nmore specific authorization and guidance for NASA in fulfilling its \nimportant new role as part of the ACI.\n  This report also provides vital new authority to the Department of \nEnergy, the Department of Education, the National Institute for \nStandards and Technology, NOAA, and the National Science Foundation to \nenable them to address the pressing national needs in science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics education and enhancing the \nNation's competitiveness and innovation capabilities.\n  It is vital that the new provisions provided by this legislation are \nused as they are intended. This legislation includes generous new \nauthority for appropriations for the Departments of Energy and \nEducation and for NIST and the National Science Foundation. These \nadditional spending limits are not provided to enable them to continue \nto do business as usual at an increased level of spending.\n  My single concern about the conference report is the action taken by \nthe conference to modify section 7018. That provision, which was an \namendment I offered during the markup of S. 1280, the original Senate \nCommerce Committee portion of what became S. 761 and was preserved in \nthe conference chairman's mark considered in the conference, provided \nthat the National Science Foundation take into account the degree to \nwhich proposed research contributed to the needs of innovation, \ncompetitiveness, the physical and natural sciences, technology, \nengineering and mathematics. At the same time, that provision included \nlanguage--consistent with the recommendations of the report ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm''--that such prioritization not be used to \ninhibit investments in other important areas of research or scientific \nendeavor.\n  Despite that limitation, the conference adopted an amendment to that \nsection which, essentially, includes virtually all research conducted \nby the NSF in the prioritization, including research that may or may \nnot contribute to meeting the critical needs outlined in that report \nand which inspired the creation of this legislation. The awarding of \nsuch a ``blank check'' to NSF removes any assurance that the expanded \nauthority and resources provided through this legislation will actually \nbe used to carry out the purposes for which they have been granted.\n  While I am disappointed with this change, I am very much in favor of \nadopting the report. But as a member of the Commerce Subcommittee on \nScience and Innovation, and the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, I will closely follow \nhow the National Science Foundation implements the authority granted by \nthis legislation.\n  By passing this report, Congress will have taken an extremely \nimportant and significant step toward meeting what are clearly and \nwidely recognized as critical national needs. We cannot let that step \nbe compromised by allowing a business-as-usual approach by the \ndepartments and agencies we are tasking to meet those needs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \ncongratulating Senator Alexander of Tennessee for his hard work and his \ngreat legislative success on this piece of legislation which passed the \nSenate tonight. I will just remark, if I may, that once again he has \nproven himself to be an effective leader and a thoughtful legislator. \nHe is really the kind of Senators who is putting America first and \ntrying to get great things done. And, obviously, you can tell by his \nspeech that he is sharing credit with anybody and everybody.\n  We all know that it was Senator Lamar Alexander's hard work and \ndedication that made that legislation a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10772-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10772-S10773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUDGET INFERNO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take 10 minutes to talk \nabout a situation that is happening in the West. I thank my colleagues \nfor giving me that opportunity.\n  I spoke last week, and the background of my speech was this graph \ncalled a Budget Inferno. I was en route to Idaho to look at a fire \ncomplex known as the Murphy Fire Complex. That is now under control. In \nother words, a perimeter is around the fire. It happens to be 1,038 \nsquare miles of fire, nearly 700,000 acres, and $6.6 million spent. \nType 1 teams, 2 of them; 24 crews, 1,230 personnel; 120 engines, 5 \nhelicopters, 27 water tenders, and 10 dozers.\n  The firefighters who went in harm's way to work and stop this fire \nwere gallant and I honor them. As I speak, there are literally \nthousands of young men and women out on the fire line in Idaho and \nMontana and parts of Nevada and elsewhere standing in harm's way to \nstop raging wildfires that are devastating the West.\n  This was the largest fire Idaho has had in literally decades. It is \nnow the largest single fire this year in total acreage. Why did it \nhappen? Is there a reason? Was it simply the hot weather or are there \nother reasons that are creating these huge infernos of wildfire across \nthe West as we speak?\n  Last year, 10 million acres burned. This year, it appears we are on \nschedule to have an even greater fire season than we had last year. A \nmonth ago, I put a half a billion more dollars in the Interior \nappropriations budget to fight fire. My guess is when we get back in \nSeptember, I and others will be on the floor asking for supplemental \nspending to pay for more wildfire devastation.\n  The good news, in the great tragedy of the Murphy Fire, was that no \none was killed. There were four firefighters injured, there were \nhundreds of cattle burned up, hundreds of sheep, probably hundreds of \nwildlife that we simply do not know about.\n  But we have this huge area, some 600,000 acres that will be of no use \nto anyone, including cattle grazing, including wildlife, for a period \nof several years. It is totally burned out. I flew over it in a \nhelicopter with our Governor and Senator Crapo. None of us has ever \nexperienced anything like that. You fly for half an hour at 100-plus \nmiles an hour across a firescape, and all of it is black, the hilltops, \nthe valleys, no trees, nothing left.\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\n  Here is what happened a few years ago. Here is what is happening now \nin the West. We ought to be doing something about it. Two years ago, \nthere was a fire out there, 200,000 acres right in the same area. We \nrehabbed it. We grassed it, and the BLM said you cannot graze it for a \ncouple of years now. Cattle might damage it.\n  Then there was another fire last year, 60,000 acres right beside it. \nWe rehabbed it. We seeded it. You cannot graze it. At least that is \nwhat the scientists say. That is not what those who have lived out \nthere for a hundred years say. We left it alone and the fuel built up.\n  Then we had someone sue us to protect the sage grouse habitat and the \nslickspot peppergrass, and a judge ruled. So we stopped grazing on half \nof that area, and the fuel built up.\n  Now, we are in a fire scenario, with temperatures in the West that we \nhave never seen. So we had 3 weeks of 100-degree temperatures in the \nBoise Valley, and the dewpoint dropped to nearly zero. You know the \nrest of the story because I told you that story.\n  An unprecedented fuel buildup because a judge, and what I now call \necoterrorists, are destroying the landscape by not allowing reasonably \nmanaged, multiple-use approaches to our management. That is why the \nfire destroyed what it destroyed.\n  An unprecedented fuel loading is on the grasslands of our country. \nNow, because it is a little hotter, it is a little further into the \nsummer, our timberlands are starting to burn. They, too, are loaded \nwith fuel, and they will burn at unprecedented rates as they did last \nyear and the year before and the year before that.\n  Here we are spending billions of dollars and destroying millions of \nacres of wildlife, watershed, wildlife habitat, all of those things \ncombined. Our courts are saying: Get the people off the land, get the \nlivestock off the land, rule in the favor of single-use management, \nhere, there, and everywhere, tying the hands of our managers at the BLM \nand the Forest Service level, denying them the right to use their \nknowledge, use their scientific understanding for reasonable \nflexibility in the management we so desperately need.\n  That is the story of the Murphy Complex; that is the story of nearly \n700,000 acres of total destruction; $6.6 million, and by the time we \nare done rehabilitating it, it could go to nearly $8 million.\n  Is there something we can do about it? Well, there will be interest \ngroups who will rush back here, and in the name of the environment say \ndo nothing--in the name of the environment.\n  Please, let us do something. Because the habitat the judge and the \necoactivists argued for to save the sage grouse and the slickspot \npeppergrass is no longer there. The enemy, some were the cattle that \nwere grazing, they are no longer the enemy. The fire has become the \nenemy and that which they who ruled sought to save is now gone.\n  That story that I have related to you, whether it is played out in \nthe Murphy Complex in Idaho and Nevada, or whether it is in Northern \nCalifornia, or whether it was in the Tahoe Basin this year, or whether \nit is in Eastern Oregon, or whether it is in the mountains of Idaho, \nwill be played out and millions of acres will burn and billions of \ndollars will be spent and homes will be destroyed and we will say: Gee, \nI think we got a problem.\n  Congress will fail to respond and act to give our managers the \nflexibility, and we will continue to allow judges in the Ninth Circuit \nand environmental interests to game us and create these single, unique \nspecial kinds of management units that are impossible in any way to \nmanage.\n  I wanted to relate to you this story. The State BLM director, our \nGovernor, myself, and my colleague, Mike Crapo, flew over this \ndevastation. In the terms of a cowboy who has lived out there all his \nlife and his father before him and his father before him:\n\n       Senator, you ain't never seen anything like this one.\n\n  And, boy, we have not. The great tragedy is, more will come, and more \nis burning now. Several fires are burning in Idaho. We are already \nnearly over a million acres in my State alone. Yet our hands are tied \nby a bureaucracy that is strangled by court decision after court \ndecision because Congress will not act in the name of the environment.\n  We have been scared into environmentalism instead of good and \nreasonable management. We are allowing our courts and our activist \norganizations to create the wildfire which has become a budget inferno.\n  So the reason I give this speech now is because we have entered the \nfire season. August is our fire season. September is our fire season. \nMy guess is I will be returning as one of the members of the \nAppropriations Committee and the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nsaying: Please, my colleagues, could we have a couple billion more \ndollars to fight these fires? Because we are burning up out there, and \nthere is not much we seem to be able to do about it because we have \ndecided to allow public land management to be turned over to the \nactivists and the judges instead of the professionals.\n  Idaho burns tonight. Montana burns tonight. Nevada burns tonight, \nCalifornia, parts of Oregon, parts of Utah. I think it is important you \nhear this story and try to begin to understand that when we talk about \nbalance and flexibility, you help us get there so we do not have to \nspend our budget in a useless and irresponsible way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10773-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH S. RUNNER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a respected \nKentuckian, Mrs. Elizabeth S. Runner. On August 25, Mrs. Runner will \nturn 100 years old.\n  Mrs. Runner was born in Arkansas and moved to Warren County, KY, when \nshe was just an infant. Her early years were not without struggle. She \nlost her father at the age of five, and her mother died during the flu \nepidemic that swept across the country in the early part of the last \ncentury. She was raised by her maternal grandmother.\n  At an early age, Mrs. Runner recognized the importance of a good \neducation, and she pursued her passion for teaching. In 1925, she began \nher teaching career at Indian Creek, a one-room school in northern \nWarren County. She later transferred to the Richardsville School, where \nshe taught until 1965. Over the course of her 40-year teaching career, \nshe touched the lives of many Kentucky schoolchildren and their \nfamilies.\n  In addition to being a devoted teacher, Mrs. Runner is a wife, \nmother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She married J. Elvis Runner \non June 28, 1930, and they were happily married until his passing in \n1997. They raised two sons, Randall S. Runner and Phillip J. Runner. \nShe has one granddaughter, Karen Elizabeth Runner, and two great-\ngrandsons, Kory and Wren.\n  Mrs. Runner is a woman of faith and a founding member of the Rays \nBranch Church of Christ congregation. Kentuckians admire Mrs. Runner \nfor her dedication to teaching, her family, her faith and her zest for \nlife. I understand that Mrs. Runner's family and friends will gather on \nSunday, August 26, to celebrate and honor her reaching the rare and \nmarvelous milestone of a 100th birthday. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin sending Mrs. Runner well-wishes and congratulating her on her \ncentenarian status.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10773-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10773-S10774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICA'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in the wake of the terrible \ntragedy that began unfolding yesterday in the Twin Cities region of \nMinnesota.\n  As we all know by now, the bridge carrying Interstate 35W over the \nMississippi River near downtown Minneapolis abruptly collapsed during \nyesterday evening's rush hour. At least 50 vehicles plunged 60 feet \ninto the river. This morning, several people are confirmed dead, dozens \nof people are injured, and almost two dozen people remain missing. \nSadly, first responders expect the death toll to rise as search and \nrescue missions continue today in earnest.\n  I would like to extend my thoughts and prayers to Senator Coleman, \nSenator Klobuchar, and all those directly affected by this tragedy. The \npeople of Connecticut can sympathize with the people of Minnesota at a \ntime like this. Just over 24 years ago, a bridge carrying Interstate 95 \nover the Mianus River in Greenwich, CT, collapsed in the early \nafternoon. Four vehicles plunged into the river, three people\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\ndied, and three others sustained serious injuries. It remains the worst \ntransportation disaster in my State's history.\n  Today, the National Transportation Safety Board will begin \ninvestigating the bridge collapse in Minnesota. While it is too early \nto conclude what exactly caused the collapse, we do know that a \ncatastrophic structural failure of some sort occurred. We also know \nthat this truss bridge was constructed in 1967 and--according to an \ninterview on National Public Radio this morning--likely nearing the end \nof a 50-year operational lifetime.\n  The tragedy in Minnesota is the most recent example of our national \ninfrastructure crumbling before our very eyes. Indeed, this is not a \nproblem only affecting Minneapolis or Greenwich or--in the case of the \nrecent steam pipe eruption--New York City. It is a problem affecting \nevery State, county, city, and community between San Diego, CA, and \nBangor, ME. For too long we have taken our infrastructure systems--our \nroads, bridges, mass transit systems, drinking water systems, \nwastewater systems, and public housing properties--for granted. For too \nlong we have failed to invest adequately in their long-term \nsustainability. And today, we find ourselves in a precarious position \nconcerning their future viability--a precarious position that is \ncosting lives, endangering lives, and jeopardizing the high quality of \nlife we have come to enjoy and expect as Americans.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers in their seminal \n2005 Infrastructure Report Card, the current condition of our Nation's \nmajor infrastructure systems earns a grade point average of D and \njeopardizes the prosperity and quality of life of all Americans.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration, 27.1 percent of all \nbridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The \naverage age of bridges in our country is 40 years. Thirty-three percent \nof all urban and rural roads are in poor, mediocre or fair condition. \nData from the Federal Transit Administration shows our mass transit \nsystems are becoming increasingly unable to handle the growing demands \nof passengers in a safe and efficient manner. A significant percentage \nof our Nation's drinking water and wastewater systems are obsolete; the \naverage age of these systems ranges in age from 50 years in smaller \ncities to 100 years in larger cities. Clearly, these statistics are \nalarming and they are not getting any better.\n  In their Infrastructure report Card, the American Society of Civil \nEngineers estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a 5-year period \nto bring our Nation's infrastructure systems to a good condition.\n  Regrettably, our current infrastructure financing mechanisms, such as \nformula grants and earmarks, are not equipped by themselves to absorb \nthis cost or meet fully these growing needs. They largely do not \naddress capacity-building infrastructure projects of regional or \nnational significance; they largely do not encourage an appropriate \npooling of Federal, State, local and private resources; and they \nlargely do not provide transparency to ensure the optimal return on \npublic resources.\n  Early yesterday afternoon, on, I joined with my colleague, Senator \nHagel, in introducing bipartisan legislation to establish a new method \nthrough which the Federal Government can finance more effectively large \n``capacity-building'' infrastructure projects of substantial regional \nor national significance by using public and private capital. I will \nsay to my colleagues that our legislation focuses on the long-term \ncapacity and sustainability of infrastructure facilities just like the \nbridge that carried Interstate 35W over the Mississippi River.\n  Fixing our Nation's crumbling infrastructure is an issue that cannot \nbe neglected or deferred any further. This demands our immediate \nattention and commitment in the Senate. The quality of life in our \ncountry hangs in the balance.\n  Again, I extend my thoughts and prayers to those in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10774-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10774-S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ETHICS REFORM\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, following the tragic collapse of the \n35W bridge in Minneapolis that took place yesterday, August 1, 2007, I \nreturned to Minnesota this morning to learn all of the facts, and \npledge the necessary Federal resources for the victims, the \ninvestigation, and the repair. By returning to Minnesota, I was, \nunfortunately, unable to be in Washington, DC, to vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House Amendment S. 1; and \nthe motion to concur with the House Message to S. 1. Had the tragedy in \nmy State not taken me back to Minnesota, I would have voted for the \nmotion to invoke cloture as well as the underlying bill. In short, I \nwould have voted to change the course in Washington.\n  When I arrived in Washington in January, my husband, daughter and I \npulled up in our family Saturn, loaded with my husband's college dishes \nand a shower curtain that I found in the basement from 1980. But we \nbrought a little more than dishes and shower curtains. We brought a \ncommitment for change something the people of our State Democrats, \nIndependents, and Republicans, from Worthington to Moorhead to Duluth \nto Rochester called for very clearly and loudly in November.\n  We also brought a Minnesota moral compass, grounded in a simple \nnotion of Minnesota fairness: A notion that all people should be on \nequal footing in the halls of Congress.\n  But they can't be on equal footing when their elected representatives \nare selling their votes for trips to Scotland or have cash in the \nfreezer. They can't be on equal footing unless this new Congress \ndelivers real, meaningful ethics reform.\n  That's why I came to Washington back in January and why I am \ndelighted to see that the Senate passed a strong, bipartisan ethics \nreform package today.\n  Instead of maintaining business-as-usual, this ethics legislation \nwill bring meaningful and robust reform in a number of critical areas.\n  Among other things, this legislation will bring about more \ntransparency for lobbyist bundling and political campaign fund \nactivity; greater transparency in earmarking; a strong lobbyist gift \nban; meaningful limits on privately funded travel; strong revolving \ndoor restrictions; and expanded public disclosure of lobbyist \nactivities.\n  Stated simply, these reforms are needed and they are needed now to \nrestore the American public's faith in the integrity of their \ngovernment as well as their elected representatives.\n  It is hard to exaggerate the importance of what's at stake.\n  Ethics is woven into the very fabric of how our government does \nbusiness. And ethics reform goes to the very heart of our democracy, to \nthe public trust and respect that's essential to the health of our \nconstitutional system.\n  Recent scandals have cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the laws \nand policies that come out of Washington. The American public's \nreceding faith in the integrity of our legislative process means that \nethics reform is now central to every public issue that we will \nconsider--whether it's energy policy, or health care reform, tax \npolicy, or even homeland security.\n  The ability of Congress to deal credibly and forthrightly with these \nother issues depends on reforming our own ethical rules.\n  The long-term challenges that we face in this country are enormous. \nThey include high energy prices and a growing dependence on foreign \noil; health care costs that have spiraled out of control; global \nwarming that threatens the future of our environment and our economy; a \nmounting national debt; and a growing middle class squeeze.\n  I believe that there are solutions to these challenges. We can \nachieve energy independence by investing smart and having some guts to \ntake on the oil companies. We can get this country back on the right \nfiscal track, and move forward to more affordable health care. We can \ndeliver much-needed and long overdue relief to the middle class. These \nare the things that the people of Minnesota sent me to Washington to \nfight for.\n  The people of Minnesota also sent me here because they have not yet \nseen the bold change of direction that we need to make these solutions \nhappen. Instead, they have seen a Washington where the rules are tilted \nagainst them and where the interests of well-connected lobbyists come \nat the expense of the interests of the middle class.\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\n  When our energy policy is drafted in secret meetings with the oil \ncompanies, we all end up paying more at the pump because they've failed \nto invest in renewable energy. When our health care legislation is \nwritten by the drug companies, we all pay more because they've banned \nnegotiation on prices. The people of this country know corruption when \nthey see it and they saw last November who was benefiting and who was \ngetting hurt.\n  Business as usual doesn't only generate bad policy and wasteful \nspending. It also erodes public trust in the integrity of our \ngovernment institutions, our elected leaders, and the law-making \nprocess itself. We the American people know what we want from \nWashington. It is this: a government that's focused on doing what's \nbest for our nation, and on securing a better and more prosperous \nfuture for the people.\n  This reform legislation gets us there. By passing this legislation, \nwe will make a positive difference in how Congress performs its \nduties--and these reforms will send a strong, clear message to the \nAmerican people that we are here for them and focused solely on \nrepresenting their interests.\n  And that's the way it should be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10775-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FDA REAUTHORIZATION BILLS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Staff of the \nSenate HELP Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee has \nworked many, many hours a day, 7 days a week, to get to a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement on the FDA reauthorization bills.\n  Working together with Senator Enzi, we have already made a great deal \nof progress. We have reached agreement or near agreement on several \ntitles and have narrowed the gap on most others. Important issues \nremain to be resolved, but we will do the work we need to do to have an \nagreement for the House and Senate to consider in September.\n  I thank our majority leader, Senator Reid, for his leadership and \nsupport throughout this process and for making this important \nlegislation an early priority in the Senate. While we were unable to \nappoint conferees today, our bipartisan deliberations will continue \nthrough August, and I hope we can name conferees in September and \nfinalize this legislation that is so important to the safety and health \nof all Americans.\n  I also commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, from both \nthe House and Senate. They have a deep knowledge of the issues \npresented by these bills and have been strong advocates of different \npositions on some of the issues. I believe this process has improved \nthe legislation and will continue to do so and that it will produce an \nFDA reauthorization bill that the House and Senate can again endorse \nwith broad, bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10775-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DROUGHT IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the farmers in \nmy State of Delaware, and those in other parts of the Nation, who are \nlooking out their windows and seeing the damage caused by a drought. \nThis is the time of year when corn is at its best, at its sweetest, but \nin Delaware, specifically in Sussex and Kent Counties, where \nagriculture is king, my guys are in trouble. On some farms, corn is \nhalf the size it should be, brown and withered, stalks, with no ears of \ncorn. Losses, I have been told, are 50 percent of the crop or even 100 \npercent of a farmers total crop. Soybeans are also in jeopardy. And we \nare facing a forecast with little or no rain.\n  As I have been telling my colleagues, for more than three decades, \nagriculture is an enormous and vital part of my State. Delaware is an \nagricultural State. Almost 50 percent of our total acreage is farmland. \nSussex County, the southernmost county in my State, is the largest \npoultry producing county in the entire country. Delaware is first in \nproduction value per farm and first in cash receipts per acre. We are \nranked No. 2 in lima bean production, and we have 200,000 acres of \nsoybeans and 175,000 acres of corn.\n  Sadly, this is not the first time that my State has faced a severe \ndrought. In 2002, our farmers faced similar circumstances and suffered \nmajor losses. When a severe drought strikes, the impact on the economy, \nthe environment, and the agricultural sector can be devastating. USDA's \nassistance during these crucial periods help the livelihoods of our \nfarmers in Delaware.\n  Farmers, always at the mercy of the weather, are constantly faced \nwith decisions of how to best manage risk. With Delaware soil, \nirrigation is oftentimes an option, but it is an expensive one which \ncan be daunting to a farmer trying to make a profit. Another tool which \nfarmers look to is crop insurance. Throughout my tenure in the Senate, \nI have supported incentives to make such tools attractive and \naffordable to farmers.\n  Bur for now, our Governor has started the process that triggers \nFederal assistance by calling for the Delaware Farm Service Agency to \nsurvey the crops. Because it is essential that the State, or specific \ncounties, be designated as crop disaster areas to make farmers eligible \nfor Federal disaster assistance, I am hopeful that they complete the \nprocess soon. If disaster assistance is needed, I hope the Secretary of \nAgriculture will move swiftly to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10775-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10775-S10776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to engage in a \ncolloquy with a number of colleagues who have been true leaders on one \nof the most challenging issues facing the world today climate change.\n  As I stated on the floor several weeks ago, the time for action is \nnow. According to the latest scientific findings of our world's leading \nexperts--the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the confidence \nthat humans are altering earth's climate has reached 90 percent \ncertainty.\n  It is with this sense of urgency that I recently introduced, along \nwith Senator Specter, the Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007. S. 1766--\nwhich is also supported by Senators Akaka, Murkowski, Casey, Stevens, \nand Harkin--is the product of over 2 years of deliberation and analysis \nand enjoys the support of many in industry, labor and conservation.\n  Senator Specter and I are convinced--and I believe my good colleagues \nfrom Connecticut and Virginia would agree--that legislation can only \nattract the bipartisan support needed to put the United States on a \npath to a low carbon economy if it contains the following: No. 1. \nmandatory limits on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions; No. 2, an economy-\nwide approach that meets the economic test of ``no significant harm''; \nNo. 3. increased incentives to accelerate the development and \ndeployment of low and zero emission technologies; No. 4. measures that \nstrongly encourage our major trading partners to begin reducing \nemissions and that balance U.S. emission-reduction commitments with the \nnecessity of engaging other countries; and No. 5. measures to allocate \nallowances under the program equitably and efficiently.\n  Ultimately I am optimistic about our ability to forge bipartisan \nresolution of all of these issues because there is now such broad \nagreement within this body and within the business community and the \ngeneral public about the need for real progress and action on this \nissue. At the same time, I recognize that we have work left to do. \nSenator Specter and I today hosted a meeting among many of the Nation's \nleading power producers to explore some new ideas for allocating \nemission permits within the power sector. We were encouraged by this \ndiscussion and plan to broaden the discussion to include a wider array \nof consumer and environmental perspectives.\n  While the legislation we have introduced and the outline you are \nsharing today differ in some important respects, I believe that we have \na great deal in common. Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner, I stand \nready to work to address our differences in the interest in forging a \nbroad consensus capable of passing legislation this year.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from New \nMexico, for the enormous contribution his efforts have made to move the \nclimate change debate forward. He has\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\ntaken the time to study and consider many of the nuts-and-bolts issues \nthat are critical to developing a balanced approach, and we all are \nbetter informed for his efforts.\n  Like my friend, I stand here today very optimistic that we can forge \nbipartisan legislation. It is my honor to chair a subcommittee on \nclimate change in the Environment and Public Works Committee and to \nhave Senator Warner as my ranking member. Senator Boxer has shown great \nleadership and commitment to moving climate legislation through our \nfull committee, and I look forward to working with her and all members \nof our committee to report out a strong bill in the fall. Senator \nWarner and I have reached agreement on the salient aspects of our \nclimate proposal. I agree with Senator Bingaman's description of the \nnecessary design elements and believe that he and others will find that \nthe legislation we are working on in our committee embraces these same \nprinciples.\n  Much of the debate recently has centered on what level of U.S. \nemissions reductions are necessary to stabilize atmospheric \nconcentrations of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury to avoid \ncatastrophic consequences. I believe that it is ultimately our moral \nresponsibility to curb our emissions to avoid these consequences for \nthose who follow us here on Earth. I also agree that we must ensure \nthat our efforts to address climate change are consistent with our \ncommitment to strengthening the U.S. economy and our economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  I note that some labor unions support the Low Carbon Economy Act, and \nwhile I also recognize that we are proposing approaches to cost-\ncontainment that overlap in part and differ in part, I am optimistic \nthat we may be able to find a common way forward that will protect the \nenvironment and the economy. It is my personal belief that reducing \nclimate pollution will ultimately provide a benefit to the U.S. \neconomy; however Senator Warner and I recognize that there remain many \nin this body who are deeply concerned about economic impacts from \nclimate regulation. For these reasons, like Senators Bingaman and \nSpecter, I am convinced that we must have robust cost-control measures \nin place in order to forge the bipartisan consensus needed for timely \nand aggressive action.\n  The world is looking toward the United States for leadership on \nclimate change. Only with bipartisan leadership and quick action will \nwe be able assume this leadership role. I appreciate my colleagues \njoining me today in this colloquy and pledge that I will work closely \nwith them to ensure that the bill we report out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee enjoys the broadest level of bipartisan support \npossible.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \ncommending the growing bipartisan movement to craft climate legislation \nthat can pass this body. Senator Bingaman and I have been striving for \nsome time to develop an approach that provides a deliberative and \nmeasured response to climate change. I agree with the criteria outlined \ntoday. Several of these elements were critical to my support for the \nLow Carbon Economy Act.\n  First, I represent a State that relies heavily on manufacturing and \ncoal production. We must craft climate change legislation that will \nprotect the U.S. economy. It is critical that we not only provide \nfunding to develop and deploy new climate-friendly technologies, but we \nmust also find the most efficient way to drive these new technologies \nforward. One aspect of the bill I sponsored with Senator Bingaman that \nI want to highlight is designed to drive the development of carbon \ncapture and storage a technology that is critical to coal-producing \nStates such as Pennsylvania. The bill provides a significant economic \nincentive to innovative companies willing to take on the challenge of \nbuilding commercial-scale power plants that capture and store carbon \ndioxide emissions.\n  Second, while I agree that the United States needs to take more \naggressive steps here at home to address this issue, I also believe \nthat any legislation must include provisions to ensure that we \nperiodically review whether other countries are taking comparable \naction and that we be prepared to apply pressure on nations that \ncontinue to avoid implementing emissions limits.\n  I believe that this is an idea we all embrace and thank the Senators \nfrom the Environment and Public Works Committee for their willingness \nto work with us as they move legislation through the committee. We must \nbring together many interest groups in the fight against global \nwarming. Only with broad support inside and outside of this chamber \nwill we develop a bill that can pass.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am honored to join with my colleagues in \nthis colloquy on developing a bipartisan approach to addressing climate \nchange. As my friend from Connecticut already stated, we have agreed on \nthe principal outlines of a climate change proposal that we intend on \nmoving through the Environment and Public Works Committee this fall. \nClimate change is a very big problem, and the solution will require a \nvery big tent. In addition to the good work by my colleagues standing \nhere today, we also welcome continued leadership by Senators Carper and \nAlexander on our committee, Senators Kerry and Snowe in the Commerce \nCommittee, Senators Biden and Lugar in Foreign Relations, and many \nothers.\n  I can say with utmost confidence that Senator Lieberman and I embrace \nthe principles for action described by our colleagues today. As always, \nthe details matter a great deal. Senators Bingaman and Specter have \nclearly invested significant time and effort on this issue, and we \ntruly welcome their input as we move legislation through the committee.\n  Like my colleagues, I believe that as we legislate on climate change \nwe must be careful to protect our economy and pay special attention to \nthose industries and regions that will bear the brunt of achieving \nnecessary reductions. That is why last week I joined Senators Landrieu, \nGraham, and Lincoln in introducing legislation that I hope will allay \nthe concerns of some Senators about the economic impacts of a cap-and-\ntrade program. We have included this bipartisan measure in the proposal \nSenator Lieberman and I have agreed to today. While I believe the cost-\ncontainment measures we have proposed present a sound basis for \nlegislation, I, too, am open to consider a combination of efforts and \nideas so long as the resulting product makes sense ecologically, \neconomically and politically. It will not be easy, but if we can \nsucceed in uniting our coalitions of support, I believe we will have \nthe ability to pass climate legislation in this body.\n  In my 28 years in the Senate, I have focused above all on issues of \nnational security, and I see the problem of global climate change as \nfitting within that focus. As with national security concerns, to \nsucceed in addressing the threats of global climate change, we must be \nunited at home.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friends and colleagues for \ntheir remarks and their commitment. We must approach this issue in a \nthoughtful and constructive way. It is my hope that we can take action \non this issue by the end of the year. Let's not wait any longer when we \nknow the one course of action we can't afford or defend is continued \nparalysis.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am committed to working with you and suggest that we \nbring our key staff together early in the recess to move this \ndiscussion forward. I think we all agree that these issues must be \nresolved and we can only benefit from a serious effort to try and \nresolve them together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10776-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10776-S10777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     corporal dustin lee workman ii\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I honor Army CPL Dustin \nLee Workman II.\n  Upon his graduation in 2005 from Ashland-Greenwood High School in \nAshland, Nebraska, Corporal Workman joined the Nebraska National Guard. \nHis friends and family describe him as an iron-willed person, and as \nsomeone who was deeply in touch with his faith. One of his former \nteachers described him as a talented and creative writer. In fact, \nCorporal Workman, who was not yet 20 years old, composed a poem, which \nwas set to music by one of his friends and sang at his funeral. I \nattended the funeral, and it was a moving rendition. The poem follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\n\n     I am from God whose\n     Hand molded me with only his will.\n     Conceiving my innocence\n     As I lay dormant and still.\n\n     I am from God who knew\n     No limits nor fear.\n     Who gave up his son\n     Without shedding a tear.\n\n     I am from God who granted\n     Me my soul.\n     Never to be Hell's among\n     The others it stole.\n\n     I am from God who's my\n     Shepherd and Lord.\n     Guiding others and myself\n     In our herds and our hordes.\n\n     I am from God whose\n     Power and blessing is given as mine\n     Endowed into me by his hand so divine.\n\n  On June 28, 2007, Corporal Workman passed away due to combat injuries \nsustained from an improvised explosive device while serving in Iraq. He \nwas assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade \nCombat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, based in Fort Carson, CO.\n  Corporal Workman is survived by his father, Dustin, Sr.; mother, \nValerie; and two younger siblings, Korey and Krysta. I join all \nAmericans in grieving the loss of a patriot and a beloved friend, \nbrother, and son.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Nathan L. Winder\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to honor and commemorate one \nof Utah's fallen sons. SFC Nathan L. Winder was a native of Blanding, \nUtah, and a member of the 1st Special Forces Group stationed at Fort \nLewis, WA. I have been informed that this good soldier tragically lost \nhis life as he and his U.S. Special Forces Quick Reaction team came to \nthe aid of another unit that was ambushed and taking on small-arms fire \nin Ad Diwaniyah, Iraq.\n  Shortly after graduating from high school, Sergeant Winder left his \nhome in Blanding, UT, to pursue a career in the Armed Forces. In 2006, \nhe graduated from the special forces qualification course in Fort \nBragg, NC, and earned the coveted Green Beret.\n  As a 2-year-old boy, he was abandoned on the steps of a courthouse in \nSeoul, South Korea. Shortly after, he was offered a better life and a \nnew beginning in the loving home of Tom and Teri Winder, incredible \nparents of 20 children. In his parents' eyes, it was from his \nabandonment and subsequent adoption that he developed the fierce desire \nto offer others the same kind of hope that was offered him.\n  Throughout his life, it was clear that Sergeant Winder had a special \nplace in his heart for children. His family remembers how he often \nremarked in his e-mails that Iraqi children seemed so appreciative of \nthe little things, like a wave from a U.S. soldier, a smile, or even a \nsmall piece of candy. Teri Winder said of her son, ``He loved the \nchildren. He gave them a sense that they were cared about.'' He did \neverything he could to offer them the hope he so gratefully received so \nmany years ago. He was known for always carrying toys and candy to hand \nout to the Iraqi children.\n  Sergeant Winder was a man who lived his life with a profound purpose, \ndeeply rooted in his convictions of moral reciprocity. His greatest \ndesire was to take the freedom afforded to him and offer it to those \nwho had none. Tom Winder said his son wanted the people in Iraq, if \nonly for a moment, to feel some sense of freedom, however seemingly \nminute its manifestation.\n  In addition to two wonderful parents and 19 brothers and sisters, \nSergeant Winder is survived by his wife Mechelle and an 11-year-old \nson. This great soldier and his family will always be in my memory and \nprayers.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Nathan S. Barnes\n\n  Mr. President, today I also pay tribute to SGT Nathan S. Barnes of \nAmerican Fork, UT, who recently gave his life during a combat mission \nin Iraq. Sergeant Barnes was a member of the 10th Mountain Division's \n4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment stationed out of Fort Drum, NY.\n  I have been informed that 400 American flags lined the streets \nleading to the Sergeant Barnes's family home in American Fork. I also \nunderstand that on the day of his funeral, hundreds of Boy Scouts, each \nbearing a U.S. flag and standing at attention, gathered along either \nside of the street to honor the fallen soldier.\n  That is the kind of tribute this brave and selfless soldier merits.\n  Sergeant Barnes is remembered by his family members and fellow \nsoldiers for his love of friends and family, and for his humor, his \ncommitment to serving the country and his profound dedication to his \nfaith.\n  Sergeant Barnes was a man who truly lived an abundant life. When not \nengaged in the service of his country, the soldier enjoyed spending \ntime outdoors jogging, hiking, camping, and hunting. Friends and family \nrecall his insatiable appetite for good literature. All of these \ninterests and hobbies were part of Sergeant Barnes' unique way of \nexploring what life had to offer him.\n  I would submit to you this day, Mr. President, that in a time when \npatriotism is a virtue often overlooked and lost in the midst of the \nswirl of issues, Sergeant Barnes' sacrifice brings us back to the core \nof what it means to be a patriot. I hope and pray that his sacrifice \nwill inspire us all to reach for new levels of excellence and \ncitizenship, to recommit ourselves to a greater measure of devotion to \nfamily and country, and above all, to continue to pursue ways to \nprovide for a more perfect America.\n  I am honored and humbled by this opportunity to commemorate the life \nof SGT Nathan S. Barnes. He served his country with pride and answered \nits call when it needed him most. I will always remember him and his \nfamily in my prayers. Our nation owes SGT Nathan S. Barnes a giant debt \nof gratitude and for that reason I pay tribute today to his dedicated \nand selfless service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10777-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10777-S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNITED ORPHANAGE AND ACADEMY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the United \nOrphanage and Academy in Moi's Bridge, Kenya. As many of my esteemed \ncolleagues know, Africa has a special place in my heart. I visit the \ncontinent several times a year to see a number of dear friends. My own \ngranddaughter, Zegita Marie, joined our family through adoption from \nEthiopia.\n  As we hear virtually every day, Sub-Saharan Africa is in crisis; the \nstatistics of devastation are staggering. In 2006, 2.8 million people \nin Sub-Saharan Africa contracted HIV and nearly 1 million children died \nfrom malaria, according to the World Health Organization. The United \nNations estimates that in the same year, there were 12 million AIDS \norphans living in the region. These pandemics are further compounded by \nfamine, unsafe drinking water, corruption, and war.\n  Much has been said of these heart-wrenching situations, but today my \nmessage is one of hope. During my travels, I have found Africa to be a \nplace of beauty, courage, and ingenuity. Kenya alone is home to more \nthan 42 distinct ethnic communities, the soaring heights of Mt. Kenya, \nand one of the largest drama events in Africa, the annual Kenya Schools \nand Colleges Drama Festival.\n  Embodying these characteristics, the United Orphanage and Academy \ncares for 40 children impacted by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Founded in \n2001, this beacon of hope lies in rural northwest Kenya, near the \nUgandan border. Children ages 4 to 14 are provided with food, shelter, \nclean water, and quality education. One hundred students are currently \nenrolled in classes from pre-kindergarten through second grade. \nMoreover, the home is a place of reconciliation and unity as children \nfrom five distinct ethnic backgrounds and numerous tribes learn to \nwork, play, and grow together.\n  The vision for the orphanage stemmed from humble beginnings, as \nconversations between Rev. Stephen Chege and Henri Rush, an elder at \nWestminster Presbyterian Church, evolved into a vision to ``develop a \ncaring and spiritual space for children to live and grow when they come \nto the point of having no family or guardian support available to \nthem.'' As a result, an ambitious roadmap has been set in place, \nencompassing everything from procuring a van for vital transportation \nneeds to constructing additional classrooms.\n  Today, I would like to highlight efforts to expand this mission. \nGreat need requires great hope, and great hope requires great action. \nReverend Chege, Mr. Rush and their partners seek to double the capacity \nof the orphanage to house up to 80 children. Furthermore, plans exist \nto expand the school to include grades K-12 and further vocational \ntraining. The philosopher Aristotle once said: ``All who have\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\nmeditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the \nfate of empires depends on the education of youth.'' In my humble \nestimation, the fate of Africa depends, in large part, on the education \nof young men and women who learn to lead their communities with wisdom \nand integrity.\n  I am filled with hope when I see individuals and communities coming \ntogether to respond to perhaps one of the greatest crises of our time, \nand I am encouraged when such initiatives emerge from transcontinental \nfriendships. I believe the United Orphanage and Academy embodies the \nvalues and provides the tools necessary to equip Africa's youth to \nembrace a world of challenges and possibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10778-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LIFTING HOLD ON NOMINATION OF DENNIS SCHRADER\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on June 18, I announced my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the \nnomination of Dennis Schrader to be Deputy Administrator for National \nPreparedness in the Department of Homeland Security. I did so because, \nprior to his confirmation as Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, Michael Chertoff told me in my office that if confirmed, he \nwould move expeditiously to implement the National Emergency Technology \nGuard--NET Guard program. Unfortunately, Secretary Chertoff had failed \nto honor that pledge.\n  Today, I received a letter from Secretary Chertoff describing how the \nDepartment is moving forward with 12-month NET Guard pilots beginning \nin September 2007, and how the DHS will be requesting funds to continue \nthe program in its 2009 budget request to the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  The Secretary also communicated to me that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will be publicizing NET Guard and seeking involvement from the \nprivate sector, a step critical to the success of this vital program.\n  The Department has also set aside funds to run the pilots for the \nyear and convened a working group of subject matter experts to guide \nthe design of NET Guard. These activities and Secretary Chertoff's \nletter indicate that he is making a good-faith effort to get NET Guard \noff the ground.\n  In light of these actions, I will no longer object to any unanimous-\nconsent request for the Senate to take up Mr. Schrader's nomination. I \nwill, however, continue to closely monitor DHS's actions on NET Guard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Secretary Chertoff's letter be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Department of Homeland Security,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for taking time this morning \n     to discuss the Department of Homeland Security's plans for \n     the National Emergency Technology Guard (NET Guard) program. \n     Following my June 29, 2007 letter to you that outlined our \n     program approach, and as a prelude to our discussion, members \n     of the Department's NET Guard team briefed your staff on our \n     proposed plan. The positive feedback from your staff, coupled \n     with your positive feedback this morning and the positive \n     feedback that we have received from State, local, and private \n     sector stakeholders, gives us confidence that we are taking \n     the right approach to implementing this important disaster \n     response program.\n       Accordingly, the Department is moving forward with plans to \n     implement 12-month NET Guard pilots beginning in September \n     2007. The recommendation to establish pilots in September is \n     consistent with the NET Guard Scoping Initiative Report, \n     which I will provide to you upon its completion this month. \n     To fund our efforts in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, we will \n     continue to work with Congressional appropriators.

Mr. President, I would like to share a letter received by \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives on the issue of Internet \ngambling from the National Football League, Major League Baseball, \nNational Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and National \nCollegiate Athletic Association. I would like to include this letter in \nthe Record, which alerts us to the serious threat that H.R. 2046 poses \nto the integrity of American athletics, as well as our national \nsovereignty over gambling regulation.\n  Many of us on this side of the Capitol may not be aware that there \nare efforts afoot in the House of Representatives to legalize Internet \ngambling, less than a year after we enacted the Unlawful Internet \nGambling Enforcement Act of 2006. I strongly supported UIGEA, and \nsupported its inclusion in the SAFE Ports Act, so that after more than \n10 years of overwhelming bipartisan support for doing something to stop \nillegal Internet gambling in this country, we finally have an \nenforcement law with teeth.\n  But now, before the regulations for UIGEA have even been written, \ninternational gambling interests are telling our colleagues in the \nHouse that Internet gambling can never be stopped, so we might as well \nlegalize, regulate, and tax it. We might as well decide that everyone \nspeeds on the George Washington Parkway, so we should just eliminate \nthe speed limits and make it a toll road. Internet gambling is just as \ndangerous--its 24/7 accessibility from any location, speed, and \nanonymity make it the ``crack cocaine'' of gambling, leading to \naddiction, young people wrecking their financial futures, family \nbreakdown, and even crime and suicide. The answer is stepping up \nenforcement efforts, not abandoning the law and government feeding off \nthe trough of personal tragedy.\n  H.R. 2046 would license Internet gambling companies to do business \nwith U.S. customers and override every other Federal or State law that \nwould interfere with this business. The proponents of this legalization \nscheme will argue that the bill allows States and sports leagues to \n``opt out'' of legalization, but don't be fooled. The ``opt-outs'' are \nvulnerable to legal challenge, both in U.S. courts and in the World \nTrade Organization. And if the opt-outs fall, H.R. 2046 would result in \nthe greatest expansion of gambling ever enacted in the history of the \nUnited States.\n  The sports organizations are very concerned because H.R. 2046 would \nreverse decades of Federal policy by endorsing sports gambling. We have \nall seen in the past couple of weeks how damaging gambling can be to \nthe integrity and image of professional sports. When a player or a \nreferee taints the game for gambling profits, all of the participants \nand all of the fans are betrayed. And even when there is no fraud, \npervasive gambling on a sport robs its character as family \nentertainment celebrating the pursuit of athletic achievement, turning \nit into a seedy vehicle for making money at the expense of others. \nCongress must not in any way endorse this degradation of our national \npastimes.\n  I hope that my colleagues here in the Senate will join me on the \nlookout for Internet gambling legalization efforts and will firmly \nreject and rebuff any such proposals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter prepared by the professional and collegiate sports \nassociations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 30, 2007.\n       Dear Member of Congress: Sports betting is incompatible \n     with preserving the integrity of American athletics. For many \n     decades, we have actively enforced strong policies against \n     sports betting. And the law on this point is consistent. \n     Federal statutes bar sports betting, especially the 1961 Wire \n     Act and the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection \n     Act. Enforcement of these laws against sports betting was \n     also a significant motive for enacting the Unlawful Internet \n     Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA).\n       Accordingly, we urge you to reject current proposals to \n     legalize Internet gambling, such as H.R. 2046 sponsored by \n     Rep. Barney Frank. This legislation reverses federal policy \n     on sports betting and would for the first time\n\n[[Page S10779]]\n\n     give such gambling Congressional consent. The bill sends \n     exactly the wrong message to the public about sports gambling \n     and threatens to undermine the integrity of American sports.\n       On a related point, we believe the Congress should not \n     consider any liberalization of Internet gambling until the \n     U.S. Trade Representative successfully resolves our trade \n     disputes in this area. A rush to judgment on this subject \n     could result in irreversible damage to U.S. sovereignty in \n     the area of gambling regulation, including the capacity to \n     prohibit sports bets.\n       Though Internet gambling on sports has never been legal, \n     easy access to offshore Internet gambling web sites has \n     created the opposite impression among the general public, \n     particularly before Congress enacted UIGEA last fall. UIGEA \n     emerged from more than a decade of Congressional \n     consideration, in which stand-alone legislation aimed at \n     restricting Internet gambling passed either the Senate or the \n     House in each of five successive Congresses, each time by \n     overwhelming bi-partisan votes. UIGEA also enjoyed a broad \n     array of supporters, including 49 state Attorneys General and \n     other law enforcement associations, several major financial \n     institutions and technology companies, dozens of religious \n     and family organizations, and of course our sports \n     organizations.\n       Enactment of UIGEA was grounded on concerns about \n     addictive, compulsive, and underage Internet gambling, \n     unlawful sports betting, potential criminal activity, and the \n     wholesale evasion of federal and state laws. When it passed \n     the House a year ago, the vote was 317-93, including \n     majorities of both caucuses and with the affirmative votes of \n     both party leaders.\n       The final product was a law that did not change the \n     legality of any gambling activity--it simply gave law \n     enforcement new, effective tools for enforcing existing state \n     and federal gambling laws. UIGEA and its predecessor bills \n     could attract such consensus because they adhered to this \n     principle: whether you think gambling liberalization is a bad \n     idea or a good one, the policy judgments of State \n     legislatures and Congress must be respected, not de facto \n     repealed by deliberate evasion of the law by offshore \n     entities via the Internet.\n       By contrast, H.R. 2046 would put the Treasury Department in \n     charge of issuing licenses to Internet gambling operators, \n     who would then be immunized from prosecution or liability \n     under any Federal or State law that prohibits what the Frank \n     bill permits. The bill would tear apart the fabric of \n     American gambling regulation. By overriding in one stroke \n     dozens of Federal and State gambling laws, this would amount \n     to the greatest expansion of legalized gambling ever enacted.\n       This legislation contains an ``opt-out'' that appears to \n     permit individual leagues to prohibit gambling on their \n     sports. But regardless of the ``opt-out,'' the bill breaks \n     terrible new ground, because Congress would for the first \n     time sanction sports betting. That is reason enough to oppose \n     it. In addition, the bill's safeguard opt-out for sports \n     leagues as well as the one for states may well prove illusory \n     and ineffectual. They will be subject to legal challenge \n     before U.S. courts and the WorId Trade Organization.\n       In addition, this legislation would dramatically complicate \n     current trade negotiations concerning gambling. In 1994, the \n     United States signed the General Agreement on Trade in \n     Services, which included a commitment to free trade in \n     ``other recreational services.'' In subsequent WTO \n     proceedings, the United States has claimed this commitment \n     never included gambling services. The United States has noted \n     that any such ``commitment'' would contradict a host of \n     federal and state laws that regulate and restrict gambling. \n     The WTO has not accepted this argument.\n       Accordingly, the U.S. Trade Representative has initiated \n     negotiations to withdraw gambling from U.S. GATS commitments. \n     Before withdrawal can be finalized, agreement must be reached \n     on trade concessions with interested trading partners. Few \n     concessions should be required because there was never a \n     legal market in Internet gambling in the U.S. If Congress \n     creates a legal market before withdrawal is complete, the \n     withdrawal will become much more complicated and costly. \n     Therefore, we oppose any legislation that would imperil the \n     withdrawal process.\n       Finally, we have heard the argument that Internet gambling \n     can actually protect the integrity of sports because of the \n     alleged capacity to monitor gambling patterns more closely in \n     a legalized environment. This argument is generally asserted \n     by those who would profit from legalized gambling and the \n     same point was raised in 1992 when PASPA was enacted. \n     Congress dismissed it then and should dismiss it now. The \n     harms caused by government endorsement of sports betting far \n     exceed the alleged benefits.\n       H.R. 2046 sets aside decades of federal precedent to \n     legalize sports betting and exposes American gambling laws to \n     continuing jeopardy in the WTO. We strongly urge that you \n     oppose it. Thank you for considering our views on this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Buchanan,\n       Executive VP and General Counsel, National Basketball \n     Association.\n     Elsa Kircher Cole,\n       General Counsel, National Collegiate Athletic Association.\n     William Daly,\n       Deputy Commissioner National Hockey League.\n     Tom Ostertag,\n       Senior VP and General Counsel, Major League Baseball.\n     Jeffrey Pash,\n       Executive VP and General Counsel, National Football League.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10779-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10779-S10780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, genocide has only one morally tenable \nanswer. This week, the United Nations found that answer: decisive and \nforceful action to protect the innocent. Tuesday's Security Council \nresolution put real teeth in the world's effort to stop the Darfur \ngenocide: A paltry contingent of 7,000 African Union peacekeepers will \nswell with 26,000 more troops in a combined UN/AU force.\n  The peacekeepers will take command of the region by the end of the \nyear, and their arms will help to shield the people of Darfur from \ncontinued murder and rape and displacement.\n  I applaud this resolution. We all know that it comes 450,000 lives \ntoo late. But the UN's action looks positively instantaneous when set \nagainst the delay and the equivocation of our own Government. Special \nEnvoy Andrew Natsios assured the world that American action was \n``imminent'' 7 months ago. And it was 2 years ago that President Bush \ndeclared the crimes in Darfur ``genocide.''\n  But there is still time for America to act, and a vital role for \nAmerica to play. The Security Council's force resolution, as valuable \nas it is, came at a price: To mollify China and several African member \nstates, its provisions for multilateral sanctions on Sudan were \nsignificantly softened. We can, and must, fill the gap with unilateral \nsanctions of our own.\n  Multilateral force combined with American sanctions would show the \ninternational system working at its best. The world community has \nagreed to act against genocide; now, the United States can work in the \nspirit of that resolution and do its own part to bring the suffering to \nan end. Our economic muscle can be a potent weapon.\n  Three sanctions bills are before the Senate. Two S. 831--the Sudan \nDivestment Authorization Act of 2007, and S. 1563, the Sudan Disclosure \nand Enforcement Act of 2007--have been authored by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Durbin. From the very start, his voice has been the \nstrongest in the Senate on the Darfur genocide, and his tremendous \nleadership stands in stark contrast to this administration.\n  A third sanctions bill--H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and \nDivestment Act of 2007--has been authored by Representative Barbara \nLee, whose leadership ranks with Senator Durbin's. I have asked the \nmajority leader to expedite consideration of all of these bills.\n  I would like to focus for a moment on Representative Lee's bill. It \naims to punish the bloodstained Government of Sudan by assisting \ndivestment from companies that--knowingly or not--have helped to fund \nthe genocide. H.R. 180 requires the Department of the Treasury to \ndevelop a list of companies investing in specific sectors of the \nSudanese economy: power production, mineral extraction, oil-related \nindustries, and military equipment industries.\n  Before being put on the list, companies are given 30 days to either \nrebut the designation or to say that they will be suspending such \nactivities within a year. The bill also removes specific legal barriers \nto enable mutual fund and corporate pension fund managers to cut ties \nwith these listed companies.\n  And it allows States and localities to divest their public pension \nfunds from those companies whose financial operations help support the \ngenocidal practices of the Sudanese Government.\n  In ultimately leading to the withdrawal of funds from the Sudanese \nmilitary machine, the bill does valuable work. But I am concerned that \nit entrusts the compilation of the list of companies to the wrong \nagency, Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control. OFAC is an \nenforcement agency, and such investigation is not in its mission.\n  I believe the job is better entrusted to an interagency task force \ncombining\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\nthe varied strengths of the Departments of Treasury, State, and Energy, \nalong with the SEC. This combined approach will mean that our efforts \ntoward divestment are as fair, effective, targeted, and transparent as \nthey can be. So I have proposed amending the divestment bill to that \neffect; a second amendment authorizes $2 million to make this \ndivestment task force a reality.\n  But whatever form they take, sanctions need to pass now. As the UN/AU \nforce stabilizes Darfur, we must do our utmost to choke off the money \nthat has oiled the machinery of slaughter. To those of my colleagues \nwho are standing in the way of swift action, I ask:\n  What more do you need to see?\n  What more do we need to prove?\n  What more could it possibly take to move you?\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 180, as amended, and the two \nother strong Senate bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10780-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CROP INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my comments here today are to point out \nthe importance of the crop insurance program to America's farmers and \nAmerica's rural communities.\n  Congress enacted legislation in 1980 that allowed for the expansion \nof the program and the involvement of the private insurance sector in \nthe crop insurance program's delivery. Since this time, the program has \ngrown from a small, experimental program to one that insures over 70 \npercent of the eligible acres in the country. In many States, an even \nhigher percentage of the eligible acres in the State are insured. In my \nhome State of Iowa we have over 90 percent enrollment. This protection \nhas come to be relied on by farmers and their lenders as a vital and \nnecessary part of farming. For most farmers their crop insurance policy \nis the basis of their risk management, crop marketing and loan \ncollateral.\n  The success of the crop insurance program can be attributed to two \nkey items. One is the support of the Federal Government. It is no \nsecret that the Government supports the crop insurance program with \npremium subsidies that encourage farmers to purchase coverage and help \npay for its cost. Additionally, rather than further increasing farmers' \npremium costs, the Government also pays for the delivery of the \nprogram. These Government expenditures, while not insignificant, are \nconsiderably less than the Government would likely spend in after-the-\nfact disaster aid if farmers didn't use the program or if the program \ndidn't exist.\n  The second key item that has contributed to the success of the crop \ninsurance program is the delivery of the program by the private \ninsurance sector. Delivery of the crop insurance program by private \ncompanies, using local insurance agents, using modern technology, and \nwith an incentive to do things right and earn underwriting rewards, has \nallowed for market penetration that was thought impossible by many. But \nit has occurred, and it continues due to the quality, timely and \naccurate service being provided to farmers by local agents and \ncompanies.\n  I point out the importance of this program and its successes today, \nbecause this body is expected to consider this program during debate of \nthe farm bill. It appears that despite successfully operating under \nseparate legislation for years, the crop insurance program is being \npulled into the farm bill discussions. The House farm bill has pulled \nmoney from the crop insurance program to offset other spending. I \nintend to analyze carefully the impact this House action will have on \nfarmer's ability to manage their own risk. While I recognize there are \nimprovements that need to be made to the program, crop insurance brings \nmore stability to rural America.\n  American farmers deserve a safety net that they can count on each and \nevery crop year. As the Senate prepares to work on our farm bill \nprovisions, I hope we recognize that crop insurance has become \ningrained into the fiber of American agriculture, from the farmers and \nlenders that depend on it to the rural communities whose local \neconomies are bolstered by it in hard times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10780-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10780-S10781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALLOT INTEGRITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address an important \ndevelopment in the way our votes our counted. Last November, California \nelected a new chief election officer--Secretary of State Debra Bowen. \nSecretary Bowen served in the California Legislature, where she had a \nreputation as a dedicated advocate for greater protections of our \nvoting systems. Upon becoming secretary of state, she called for a \n``top-to-bottom'' review of all voting systems used in California. This \nwas a dynamic and appropriate step, given the heartburn that electronic \nvoting systems have caused voters nationwide.\n  The problems with paperless voting systems are clear. Computers are \nno substitute for a paper record. We want to know where our most \nimportant documents are--and we don't leave them on the computer. Votes \nshould be no different.\n  Many events over the last few years have raised great concerns about \npaperless voting systems. In a congressional race in Sarasota, FL, \nabout 18,000 ballots had no recorded vote. The final vote count divided \nthe candidates by only 300-odd votes. So-called ``under-votes'' occur \nin every election. But the rate in Florida's 13th Congressional \nDistrict was unusually high. And because there was no verified paper \nrecord, we may never know who really won that election.\n  Some say paper ballots can malfunction or be manipulated just as \neasily as these computers. I strongly disagree. When paper records \nfail, we can see that they have failed. If paper records are stolen, or \ndisappear, we will notice their absence. But when malfunctions or \nsecurity gaps occur in paperless voting systems, there is no easy way \nfor voters or election officials to know that something has gone wrong. \nIt is for this reason I support optical scan paper systems--or, at \nminimum, voting systems that produce a paper record verified by the \nvoter.\n  So it is entirely appropriate that Secretary Bowen performed this \ntest. Californians go to the polls in 6 months to cast their votes in \nthe presidential primary. They must have confidence in their voting \nsystems. With the cooperation of several voting system vendors, the \nUniversity of California assembled several teams to review the systems. \nThe teams examined the systems' source code, their physical and \nsoftware defenses, and the ability of people with disabilities to use \nthese systems. The systems fell short in all three tests. In a short \nspan of time, computer scientists identified a number of major \nvulnerabilities with the voting systems. And these experts were able to \nhack the vote in less than 5 weeks.\n  It is important to note that many election officials employ security \nmeasures to protect their systems from these kinds of attacks. In this \ntest, the focus was on the voting system's defenses alone--no external \nprotections were employed. Even without such protections, the results \nof this examination clearly indicate we need to improve these systems.\n  A few examples of what the University of California experts were able \nto do: First, researchers were able to gain access to the internal \ncomputer system by breaking or bypassing the locks in the voting \nsystems. In the case of one voting system, ordinary office objects were \nused to gain access. Second, researchers were able replace existing \nsoftware with a new, corrupt virus that fed incorrect election data to \nthe system. This attack used a program that appeared to change the \ntext, but instead replaced the original software with corrupted code. \nMany small jurisdictions may lack the technical ability to identify and \nprotect against these attacks. Third, while election officials can test \nthese systems, experts noted that software distinguishes between \nelection mode and testing mode. This could allow a virus to instruct \nthe system to run properly during a test--but allow it to be corrupted \nduring an election. Even counties that test their systems often could \nbe vulnerable. Finally, the team was able to develop a device that \nwould allow unauthorized access--and allow someone wishing to corrupt \nthe ballot box to change the system's vote count.\n  What does all this mean for elections in the United States?\n  It means we should to follow the lead of Secretary Bowen, and take a \nvery\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\ncareful look at our voting systems. It means the argument for paper as \nan essential part of voting systems is becoming more and more \nconvincing. It means we should watch and carefully assess the new \nstandards for testing voting systems that will be employed for the \nfirst time in December. I hope these standards have a significant \nimpact, that they catch the vulnerabilities of these systems.\n  I believe the bill I introduced in May will lead to great \nimprovements in the technology and the processes of elections. The \nBallot Integrity Act would immediately prohibit new purchases of \npaperless voting systems. By 2010, it would require a voter-verified \npaper record to be produced by all voting systems used in federal \nelections. It would ensure that laboratories that test voting systems \nwould not be hand-picked by vendors. And it would bar wireless and \ninternet components in voting systems. In addition, States would have \nto document which individuals have access to voting systems, and they \nwould have to agree on ways to train poll workers on how to operate \nmachinery. This approach deals with all elements of the voting \nprocess--and recognizes that good voting equipment cannot be secure \nwithout good procedures to protect the integrity of the vote.\n  While the debate rages over how California should respond to this new \nreport, it is important to stick to the basics. Vote verification is \nthe new consensus. More than half the States use paper records to \npreserve the vote count.\n  I know Americans are passionate about ensuring that their votes are \ncounted. California has taken an important step--and uncovered some \ndisturbing information. The Senate should support improving Federal \nelections by passing the Ballot Integrity Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10781-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF CONGRESSMAN RAY LaHOOD\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my appreciation and \nbest wishes to my good friend, Ray LaHood, who recently announced his \nintention to retire at the end of the 110th Congress.\n  His retirement next fall will mark the end of a long, successful \ncareer representing the 18th District of Illinois--first as a staffer \nfor 12 years for then-minority leader Bob Michel and then as a \ndistinguished member of Congress for seven terms.\n  Born in the district he has represented for over 13 years, Ray \nLaHood's constituents have always been his No. 1 priority. Long after \nRay leaves office, Illinoisans from Peoria to Jacksonville will benefit \nfrom his attention to local infrastructure needs, whether it is the \nroads, hospitals or arts projects of central Illinois.\n  He has been a champion for economic development in rural communities, \nexpanded use of alternative energy, and conservation efforts along the \nIllinois River. Ray and I also worked together earlier this year to \nhelp our Nation's servicemembers and veterans by introducing the Lane \nEvans Mental Health and Benefits Act.\n  But beyond his many legislative accomplishments is the distinctive \nspirit that Ray brought to his job. His time in Washington has been \nmarked by a willingness to speak the truth and work across party \nlines--traits that have earned him the highest respect and admiration \nfrom colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  For several years, Ray hosted bipartisan congressional retreats to \nbring Members of Congress together for an open dialogue about ways to \nsolve the country's problems in a civil manner. At a time in which \nCongress is marked by ideological warfare and harsh personal rhetoric, \nRay is always searching for ways to bridge the partisan divide and find \ncommonsense solutions to the problems facing average Americans. He \nwas--and is--the ideal successor to Bob Michel, the great statesman who \nmentored him.\n  On a personal note, I will always be grateful to him for joining me \nin opening my Springfield office in January 2005 shortly after I came \nto the Senate. That small gesture of bipartisanship meant a lot to a \nfreshman Senator and is a reflection of Ray's decency.\n  The people of central Illinois will miss Ray LaHood's hard work on \ntheir behalf, and I will miss his friendship.\n  I thank Ray for his many years of service to Illinois and to his \ncountry, and I wish him and his family all the best as he embarks upon \nthis next chapter in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10781-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO UNCLE HAROLD\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if one is going to boast on the Senate \nfloor, I assume I can be forgiven for boasting about close relatives.\n  My story is about my Uncle Harold--Harold Bach to be exact.\n  I called Harold last week and asked him what he had been doing. He \nsaid he had just gotten back from Minnesota. I asked, ``What were you \ndoing there?'' He said, ``Well I was running in the Senior Olympics \nevents.''\n  I guess it is not too unusual to have someone tell you that they are \nengaged in some track and field events. But my uncle is 87 years old. I \nsaid, ``Harold, what events did you enter?'' He said, ``I ran in the 50 \nmeter, the 100 meter and the 200 meter.'' I asked, ``How did you do?'' \nHarold said, ``I won three medals--a gold, a silver and a bronze.''\n  It wasn't news to me to hear that my uncle was running.\n  At age 72 Harold went to the Prairie Rose Games in North Dakota and \njust as a lark he entered races for age 70 and above. He easily won all \nthree races that he entered. Then he decided, you know--I must have a \ntalent here. It appears I can run faster than people my age. So he \nstarted running in other States. He ran in the Minnesota Senior \nOlympics, he ran in the South Dakota Senior Olympics, and then he was \nin Arizona and California.\n  He never stopped running. He has now won 100 medals in Senior \nOlympics events across the country. At age 87, I think he is still \nangling for more victories.\n  So I am announcing today that I am going to award my Uncle Harold a \ncertificate, designating him as the oldest, fastest runner in our \nState's history. No, I have not done any research to demonstrate that, \nbut I am sure it must be true. And besides, he's my uncle.\n  The message in having an 87-year-old uncle that runs the 100 meter \ndash in under 20 seconds is inspiring to me, and I hope, to everyone \nelse. It is a message that if you don't know what you can't do, maybe \nyou won't be surprised if you find out you can do it, even if others \nthink it is improbable.\n  None of us should be limited by our notions of what is impossible. My \nUncle Harold has described what is possible for him by trying--and \nsucceeding. It is a lesson that many of us should learn over and over \nagain. Defeat is not about trying and failing. Defeat is failing to \ntry. And when my uncle determined that he was faster than anybody his \nage, he got himself a pair of running shoes and filled his car with \ngas. Fifteen years later he has won 100 track and field medals.\n  So, hats off to my Uncle Harold! His accomplishments in Senior \nOlympics events are impressive and inspiring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10781-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10781-S10782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                CONGRATULATING MISS ASHLEY SAGISI MOSER\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the hard \nwork and meritorious sacrifice of the Army Veterinary Corps. Their \nefforts support the global war on terrorism by protecting not only the \nmilitary men and women serving our country, but our armed forces' \nanimals as well.\n  The Army Veterinary Corps was formally established in 1916. However, \nthe need for a military veterinary service was recognized as far back \nas the Revolutionary War. George Washington knew that if the Army used \nhorses, it needed farriers as well. The program continued through the \n19th century and when the Civil War began, the War Department issued \norders that provided each cavalry regiment with a veterinary surgeon. \nAs early as the 1890s, army veterinarians were sought to inspect meat, \npoultry and dairy products destined for the frontier posts.\n  Veterinary officers were first commissioned following the passage of \nthe National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, and the Army Veterinary Corps \nbecame a reality. While providing care to the military's working \nanimals would be part of the Army veterinarian's function, food safety \nand regulation was a primary mission upon the Army Veterinary Corps \ncreation.\n  After the start of World War I, veterinarians within the ranks of the \nArmy rose from 57 to 2,313 in just 18 months. Since World War I, the \nVeterinary Corps has remained an essential asset to our Nation's \nmilitary by ensuring the health of both our animals and troops. The Air \nForce formed a veterinary service in 1949 as well, but in 1979, \nCongress directed changes to Department of Defense's veterinary \nmissions and in 1980 the Army became DOD's Executive Agent for \nveterinary services.\n  Today the mission of the Army Veterinary Corps includes maintaining \nfood safety and defense, animal medicine, and medical research support. \nPart of this mission is protecting the food of deployed soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines. In the global war on terrorism, more than \n200 U.S. Army veterinarians have deployed in support of our Nation's \nefforts. The threat of BSE, the spinach recall due to pathogenic E. \ncoli, and the ongoing pet food recall are just a few examples that \nillustrate the necessity of having robust food safety programs \nthroughout DOD. Army veterinary service personnel audit more than 3,800 \nfood producers in more than 80 countries annually to ensure safe food \nfor service members and beneficiaries. Approximately 75 percent of \nemerging pathogens are zoonotic, meaning they are shared by both \nanimals and man, such as avian influenza.\n  Army veterinarians have actively contributed to military and \ninteragency planning processes as well. They recently participated in \nthe development of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Avian Influenza \nPlaybook in support of the National Response Plan. Veterinary personnel \nare also an essential contributor in overseas avian influenza testing \nand surveillance programs.\n  The Army Veterinary Corps executes programs to test for, monitor and \ncontrol other emerging diseases, like West Nile Virus, numerous food \nborne diseases, certain parasitic infections, and rabies. Army \nveterinarians direct animal medicine programs that protect both \nmilitary members and their pets. In the same role, they also provide \nveterinary medical care for the Government-owned and contractor \nmilitary working dogs which detect explosives, weapons and other \ndevices. These animals help to literally take these weapons out of the \nhands of terrorists and insurgents.\n  Here at home, military veterinary supervision of operational ration \nassembly plants, supply and distribution points, ports, and other types \nof subsistence operations are critical to ensuring safe, wholesome food \nfor our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their family members. \nThe service provided by the Army Veterinary Corps remains an \nincreasingly vital component of our homeland defense.\n  There are nearly 700 veterinarians serving on active duty, Army \nReserve, and National Guard today. These brave service men and women \nproudly protect our Nation and its animals. I offer my sincere thanks \nand appreciation to these veterinarians and their staffs who dedicate \ntheir time and efforts in aid to the United States of America. As a \nveterinarian, I am proud to see them portray a positive image of our \ncountry, both at home and deployed abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10782-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10782-S10783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING ADMIRAL EDMUND P. GIAMBASTIANI, JR.\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize ADM Edmund P. \nGiambastiani, Jr. for his 37 years of dedicated service to our Nation. \nNext month, Admiral Giambastiani, or ``Admiral G'' as he is known by \nthose who have worked closely with him, will retire from his position \nas Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A native New Yorker, \nAdmiral Giambastiani hails from Canastota, a small town near Syracuse. \nFollowing his graduation from Canastota High School, he entered the \nU.S. Naval Academy in the summer of 1966. For the next 4 years, Admiral \nGiambastiani learned and practiced many of the values and skills that \nwould guide him later in life and ultimately to the most senior levels \nof the Department of Defense.\n  Admiral Giambastiani's early career brought him back to the State of \nNew York where he served at the Naval Reserve Training Center in \nWhitestone and later at the Nuclear-Powered Training Unit in \nSchenectady. He served his first fleet assignments aboard the USS \nPuffer and USS Francis Scott Key. Later, Admiral Giambastiani commanded \nsubmarine NR-1, the Navy's only nuclear-powered, deep-diving ocean-\nengineering and research\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\nsubmarine, as well as the USS Richard B. Russell, whose crew was \nawarded three consecutive Battle Efficiency ``E'' awards, three Navy \nUnit Commendations, and two Fleet Commander Silver Anchors for \nexcellence in enlisted retention.\n  As his career progressed, so too did the assignments that the admiral \nwas given. Admiral Giambastiani led the Submarine Development Squadron \nTwelve, an attack submarine squadron that serves as the Navy's Warfare \nCenter of Excellence for submarine doctrine and attacks. He was also \nthe first director of strategy and concepts at the Naval Doctrine \nCommand and the commander of the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force. He \nserved as the commander of the Submarines Allied Command Atlantic; the \nAnti-Submarine and Reconnaissance Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, VA; and \nas NATO's first supreme allied commander for transformation. In each of \nthese assignments, Admiral Giambastiani performed his duties with \ndistinction.\n  On the morning of September 11, 2001, Admiral Giambastiani was \nworking in the Pentagon as the Senior Military Assistant to the \nSecretary of Defense. On that day and those that followed, Admiral \nGiambastiani worked tirelessly to respond to the aftermath of that \nattack.\n  Admiral Giambastiani served as commander of Joint Forces Command from \nOctober of 2002 to August of 2005. During this period, Joint Forces \nCommand deployed headquarters personnel in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, established assessment teams \nfor global contingency operations to ensure the application of joint \ndoctrine and practices, and provided oversight of numerous training \nexercises for deploying task force headquarters staffs to Iraq.\n  During this time, I worked closely with Admiral Giambastiani as a \nmember of Joint Forces Command's Transformation Advisory Group, a body \nthat the admiral formed to provide U.S. Joint Forces Command with \nindependent advice and recommendations on strategic, scientific, \ntechnical, intelligence and policy-related issues. I have great \npersonal and intellectual respect for Admiral Giambastiani and admire \nhis openness to new ideas, his commitment to joint transformation, and \nhis dedication to supporting our servicemembers.\n  In 2005, Admiral Giambastiani was nominated to serve as Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I had the honor of introducing \nAdmiral Giambastiani at his confirmation hearing before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. During his tenure as Vice Chairman, Admiral \nGiambastiani has worked diligently to improve and transform our \nNation's defense capabilities. He has served as the chairman of the \nJoint Requirements Oversight Council, where he worked to make it more \nresponsive to the requests of our military commanders and to \nsynchronize the delivery of resources needed by our servicemembers.\n  On behalf of my constituents in New York and of all Americans, I want \nto express my gratitude to Admiral Giambastiani for his many years of \npublic service. I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me today in recognizing and honoring Admiral Giambastiani for the \nservice and commitment to the country that he represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10783-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WALTER JOHNSON\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican who spent a little time in my home State of Idaho.\n  Today marks the 100th anniversary of Hall of Fame pitcher Walter \nJohnson's Major League debut for the Washington Senators. On this day--\nAugust 2--in 1907, Walter ``Big Train'' Johnson took the field as the \nstarting pitcher for the first time in what would be a 21-year career.\n  Interestingly enough, I actually have quite a bit in common with \nWalter Johnson. We both grew up in small towns; we share a connection \nto Washington County, ID. Johnson played semiprofessional ball in \nWeiser; I am a Republican, as was Johnson; and both of us are, or were, \nSenators--Johnson played for the Washington Senators.\n  Let me explain a little bit about our shared connection to Washington \nCounty. Walter Johnson was discovered while playing semiprofessional \nbaseball in the Idaho State League. He played for the team in Weiser, \nID; I could almost toss a baseball to Weiser from my hometown of \nMidvale. Johnson spent 2 years playing in Weiser from 1905 to 1907.\n  The Washington Senators tried to sign Johnson in 1906, but having \ngrown up in small towns in Kansas and California, Johnson preferred the \nsmall-town life and was unsure about moving to Washington, DC.\n  The following year, the Senators sent their catcher, Cliff \nBlankenship, to scout Johnson and try to sign him. Blankenship was told \nto try to get a hit off of Johnson.\n  Blankenship tried but was unsuccessful. He sent a telegram to his \nmanager back in Washington, saying, ``You can't hit what you can't see. \nI've signed him and he is on his way.''\n  For most of his career, Walter Johnson's pitches were considered to \nbe practically un-hittable. Because the radar gun had not yet been \ninvented, nobody knows for sure just how hard he could throw a \nbaseball. But most experts estimate that he could top 100 miles per \nhour with ease.\n  His stature was equally intimidating. Johnson stood 6-foot-1 and \nweighed in at 200 pounds, earning him the nickname ``The Big Train.''\n  Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was arguably the best hitter ever to play the \ngame. Cobb faced Walter Johnson in Johnson's debut game on August 2, \n1907. Although Johnson and the Senators lost, 3 to 2, Cobb gave Johnson \nhigh praise, saying, ``The first time I faced him, I watched him take \nthat easy windup, and then something went past me that made me flinch. \nI hardly saw the pitch, but I heard it. The thing just hissed with \ndanger. Every one of us knew we'd met the most powerful arm ever turned \nloose in a ballpark.''\n  Despite playing for teams that were routinely awful, Johnson won 417 \ngames in his career, second only to Cy Young, who won 511.\n  Johnson won 32 games in one season; compare that to today, where \nwinning 20 games is considered a major accomplishment.\n  The Big Train also holds a record that will likely never be broken: \nIn 1916, he pitched 369.2 innings without allowing a single home run.\n  Let me put this in perspective. Simply pitching that many innings in \na season today would be a remarkable feat. Most pitchers never come \nclose to 300 innings per season. It is truly phenomenal that Johnson \nwas physically able to pitch that many innings and totally unthinkable \nthat he could do it without allowing a single homerun. My colleague, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, who is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame \nhimself, could tell you what an extraordinary accomplishment this is.\n  Many credit Johnson with carrying the Washington Senators to their \nfirst and only World Series title in 1924. They defeated the New York \nGiants, four games to three.\n  It was truly a different era in America. Senators fans were so \necstatic that Johnson had carried them to the World Series that before \nthe first game, they presented him with a Lincoln Town Car as an \nexpression of their gratitude. At the time, it was the most expensive \ncar made in America and cost $8,000. That wouldn't happen today.\n  In time, Johnson grew to love Washington, DC and even got involved in \nlocal politics after he retired from baseball, winning a seat as a \ncounty commissioner in Montgomery County, MD.\n  He frequently held rallies and political events at his home, and \nran--unsuccessfully--for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Although Walter Johnson only spent a short time in Idaho--just over \ntwo seasons-we claim him as one of our own. We feel proud to have \nplayed an important role in launching the career of ``The Big Train,'' \nand I am honored today to mark the 100th anniversary of his Major \nLeague debut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10783-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10783-S10784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HATCH CHILE FESTIVIAL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The Hatch chile festival is the\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\npremiere celebration of this fiery food that is near and dear to the \nhearts of New Mexicans.

Mr. President, today I recognize the Georgia \nO'Keefe Museum in Santa Fe, NM, on its 10th anniversary. Georgia \nO'Keefe was, and remains, a New Mexico institution. The work she did \nwhile living in my State is held in the highest regard by artists and \nspectators alike.\n  Georgia O'Keefe settled in New Mexico in 1945 after being a frequent \nvisitor of the State seeking artistic inspiration. She is famous for \nher vibrant portrayals of flowers and unique New Mexico landscapes. Ms. \nO'Keefe has inspired a number of aspiring artists, and she is sure to \ninspire many more for many years. Her work is timeless. New Mexico is \nproud to be home to most of her prized work.\n  The Georgia O'Keefe Museum is the first museum dedicated to the work \nof a woman artist of international stature. It showcases well over \n1,000 pieces of Ms. O'Keefe's work. The museum has opened its doors to \nover one million visitors just in its first few years of operation; \ncountless others will enjoy it in the future. It also boasts a vast \neducation and outreach program that includes internships, teacher \nworkshops, seminars and even afterschool arts programs. The museum is \ndedicated to the study and interpretation of her work, as well as \nAmerican modernism.\n  The museum will commemorate the anniversary with a 10th anniversary \ncelebration. The celebration will include a dinner dance, \nentertainment, and obviously art. The event will not only commemorate \nGeorgia O'Keefe but also honor the museum's founders, Anne and John \nMarion. They have worked tirelessly to see that the artwork of Ms. \nO'Keefe is available for all to enjoy. Through their vision, the work \nof Georgia O'Keefe will be available for study and viewing for many \nyears to come.\n  I commend these two individuals for envisioning a place for Georgia \nO'Keefe's work to be displayed, and maintaining that vision for the \nlast 10 years. I believe Ms. O'Keefe would be proud of the work they \nhave done and honored to be held in such high regard with respect to \nher art.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10784-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LEAGUE TO SAVE LAKE TAHOE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I recognize the 50 years \nof great work by the League to Save Lake Tahoe.\n  The League to Save Lake Tahoe has a long history of fighting to \nprotect what I consider to be the crown jewel of the Sierra. The league \nwas founded in 1957 as the Tahoe Improvement and Conservation \nAssociation to fight runaway development in one of our Nation's most \nbeautiful regions. Since then, its membership has grown to 4,500 \npeople, but its mission remains the same: to protect Lake Tahoe's \nfamously clear waters and the surrounding area's natural beauty.\n  Protecting Lake Tahoe is an issue very dear to my heart. My love for \nTahoe goes back to my childhood, when I attended camp and rode horses \nthrough its beautiful forests. Today however, the lake's health is \nthreatened. Water clarity has declined from 102 feet in 1968 to 68 feet \ntoday, and the forests are more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.\n  The League to Save Lake Tahoe was influential in developing the \nEnvironmental Improvement Program that identified actions that needed \nto be taken to help restore Lake Tahoe and instrumental in organizing \nthe 1997 Presidential Forum. The league has continued to display an \nunwavering commitment to protecting the irreplaceable natural resources \nthe Lake Tahoe Basin is blessed with.\n  I would like to congratulate the League to Save Lake Tahoe on a half \ncentury of outstanding environmental stewardship and wish them the best \nof luck in their continuing mission to Keep Tahoe Blue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10784-4", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BEST BUDDIES\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Best \nBuddies Chapter from Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, \nMD, for being named ``Chapter of the Year'' by Best Buddies \nInternational. Best Buddies is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization \ndedicated to enhancing the lives of people with intellectual \ndisabilities by providing opportunities for one-to-one friendships and \nintegrated employment. Founded by Anthony K. Shriver in 1989, Best \nBuddies focuses on the importance of social integration for a group \nthat is often overlooked by society. They achieve their mission by \ncreating ``buddy pairs'' in student-run chapters at middle schools, \nhigh schools, and colleges around the world.\n  Every year, Best Buddies holds its international leadership \nconference at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN, where over 1,300 \nhigh school and college students are trained on how to run an effective \nBest Buddies chapter--skills that will serve them well throughout their \nacademic and professional lives. During the conference the organization \nacknowledges certain chapters that have achieved a particular level of \nexcellence throughout the past year. The Chapter of the Year is \nselected by the board of directors and is based on the quality of the \none-to-one friendships, chapter leadership, and activities. For 2007, \n75 chapters applied, and Walter Johnson High School was awarded this \nimpressive distinction.\n  This chapter exemplified the true meaning of team work. As a team \nthey worked together and planned incredibly successful events, \nfundraisers, and group outings. Their great sense of spirit and \nenthusiasm showed in every activity they undertook and in the deeply \nrewarding friendships they created. Through the tireless outreach of \nthe chapter members, the general student population at Walter Johnson \nlearned first hand that the similarities between children with and \nwithout intellectual disabilities far outweigh the differences.\n  I hope that you will join me in recognizing the importance of what \nthese high school students are doing through their participation in the \nBest Buddies program and the excellence with which they do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10784-5", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10784-S10785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON HIGHT\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to South Dakota \nrancher Don Hight for being recognized at the Third Annual National Day \nof the American Cowboy celebration in my home town of Murdo, SD.\n  Don was born in Mellette County, SD, in 1920. He served as an Army \nparatrooper in World War II. After his return from the war, Don married \nAdeline Fott and together they started ranching in Jones County, SD, \nwhere they raised their two children Dan and Cheryl.\n  In January of 1962, the farmer from small-town South Dakota made \nnational news when he began a 70-mile cattle drive, trailing 1800 head \nof cattle from his Jones County ranch along the White River to Winner, \nSD. On the third day into the trip, a blizzard hit with temperatures \nbelow zero and\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\nwinds reaching 35 miles per hour. As a result of his accomplishing this \ndifficult drive, his story was picked up by the national news and Don \nwas invited to appear in an episode of ``Rawhide'' which starred a \nyoung Clint Eastwood.\n  Don Hight displayed his strong patriotism following the September 11, \n2001, terrorist attacks, when he sold 100 head of calves to the Fort \nPierre Livestock and presented the check to the South Dakota Stock \nGrowers to buy beef certificates, which were given to the Salvation \nArmy for distribution to the victim's families.\n  Mr. Hight is truly a reflection of the American cowboy and proof that \nthe cowboy way of life is still alive and well in South Dakota. He is a \nman dedicated to his country, and the values that this country \nrepresents such as bravery, honor and respect for his fellow man. It is \npeople like Don that make the state of South Dakota such a great place \nto live.\n  It gives me pleasure to rise and pay tribute to Don Hight, a true \nAmerican cowboy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10785-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10785-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10785-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3248.

A bill to reauthorize the Rio Puerco Watershed Management \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nreauthorizing the Rio Puerco Watershed Management Program, which became \nlaw in 1996. In the 10 years since it was formalized by Congress, the \nRio Puerco Management Committee has helped facilitate a collaborative \napproach for the restoration of the highly degraded Rio Puerco \nWatershed, which at 7,000 square miles is the largest tributary to the \nRio Grande in terms of area and sediment.\n  The Rio Puerco was once known as New Mexico's breadbasket, with water \nsupply and soil tilth to support that reputation. Over time, extensive \necological changes have occurred in the Rio Puerco Watershed, some of \nwhich have resulted in damage to the watershed that has seriously \naffected the economic and cultural well-being of its inhabitants. This \nhas resulted in the loss of existing communities that were based on the \nland and were self-sustaining. According to the Bureau of Land \nManagement, while the Rio Puerco contributes less than 10 percent of \nthe total water to the Rio Grande, it represents the primary source of \nsedimentation entering the Upper Rio Grande with far reaching effects \nthroughout the lower portions of the river. For example, the Rio Puerco \ncontributes the majority of the silt entering Elephant Butte Reservoir \nabout 65 miles downstream of its confluence with the Rio Grande.\n  The Rio Puerco Management Committee has become one of the most \neffective collaborative land management efforts in the Southwest, \nparticularly given the challenges posed by the multi-jurisdictional \nnature of the watershed. It has successfully developed and implemented \nproposals for watershed rehabilitation on a collaborative basis with \nparticipation from private stakeholders, various Federal agencies, \nNative American Indian tribes, State agencies, and local governments. \nFor example, the committee took on the bold proposal of returning the \nRio Puerco to its original streambed, originally altered to accommodate \nthe construction of State Highway 44, now U.S. Highway 550, in the late \n1960s. According to the BLM, the channel became a primary contributor \nof erosion and sediment in the river main stem, and even began \nadvancing toward U.S. 550, threatening the highways stability. This \nlarge-scale project is one of only three in the entire country that has \nattempted to reintroduce a channelized river into its original meander.\n  I am proud to say that the committee's holistic approach has also \nfacilitated low-tech but time-intensive restoration projects and \ncommunity outreach initiatives which have actively engaged community \nmembers and the Youth Conservation Corps. This has helped develop a \nsense of ownership and community responsibility for the restoration of \nthe Rio Puerco while also providing our State's youth valuable resource \nmanagement skills and teaching them how to be responsible stewards of \nthe land now and in the future.\n  I am pleased Senator Domenici is a cosponsor of this reauthorization \nbill, and I thank him for always being a strong advocate for this \nprogram. The Rio Puerco Management Committee has demonstrated the \nachievements that can be made by working cooperatively to advance the \nrestoration of and maintenance of this watershed. It is also clear that \nmore work needs to be done, and it is my sincere hope that the Congress \nand the administration will continue to work in a similar cooperative \nmanner to ensure adequate funding is provided for this important \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the need for targeted restoration work \nin the Rio Puerco watershed came to my attention during the early \n1990s. Congress began funding local efforts to improve the Rio Puerco \narea in 1992, and the Rio Puerco Management Program was formally \nauthorized by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of \n1996.\n  The Rio Puerco Basin is the largest tributary to the Middle Rio \nGrande Basin. The watershed encompasses nearly 5 million acres and acts \nas drainage for portions of 7 counties in my home State of New Mexico. \nThe Rio Puerco watershed is a major source of silt in Elephant Butte \nReservoir. In fact, the Department of Interior's U.S. Geological Survey \nhas identified the Rio Puerco as having one of the highest sediment \nconcentrations. The objective of the collaborative program is to \ncurtail sedimentation from washing down the Rio Puerco to the Rio \nGrande and Elephant Butte. As intended, this program has helped to \nfacilitate cooperation between Federal, State, and local agencies along \nwith local landowners to improve the health of the Rio Puerco watershed \nby working together to implement projects that help control erosion and \nreduce the flow of sediment into the Rio Grande.\n  I believe the program has accomplished much during its tenure, and I \nfully support its objectives. I am pleased to join my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Bingaman, as a cosponsor of this bill, and I look \nforward to working with him to see that this important program is \nreauthorized.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 1942. A bill to amend part D of title V of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for the renovation of \nschools; to the Committee on Health, Education, labor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nSchool Repair and Renovation Act. I offer this legislation to meet the \nurgent need for support to repair crumbling schools in disadvantaged \nand rural school districts.\n  We all agree that school infrastructure requires constant \nmaintenance. Unfortunately, far too many schools have been forced to \nneglect ongoing issues, most likely due to lack of funds, which can \nlead to health and safety problems for students, educators and staff. \nThe most recent infrastructure report card issued by the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers gives public schools a ``D'' grade. Now, I \ndon't know many parents who would find ``D'' grades acceptable for \ntheir children. So why on earth would we stand by while the state of \nthe buildings in which our children learn are assigned such a grade?\n  Despite the declining condition of many public schools, Federal grant \nfunding is generally not available to leverage local spending. In \nfiscal year 2001, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee which I then chaired, I was able \nto secure $1.2 billion for school repair and renovation. I continue to \nhear nothing but positive feedback from educators across the country \nabout that funding.\n  But that one-time investment amounted to nothing more than a drop in \nthe bucket compared to the estimated national need. In 1995, the \nGeneral Accounting Office reported that the nation's K-12 schools \nneeded some $112 billion in repairs and upgrades. A more recent study \nby the National Education Association put the estimate as high as $322 \nbillion.\n  I have been heartened by the recent boom in local and State spending \non\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nschool facilities. However, the distribution of these recent \ninvestments has been overwhelmingly slanted to the most affluent \ncommunities which are better able to fund new investments without \noutside assistance. A 2006 study released by the Building Educational \nSuccess Together, BEST, coalition found that the quality of your \nchild's school is dependent upon his or her racial or ethnic background \nand whether they live in a rich or poor neighborhood.\n  Local spending on school facilities in affluent communities is almost \ntwice as high as in our most disadvantaged communities, as measured on \na per-pupil basis. The report also found that school districts with \npredominantly caucasian enrollment benefited from about $2000 more per \nstudent in school repair and construction spending than their peers \nliving in school districts with predominantly minority enrollment.\n  The Public School Repair and Renovation Act addresses that inequity \nby targeting school renovation grants to those communities that have \nstruggled to fund needed repairs. The bill builds on the model States \nfound successful in the fiscal year 2001 program. States would receive \nfunding based on their most recent Title I allocation to initiate a \ncompetitive grant program targeted to poor and rural school districts. \nStates have the discretion to require matching funds from the local \ndistrict bringing the potential funding to much more than the $1.6 \nbillion Federal investment.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Clinton, and \nMikulski for signing on to this bill. In addition, I am pleased to \nreport this legislation has the support of a diverse group of national \neducation organizations representing teachers, school boards, school \nadministrators, and principals.\n  The Public School Repair and Renovation Act takes a much needed step \nforward in fixing the inequity in public school facilities. Something \nis seriously wrong when children go to modern, gleaming movie theaters, \nshopping malls, and sports arenas, but attend public schools with \ncrumbling walls and leaking roofs. This sends exactly the wrong message \nto children about the importance of education.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support the Public School Repair and \nRenovation Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Casey, Ms. Collins, Mr. Graham, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1944. A bill to provide justice for victims of state-sponsored \nterrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Justice for \nVictims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act with my colleagues, Senators \nSpecter, Menendez, Cornyn, Coleman, Lott, Lieberman, Schumer, Clinton, \nCasey, Collins, Graham, Biden, Stevens, and Feinstein.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation on behalf of the many \nAmericans who have suffered at the hands of State sponsors of \nterrorism. This important legislation will allow victims of state \nsponsored terrorism to have their day in court. It will do so by \nenabling these individuals to both sue for liability and seek financial \ncompensation from the states, such as Iran, which committed these \nmurderous acts, thereby starving them of the funds that they use to \nstrike at innocent victims.\n  In 1983, the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, was \nbombed by the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah, killing 241 \nservicemen and wounding 100 others. In 2003, the U.S. District Court in \nWashington, DC, found the Republic of Iran, which directly supports \nHezbollah, guilty of masterminding that bombing. The victims and their \nfamilies have the right to sue their tormentors and have judgments \nagainst Iran, yet the judgments are not being enforced.\n  In 1996, the President signed into law legislation that I wrote to \namend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to give private American \ncitizens the right to hold U.S. Department of State-designated state \nsponsors of terrorism liable in U.S. courts. This legislation, also \nknown as the Flatow amendment, needs to be clarified and updated. The \nbill I am introducing today will bring clarity to this law on behalf of \nvictims of terrorism and reaffirm their right to sue and collect \ndamages from state sponsors of terrorism.\n  There are several reasons why the law needs to be improved. First, \nthe courts decided in 2004 in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of \nIran that, contrary to the intent of the Flatow amendment, there would \nbe no Federal private right of action against foreign governments. The \nruling stated that there could only be legal action against individual \nofficials and employees of that government. Second, current law permits \njudgment holders to only seize assets over which a terrorist state has \nday-to-day managerial control, thereby allowing terrorist states to \nhide their assets from the victims who have successful judgments \nagainst them. Third, state sponsors of terrorism, such as Libya, which \nis still responsible for terrorist acts it committed in the past, have \nconsistently abused the appeals process to delay litigation \nproceedings.\n  My new legislation will address these issues and improve the ability \nof victims to hold state sponsors of terrorism accountable. First, it \nwill update the Flatow amendment to improve its enforcement by \nreaffirming the right of private citizens to sue state sponsors of \nterrorism. Second, it will allow for the seizure of hidden commercial \nassets belonging to the terrorist state so that the victims of \nterrorism can be justly compensated. Third, it will limit the number of \nappeals that the terrorist state can pursue in U.S. courts. In \naddition, my legislation will provide foreign nationals working for the \nU.S. Government, if they are victims of a terrorist attack during their \nofficial duties, to be covered by these same provisions.\n  While nothing can bring back innocent lives lost to terrorism, the \nstate sponsors of these horrific acts must be made to pay for their \ncrimes. We are united in our belief that state-sponsored terrorism is \nwrong and that the perpetrators of terrorism must be brought to \njustice. This legislation will also strengthen our national security by \ncombating the desire and ability of foreign nations to both finance and \nsupport terrorism. Most importantly, it will empower those innocent \nvictims who have suffered from terrorism to seek justice through the \nrule of American law.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support justice \nfor victims of state sponsored terrorism by supporting this important \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a Federal income tax credit for Patriot \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when companies make headlines today it is \noften for all the wrong reasons: fraud, tax avoidance, profiteering, \netc. Yet many of the companies that are currently providing jobs across \nAmerica are conscientious corporate citizens that strive to treat their \nworkers fairly even as they seek to create good products that consumers \nwant and to maximize profits for their shareholders. I believe that we \nshould reward such companies for providing good jobs to American \nworkers, and create incentives that encourage more companies to do \nlikewise. The Patriot Employers bill does just that.\n  This legislation, which I am introducing today along with Senators \nObama and Brown, would provide a tax credit to reward the companies \nthat treat American workers best. Companies that provide American jobs, \npay decent wages; provide good benefits, and support their employees \nwhen they are called to active duty should enjoy more favorable tax \ntreatment than companies that are unwilling to make the same commitment \nto American workers. The Patriot Employers tax credit would put the tax \ncode on the side of those deserving companies by acknowledging their \ncommitments.\n  The Patriot Employers legislation would provide a tax credit equal to \n1 percent of taxable income to employers that meet the following \ncriteria:\n  First, invest in American jobs, by maintaining or increasing the \nnumber of full-time workers in America relative to the number of full-\ntime workers outside of America, by maintaining their corporate \nheadquarters in America if the company has ever been headquartered in \nAmerica, and by maintaining neutrality in union organizing drives.\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\n  Second, pay decent wages, by paying each worker an hourly wage that \nwould ensure that a full-time worker would earn enough to keep a family \nof three out of poverty, at least $7.80 per hour.\n  Third, prepare workers for retirement, either by providing a defined \nbenefit plan or by providing a defined contribution plan that fully \nmatches at least 5 percent of worker contributions for every employee.\n  Fourth, provide health insurance, by paying at least 60 percent of \neach worker's health care premiums.\n  Fifth, support our troops, by paying the difference between the \nregular salary and the military salary of all National Guard and \nReserve employees who are called for active duty, and also by \ncontinuing their health insurance coverage.\n  In recognition of the different business circumstances that small \nemployers face, companies with fewer than 50 employees could achieve \nPatriot Employer status by fulfilling a smaller number of these \ncriteria.\n  There is more to the story of corporate American than the widely-\npublicized wrong-doing. Patriot Employers should be publicly recognized \nfor doing right by their workers even while they do well for their \ncustomers and shareholders. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Obama, \nSenator Brown, and me in supporting this effort. Our best companies, \nand our American workers, deserve nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to help Federal prosecutors and investigators combat \npublic corruption by strengthening and clarifying the law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to \nintroduce the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act of 2007, a \nbill that will strengthen and clarify key aspects of Federal criminal \nlaw and provide new tools to help investigators and prosecutors attack \npublic corruption nationwide. This is the time to restore the faith of \nthe American people in their Government. Congress took an important \nstep in that direction today in passing long-awaited ethics and \nlobbying reforms that will tighten restrictions on those of us who hold \npublic office, and those who seek to lobby us on behalf of private \nindustry. But rooting out the kinds of rampant public corruption we \nhave seen in recent years requires us to go further and to give \nprosecutors the tools they need to effectively investigate and \nprosecute criminal public corruption offenses.\n  The most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing our \nown rules. Bribery and extortion are committed by people bent on \ngetting around the rules and banking that they will not get caught. \nThese offenses are very difficult to detect and even harder to prove. \nBecause they attack the core of our democracy, these offenses must be \nfound out and punished. Congress must send a signal that it will not \ntolerate this corruption by providing better tools for Federal \nprosecutors to combat it. This b1ll will do exactly that.\n  The bill Senator Cornyn and I introduce today, like a bill that I \nintroduced in the Senate in January, will provide investigators and \nprosecutors more time and resources to pursue public corruption cases. \nBut it goes a step further by amending several key statutes to broaden \ntheir application in corruption contexts and to prevent corrupt public \nofficials and their accomplices from evading or defeating prosecution \nbased on existing legal ambiguities.\n  The bill will help improve the prosecution of public corruption \noffenses in three fundamental ways. First, the bill would give \ninvestigators and prosecutors more time and resources to uncover, \ncharge, and prove three of the most serious and corrosive public \ncorruption offenses. Specifically, it would extend the statute of \nlimitations from 5 years to 6 years for prosecutions involving bribery, \ndeprivation of honest services by a public official, and extortion by a \npublic official. Public corruption cases are among the most difficult \nand time-consuming cases to investigate and prosecute. They often \nrequire the use of informants and electronic monitoring, as well as \nreview of extensive financial and electronic records, techniques which \ntake time to develop and implement. Bank fraud, arson and passport \nfraud, among other\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\noffenses, all have 10-year statutes of limitations. Public corruption \noffenses cut to the heart of our democracy, and a more modest increase \nto the statute of limitations is a reasonable step to help our \ncorruption investigators and prosecutors do their jobs.\n  The bill would also provide significant additional funding for public \ncorruption enforcement. Since 9/11, FBI resources have been shifted \naway from the pursuit of public corruption cases to counterterrorism. \nFBI Director Mueller has recently indicated that public corruption is \nnow a top criminal investigative priority; but a September 2005 report \nby Department of Justice Inspector General Fine found that, from 2000 \nto 2004, there was an overall reduction in public corruption matters \nhandled by the FBI. This must be reversed; our bill will give Offices \nof Inspector General, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Offices, and the \nPublic Integrity Section of the Department of Justice additional \nresources to hire additional public corruption investigators and \nprosecutors. These offices will finally be able to have the manpower \nthey need to track down and prosecute these difficult but crucially \nimportant cases.\n  Second, the bill contains a series of legislative fixes designed to \nimprove the clarity and enhance the effectiveness of existing Federal \ncorruption statutes, such as the law criminalizing the acceptance of \nbribes and gratuities, and the law that govern mail and wire fraud. The \nbribery-gratuities fix resolves ambiguity in the law by making clear \nthat public officials may not accept anything of value, other than what \nis permitted by existing regulations, that is given to them because of \ntheir official position. Similarly, the bill appropriately expands the \ndefinition of what it means for a public official to perform an \n``official act'' for the purposes of the bribery statute to include any \nactions that fall within the duties of that official's public office. \nThe bill also adds two corruption-related crimes as predicates for the \nFederal wiretap and the racketeering statutes, lowers the transactional \namount required for Federal prosecution of bribery involving federally-\nfunded state programs, and expands venue for perjury and obstruction of \njustice prosecutions.\n  Third, the bill raises the statutory maximum penalties for theft of \nGovernment property and Federal bribery to reflect the serious and \ncorrosive nature of these crimes, and to harmonize these statutory \nmaximums with others for which Congress has already raised penalties. \nIncreasing penalties in appropriate cases sends a message to would-be \ncriminals and to the public that there will be severe consequences for \nbreaching the public trust.\n  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct \nthat we have recently witnessed in high-profile public corruption \ncases, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to give investigators \nand prosecutors the tools and resources they need to enforce our laws. \nPassing the ethics and lobbying reform bill is a step in the right \ndirection. But we must finish the job by strengthening the criminal law \nto enable Federal investigators and prosecutors to bring those who \nundermine the public trust to justice. I strongly urge Congress to do \nmore to restore the public's faith in their Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this important \nlegislation with Senator Patrick Leahy, the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. This bill is yet another example of the great \nthings that can come from bipartisan cooperation.\n  Public corruption is not a Republican or Democratic problem. It is a \nWashington, DC problem. It is a problem in statehouses and city halls \nacross this country. Our citizens deserve to be governed by the rule of \nlaw, not the rule of man. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, \na few rotten apples have a tendency to spoil the bunch.\n  The legislation we introduce today, the Public Corruption Prosecution \nImprovements Act, will strengthen the enforcement of U.S. Federal laws \naimed at combating betrayals of public dollars and public trust. Our \nbill does this both by making substantive changes to public corruption \nlaws and by giving prosecutors new tools to use in their battle against \ncorrupt officials.\n  The Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act increases the \nmaximum punishments on several offenses, including theft and \nembezzlement of Federal funds, bribery, and a number of corrupt \ncampaign contribution practices. For example, it cracks down on theft \nor bribery related to entities that receive Federal funds, by \nincreasing the maximum sentence for a conviction from 10 to 15 year and \nlowering the threshold that prosecutors must prove, from $5,000 to \n$1,000. It clarifies the law in response to several court decisions \nnarrowly interpreting the public corruption statutes. For example, the \nbill broadens the definitions of ``illegal gratuities'' and ``official \nacts,'' clarified that an entire ``course of conduct'' can be the \nresult of bribery, and clarified that intangible property interests \nsuch as licenses can now trigger the mail and wire fraud provisions.\n  Federal investigators who seek to root out corrupt officials will \nbenefit from new tools provided in this legislation. The bill would \nextend the statute of limitations on certain serious public corruption \noffenses, giving prosecutors more time to investigate and build a case. \nIt expands the criminal venue provisions, allowing prosecutors to bring \nthe case against corrupt officials in any district where any part of \nthe corruption occurred. The bill similarly expands the venue for \nperjury and obstruction of justice.\n  Finally, the legislation gives Federal law enforcement what they need \nmost to prosecute public corruption: more resources. Funding of $25 \nmillion for each of the fiscal years 2008-2011 will help enhance the \nability of the Department of Justice and the Offices of Inspectors \nGeneral to effectively combat fraud and public corruption.\n  Importantly, these improvements to current law come with significant \ninput from the career professionals in the Department of Justice.\n  But this legislation by itself is only a start if we want to clean up \nWashington, DC. Two additional reforms, in particular, are necessary: \nthe OPEN Government Act, and earmark reform. The operations of \nGovernment should be as transparent as possible. Quite simply, refusing \nto let the public have full access to Government records is a betrayal \nof public trust. This Senate must live up to its duty to provide \ntransparent government and pass the crucial FOIA reforms contained in \nthe OPEN Government Act.\n  Similarly, Congress too often permits its members to walk ethical \ntight-\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nropes through questionable earmarking practices. The public sees these \nfor what they too often are: handouts of taxpayer money to special \ninterests. I think it is of the utmost importance that we increase \ntransparency in the earmarking process, exposing the process to the \nlight of the day.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Public Corruption Prosecution \nImprovements Act, as well as these other important reforms. I look \nforward to debating these issues in Committee and here on the Senate \nfloor. And I thank Chairman Leahy for his leadership on this and other \nlegislation we have crafted together.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1947. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the quality improvement organization (QIO) program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Baucus to introduce the Continuing the Advancement of \nQuality Improvement Act.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to reform Medicare's troubled \nQuality Improvement Organization, QIO, program. QIOs and their \npredecessor organizations have long been responsible for ensuring that \nthe care Medicare beneficiaries receive is medically necessary, meets \nrecognized standards and is provided in appropriate settings. They are \ncurrently tasked with a wide variety of important roles ranging from \ninvestigating beneficiary complaints of poor quality care to giving \ntechnical assistance to Medicare providers for improving health care \nquality.\n  I have been an advocate of reforming the QIO program for quite some \ntime. About 2 years ago, I initiated an investigation into a number of \nthe QIOs. Those investigations revealed a program that is in desperate \nneed of reform. This program was running with little or no oversight, \nand it was expending more than $1 billion every 3 years with little \nmeasurable results. In other words, I found trouble. Let me elaborate \non a few disturbing things that I discovered. I found that one QIO \nleased residential properties for board members and a CEO. That same \nQIO also used Federal funds to lease automobiles for its top \nexecutives. I also found other QIOs who had board members and staff \nattend conferences, many at lavish resorts.\n  I was not the only one to identify serous concerns with the QIOs. \nOthers identified concerns too. Specifically, the Institute of \nMedicine, IOM, the General Accountability Office, GAO, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, Office of the Inspector \nGeheral (OIG) all identified numerous concerns about the effectiveness \nof this program. These independent organizations also voiced their \nconcerns with the manner in which it is operated and have made \nrecommendations for major reform. Their findings clearly show the need \nto hold the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and the \norganizations that serve as QIOs accountable for the important tasks \nthey must perform.\n  The Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act will ensure \nthat the QIO program is not only effective in improving the quality of \ncare provided to our Medicare beneficiaries, but also that it operates \nin an effective, efficient and accountable manner. Much of this \nlegislation is based on the investigations that I conducted and the \ntroubling findings that I came across and on the work of the IOM, the \nGAO, and the HHS OIG.\n  First, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould focus the mission of the QIO program on quality improvement. QIOs \ncurrently have many diverse responsibilities. As a result, they served \nconflicting roles of both ``regulator'' and ``technical assistant.'' \nThis conflict poses significant barriers to QIOs effectively serving \neither role, and we have come to learn that they really don't perform \neither function particularly well.\n  The legislation would also address this conflict by following the \nIOM's recommendation to make the sole purpose of QIOs to be technical \nassistants for quality improvement and performance measurement. The HHS \nSecretary would be required to transfer all other QIO: responsibilities \nto other entities called Medicare Provider Review Organizations, MPROs, \nin a manner that will support the needs of beneficiaries and be \naccountable to them.\n  Second, the legislation would improve the beneficiary complaint \nreview process that I think is in desperate need of reform. You may \nrecall that in 2006 we read about the plight of Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff \nwent to a QIO and filed a complaint about the care provided to his \nwife, who died. The QIO in that case was unresponsive to Mr. Schiff. He \nwas forced to take legal action to learn what the QIO found out about \nhis wife's death. He should not have had to do that. After all, he was \nthe one who filed the complaint with the QIO in the first place because \nhe thought that someone did something wrong that lead to his wife's \ndeath. It was at that juncture that I learned that the beneficiary \ncomplaint review process was too opaque and ineffective. More \nimportantly, beneficiaries were not being properly served. In fact, I \ncame to learn that complainants often do not receive the findings of \nthe investigation conducted by the QIO. Now I ask; what sense does that \nmake?\n  The Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act would \nrequire MPROs to report the investigational findings to the complainant \nand refer the provider to a QIO for technical assistance and/or the \nappropriate regulatory body for sanctions. In other words, this part of \nthe bill would bring transparency to a process now shrouded in a cloud \nof silence.\n  Third, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould ensure that limited resources go to providers that need them the \nmost. The GAO recently found that QIOs prioritized their assistance to \nproviders who would be easiest to help rather than the providers who \nwere most in need of help. In other words the QIOs decided it was \neasier to take a B plus student and make them into an A student rather \nthan putting their resources into the D student to bring them up to \npar. I guess that way they thought that they would look better and more \nsuccessful. But if you ask me; that is not the best way to spend \nlimited taxpayer resources. Now, this bill will insure that if demand \nfor technical assistance exceeds available resources, the QIOs would \ngive priority to providers that are in rural or underserved areas, in \nfinancial need, have low performance measures or have a significant \nnumber of beneficiary complaints. In other words the help is going to \ngo to those who need it most.\n  Fourth, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould make QIO data more available to CMS and providers for quality \nimprovement and patient safety purposes. Amazingly enough, QIOs are \ncurrently restricted from sharing such data despite the obvious value \nof this data for improving health care quality. This legislation would \npermit the sharing of QIO data with providers for quality improvement \nand patient safety purposes and require CMS to make recommendations on \nhow to improve the data sharing process.\n\n  Fifth, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould promote competition in the QIO program. This is a giant leap \nforward. These organizations are currently not subject to significant \ncompetition because of limitations on who can be a QIO and the \navailability of noncompetitive contract renewals. This lack of \ncompetition has led to a gross lack of accountability and stagnation in \nthe QIO program. This legislation would promote competition by allowing \nother types of organizations to serve as QIOs and eliminate \nnoncompetitive renewals.\n  Sixth, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould enhance governance at the QIOs. During the course of my \ninvestigations I identified repeated failures in governance. I exposed \nboard members who were more interested in helping themselves than \nhelping others.\n  This bill will also address board member conflicts of interest. My \ninvestigations identified numerous incidents of questionable QIO \ngovernance practices and board member conflicts of interest. Since the \nQIO program receives over $400 million in taxpayer funding every year, \nit is reasonable for us to expect not only that QIOs are governed in an \nethical manner free of conflicts of interest, but also that CMS \nappropriately oversees the program. This\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\nlegislation would require QIOs to comply with board governance \nrequirements and would require CMS to establish procedures to address \nconflicts of interest and follow those procedures.\n  Finally, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould increase much needed accountability in the QIO program. The I0M, \nthe GAO and the HHS OIG have all questioned the effectiveness of the \nQIO program. This legislation would require the Secretary to perform \ninterim and final evaluations of program effectiveness not only at the \nindividual QIO level, but at the overall QIO program level as a whole. \nAlso, high performing QIOs would receive financial rewards while low \nperforming QIOs would receive financial penalties. Finally, the \nSecretary would be required to submit a more detailed annual report \nshowing performance results of QIOs and MPROs and details on how \ntaxpayer dollars are spent.\n  We have been placing more emphasis on the quality of care that our \nMedicare beneficiaries receive from providers. You see this as we \nrequire more transparency in the Medicare program with the public \nreporting of provider quality measures. You also see this as we \ntransform Medicare from being a passive payer of services of any \nquality to a value-based purchaser. These are important reforms that \nwill help improve the quality of care provided in the Medicare program \nand work toward ensuring that limited resources are used more \nefficiently and wisely.\n  As we move toward a payment system based on quality, the reforms in \nthis bill will position the QIO program to support that transformation \nin Medicare to a quality-based purchaser by making the tools and \nassistance available to help Medicare providers improve the quality of \nthe care they provide. The Continuing the Advancement of Quality \nImprovement Act would ensure the QIO program's ability to provide this \nassistance in an effective, efficient and accountable manner and \ncorrect the problems currently plaguing the program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nGrassley in introducing the Continuing the Advancement of Quality \nImprovement Act of 2007.\n  This bill represents another step in our commitment to improving the \nquality of care provided for Medicare beneficiaries and all Americans.\n  The Medicare program funds Quality Improvement Organizations, known \nas QIOs, in part to work with health care providers to help them \nimprove the quality of care they provide.\n  QIOs have played an evolving role in Medicare. Recently, the QIO \nprogram has received a great deal of attention. Not only did Senator \nGrassley and I have the Senate Finance Committee look into aspects of \nQIO operations, but the Institute of Medicine, the Government \nAccountability Office, and the Health and Human Services' Inspector \nGeneral have all opined about QIOs as well. It seems there is a \nconsensus that the QIO program could be doing more to help improve the \nquality of care.\n  That is not to say that QIOs have not been doing good work and \nproviding valuable services up until now. Quite the opposite. However, \nover the course of time, QIOs have been tasked with a number of \nresponsibilities and the program's mission has become blurred.\n  What Senator Grassley and I found, as well as the IOM, the GAO, and \nthe HHS, OIG, is that the QIO program needs a sharper focus. Its \nmission to improve quality must be clear and unambiguous. Therefore, \nthe Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement, or CAQI, Act \nwould focus QIOs on providing technical assistance for quality \nimprovement and performance measurement.\n  The bill would separate the beneficiary complaint process from QIOs \nand give this responsibility to Medicare Provider Review Organizations, \nwhich will be required to report to the complainant and refer the \nprovider to a QIO for technical assistance and/or the appropriate \nregulatory body for sanctions. This will make the complaint review \nprocess stronger.\n  The CAQI Act would ensure that QIOs devote their attention to the \nhealth care providers that need help the most. It would also permit \nsharing QIO data with providers for quality improvement and patient \nsafety purposes.\n  The Finance Committee investigation of the QIO program led Senator \nGrassley and I to include certain provisions we believe will enhance \nthe integrity of the program. So, the CAQI Act would promote \ncompetition by allowing other types of organizations to serve as QIOs \nand eliminating noncompetitive renewals.\n  To ensure ``corporate'' integrity, the CAQI Act would establish \nrequirements for governance and boards of directors at the QIOs, as \nwell as requiring CMS to establish ways to avoid conflicts of interest.\n  The CAQI Act aims to ensure greater accountability for individual \nQIOs, and the QIO program as a whole. It would require the Secretary to \nperform evaluations of the effectiveness of each QIO and the whole \nprogram. QIOs would be evaluated on consistent measures that are based \non nationwide priorities for quality improvement. The Secretary would \nbe required to report to Congress annually on QIO performance, \nincluding how program funds were spent.\n  The QIO program is an asset to the Medicare program and the health \ncare system in general. We have an opportunity to improve its \neffectiveness. We can make it a more useful tool as we continue \nadvancing toward quality improvement. We have a duty to make the \nMedicare program as strong and robust as it can be. The Continuing the \nAdvancement of Quality Improvement Act presents an opportunity to do \njust that. Senator Grassley and I urge our Colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 1949.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Manufacturing Act of 1946 \nto require labeling of raw agricultural forms of ginseng, including the \ncountry of harvest, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss legislation I am \nintroducing with the Senior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, which \nwould protect ginseng farmers and consumers by ensuring that ginseng is \nlabeled accurately with where the root was harvested. The Ginseng \nHarvest Labeling Act of 2007 is similar to bills that I introduced in \nprevious Congresses and developed after hearing suggestions from \nginseng growers and the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to discuss American ginseng and \nthe problems facing Wisconsin's ginseng growers so that my colleagues \nunderstand the need for this legislation. Chinese and Native American \ncultures have used ginseng for thousands of years for herbal and \nmedicinal purposes. As a dietary supplement, American ginseng is widely \ntouted for its ability to improve energy and vitality, particularly in \nfighting fatigue or stress.\n  In the U.S., ginseng is experiencing increasing popularity as a \ndietary supplement, and I am proud to say that my home State of \nWisconsin is playing a central role in ginseng's resurgence. Wisconsin \nproduces over 90 percent of the ginseng grown in the U.S., with the \nvast majority of that ginseng grown in just one Wisconsin county, \nMarathon County. Ginseng is also grown in a number of other states such \nas Maine, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, \nand West Virginia.\n  For Wisconsin, ginseng has been an economic boon. Wisconsin ginseng \ncommands a premium price in world markets because it is of the highest \nquality and because it has a low pesticide and chemical content. In \n2002, U.S. exports of ginseng totaled nearly $45 million, much of which \nwas grown in Wisconsin. With a huge market for this high-quality \nginseng overseas, and growing popularity for the ancient root here at \nhome, Wisconsin's ginseng industry should have a prosperous future \nahead.\n  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious \nproblem, smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is \nconsidered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go \nto great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as \n``Wisconsin-grown.''\n  Here is how the switch takes place: Wisconsin ginseng is shipped to \nChina to be sorted into various grades. While the sorting process is \nitself a legitimate part of distributing ginseng, smugglers too often \nuse it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng with Asian or Canadian-\ngrown ginseng considered inferior by consumers. The lower quality \nginseng is then shipped back to the U.S. for sale to American consumers \nwho think they are buying the Wisconsin-grown product.\n  There is good reason consumers should want to know that the ginseng \nthey buy is American-grown considering that the only accurate way of \ntesting ginseng to determine where it was grown is to test for \npesticides that are banned in the U.S. The Ginseng Board of Wisconsin \nhas been testing some ginseng found on store shelves, and in many of \nthe products, residues of chemicals such as DDT, lead, arsenic, and \nquintozine, PCNB, have been detected. Since the majority of ginseng \nsold in the U.S. originates from countries with less stringent \npesticide standards, it is vitally important that consumers know which \nginseng is really grown in the U.S.\n  To capitalize on their product's preeminence, the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin has developed a voluntary labeling program, stating that the \nginseng is ``Grown in Wisconsin, U.S.A.'' However, Wisconsin ginseng is \nso valuable that counterfeit labels and ginseng smuggling have become \nwidespread around the world. As a result, consumers have no way of \nknowing the most basic information about the ginseng they purchase--\nwhere it was grown, what quality or grade it is, or whether it contains \ndangerous pesticides.\n  My legislation, the Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act of 2007, proposes \nsome common sense steps to address some of the challenges facing the \nginseng industry. My legislation requires that ginseng, as a raw \nagricultural commodity, be clearly labeled with the country of harvest \nat the point of importation or when it is sold at wholesale or retail. \n``Harvest'' is important because some Canadian and Chinese growers have \nginseng plants that originated in the U.S., but because these plants \nwere cultivated in a foreign country, they may have been treated with \nchemicals not allowed for use in the U.S. This label would also allow \nbuyers of ginseng to more easily prevent foreign companies from mixing \nforeign-produced ginseng with ginseng harvested in the U.S. The country \nof harvest labeling is a simple but effective way to enable consumers \nto make an informed decision.\n  I have also made sure that these straight-forward labeling provisions \nare reasonable for the legitimate importers, wholesalers and retailers \nof ginseng. My bill only covers ginseng as a raw root, the form in \nwhich the majority of the high quality Wisconsin ginseng is sold. I \nhave also clarified the legislation to make it clear that retailers are \nonly responsible for transmitting the country of harvest label that \nthey received from the importer or wholesaler to the consumer. So if \nthe retailer never received the country of harvest label, it is only \nthe wholesaler or importer that is liable. Moreover, I added a \nprovision that requires the USDA to conduct outreach to the \nwholesalers, importers, retailers, trade associations and other \ninterested parties during the 180 days provided before the labeling \nrequirement takes effect.\n  Besides the support from the ginseng growers of the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin, I am glad to have the support of the American Herbal \nProducts Association and the United Natural Products Alliance. The \nsupport of both the growers of ginseng and these trade associations \nfocused on herbal and natural products are further testament to the \nbroad support for the legislation Senator Kohl and I introduce today.\n  These commonsense reforms would give ginseng growers the support they \ndeserve and help consumers make informed choices about the ginseng that \nthey consume. We must ensure that when ginseng consumers seek out a \nhigh-quality ginseng root--such as Wisconsin-grown ginseng, they are \ngetting the real thing, not a knock-off.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1953\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to pharmacies under part D; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pharmacy Access \nImprovement Act of 2007. This is an updated version of a bill I \nintroduced last year, and I am proud to bring it back.\n  I am excited that this year's bill is bipartisan. I am happy that \nSenator Grassley has joined me in introducing this bill. Given all of \nour work together on the Medicare prescription drug benefit, I am glad \nhe is a cosponsor. I also am pleased to have our Senate colleagues join \nus on this important piece of legislation.\n  The Medicare prescription drug benefit got off to a bumpy start last \nyear. A lot of the problems have been fixed, and the benefit is \nproviding millions of seniors with access to affordable prescription \ndrugs. Unfortunately, a number of the problems facing pharmacists \nremain. We need to help them.\n  The Medicare drug benefit brought about big changes to the pharmacy \nbusiness. Dual eligible beneficiaries switched from Medicaid to \nMedicare drug coverage. Many more seniors have drug coverage. Dozens of \nnew private drug plans are available.\n  I have heard from pharmacists in Montana who are struggling. They are \ntrying to help their patients. But they face great difficulty. The \nsuccess of the Medicare drug benefit depends on the pharmacists who \ndeliver the drugs. So we have to help them. We must act now, before \npharmacists find that they are no longer able to provide drugs to \nMedicare beneficiaries, or to provide drugs at all.\n  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would do several things to help \npharmacies. First, it would strengthen the access standards that drug \nplans have to meet. It is important that the drug plans contract with \nbroad and far-reaching networks of pharmacies. This bill would ensure \nthat the pharmacies that drug plans count in their networks provide \nreal access to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  It would also help safety net pharmacies to join drug plan networks. \nThese pharmacies serve the most vulnerable patients and should be able \nto continue to do so. Drug plans should not be allowed to exclude \nsafety net pharmacies. Excluding them does a huge disservice to needy \nbeneficiaries. This bill would rectify the problems that safety net \npharmacies have encountered in participating in the Medicare drug \nbenefit.\n  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would speed up reimbursement to \npharmacies. The delays in receiving payment from drug plans have forced \npharmacies to seek additional credit, dip into their savings, or worse, \nas they try to continue operations. This bill would require drug plans \nto pay promptly. Most claims would be reimbursed within 2 weeks. And \nthe bill would impose a monetary penalty on plans that pay late.\n  One of the most common complaints from beneficiaries has been how \nconfusing the practice of co-branding is. Co-branding is when a drug \nplan partners with a pharmacy chain and then includes the pharmacy's \nlogo or name on its marketing materials and identification cards. This \nis confusing, because it sends the message that drugs are available \nonly from that pharmacy. That is not true. To help end this confusion, \nthe Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would prohibit drug plans from \nplacing pharmacy logos or trademarks on their identification cards and \nrestrict other forms of co-branding.\n  This bill would also require that plans provide pharmacists with more \naccurate and updated information about reimbursement rates. Currently, \nsome plans do not divulge to pharmacists how much a particular \nprescription will be reimbursed prior to dispensing. This bill would \nrequire disclosure before a pharmacist dispenses. It would require \nregular updating and disclosure of pricing standards.\n  The problems that pharmacists are facing are real. And they are not \ngoing away. We must act on the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act before \nit is too late for many pharmacists and the beneficiaries whom they \nserve. We have a duty to make the Medicare drug benefit as strong and \nrobust as it can be. And the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act presents \nan opportunity for us to do just that. My cosponsors and I urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Baucus, as well as Senators Lincoln, Roberts, Conrad, \nEnzi, Schumer, Cochran, Salazar, Smith, Bingaman, and Snowe, to \nintroduce the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act.\n  I am pleased with how well the Medicare Part D program is working. It \nhas demonstrated how effectively private sector competition can work in \ndelivering an entitlement benefit. The program has defied official \npredictions and come in under budget by $113 billion compared to the \nbaseline projected in 2006. Premiums, initially estimated at $37 for \n2006, in fact averaged $23; in 2007 they fell to an average of $22. We \nunderstand that this year's bids are even lower and that premiums are \nexpected to fall again next year. The vast majority of Medicare \nbeneficiaries have enrolled in the program, and while there were some \ntroubling start-up problems initially, beneficiaries are very pleased \nwith their plans.\n  At the same time, the first years of implementation of the Part D \nprogram have revealed some areas in which the program can be improved. \nOne is related to pharmacy participation in the program. Changes are \nneeded to ensure that Part D treats pharmacies as Congress intended and \nto make the program friendlier to pharmacists and independent \npharmacies.\n  As Senator Baucus, Senator Lincoln, and my other colleagues and I \ntalked to beneficiaries, pharmacists, pharmacy owners and prescription \ndrug plans about changes that would make Medicare Part D work better, \nmany of our discussions centered around how to make sure that Part D \nworks not just\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\nfor the beneficiaries, the chain drug-stores, and the plans, but also \nfor the local, independent pharmacies, the long-term care pharmacies, \nand the safety net pharmacies that many beneficiaries rely on. That is \nexactly what this bill is intended to do.\n  My colleagues and I hope with this bill to improve contracting for \npharmacies, increase CMS's and prescription drug plans' customer \nservice, and give beneficiaries better access to pharmacies. Let me \ngive you some of the specifics of the bill.\n  First, the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would strengthen standards \nfor ensuring convenient beneficiary access to pharmacies. During the \nfirst two years of implementation, CMS has permitted some plans to meet \nthe pharmacy access requirements in the law by counting non-preferred \nand out-of-network pharmacies. The plans charge higher cost-sharing at \nthese pharmacies to discourage their use and drive utilization to \npreferred pharmacies. Counting non-preferred and out-of-network \npharmacies to meet the access requirements is clearly not what Congress \nhad in mind in establishing the beneficiary access guarantees in the \nlaw. To correct this problem, this bill would require that plans, with \ncertain exceptions, count only ``open'' pharmacies, those that are \naccessible to the general public, in meeting the Medicare pharmacy \naccess standard.\n  It also would require plans to count only their preferred in-network \npharmacies, not the non-preferred pharmacies, in determining whether \nthey meet the access standard.\n  The bill would allow pharmacies to initiate negotiations with plans \nunder the ``any willing pharmacy'' provision regardless of whether they \nhad already rejected, or failed to act on, previous offers from the \nplan.\n  The bill also would help ensure the inclusion of safety-net \npharmacies in a prescription drug plan's network by preventing plans \nfrom specifically excluding 340B entities in the terms of their \ncontracts. 340B entities include federally qualified health centers, \nmigrant health centers, health centers for residents of public housing, \nschool health centers, as well as black lung clinics, entities \nreceiving grants for early intervention for HIV under the Ryan White \nAct, disproportionate share hospitals, and others. They serve more than \nten million people.\n  Many of these entities operate their own pharmacies, which operate \nunder different constraints than other retail pharmacies. They may have \nabbreviated hours or be available only to patients of the 340B entity. \nIf 340B entities' pharmacies are not available as in-network pharmacies \nin Part D, these patients may have difficulty getting their \nprescription drugs.\n  The Model Safety Net Pharmacy Addendum was developed by the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Health Research and Services \nAdministration to facilitate 340B entities' participation in Medicare \nPart D. Because it takes the 340B entities' special circumstances into \naccount, it has appropriate contract language for Part D plans to use \nwhen contracting with safety net pharmacies. Under the bill, plans \nwould have to apply the Model Safety Net Pharmacy Addendum to their \ncontracts if a 340B entity so requests.\n\n  The bill also would require plans to include a contract provision to \nallow these safety net pharmacies to waive cost-sharing if the entity \nso requests. Many safety-net pharmacies waive cost-sharing for their \npatients, but the Part D plan contracts typically prohibit this. Given \nthat 340B entities serve low-income and poor populations, we believe \nthose entities should be able to waive cost sharing for drugs, and our \nbill would facilitate that.\n  We have found that long-term care pharmacies similarly operate under \nconditions different from those of retail pharmacies serving the \ngeneral population. For institutionalized populations, each resident's \ndaily drugs must be specially packaged to help ensure that each gets \nthe drugs meant for her, not for other residents. Long-term care \npharmacies specialize in this, but the Part D rules to date do not \nadequately reflect how long-term care pharmacies work with long-term \ncare facilities, which affects residents' access to these pharmacies. \nOur bill would require the Secretary to establish rules that include \npharmacy access standards for long-term care residents.\n  Another problem that has arisen in the implementation of Part D \nconcerns the ability of beneficiaries to obtain extended supplies of \ntheir drugs from a local pharmacy. Our bill therefore would ask the \nSecretary to establish standards for access to pharmacies that dispense \nextended supplies of covered drugs.\n  We have also heard from our local independent pharmacies that many, \ndespite contract terms, face delayed payments from prescription drug \nplans. Given that the pharmacies must pay for their drugs on a more \nabbreviated schedule, these delays have created cash-flow crises for \nsome pharmacies and put some at risk of closing. As much as I hate to \nlegislate contract terms, I would hate more for the independent \npharmacies in my State to close and my beneficiaries to be left without \na pharmacy. In our bill, we would require plans to pay most pharmacies \nwithin 14 days upon receipt of an electronically submitted clean claim. \nFor paper claims, they would have 30 days. If they were late, the \nprescription drug plans would have to pay the pharmacies interest. If a \npharmacy submitted claims electronically and requested electronic \npayment, the plan would have to pay electronically.\n  Because long-term care pharmacies operate under unusual circumstances \ncompared with retail pharmacies, our bill would allow pharmacies in \nlong-term care facilities, or that contract with long-term care \nfacilities, at least 30 days but no more than 90 days to submit their \nclaims for reimbursement to the plans.\n  Another problem involves how plans use maximum allowable prices as \nthe upper limit of what they will pay a retail pharmacy for the cost of \na drug. What has come to light is that some plans will not disclose to \nthe contracting pharmacies exactly what the maximum allowable prices \nare either when the contract is proposed to them or even after they \nsign the contract.\n  It seems unconscionable to me that a pharmacy would be expected to \nsign a contract where the price term is hidden and not disclosed. In \nthe Medicare program, no other health care providers are subject to \nsigning a contract in which they don't know what they will get paid.\n  Another abusive practice by some plans occurs when they do not update \ntheir maximum allowable prices in a timely manner. When a \npharmaceutical company raises its price for a drug the pharmacy has to \npay that new higher price right away. But the plan might not update \nwhat it pays for weeks. That leaves the pharmacy to absorb the \ndifference. The plans that do this know exactly what they are doing. \nThey know they are making the pharmacies eat the higher cost while they \ndelay updating their payment rates. To address these concerns, the bill \nwould require plans to disclose to pharmacies their ``maximum allowable \ncost'' pricing, and also to update those prices as they change, through \nan Internet website and a toll-free phone number.\n  Similarly, the bill would require plans to update their prescription \ndrug pricing standard at least every seven days. The drug pricing \nstandard changes frequently, and the price the pharmacy is paid is \nbased on that standard, and so it seemed fair to us that the \nprescription drug plans' payments should reflect recent changes.\n  Our bill is intended to improve CMS's and prescription drug plans' \nservice to pharmacies. It would require the HHS Secretary to establish \na pharmacists' toll-free hotline. Prescription drug plans would have to \nestablish separate pharmacists' and physicians' toll-free hotlines, and \nwould have to comply with customer service standards established by the \nSecretary. We hope this will prevent pharmacists being placed on long \nholds when they have customers standing at the counter waiting for \ntheir drugs.\n  We have some questions about pharmacists' average dispensing fees, \nand under the bill the HHS Inspector General would conduct a study of \ndispensing fees, including studying whether the pharmacist is \ndispensing a standard prescription or an extended one; whether the \npharmacist is in a chain store or an independent pharmacy; whether the \npharmacy dispenses specialty pharmacy products, or is a\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\nlong-term care pharmacy. The Inspector General's report would be due \nOctober 1, 2008.\n  I believe that with these changes, the Medicare Part D program will \nwork even better for beneficiaries and for the pharmacies that serve \nthem. As we refine the Medicare Part D program, we want to build on its \nsuccess even as we hope to make it fairer to all the stakeholders \ninvolved, the beneficiaries, the pharmacies, the PDP plans, and the \nmanufacturers. I believe this bill does just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Ms. Stabenow): S. 1955. A bill to \n        authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to make grants to \n        first responder agencies that have employees in the National \n        Guard or Reserves on active duty; to the Committee on Homeland \n        Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, our Nation's first responders are vital to \nprotecting our citizens from everyday crime, and to keeping our \ncitizens safe from fire and health-related emergencies. Our first \nresponders are also vital in the event of disaster, whether man-made or \nnatural.\n  But these same men and women that keep us safe and healthy at home \nare often called upon to fight for our country abroad with the National \nGuard and Reserves; or sometimes they are called to active duty within \nthe U.S. The demands on the Guard and Reserves have become extremely \nheavy during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  However, the demands on first responders here at home do not decrease \nand local fire, police and ambulance services are forced to manage \nwithout key employees.\n  That is why I am introducing the Reinforce First Responders and \nEmergency Employees Deployed Overseas in the Military, or Reinforce \nFREEDOM Act today. My bill will reinforce local first responder \nagencies whose employees are fighting for our freedom overseas. It \nestablishes a grant program through the Department of Homeland Security \nfor first responder agencies that have employees deployed with the \nNational Guard or Reserves.\n  The grants are available to law enforcement and fire departments, as \nwell as public and private ambulance services. Agencies are eligible to \nreceive up to $15,000 for each 3 month period they are without \nemployees serving with the military. Primarily volunteer organizations \nare eligible if they are missing a substantial part of their workforce. \nThe funds from these grants can be used to hire replacement employees \nor for overtime salary expenses. The funds can also be used for non-\nsalary costs that were created by the employees' deployment with the \nGuard or Reserves, or which would alleviate the impact of their \nabsence.\n  Extra funding perhaps cannot fully make up for the loss of crucial \nemployees. But this bill will help ensure that first responder agencies \ncan continue to keep the American people safe when their Guardsmen and \nReservist employees are called to defend the United States of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Smith, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. McCain, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1956. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to provide equitable access for foster care and adoption services \nfor Indian children in tribal areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks by commending \nthe thousands of case workers, foster families, neighbors and friends \nacross the country that work to provide safety, stability, and love for \nthe more than half a million children in the Nation's foster care \nsystem. More than a third of foster children in Montana are Native \nAmerican. Across America, most of the Native American children in \nfoster care are under the jurisdiction of tribal courts. But Native \nAmerican tribes that want to administer their own child welfare systems \nare not eligible for Title IV-E funds to run their own foster care and \nadoption programs.\n  Today I am proud to introduce with Senators Domenici, Bingaman, \nSmith, Stabenow, McCain, and Cantwell the Tribal Foster Care and \nAdoption Act of 2007. This legislation is a demonstration of the \ncommitment on both sides of the aisle to provide tribes with the \nopportunity to care for their own children. Children that need foster \ncare and adoption services because of the abuse and neglect that they \nhave already suffered. This bill provides tribes with the ability to \nserve their children directly with culturally appropriate care and \nunderstanding. The legislation also recognizes the good work of states \nand their collaborative efforts with tribes on behalf of tribal \nchildren.\n  This legislation has had a long history in the Senate and I am \npleased to have been a part of that history since the 107th congress. \nIt has been introduced in every Congress since then always with \nbipartisan support. This bill's time has come.\n  We have worked very hard to fine tune this legislation in away that \nis fair to states and finally gives Tribes direct access to the child \nwelfare system. We want a system set up to protect those that need our \nprotection the most not to exclude the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety from direct participation.\n  The child welfare system is languishing because of inadequate \nfunding. And the system also suffers from a lack of culturally-\nappropriate approaches to help tribal children to find loving, \npermanent homes. I am further committed to working on behalf of our \nchild welfare system with Chairman Grassley and with Senator \nRockefeller who have always been dedicated to child welfare issues. The \nTribal Foster Care and Adoption Act provides a pivotal opportunity to \nensure that tribes across our country have the ability to access the \nchild welfare system. I see this as a first step in making much needed \nimprovements to the country's child welfare system, without significant \ncosts or new federal programs.\n  We owe the first inhabitants of this great Nation and their children \na child welfare system that works for them. We must do all we can to \nprovide help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Clinton, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1957. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide \nprotection for fashion design; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1957, the Design Piracy Prohibition Act. As one who has been involved \nin national intellectual property, patent, copyright and trademark \npolicy development for many years, I can tell you first-hand how \ndifficult it can be to legislate in these areas. The Constitution \nexpressly tasks Congress with the duty to protect the rights of \nproperty owners, including intellectual property owners. And we spend a \ngood bit of time here legislating in the areas of music, art, movies, \ntelevision, radio, books, and so many other things that exist solely \nbecause of intellectual property rights.\n  However, one area of our economy that has been overlooked and not \nbenefited from the legal framework associated with intellectual \nproperty law is the area of fashion design. And yet fashion design is \none area where America enjoys a trade surplus and has clear leaders in \nthe world market. In fact, much of the world apparel and accessory \nindustry takes follows the lead of our world renowned fashion experts. \nHowever, the protections of their designs are not taken as seriously as \nwe take other forms of property rights, thereby, hurting a thriving \nAmerican industry around the world.\n  In an effort to bring some balance to the property rights of \ndesigners, Senators Schumer, Hutchison, Feinstein, Whitehouse, Graham, \nKohl, Clinton, Snowe, and I are introducing this legislation. The goal \nof S. 1957 is to ensure that those who spend their time and money \ndeveloping new and innovative fashion designs are able to secure and \nenforce adequate copyright protections for their hard work. And I \nsupport that goal.\n  As I stated earlier, this is a difficult area of law in which to \nlegislate and the balancing of the rights of property owners and \nconsumers is often difficult. In fact, the U.S. has been changing and \nrefining intellectual property laws for over 200 years and in some \nareas we still have not gotten it right.\n\n[[Page S10805]]\n\n  It must be recognized that this bill is not perfect and there are \nseveral legitimate concerns with the way this bill attempts to protect \ndesigns. I will be working with my colleagues to make improvements to \nthis bill as it goes through the Senate process. Some areas of the bill \nthat need to be improved are: the standard for liability, the \ndefinition of designs in the public domain, and the secondary liability \nprovisions. However, I am certain we will be able to work through these \nissues and move this bill forward.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Schumer, for introducing this \nbill. It takes a strong will, and a strong stomach, to take on the job \nof moving intellectual property-related legislation through Congress. \nI'm sure Senator Schumer is up to the task and I look forward to \nhelping him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 1959. A bill to establish the National Commission on the \nPrevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Violent \nRadicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007.\n  Foreign-based terrorism has weighed heavily in the news and in our \nthoughts for more than a decade. Since the first bombing of the World \nTrade Center in 1993, we have seen foreign-based terrorists attack our \nembassies in Tanzania and Kenya, a Navy destroyer in Yemen, the World \nTrade Center again, and the Pentagon. Timely arrests prevented foreign-\nbased terrorists from carrying out a bombing plot directed at the Los \nAngeles airport and, more recently, attacks targeting U.S.-bound \nflights originating in England.\n  This long-standing and still-deadly threat requires continued \nsurveillance and aggressive action, and will for years to come. But we \ncannot confine our counter-terrorism efforts to attacks organized in \nand launched from other countries. As demonstrated by the bloody \nbombing of the Oklahoma City Federal office building in 1995 and by \nthis year's arrests of suspects in plots directed at JFK International \nAirport and Fort Dix, NJ, domestic radicalization and violent extremism \nare also threats to American lives and American society.\n  The most effective border security will not prevent ``home-grown'' \nterrorists from attacking our citizens. We need to better understand \nthe triggers for radicalization and violence in order to counter the \nthreat of terrorists on American soil.\n  For nearly a year now, Senator Lieberman and I have conducted an \ninvestigation and held a series of hearings in the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee probing different aspects of this domestic danger by \nexamining radicalization in prisons, radicalization trends, the \nInternet and violent extremism, lessons from the European experience, \nand the adequacy of government counter-measures.\n  The harvest of information and insights from these hearings has \nhelped alert us to dangers, guide our oversight activities, and \nformulate ideas for legislative action. The testimony and evidence we \nhave seen persuade me that we need to undertake an even more in-depth \nexamination of the threats of domestic radicalization and violent \nextremism.\n  The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act \nwould provide such an examination. It is a companion measure to the \nbill introduced by Representatives Jane Harman of California and Dave \nReichert of Washington in the House of Representatives. Congresswoman \nHarman has been extraordinarily perceptive in understanding the threat \nof violent radicalization, and her bill's unanimous approval by the \nHouse Homeland Security Committee is a tribute to her leadership.\n  My bill, like the House measure, includes two key initiatives.\n  First, it would create a National Commission on the Prevention of \nViolent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism.\n  Second, it would establish a university-based Center of Excellence \nfor the Study of Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism in the U.S.\n  The Commission would devote itself to a survey of what we know, and \nwhat we need to learn, about the social and psychological breeding \ngrounds of extremism, the process of radicalization, the factors that \ncause people to turn to violence, the processes of recruitment and \ncoordination, and the phenomenon of self-radicalization and ``lone \nwolf'' terrorism.\n  To ensure a broad range of input for the commission, members would be \nselected for their qualifications by the President, the majority and \nminority leaders of the House and Senate, and the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Homeland Security Committees of the House and Senate.\n  The commission's final report, to be delivered within 18 months of \nits initial meeting, would provide a solid base of information and a \nguide for further research and action against the dangers that we face.\n  A ``final report,'' however useful, cannot be the last word in the \nfight against a threat that has been growing for years and may persist \nfor decades. That is why the bill takes the important second step of \nestablishing a university-based Center of Excellence focused on \nhomegrown terrorism, violent radicalization, and ideologically based \nviolence.\n  The Department of Homeland Security currently has 8 Centers for \nExcellence focusing on various aspects of homeland security, such as \nrisk-analysis, food protection, and catastrophic-event preparedness and \nresponse.\n  My bill would empower the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate \na new center or to expand the mission of an existing center. In either \ncase, such a center will provide an institution dedicated to \nresearching and understanding violent radicalization and homegrown \nterrorism, and to developing findings that can assist Federal, State, \nlocal, and tribal governments in dealing with these threats.\n  It is vital, that our homeland-security efforts extend to a \nsystematic and comprehensive understanding of the radicalization \nprocess that turns people living in our midst to ideologically based \nviolence and terrorism. It is also vital that we create an academically \nbased center to sustain high-quality research efforts on this threat to \naugment federal initiatives and to expand and supplement Government \nthinking.\n  This bill, which closely parallels legislation now moving through the \nHouse of Representatives, meets those vital needs. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1960. A bill amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nimprove surety bond guarantees, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today o join Senator Kerry in \nintroducing the Surety Bond Improvement Act, a bill which would \nreinvigorate the Small Business Administration's Surety Bond Guarantee \nprogram. I appreciate Senator Kerry's leadership on small business \nissues and his bipartisan work with me on this bill. Together, our \nprimary purpose is to improve the Surety Bond Guarantee SBG program and \nensure that more small businesses are able to secure the surety bonds \nthey require to compete and grow.\n  Many surety bond companies refuse to bond small businesses because of \nthe greater risks associated with underwriting new, unproven firms. \nCountless new businesses lack the stable credit histories and assets \nnecessary to obtain a surety bond. Without bonding, small firms cannot \nsecure the contracts they need to survive. For many small businesses, \ntheir inability to obtain surety bonds creates a barrier to entry which \nprevents them from competing in defense contracting, construction, \nservices, and other markets.\n  In order to reduce the risk to the surety firms issuing the bonds, \nthe SBA promises to cover between 70 and 90 percent of any possible \nclaims on bonds underwritten through the SBG program. Many small \ncontractors are only able to obtain surety bonds through the SBG \nprogram and establish a bonding history. Over time, these businesses \nwill out-grow the SBG program and will be able to obtain bonds in the \nregular, competitive marketplace.\n  It is critical to understand that the number of participating \nsureties in the\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\nSBG program directly affects the number of small companies that can \nreceive surety bonds. In fiscal year 2000, the SBG program had \n28 participating surety bonding companies and issued 7,034 bonds to \nsmall businesses. As of fiscal year 2006, there were only 10 \nparticipating surety companies that issued 4,709 surety bonds. This \ndownturn represents a 64 percent decline in the number of participating \nsureties and a decrease of 33 percent in the total number of bonds \nissued to small businesses. The sureties argue that SBA's outdated fee \nstructure and other actions, such as unwinding bond guarantees and \nrecent fee increases, make it impossible for them to earn a profit and \ncontinue participating in the program.\n\n  Our bill strives to address the reason behind the program's \ndiminishing participation and increasing inability to help small \nbusinesses. To achieve that goal, our measure would 1. prohibit the SBA \nfrom underwriting a surety bond guarantee after the agency has already \nunderwritten and approved the bond, 2. direct the SBA to promulgate \nregulations to allow surety companies to go to non-binding mediation \nwith the SBA in order to resolve disputes over denied claims or other \nissues, 3. eliminate existing price controls, 4. require the SBA to be \ntransparent in its fee structure, 5. clarify that Congress does not \nrequire the Surety Bond Guarantee program to be entirely self-funding \nor self-sufficient, and 6. raise the principal guarantee amount to $3 \nmillion.\n  We are collaborating with the SBA to reverse the downward trend \nregarding participating sureties and boost the number of small \nbusinesses receiving surety bonding. To accomplish this goal, the SBG \nprogram is working to reduce approval times by bolstering the capacity \nof companies to submit underwriting applications and claim requests \nonline. The program also plans to restructure its field offices and \nconduct outreach to new sureties and small businesses needing surety \nbonding. These reforms, along with the necessary legislative changes \nSenator Kerry and I have proposed today, will help the program attract \nnew sureties and increase the overall number of small companies able to \nsecure sureties underwriting through the program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to strongly support the Surety Bond \nImprovement Act which we wrote after consulting with small business \nowners and surety bonding companies on how best to revitalize this \npivotal program. Without these remedies, the number of sureties in the \nprogram will continue to fall as will the capability of small \nbusinesses to secure surety bonds.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish new separate fee schedule areas for physicians' services in \nStates with multiple fee schedule areas to improve Medicare physician \ngeographic payment accuracy, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a longstanding flaw in the Medicare Geographic Practice Cost \nIndex, GPCI, system that negatively impacts physicians in California \nand several other states.\n  This legislation will allow counties that are underpaid by at least 5 \npercent to be reclassified into a payment locality that reflects their \nown geographic costs.\n  It holds harmless the counties, predominately rural ones, whose \nlocality average would otherwise drop as other counties are \nreclassified.\n  Finally, this legislation is fully offset by requiring that \nindependent diagnostic laboratories comply with state and federal \nregulations. This will allow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices, CMS, to take action against unscrupulous operators, \npredominately in California, that seek Medicare reimbursements for \ninaccurate and unnecessary diagnostic testing.\n  This legislation would benefit physicians who are currently underpaid \nin 10 States: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and Washington.\n  Congressman Sam Farr has introduced companion legislation, H.R. 2484, \nin the House of Representatives, which now has 12 cosponsors.\n  The Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index measures the cost of \nproviding a Medicare covered service in a geographic area. Medicare \npayments are supposed to reflect the varying costs of rent, malpractice \ninsurance, and other expenses necessary to operate a medical process. \nCounties are assigned to ``payment localities'' that are supposed to \naccurately capture these costs.\n  Here is the problem: some of these payment localities have not \nchanged since 1997. Others have been in place since 1966. Many areas \nthat were rural even 10 years have experienced significant population \ngrowth, as metropolitan areas and suburbs have spread. Many counties \nnow find themselves in payment localities that do not accurately \nreflect their true practice costs.\n  These payment discrepancies have a real and serious impact on \nphysicians and the Medicare beneficiaries they are unable to serve. My \nhome State of California has been hit particularly hard.\n  San Diego County physicians are underpaid by 5.5 percent. A number of \nphysicians have left the county and 60 percent of remaining San Diego \nphysicians report that they cannot recruit new doctors to their \npractices.\n  Santa Cruz County receives a 10.2 percent underpayment, and as a \nresult, no physicians are accepting new Medicare patients. Instead, \nthey are moving to neighboring Santa Clara, which has similar practice \ncost expense, but is reimbursed at a rate that is at least 22 percent \nhigher. This means that seniors often need to travel at least 20 miles \nto see a physician.\n  Sacramento County, a major metropolitan area, is underpaid by 4.6 \npercent. The county's population has grown by 9.6 percent, while the \nnumber of physicians has declined by 11 percent.\n  Sonoma County physicians are paid at least 8 percent less than their \ngeographic practice costs. They have experienced at 10 percent decline \nin specialists and a 9 percent decline in primary care physicians.\n  Seniors' Medicare cards are of no value if physicians in their \ncommunity cannot afford to provide them with health care.\n  The underpayment problem grows more severe every year, and the longer \nwe wait to address it, the more drastic the solution will need to be. \nThis legislation provides a common sense solution, increasing payment \nfor those facing the most drastic underpayments, while protecting other \ncounties from cuts in the process.\n  This is an issue of equity. It costs more to provide health care in \nexpensive areas, and physicians serving our seniors must be fairly \ncompensated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10807]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize HIV/AIDS assistance; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria Act of 2003, known as the Leadership Act, the largest \ninternational health initiative in history dedicated to a single \ndisease.\n  Five years ago, there was little hope in Africa and the developing \nworld of an effective response to HIV/AIDS. Tragically, many of the \nnations hardest hit by this disease are among those with the fewest \nresources to draw on for a response. There appeared to be little basis \nfor hope.\n  Today, the pandemic continues. Yet there has been a change, and the \nAmerican people have led that change.\n  The original Leadership Act authorized $15 billion in appropriations \nover 5 years. And in a significant departure from earlier approaches to \ndevelopment, it linked that funding to accountability for goals: \nsupport for treatment of 2 million people, prevention of 7 million new \ninfections, care for 10 million people, including orphans and \nvulnerable children.\n  As many Senators will recall, when this legislation was first enacted \nin 2003, it was done with a certain amount of haste and after a request \nfrom the President for quick action. The G-8 summit was fast \napproaching, but even more importantly, rapid Senate action meant that \nthe program could be established quickly, so that money could start to \nflow quickly to the fight. Given this, the Senate acted swiftly, \npassing the bill almost without amendment.\n  Now we are approaching the expiration of that 5-year authorization at \nthe end of fiscal year 2008. Whatever our misgivings about the \nLeadership Act as we enacted it in 2003, at this point we need to judge \nit by the results it has enabled us to deliver. Those results are \nsimply remarkable.\n  At the time the Leadership Act was announced, only 50,000 people in \nall of sub-Saharan Africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Yet \nthrough March of this year, the act has supported treatment for over \n1.1 million men, women and children, over a million of them are in \nAfrica, in those 15 countries where AIDS was on the verge of wiping out \nwhole generations. In addition to these focus countries, we are working \nwith one hundred other countries as well touching millions of other \nlives. Five years ago, HIV was a death sentence. Now there is hope.\n  During the first 3\\1/2\\ years of the act, U.S. bilateral programs \nhave supported services for pregnant women to avoid transmission of HIV \nto their babies during more than 6 million pregnancies. In over 533,000 \nof those pregnancies, the women were found to be HIV-positive and \nreceived antiretroviral prophylaxis, preventing an estimated 101,000 \ninfant infections through March 2007.\n  Before the advent of the Leadership Act, there was little concerted \neffort to meet the needs of those orphaned by AIDS, or of other \nchildren made vulnerable by it. We have now supported care for more \nthan 2 million orphans and vulnerable children, as well as 2.5 million \npeople living with HIV/AIDS, through September 2006.\n  Effective prevention, treatment and care all depend to a large extent \non people knowing their HIV status, so they can take the necessary \nsteps to stay healthy. The U.S. has supported 18.7 million HIV \ncounseling and testing sessions for men, women and children.\n  Across the act's programs, the majority of services have been \nprovided to women and girls, and a growing number of services are \nreaching children.\n  Our financial investment in this fight has been critical to our \nsuccess, and thanks in large part to the flexibility of the Leadership \nAct, we have been able to obligate over 94 percent of its available \n$12.3 billion appropriated through this fiscal year.\n  In addition to support for the U.S. bilateral programs, the \nLeadership Act has also authorized support for the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund provides an important \navenue for the rest of the world to substantially increase its \ncommitment, as we have done. The U.S. is the largest supporter of the \nGlobal Fund, having provided some $2 billion so far. It is important \nfor the American people to understand and for the rest of the world to \nremember, that the American people are responsible for approximately \n\\1/3\\ of all the funding received by the fund.\n  As we survey the results achieved by this legislation, it is apparent \nthat our efforts have been exceptionally successful. But to build on \nthat success, we must reauthorize the legislation for another 5 years. \nAs we consider how to accomplish that reauthorization task, it is \nimportant to note that the vast majority of the authorities needed for \nthe next phase of our effort are already contained in the current \nLeadership Act.\n  The necessity for new authorities is in the eye of the beholder. Many \nSenators may wish to enhance issues such as TB/HIV, gender, nutrition, \nhuman capacity, infrastructure and health systems, and education. But \nthe current law already articulates and authorizes activities in these \nvery same areas, as evidenced by the many activities in these areas \nthat the act has undertaken under existing authorities.\n  In this case, I believe we should follow the old adage, ``If it ain't \nbroke, don't fix it.'' We have a good, if not perfect, law that is \nsucceeding. In lieu of drafting an entirely new bill, today I introduce \na reauthorization which preserves the bulk of the authorities that have \nenabled the program succeed and makes only minor modifications.\n  The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator has interpreted the existing \nauthorities well and has listened to the Congress and many \nstakeholders. As the Institute of Medicine recently said, the Global \nLeadership Act is a ``learning organization.'' The Coordinator is the \nfirst to admit, as he has before Congressional committees, that we can \ndo better in every area of implementation. But new authorities are not \nneeded; these are issues of implementation. In short, rather than \nabsorbing the time of Congress, the coordinator, as well as \nstakeholders in drafting an entirely new bill, we should empower them \nto continue the work they are doing to improve upon program \nimplementation utilizing the experience of these past 3\\1/2\\ years.\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\n  Let me highlight the basic changes I am suggesting to the existing \nlegislation. First, it would increase to $30 billion the authorization \nfor the next five fiscal years 2009-2013, a doubling of the initial \ncommitment. I recognize that Senators may wish to revisit that funding \nlevel, and I trust that there will be opportunities for them to do so, \nin committee and on the floor.\n  Second, as the Institute of Medicine and others have argued, I \nbelieve we need to keep the bill as free of funding directives as \npossible in order to ensure maximum flexibility for implementation. I \nam proposing that only two funding directives be included, one modified \nfrom its current form, the other maintained as is.\n  The first modification would seek to address the abstinence directive \nin current law. The current Leadership Act requires that 33 percent of \nall prevention funding be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs. \nThe problem with this directive is that some countries need to focus \ntheir efforts not on abstinence per se but on, for example, mother-to-\nchild transmission, an activity which is considered to be nonsexual \ntransmission of HIV/AIDS. The original directive thus forced theses \ncountries to either spend money in areas where they did not necessarily \nneed to spend it or to divert funds from areas where they truly needed \nto.\n  The administration had interpreted and implemented this provision so \nas to include both abstinence and faithfulness programs, the `AB' of \n`ABC,' which stands for Abstinence, Be faithful, and the correct and \nconsistent use of condoms. The directive has been helpful in ensuring \nan evidence-based, comprehensive approach to prevention. The ABC \nparadigm for prevention was developed in Africa by Africans, in order \nto address the wide range of risks faced by people within their \nnations, particularly in the context of generalized epidemics where HIV \nis widespread throughout the population. Recent evidence from a growing \nnumber of African countries shows a correlation between the adoption of \nall three of the ABC behaviors, and a clear association with declining \nHIV prevalence.\n  Before the creation of the U.S. Global Aids Coordinator, the U.S. \nGovernment had relatively little experience implementing behavior \nchange programs for global HIV/AIDS that included the whole array of \nABC behavior change. This was the rationale for the directive, and I \nbelieve it has served a useful purpose. However, I agree with many \nothers that we can improve upon it as we look to the future.\n  The language I propose would provide that 50 percent of funding for \nprevention of sexual transmission of HIV, a sub-set all prevention \nfunding, be dedicated to abstinence and faithfulness. This will enable \ngreater flexibility to countries whose situation mirrors the one just \ndescribed.\n  At the same time, the language would ensure the continuation of \nfunding for abstinence and faithfulness programs as part of \ncomprehensive, evidence-based ABC activities. I think this compromise \napproach is the right one that can win support from across the \npolitical spectrum and provide increased flexibility while ensuring \ncontinued support for comprehensive, evidence-based prevention.\n  There are a number of other directives in the current law that need \nno longer be maintained and the new bill does not contain them. The one \nother directive that I believe must be maintained is that 10 percent of \nfunding be devoted to programs for orphans and vulnerable children, or \n``OVCs''. As I have noted, there were few programs focused on the needs \nof these children before the Leadership Act of 2005 and we remain in \nthe early stages of the essential effort to serve them. This is one of \nthe aspects of our effort that is most strongly supported by the \nAmerican people, the maintenance of this directive will help to ensure \nthat this effort remains focused on those who need our support the \nmost. The directive will also help ensure the success of the Assistance \nfor Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act \nof 2005, a bill I drafted, one cosponsored by eleven of my Senate \ncolleagues, and which the Congress passed in October 2005.\n  Finally, let me describe some new language proposed for the inclusion \nregarding the Global Fund, an organization that enjoys wide support \nhere in Congress. The Global Fund is a critically important partner of \nthe U.S. in our fight against HIV/AIDS. Our contributions are not only \nfinancial, we are also active on its board, and our U.S. personnel \noverseas provide the technical assistance needed for the Global Fund's \ngrants to work.\n  However, the fund is subject to pressures from many donors and in \nmany directions. It has become clear that it would benefit from greater \ntransparency and accountability. In keeping with my concerns with \ntransparency and accountability of international organizations that \nreceive U.S. funding, including the World Bank and International \nMonetary Fund, my proposed language would establish similar benchmarks \nfor U.S. funding for the Global Fund. I don't believe any of these \nproposed benchmarks will be controversial, but if Senators have \nconcerns about any of them, I look forward to working with them to \naddress them.\n  It is also worth noting that the bill would maintain the limitation \nin the existing Leadership Act that U.S. contributions to the fund may \nnever exceed 33 percent of its funding from all sources. This \nlimitation has proven to be a valuable tool for increasing \ncontributions to the fund from other funding sources, such as other \ngovernments, and I believe there is wide agreement that this provision \nshould be maintained as we move forward.\n  In closing, let me turn to the issue of legislative timing. It is \ncritical to the contents of my approach to reauthorization. It is \ncritically important to reauthorize this bill during 2007, as opposed \nto awaiting its expiration September 2008.\n  The US Global Aids Coordinator depends on his implementing partners, \nincluding host governments and nongovernmental organizations, including \nfaith- and community-based organizations, to scale up programs rapidly \nto reach as many people as possible. They have been a critical part of \nprograms success to date.\n  But HIV and AIDS are different from many diseases: once HIV-positive \npersons are provided treatment or orphans enrolled in care programs, \ntheir treatment and care become ongoing commitments for program \npartners. Thus, for partners to continue to scale up programs in 2008, \nthey need assurances of a continued U.S. commitment beyond 2008. These \npartners recognize that at this point, they have only a Presidential \nproposal, not actual reauthorization.\n  In fact, some of my staff on the Foreign Relations Committee have \nrecently returned from countries receiving our assistance and verified \nthis concern. Various ministries of health are refusing to expand the \nnumber of patients currently receiving antiretroviral medication for \nfear that they will not receive enough money in the years to come to \npurchase next year's doses for these new patients.\n  Without reauthorization in 2007, partners have indicated that they \nwill be unable to scale up programs in 2008, and as my staff have \nconfirmed, there is already evidence that some have begun to slow \nenrollment in programs. Without continued rapid scale-up this year and \nnext, we may not achieve the ambitious goals for the first phase of \nPEFPAR, treatment for 2 million, prevention of 7 million new \ninfections, care for 10 million, including orphans and vulnerable \nchildren. However, time will be needed to develop sustainable programs \nwith commitments from our partner countries as we move into the next 5-\nyear commitment from the American people.\n  Thus it is essential that we act before we go out of session this \nyear. I recognize that we face a crowded calendar. But we can do it if \nwe will take the most direct path to passage, a clean bill.\n  This body can be proud of its contribution to the remarkable \nturnaround on the issue of global HIV/AIDS, from concern to action. We \nhave represented well the compassion and generosity of the American \npeople and the demand for accountability by the American taxpayer. I \ncall on my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this bill to reauthorize \nthe Leadership Act in 2007, and to extend the authorities that have \nenabled the American people to make such a difference in the lives of \nothers.\n  I have no pride of authorship. But we need to start the \nreauthorization process now. I welcome the involvement\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\nand inputs of my colleagues. We should let the mark-up and amendment \nprocess work. Secondly, I would welcome the assistance of other \nCommittees and their memberships. Thirdly, I look for strong support \nand guidance from the NGO and faith-based communities. These \norganizations will be key to the reauthorization effort. We will \nrequire the constructive engagement of the administration in this \nreauthorization effort.\n  If we pull together and display the spirit of compromise necessary \nfor good legislation, we can complete the job in 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On May 30, 2007, President George W. Bush announced his \n     intent to double the commitment of the United States to fight \n     global HIV/AIDS with a new $30,000,000,000, 5-year proposal \n     to reauthorize the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n       (2) With the enactment of the President's fiscal year 2008 \n     budget, the United States Government will have committed \n     $18,000,000,000 to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n     Relief (PEPFAR), which exceeds the original 5-year, \n     $15,000,000,000 commitment.\n       (3) After 3 years of PEPFAR implementation, the American \n     people have supported treatment of 1,100,000 people in the 15 \n     focus countries, including more than 1,000,000 people in \n     Africa.\n       (4) PEPFAR is on track to meet its 5-year goals to support \n     treatment for 2,000,000 people, prevention of 7,000,000 new \n     infections, and care for 10,000,000 people, including orphans \n     and vulnerable children.\n       (5) The success of PEPFAR is rooted in support for country-\n     owned strategies and programs with commitment of resources \n     and dedication to results, achieved through the power of \n     partnerships with governments, with nongovernmental, faith-\n     based, and community-based organizations, and with the \n     private sector.\n       (6) United States efforts to address global HIV/AIDS will \n     be multiplied by engaging in partnerships with countries \n     dedicating to fighting their HIV epidemics and with \n     multilateral partners, such as the Global Fund, which can \n     help leverage international resources and build upon the \n     efforts of the United States to combat global HIV/AIDS. In \n     his announcement of his intent to double the commitment of \n     the United States to fight global HIV/AIDS, President Bush \n     reiterated his call for developed and developing countries, \n     in particular middle-income countries where projections \n     suggest many new infections will occur, to increase their \n     contributions to fighting AIDS. HIV/AIDS is a global crisis \n     that requires a global response.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility \nof designating Estate Grange and other sites related to Alexander \nHamilton's life on the island of St. Croix in the United States Virgin \nIslands as a unit of the National Park System, and for other\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Alexander \nHamilton Boyhood Home Act of 2007, a bill to study the suitability and \nfeasibility of bringing resources related to Alexander Hamilton's \nboyhood on the island of St. Croix under the National Park System. I \nwould like to thank Senators Rockefeller, Bayh, Bill Nelson, Brownback, \nHarkin, and Crapo for lending early support to this legislation as \noriginal cosponsors. I especially note the strong support of Senator \nRockefeller, who along with his family, has a special interest in this \npart of the U.S.\n  Too little is known about Hamilton's childhood on the islands. We \nknow he was born as a British subject on the island of Nevis in 1755. \nBy the age of 10 he and his brother James found themselves under Danish \nrule on the island of St. Croix. Alexander's father had abandoned them, \nso his mother Rachel Faucett was the primary care giver and bread \nwinner. It is believed they initially spent their days on a sugar \nplantation at Estate Grange, which was owned by Rachel's sister, Ann, \nand her husband, James Lytton. The Lyttons generously supported Rachel \nand her two boys for a short time. When the plantation was sold, the \nLyttons helped Rachel to set up a store with an apartment on the upper \nfloor in the nearby town of Christiansted.\n  They had been there less than a year and Alexander, as an 11-year-old \nboy, had already taken a job as a clerk at the Beekman and Cruger \ntrading post. This connection would serve him well after his mother \ndied in 1769 and he was left to fend for himself. His early years with \nBeekman and Cruger not only supported him financially, but they \nintroduced him to business, economics, and trade.\n  Hamilton learned a great deal from his surroundings on St. Croix, and \nhis political ideologies as an adult were clearly influenced by his \nboyhood in the West Indies. His mother was known to have the largest \nlibrary on the island, consisting of 34 classical books of various \ntopics. Everyday life and culture must have left an impression on him, \nas well. He was constantly exposed to the brutality of slavery, which \ndrove the plantation economy on St. Croix. His distaste for it as a boy \nwould grow into political opposition to it in America. Historians also \nnote that maturing in the West Indies made him unique among other \nAmerican politicians of the day because he never had any loyalty to a \nspecific State or region. He perceived the U.S. as one unified Nation \nwith a strong central Government. To advocate that belief, Hamilton \nwould later found the Federalist Party in America.\n  Through his work, Alexander made several connections with influential \npeople in the town. As he grew older, they began to recognize his \ntalent and intellect and they decided to send him to New York with the \nfunds to obtain an education. He left St. Croix at age 17, never to \nreturn, and the rest is now a central aspect of our Nation's history.\n  Hamilton went on to be one of the great statesmen of our history, a \nFounding Father who was influential in all of the stages of our \nblossoming Nation. He fought with the colonies during the American \nRevolution and served as General Washington's personal secretary. After \nthe Revolution he was elected to the Continental Congress. He authored \nthe Federalist Papers to advocate ratification of the Constitution, \nwhich he would pen his own name to as a delegate from New York. Of \ncourse, he may be remembered most for his appointment as the first \nSecretary of the Treasury under President George Washington. His visage \nis perpetuated in history on the $10 bill as one of only two non-\npresidential faces appearing on U.S. currency.\n  Alexander Hamilton's immeasurable influence on the progress of our \nNation deserves to be remembered and recognized. The remaining links to \nhis boyhood on the island of St. Croix should be preserved and \nrecognized for the benefit of the people. The Great House at Estate \nGrange is still there today along with a memorial marking the site \nwhere Alexander's mother was laid to rest. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation which would establish and fund a study to \ndetermine the feasability and suitability of a heritage area on St. \nCroix in honor of one of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Reed, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1975. A bill to expand family and medical leave in support of \nservicemembers with combat-related injuries; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, 14 years ago, the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, FMLA, declared the principle that workers should never be forced \nto choose between the jobs they need and the families they love. In the \nyears since its passage, more than 50 million Americans have taken \nadvantage of its provisions to care for a sick love one, or recover \nfrom illness themselves, or welcome a new baby into the family. If \nordinary Americans deserve those rights, how much more do they apply to \nthose who risk their lives in the service of our country? Soldiers who \nhave been wounded in our service deserve everything America can give to \nspeed their recoveries, but most of all, they deserve the care of their \nclosest loved ones.\n  That is exactly what is offered in the Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act, a bill I am proud to have authored along with \nSenator Clinton. The FMLA was the very first bill that President \nClinton signed into law, and I am grateful that his wife, Senator \nClinton, continues to support the principles that I have been fighting \nfor over 20 years. Now, I am also pleased that Senators Dole, Graham, \nKennedy, Chambliss, Reed, Mikulski, Murray, Salazar, Lieberman, \nMenendez, Brown, Nelson of Nebraska, and Cardin are cosponsoring this \nnew legislation today.\n  Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services \nDonna Shalala have been instrumental in this effort as well, through \ntheir thoughtfulness and work on the President's Commission on Care for \nAmerica's Returning Wounded Warriors.\n  It is unsurprising that the commission found that family members play \na critical role in the recovery of our wounded servicemembers. The \ncommitment shown by the families and friends of our troops is truly \ninspiring: according to the commission's report, 33 percent of active \nduty servicemembers report that a family member or close friend \nrelocated for extended periods of time to help in their recoveries. It \nalso points out that 21 percent of active duty servicemembers say that \ntheir friends or family members gave up jobs to find the time. To quote \nfrom the commission's moving report:\n\n       In virtually every case [of a wounded servicemember], a \n     wife, husband, parent, brother, or sister has received the \n     heart-stopping telephone call telling them that their loved \n     one is sick or injured, halfway around the world.\n\n  These loved ones bear a burden almost as sharp as the wound itself. \nThe very least we can give them is the assurance that their jobs will \nbe there when they return.\n  It is for these reasons that the commission recommend that the FMLA \nbe expanded to provide family members of combat-injured servicemembers \nup to 6 months of leave to care for their loved ones.\n  The Support for Injured Servicemembers Act does just that. FMLA \ncurrently allows 3 months of unpaid leave. Given the severity of their \ninjuries, and our debt of gratitude, our servicemembers need more.\n  For the first time, this bill offers FMLA leave not just to parents, \nspouses, and children, but to next-of-kin, including siblings. \nFamilies, not the government, should decide for themselves who takes on \nthe work of caring for their injured loved ones. This bill recognizes \nthat fact, and it is a major accomplishment.\n  Our troops are laying their bodies on the line for us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, every day. Our full debt to them is unpayable. But perhaps \nthe best thing we can do for them is to get out of the way, to make it \npossible for the love of family to heal their wounds. With their jobs \nprotected, more family members will be able to do just that. What this\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nbill does, then, is break down a barrier, between our troops and the \ncare they need the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TESTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1976. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to include a \nprovision on organic conversion in the environmental quality incentives \nprogram; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Leahy and \nBaucus to introduce the Organic Conversion Assistance Act to help \nprovide needed technical and conservation assistance to farmers and \nranchers converting to organic agriculture. I wanted to thank Senator \nLeahy for his leadership on organic agricultural issues and Senator \nBaucus for his long-time support for Montana's farmers and ranchers.\n  My wife and I have spent our careers farming organically on our farm \nnear Big Sandy, MT. Nearly 20 years ago we were struggling to get ahead \nand trying to decide if we could really make it farming while so many \nof our neighbors were packing up and moving away. We knew at that time \nthat if we didn't make some changes to our business we would end up \nlike so many of our neighbors leaving rural Montana for jobs in town.\n  In 1988, we took what was then a risk and converted our farm to \norganic production. Our motivations were mostly economic but partly for \nhealth reasons. We wanted to farm on our own terms and to make more \nmoney. When I farmed conventionally I felt beholden to one big company \nafter another from buying fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, fuel, to \nselling my grain to a corporation and shipping it by rail at high \nprices and we rarely came out ahead. Every season after I would spray \nfor weeds and bugs, I would feel sick for a week afterwards.\n  Organic agriculture let us take control of our farm and our \nlivelihood. More and more farmers are converting to organics as \nconsumer demand soars. Organics is now the fastest growing sector of \nthe food industry expanding at a rate of over 20 percent a year. In \nMontana, we lead the Nation in organic wheat production and are a close \nsecond in the production of organic barley, peas and lentils. Consumer \ndemand for organic products is growing so fast that we are now \nimporting a significant portion of the organic food that is found in \nour grocery stores.\n  In the U.S. we grow the highest quality and safest food in the world. \nI believe that increased production of domestically produced organic \nfoods will help meet consumer demand, help keep farmers on the land, \nand because organic agriculture needs fewer inputs it helps conserve \nour land, and clean up our air and water. But if the U.S. is going to \nkeep pace with imported organic products we need to get more acreage \nunder organic production here at home.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide conversion \nassistance to farmers making the transition from conventional to \norganic agriculture. Currently it takes 3 to 4 years to become \ncertified organic, but during that period of time producers cannot \nreceive the higher price that organics fetch in the market place. \nFurthermore, the shift towards a new way of farming and ranching \ncreates technical challenges for many producers as they change the way \nthey do things. Offering technical and educational assistance as well \nas cost-share funds for conservation initiatives under a certified \norganic plan will provide a needed helping hand to farmers. Making the \nconversion will help keep farmers on the land by putting a bit more \nmoney in their pockets and help our rural communities be viable. Many \nStates have already adopted similar assistance programs and \nagricultural producers nationwide would benefit from having a \nconsistent and available program in years to come.\n  I would appreciate the support of my colleagues as this legislation \nmoves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1977. A bill to provide for sustained United States leadership in \na cooperative global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global \nnuclear arsenals, stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related \nmaterial and technology, and support the responsible and peaceful use \nof nuclear technology; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the spread of nuclear weapons and related \ntechnology and the possibility that a nuclear weapon could fall into \nthe hands of terrorists constitute the most urgent threat to our \nnational security. As experts on this issue such as Henry Kissinger, \nGeorge Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn have all warned, our current \npolicies to deal with the threat posed by nuclear weapons are simply \nnot adequate.\n  We know al-Qaida has made it a goal to acquire a nuclear weapon. At \nthe same time, significant quantities of the material necessary to make \none remain vulnerable to theft in various parts of the world. And, to \nmake matters worse, the world may be on the brink of a new and \ndangerous era with a growing number of nuclear-armed states, as \nillustrated by North Korea's nuclear test last year and Iran's refusal \nto halt its uranium enrichment program.\n  So today, along with Senator Hagel, I am introducing the Nuclear \nWeapons Threat Reduction Act, which provides for sustained U.S. \nleadership in a global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce \nglobal nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons around \nthe world.\n  Securing nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at their source \nis the most direct and reliable way to prevent nuclear terrorism. \nThanks to the leadership of Senators Nunn and Lugar in creating the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program at the Department of Defense, \nthere is no question that we have made significant progress in securing \nnuclear stockpiles. But there are still significant quantities of \nweapons-usable nuclear material that remain vulnerable to theft. In the \ncivilian sector alone, there are an estimated 60 tons of highly \nenriched uranium, enough to make over 1,000 nuclear bombs, spread out \nat facilities in over 40 countries around the world. Many of these \nfacilities do not have adequate physical security, leaving the material \nvulnerable to theft.\n  The insecure storage of nuclear stockpiles has already led to an \nalarming number of attempted exchanges of small quantities of dangerous \nnuclear materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, \nconfirmed 16 incidents between 1993 and 2005 that involved trafficking \nin relatively small amounts of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. \nThat is 16 incidents too many, in my opinion, and 16 incidents that \nshould not have been allowed to happen.\n  Experts believe that a sophisticated terrorist group could \npotentially construct a crude nuclear bomb if it obtained the necessary \namount of plutonium or highly enriched uranium. The 9/11 Commission \nconcluded that a trained nuclear engineer with an amount of highly \nenriched uranium or plutonium about the size of a grapefruit or an \norange could make a nuclear device that would level Lower Manhattan. \nSimply put, our ability to secure nuclear stockpiles around the world \nis what stands between the safety of the American people and a \nterrorism incident of almost unimaginable horror.\n  It is imperative that we build and lead a truly global effort to \nsecure all stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material to \nthe highest standards to prevent them from falling into the wrong \nhands. It is also essential that we make preventing nuclear terrorism a \ntop presidential priority--with the resources, diplomatic effort and \nfunding to match the threat. We need to work with other countries to \nensure effective and sustainable security of nuclear stockpiles and to \nensure that the highest priority is placed on security of those weapons \nand materials that pose the greatest risk.\n  The Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act requires the President to \nsubmit to Congress a comprehensive threat reduction plan for ensuring \nthat all nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at vulnerable \nsites are secure by 2012. The plan must clearly designate agency \nresponsibility and accountability, specify program goals and metrics \nfor measuring progress, and outline estimated schedules and budget \nrequirements.\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\n  To meet this ambitious goal, the bill calls for accelerating U.S. \nprograms to secure, consolidate, and reduce stocks of nuclear weapons \nand weapons-usable material, including highly enriched uranium at \ncivilian nuclear facilities worldwide. Additional funding is authorized \nfor the Department of Energy's Global Threat Reduction Initiative, an \nimportant program that secures and removes high-risk nuclear materials \nfrom vulnerable locations around the world.\n  The bill calls for the United States to work cooperatively with other \ncountries and the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to develop \nand implement a comprehensive set of standards and best practices to \nprovide effective physical protection and accounting for all stockpiles \nof nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material.\n  The bill also authorizes additional funding to improve our ability to \ntrace the origin of nuclear material that might be transferred or used \nin a terrorist attack so that responsible parties can be held \naccountable.\n  Given the nature of the threat we face from nuclear terrorism, we \ncan't succeed if we act alone. Indeed, the danger of nuclear \nproliferation and nuclear terrorism reminds us of how critical global \ncooperation will be to U.S. security in the 21st century. America must \nlead in rebuilding the alliances and partnerships necessary to meet \ncommon challenges and confront common threats. And this legislation \nseeks to provide the tools to do just that.\n  While nuclear terrorism remains a dire threat to our security, it is \nonly one part of the overall threat posed by nuclear weapons. The \nNuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act also addresses the need to reduce \nglobal arsenals and prevent the emergence of additional nuclear-armed \nnations. In all too many respects, the essential bargain that stands at \nthe core of the nuclear nonproliferation regime is unraveling. \nCountries like North Korea and Iran are demonstrating that nuclear \ntechnology acquired for ostensibly civilian purposes can provide the \nbasis for producing nuclear weapons. At the same time, established \nnuclear powers retain large arsenals and are reemphasizing the \nimportance of nuclear weapons to their security.\n  At the end of the Cold War, many had hoped and believed that the \nworld was moving in the right direction to reduce the threat of nuclear \nweapons. America and Russia agreed to significant reductions in their \nmassive nuclear arsenals. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine were \npersuaded to give up their post-Soviet nuclear arsenals. The U.S.-\nRussian Cooperative Threat Reduction or Nunn-Lugar program was \nestablished. In 1994, North Korea agreed to halt its plutonium \nproduction program. And in 1995, over 180 nations agreed to take \nfurther steps to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT, \nand agreed to extend the treaty indefinitely.\n  In the last 6 years, however, these positive trends have stalled--and \nin some cases regressed. While promising to leave the Cold War behind, \nPresident Bush abandoned the very policies his successors had pursued \nto bring the Cold War weapons competition to a peaceful and successful \nend. He unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty. He refused to support ratification of the 1996 Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. He opted for an arms reduction agreement with \nRussia in 2002 that does not include new verification provisions, does \nnot require the dismantling of warheads or missiles, and allows each \nside to stockpile thousands of nondeployed weapons. And after ignoring \nthe findings of U.N. weapons inspectors on the ground and launching a \npreemptive war against Iraq, President Bush lost much of the \ninternational goodwill that is required to mobilize global support to \nstrengthen the beleaguered nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n  The Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act calls for a balanced and \ncomprehensive set of initiatives that would strengthen the global \nnonproliferation regime. The bill authorizes $50 million to support the \ncreation of a low enriched uranium reserve administered by the IAEA \nthat would help guarantee the availability of fuel for commercial \nnuclear reactors. This international fuel bank can play an important \nrole in dissuading countries from building their own uranium enrichment \nfacilities. Additional funding is also authorized for the IAEA's \nDepartment of Safeguards to improve its ability to conduct effective \ninspections.\n  To win the struggle against nuclear proliferation, we must also have \nthe courage to lead by example. The bill calls for talks with Russia to \nreduce the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons and further reduce \nthe number of strategic nuclear weapons in Russian and U.S stockpiles \nin a transparent and verifiable fashion, and in a manner consistent \nwith the security of the United States. It also calls for considering \nchanges in the alert status of U.S. and Russian forces to reduce the \nrisk of an accidental, unauthorized, or mistaken launch of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Other initiatives called for in the bill include reaffirming support \nfor and strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, taking \nsteps to reconsider and ratify a global ban on nuclear testing, \npursuing a long-overdue global agreement to verifiably halt the \nproduction of fissile material for weapons, and fully implementing the \nLugar-Obama initiative that strengthens the ability of friendly foreign \ncountries to stop the transfer of weapons of mass destruction and \nrelated material.\n  With a bold, comprehensive approach and strong U.S. leadership, we \ncan--and must--make significant strides in reducing the threat posed by \nnuclear weapons. America must lead the way again by marshalling a \nglobal effort to meet the challenge that rises above all others in \nurgency securing, destroying, and stopping the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction. This bill, I believe, makes a significant \ncontribution toward that goal, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1978. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to award grants to implement a co-teaching model for educating \nstudents with disabilities; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Co-Teaching Educator \nProfessional Development Act of 2007 to help improve the education of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  A result of the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, and \nthe 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA, is that States, districts, and schools in Rhode Island and \nnationwide have increasingly begun utilizing a ``co-teaching'' model to \nmake sure that students with disabilities have the highest quality \nteachers. Co-teaching is a term that describes a general education \nteacher and a special education teacher jointly teaching students with \nand without disabilities in the same classroom. Co-teaching ensures \nthat students with disabilities receive not only the special \ninstruction, supports, and services they are entitled to under IDEA, \nbut also are taught the same rigorous academic content as any other \nstudents.\n  However, achieving this is no easy task. Successful co-teaching \nrequires that educators truly work together so their knowledge and \nskills truly complement one another. At the end of the day that \nrequires that specialized professional development is provided to these \nteachers.\n  As such, the Co-Teaching Educator Professional Development Act of \n2007 would amend Title II of the No Child Left Behind Act to award \ncompetitive grants to school districts to provide high-quality \nprofessional development opportunities for general education teachers, \nspecial education teachers, principals, and administrators to ensure \nthat these educators have the necessary pedagogical, collaborative, \nplanning, and interpersonal skills to successfully implement a co-\nteaching model and increase the achievement of students with \ndisabilities. Such professional development training would help \nteachers, principals, and administrators address diverse learning and \nstudent needs; clearly define classroom, teaching, and decision-making \nresponsibilities; develop effective communication, problem-solving, \nclassroom management, and conflict resolution skills; and jointly \ndevelop and plan a student's IEP and overall classroom curriculum.\n  In short, this bill provides teachers, principals, and administrators \nwith the skills and tools to help ensure that children with \ndisabilities receive the\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\neducational assistance and support they need and deserve.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to provide for school improvement, comprehensive, high-quality \nmulti-year induction and mentoring for new teachers, and professional \ndevelopment for experienced teachers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the School Improvement \nthrough Teacher Quality Act of 2007, to foster the development of a \nhighly skilled and effective teacher workforce capable of improving \nstudent achievement in this country.\n  We are slated to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct this Congress for the first time since 2001. The key to this \nreauthorization will be ensuring that states, districts, and schools \nare given the resources, tools, and support to improve student \nlearning, including targeted, high-quality efforts to improve a school \nwhen it is identified as in need of improvement under the law.\n  Improving teacher quality is the single most effective step we can \ntake to increase student achievement and turnaround failing schools. \nStudies have found that 40 to 90 percent of the difference in student \ntest scores can be attributed to teacher quality. Unfortunately, new \nteachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, face such \nchallenging working conditions that nearly half leave the profession \nwithin their first 5 years, one-third leave within their first 3 years, \nand 14 percent leave by the end of their first year.\n  However, research has shown that offering new teachers comprehensive, \nmulti-year mentoring and guidance cuts attrition rates in half, and \nhelps these teachers become high-quality professionals who improve \nstudent achievement. At the same time, we know that experienced \nteachers also need effective, sustained professional development to \nmaintain and improve their teaching skills.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing the School Improvement through \nTeacher Quality Act of 2007, cosponsored by Senators Murray, Obama, and \nBrown. This legislation amends Title II of the No Child Left Behind Act \nto create a new $500 million formula-based program for school districts \nto provide targeted assistance so teachers in low-performing, high-\npoverty schools get comprehensive, high-quality multi-year guidance and \nmentoring for new teachers and systematic, sustained professional \ndevelopment for experienced teachers.\n  First, this legislation would direct funding to districts with \nfailing schools to help implement a high-quality induction program for \nteachers throughout at least their first two years of full-time \nteaching. This intensive support for beginning teachers would \nincorporate proven strategies such as: rigorous mentor selection; \nongoing mentoring with school-protected release time; research-based \nprofessional development for mentors and school leaders; and research-\nbased teaching practices, formative assessments, and teacher \nportfolios. Research has demonstrated that such mentoring for beginning \nteachers at institutions like the New Teacher Center at University of \nCalifornia, Santa Cruz provides a return on investment, $1.66 for every \n$1\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nspent; increases the new teacher retention rate, to 88 percent after 6 \nyears in some California districts; and strengthens beginning teacher \neffectiveness to such an extent that their students demonstrate \nlearning gains similar to those students of their more veteran \ncounterparts.\n  Second, the School Improvement through Teacher Quality Act of 2007 \nwould offer funding for struggling schools to provide their veteran \nteachers with ongoing professional development and training, including \nhelping such schools develop and implement rigorous curricula aligned \nto State standards and student needs; design and evaluate assessments; \nimplement strategies to improve student achievement and teacher \neffectiveness; train teachers, principals, and administrators in \neffective coaching strategies, analyzing school and student data, and \nstrategies for teaching students with disabilities and English Language \nLearners; and utilize teacher leaders, coaches, or content experts to \nsupport learning and model effective collaboration skills.\n  This assistance would be tied to a modified definition of \nprofessional development based on successful nationwide models such as \nthe National Staff Development Council, with an increased focus on \ncollaboration among teachers, including engaging established teams of \nteachers to plan and develop instruction across grade level and content \narea and to evaluate and analyze data on student achievement and \nlearning goals. This professional development would occur multiple \ntimes per week during the regular work day, and be supported by school \nprincipals through school-based coaches, mentors, or lead teachers who \nallocate time, resources, and structured facilitation to the learning \nteams or cohorts.\n  Lastly, this legislation requires that an external evaluation be \nconducted of the mentoring and professional development programs \nauthorized and supported under this act. Outcomes would be based on \nmeasures such as teacher retention, student learning gains, teacher \ninstructional practice, and parent, family, and community involvement.\n  We must act on this bill and continue to push for increased Federal \ninvestment in improving schools through enhanced teacher quality and \nprofessional development. The stakes are too high, not just in terms of \nmeeting the current highly qualified requirements of the No Child Left \nBehind Act, but to take the next step and ensure that each and every \nclassroom in America is taught by an effective teacher. Teachers are \nthe key to student success and student success will in turn keep our \ncountry competitive in today's global economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work for its \ninclusion in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Teacher quality is the single most important factor \n     influencing student learning and achievement.\n       (2) Studies have found that 40 to 90 percent of the \n     difference in student test scores can be attributed to \n     teacher quality.\n       (3) New teachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, \n     face such challenging working conditions that nearly half \n     leave the profession within their first 5 years, \\1/3\\ leave \n     within their first 3 years, and 14 percent leave by the end \n     of their first year.\n       (4) The rate of attrition is roughly 50 percent higher in \n     poor schools than in wealthier ones.\n       (5) A report by the Alliance for Excellent Education \n     estimated that the cost of replacing public school teachers \n     who have dropped out of the profession is $2,600,000,000 per \n     year.\n       (6) Comprehensive induction cuts attrition rates in half, \n     and helps to develop novice teachers into high-quality \n     professionals who improve student achievement.\n       (7) Research has demonstrated that comprehensive, multi-\n     year induction--such as that provided by the New Teacher \n     Center at University of California, Santa Cruz--provides a \n     return on investment ($1.66 for every $1 spent); increases \n     the new teacher retention rate (to 88 percent after 6 years \n     in some California districts); and strengthens beginning \n     teacher effectiveness to such an extent that their students \n     demonstrate learning gains similar to those students of their \n     more veteran counterparts.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to build \n     capacity and grow effective teachers and principals in our \n     Nation's schools through--\n       (1) comprehensive, high-quality, rigorous multi-year \n     induction and mentoring programs for beginning teachers; and\n       (2) systematic, sustained, coherent team-based, job-\n     embedded professional development for experienced teachers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve the quality of, and access to, long-term \ncare; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Long-Term \nCare Quality and Modernization Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined \nby my\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \ncommitted to improving the financing and delivery of long-term care. \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that national \nspending for long-term care was almost $160 billion in 2002, \nrepresenting about 12 percent of all personal health care expenditures. \nWhile those numbers are already staggering, we also know that the need \nfor long-term care is expected to grow significantly in coming decades. \nAlmost two-thirds of people receiving long-term care services are over \nage 65, with this number expected to double by 2030.\n  Providing quality long-term care services for America's frail, \nelderly and disabled is the priority of nursing homes and assisted \nliving facilities. I applaud their work, but recognize we must do more \nto improve care and contain costs. When you consider that eight of ten \nnursing home residents rely on Medicare and Medicaid for their long-\nterm care needs, it is apparent that Congress has a responsibility to \nimprove these programs so they are sustainable for years to come.\n  That is why I am introducing The Long-Term Care Quality and \nModernization Act of 2007 with Senator Lincoln. This bill will address \nseveral problems nursing homes are experiencing with federal \nregulations, workforce shortages and taxes related to building \ndepreciation. The issue of long-term care expenditures need not be an \ninsurmountable task. It will require action and cooperation by public \nofficials and private providers as we work to find ways to help \nAmericans become better prepared for their long-term care needs.\n  However, we cannot do it alone. Individuals must take responsibility \nand begin planning for their long-term care needs. With our national \nsavings rate in steady decline, I fear the American middle class is \nwoefully unprepared to meet this coming challenges. As we move forward \nin our effort to help individuals stay financially stable in their \nlater years, we must encourage them to purchase long-term care \ninsurance and save for long-term care services.\n  Today, millions of Americans are receiving or are in need of long-\nterm care services and supports. Surprisingly, more than 40 percent of \npersons receiving long-term care are between the ages of 18 and 64. \nSome were born with disabilities; others came to be disabled through \naccident or illness. No one can predict their future long-term health \ncare needs. Therefore, everyone needs to be prepared.\n  Included in the bill I am introducing today is The Long-Term Care \nTrust Account Act of 2007. My legislation will create a new type of \nsavings vehicle for the purpose of preparing for the costs associated \nwith long-term care services and purchasing long-term care insurance. \nAn individual who establishes a long-term care trust account can \ncontribute up to $5,000 per year to their account and receive a \nrefundable 10 percent tax credit on that contribution. Interest accrued \non these accounts will be tax free, and funds can be withdrawn for the \npurchase of long-term care insurance or to pay for long-term care \nservices. The bill also will allow an individual to make contributions \nto another family members' Long-Term Care Trust Account. This will help \nmany people in our country who want to help their parents or a loved \none prepare for their health care needs.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help all Americans save for \ntheir long-term care needs. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1981. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding environmental education, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the No Child Left \nInside Act of 2007, which will provide new support for environmental \neducation in our Nation's classrooms. Given the major environmental \nchallenges we face today, teaching our young people about their natural \nworld should be a priority, and this legislation is an important first \nstep.\n  For more than three decades, environmental education has been a \ngrowing part of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding \nto the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the \n21st century economy, many schools throughout the Nation now offer some \nform of environmental education. Mr. President, 30 million students and \n1.2 million teachers annually are involved in these programs.\n  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many \nschools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental \nprograms. Fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related \nclassroom instruction and field investigations, however effective or \npopular. State and local administrators, teachers, and environmental \neducators point to two factors behind this recent and disturbing shift: \nthe unintended consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act and a lack \nof funding for these critical programs.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would address these two \ncauses. It would provide funding to States to train their teachers in \nthe field of environmental education, and it would provide support for \noutdoor environmental education programs for children and a model \nenvironmental education curriculum. The bill would also create \nincentives, through new funding, for states to develop environmental \nliteracy plans to make sure students have a solid understanding of our \nplanet and its precious natural resources. Finally, the legislation \nwould reestablish the Office of Environmental Education within the U.S. \nDepartment of Education to oversee critical environmental education \nactivities. This legislation has broad support among national and state \nenvironmental groups and educational groups.\n  The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of \nthe dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003, a National Science \nFoundation panel noted that ``in the coming decades, the public will \nmore frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental \nissues, assess risk, evaluate proposed environmental plans and \nunderstand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and \nglobal scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a \nconcerted, systemic approach to environmental education ...'' In the \nprivate sector, business leaders also increasingly believe that an \nenvironmentally literate workforce is critical to their long-term \nsuccess. They recognize that better, more efficient environmental \npractices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for \nthe future.\n  Climate change, conservation of precious natural resources, \nmaintaining clean air and water, and other environmental challenges are \npressing and complex issues that influence human health, economic \ndevelopment and national security. Finding widespread agreement about \nthe specific steps we need to take to solve these problems is \ndifficult. Environmental education will help ensure that our Nation's \nchildren have the knowledge and skills necessary to address these \ncritical issues. In short, the environment should be an important part \nof the curriculum in our schools.\n  I know my constituents in Rhode Island, as well as the residents of \nother States, want their children to be environmentally literate and \nhave a connection with the natural world. I am proud to sponsor this \nimportant legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact the No Child Left Inside Act of 2007. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1981\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Together \n     we represent more than 7 million citizens who are passionate \n     about the inclusion of environmental education in students' \n     learning.\n       The country is facing a host of complicated environmental \n     challenges, but we are not providing an adequate \n     environmental education to our young people. Indeed, over the \n     past few years many schools have cut back on instruction \n     related to the environment, canceling field trips and \n     meaningful outdoor explorations. Three decades of growth in \n     environmental education has been hampered by No Child Left \n     Behind, even as the nation's environmental issues have grown \n     increasingly complex.\n       We believe it is critical to reverse this trend and provide \n     children with a solid understanding of the planet and the \n     problems it faces. As they will be called upon throughout \n     their lives to sort out various environmental claims and \n     issues impacting their jobs, health, security and \n     transportation, our children need to have the tools to be \n     able to make wise decisions and choices.\n       To that end, we support several changes to the No Child \n     Left Behind Act that would emphasize the importance of \n     environmental education:\n       New funding should be available to help states develop \n     rigorous environmental education standards and improve \n     teacher training.\n       To be eligible for new environmental education funding, \n     states would be required to develop plans to ensure that \n     their students are environmentally literate.\n       These changes will provide the incentives and support \n     school systems need to offer more and better environmental \n     instruction. The rewards are likely to be great. We know from \n     past research that students who take part in environmental \n     education programs become more engaged with school and do \n     better on standardized tests.\n       Our coalition urges that the reauthorization of the No \n     Child Left Behind Act not only improve educational offerings \n     but provide new support for environmental education.\n       Once again, we thank you for your leadership on this \n     important issue.\n       If you would like additional information, please contact \n     Don Baugh, representing the No Child Left Inside Coalition.\n           Sincerely,\n         Pam Gluck, Executive Director, American Trails; Andrew J. \n           Falender, Executive Director, Appalachian Mountain \n           Club; Jen Levy, Executive Director, Association of \n           Nature Center Administrators; Steve Olson, Director of \n           Government Affairs, Association of Zoos and Aquariums; \n           Lori Whalen, Director of Education, Back to Natives \n           Restoration; William C.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the United States \nEmployee Ownership Bank, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am introducing today with Senator Leahy \nthe U.S. Employee Ownership Bank Act.\n  At a time when the U.S. has lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs; \nat a time when we are on the cusp of losing millions of high-paying \ninformation technology jobs, this legislation would begin to reverse \nthat trend by providing employees with the resources they need to \npurchase their own businesses through Employee Stock Ownership Plans \nand Eligible Worker Owned Cooperatives.\n  Specifically, this legislation would authorize $100 million to create \na U.S. Employee Ownership Bank within the Department of Treasury to \nprovide loans, loan guarantees, technical assistance, and grants to \nexpand employee ownership throughout the country.\n  Why is it so important for the Senate to provide incentives to expand \nemployee ownership in this country? The answer is simple: employee \nownership is one of the keys to creating a sustainable economy with \njobs that pay a living wage.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the ESOP Association, a \nnonprofit organization representing approximately 2,500 Employee Stock \nOwnership Plans throughout the country. Let me quote from a letter they \nrecently sent to my office:\n\n       Your legislation is a modest first step in awakening our \n     Government to the fact that in the 21st Century the inclusion \n     of employees as owners of the companies where they work in a \n     meaningful manner should be a key component of any national \n     competitiveness program. If the Senate adopts your \n     legislation, and it eventually becomes law, we assure you \n     that the ESOP community will work constructively to ensure \n     that the loan and grant program you propose works effectively \n     to benefit the employee owners, the employee owned companies, \n     and our American economy.\n  Every day we read in the papers about plants that are being moved to \nChina, Mexico, and a number of other low wage countries. Since a number \nof these factories were making profits, shutting them down was \nunnecessary and could have been avoided by selling these factories to \ntheir employees through ESOPs or worker-owned cooperatives.\n  Since 2000, the U.S. manufacturing sector has lost 3.2 million \ndecent-paying jobs. Put another way, since George W. Bush has been \nelected President, this country has seen one out of every six factory \njobs disappear.\n  In addition, the Associated Press recently reported about a study by \nMoody's which found that ``16 percent of the nation's 379 metropolitan \nareas are in recession, reflecting primarily the troubles in \nmanufacturing.''\n  In other words, about 16 percent of the biggest cities in this \ncountry are experiencing a recession, largely due to the loss of \ndecent-paying manufacturing jobs. I suspect that this problem is even \nworse in rural areas. In my small State of Vermont, we have lost about \n20 percent of our manufacturing jobs over the past 6 years representing \nover 10,000 jobs.\n  Let me just give you an example of some of the jobs that have been \nlost. From 2001-2006 the United States of America experienced the loss \nof 42 percent of our communication equipment jobs; 37 percent of our \nsemiconductor and electronic component manufacturing jobs; 43 percent \nof our textile jobs; and about half of our apparel jobs.\n  Not only are we losing decent-paying manufacturing jobs, we are also \nlosing high-paying information technology jobs as well.\n  While the loss of manufacturing jobs has been well-documented, it may \ncome as a surprise to some that from January of 2001 to January of \n2006, the information sector of the U.S. economy lost over 640,000 jobs \nor more than 17 percent of its workforce.\n  Unfortunately, the worst may be yet to come. Alan Blinder, an \neconomist at Princeton and the former Vice Chairman of the Federal \nReserve has recently concluded that between 30 and 40 million jobs in \nthe United States are vulnerable to overseas outsourcing over the next \n10 to 20 years.\n  Would expanding employee ownership be a cure-all for what ails the \nmanufacturing and information technology sectors? Of course it \nwouldn't. But I strongly believe that employee ownership can and should \nbe one of the central strategies in combating the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs. Simply put, workers who are also owners will not move \ntheir own jobs to China.\n  Today, there are some 11,000 Employee Stock Ownership Plans, hundreds \nof worker owned cooperatives, and thousands of other companies with \nsome form of employee ownership, and most of them are thriving.\n  In fact, employee ownership has been proven to increase employment, \nincrease productivity, increase sales, and increase wages in the United \nStates. According to a Rutgers University study, broad based employee \nownership boosts company productivity by 4 percent shareholder return \nby 2 percent and profits by 14 percent. Similar studies have shown that \nESOP companies paid their hourly workers between 5 to 12 percent better \nthan non-ESOP companies.\n  Yet, despite the important role that worker ownership can play in \nrevitalizing our economy, the Federal Government has failed to commit \nthe resources needed to allow employee ownership to realize its true \npotential, and that is why this legislation is so important.\n  When I was the Ranking Member of the Financial Institutions and \nConsumer Credit Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, I was \nable to hold a hearing on this issue nearly 4 years ago.\n  During the hearing, a number of witnesses told the Subcommittee that \nif Federal loans, loan guarantees, technical assistance and grants were \nmade available for the expansion of employee ownership, factories that \nare now closed and abandoned would be open for business today.\n  For example, the Subcommittee heard from Larry Owenby who worked at \nthe RFS Ecusta mill in North Carolina for 30 years until one day, the \ncompany decided to shut down.\n  Other witnesses talked about factories that were closed in \nMississippi, Alabama and Ohio. All of the witnesses testified in \nsupport of Federal loans, loan guarantees and technical assistance for \nthe expansion of employee ownership. In fact, if this assistance had \nbeen around before the plants had closed, many of them would still be \nemployed today as employee owners.\n  The final point that I want to make is that the Federal Government, \nthrough the U.S. Export-Import Bank, is already providing billions of \ndollars in loans, loan guarantees and other assistance to large, multi-\nnational companies, such as Boeing, General Electric, and Halliburton. \nMany of these companies happen to be some of the largest job cutters in \nAmerica, as they have moved hundreds of thousands of jobs to China, \nIndia, and Mexico.\n  In my opinion, instead of providing corporate welfare to large \ncorporations that are throwing American workers out on the street as \nthey move overseas, we should be providing employees with the tools \nthey need to create and retain jobs right here in the United States \nthrough the expansion of employee ownership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10791-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10791-S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Thune, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 1934.

A bill to reauthorize the Rio Puerco Watershed Management \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nreauthorizing the Rio Puerco Watershed Management Program, which became \nlaw in 1996. In the 10 years since it was formalized by Congress, the \nRio Puerco Management Committee has helped facilitate a collaborative \napproach for the restoration of the highly degraded Rio Puerco \nWatershed, which at 7,000 square miles is the largest tributary to the \nRio Grande in terms of area and sediment.\n  The Rio Puerco was once known as New Mexico's breadbasket, with water \nsupply and soil tilth to support that reputation. Over time, extensive \necological changes have occurred in the Rio Puerco Watershed, some of \nwhich have resulted in damage to the watershed that has seriously \naffected the economic and cultural well-being of its inhabitants. This \nhas resulted in the loss of existing communities that were based on the \nland and were self-sustaining. According to the Bureau of Land \nManagement, while the Rio Puerco contributes less than 10 percent of \nthe total water to the Rio Grande, it represents the primary source of \nsedimentation entering the Upper Rio Grande with far reaching effects \nthroughout the lower portions of the river. For example, the Rio Puerco \ncontributes the majority of the silt entering Elephant Butte Reservoir \nabout 65 miles downstream of its confluence with the Rio Grande.\n  The Rio Puerco Management Committee has become one of the most \neffective collaborative land management efforts in the Southwest, \nparticularly given the challenges posed by the multi-jurisdictional \nnature of the watershed. It has successfully developed and implemented \nproposals for watershed rehabilitation on a collaborative basis with \nparticipation from private stakeholders, various Federal agencies, \nNative American Indian tribes, State agencies, and local governments. \nFor example, the committee took on the bold proposal of returning the \nRio Puerco to its original streambed, originally altered to accommodate \nthe construction of State Highway 44, now U.S. Highway 550, in the late \n1960s. According to the BLM, the channel became a primary contributor \nof erosion and sediment in the river main stem, and even began \nadvancing toward U.S. 550, threatening the highways stability. This \nlarge-scale project is one of only three in the entire country that has \nattempted to reintroduce a channelized river into its original meander.\n  I am proud to say that the committee's holistic approach has also \nfacilitated low-tech but time-intensive restoration projects and \ncommunity outreach initiatives which have actively engaged community \nmembers and the Youth Conservation Corps. This has helped develop a \nsense of ownership and community responsibility for the restoration of \nthe Rio Puerco while also providing our State's youth valuable resource \nmanagement skills and teaching them how to be responsible stewards of \nthe land now and in the future.\n  I am pleased Senator Domenici is a cosponsor of this reauthorization \nbill, and I thank him for always being a strong advocate for this \nprogram. The Rio Puerco Management Committee has demonstrated the \nachievements that can be made by working cooperatively to advance the \nrestoration of and maintenance of this watershed. It is also clear that \nmore work needs to be done, and it is my sincere hope that the Congress \nand the administration will continue to work in a similar cooperative \nmanner to ensure adequate funding is provided for this important \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the need for targeted restoration work \nin the Rio Puerco watershed came to my attention during the early \n1990s. Congress began funding local efforts to improve the Rio Puerco \narea in 1992, and the Rio Puerco Management Program was formally \nauthorized by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of \n1996.\n  The Rio Puerco Basin is the largest tributary to the Middle Rio \nGrande Basin. The watershed encompasses nearly 5 million acres and acts \nas drainage for portions of 7 counties in my home State of New Mexico. \nThe Rio Puerco watershed is a major source of silt in Elephant Butte \nReservoir. In fact, the Department of Interior's U.S. Geological Survey \nhas identified the Rio Puerco as having one of the highest sediment \nconcentrations. The objective of the collaborative program is to \ncurtail sedimentation from washing down the Rio Puerco to the Rio \nGrande and Elephant Butte. As intended, this program has helped to \nfacilitate cooperation between Federal, State, and local agencies along \nwith local landowners to improve the health of the Rio Puerco watershed \nby working together to implement projects that help control erosion and \nreduce the flow of sediment into the Rio Grande.\n  I believe the program has accomplished much during its tenure, and I \nfully support its objectives. I am pleased to join my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Bingaman, as a cosponsor of this bill, and I look \nforward to working with him to see that this important program is \nreauthorized.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 1942. A bill to amend part D of title V of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for the renovation of \nschools; to the Committee on Health, Education, labor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nSchool Repair and Renovation Act. I offer this legislation to meet the \nurgent need for support to repair crumbling schools in disadvantaged \nand rural school districts.\n  We all agree that school infrastructure requires constant \nmaintenance. Unfortunately, far too many schools have been forced to \nneglect ongoing issues, most likely due to lack of funds, which can \nlead to health and safety problems for students, educators and staff. \nThe most recent infrastructure report card issued by the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers gives public schools a ``D'' grade. Now, I \ndon't know many parents who would find ``D'' grades acceptable for \ntheir children. So why on earth would we stand by while the state of \nthe buildings in which our children learn are assigned such a grade?\n  Despite the declining condition of many public schools, Federal grant \nfunding is generally not available to leverage local spending. In \nfiscal year 2001, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee which I then chaired, I was able \nto secure $1.2 billion for school repair and renovation. I continue to \nhear nothing but positive feedback from educators across the country \nabout that funding.\n  But that one-time investment amounted to nothing more than a drop in \nthe bucket compared to the estimated national need. In 1995, the \nGeneral Accounting Office reported that the nation's K-12 schools \nneeded some $112 billion in repairs and upgrades. A more recent study \nby the National Education Association put the estimate as high as $322 \nbillion.\n  I have been heartened by the recent boom in local and State spending \non\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nschool facilities. However, the distribution of these recent \ninvestments has been overwhelmingly slanted to the most affluent \ncommunities which are better able to fund new investments without \noutside assistance. A 2006 study released by the Building Educational \nSuccess Together, BEST, coalition found that the quality of your \nchild's school is dependent upon his or her racial or ethnic background \nand whether they live in a rich or poor neighborhood.\n  Local spending on school facilities in affluent communities is almost \ntwice as high as in our most disadvantaged communities, as measured on \na per-pupil basis. The report also found that school districts with \npredominantly caucasian enrollment benefited from about $2000 more per \nstudent in school repair and construction spending than their peers \nliving in school districts with predominantly minority enrollment.\n  The Public School Repair and Renovation Act addresses that inequity \nby targeting school renovation grants to those communities that have \nstruggled to fund needed repairs. The bill builds on the model States \nfound successful in the fiscal year 2001 program. States would receive \nfunding based on their most recent Title I allocation to initiate a \ncompetitive grant program targeted to poor and rural school districts. \nStates have the discretion to require matching funds from the local \ndistrict bringing the potential funding to much more than the $1.6 \nbillion Federal investment.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Clinton, and \nMikulski for signing on to this bill. In addition, I am pleased to \nreport this legislation has the support of a diverse group of national \neducation organizations representing teachers, school boards, school \nadministrators, and principals.\n  The Public School Repair and Renovation Act takes a much needed step \nforward in fixing the inequity in public school facilities. Something \nis seriously wrong when children go to modern, gleaming movie theaters, \nshopping malls, and sports arenas, but attend public schools with \ncrumbling walls and leaking roofs. This sends exactly the wrong message \nto children about the importance of education.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support the Public School Repair and \nRenovation Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Casey, Ms. Collins, Mr. Graham, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1944. A bill to provide justice for victims of state-sponsored \nterrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Justice for \nVictims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act with my colleagues, Senators \nSpecter, Menendez, Cornyn, Coleman, Lott, Lieberman, Schumer, Clinton, \nCasey, Collins, Graham, Biden, Stevens, and Feinstein.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation on behalf of the many \nAmericans who have suffered at the hands of State sponsors of \nterrorism. This important legislation will allow victims of state \nsponsored terrorism to have their day in court. It will do so by \nenabling these individuals to both sue for liability and seek financial \ncompensation from the states, such as Iran, which committed these \nmurderous acts, thereby starving them of the funds that they use to \nstrike at innocent victims.\n  In 1983, the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, was \nbombed by the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah, killing 241 \nservicemen and wounding 100 others. In 2003, the U.S. District Court in \nWashington, DC, found the Republic of Iran, which directly supports \nHezbollah, guilty of masterminding that bombing. The victims and their \nfamilies have the right to sue their tormentors and have judgments \nagainst Iran, yet the judgments are not being enforced.\n  In 1996, the President signed into law legislation that I wrote to \namend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to give private American \ncitizens the right to hold U.S. Department of State-designated state \nsponsors of terrorism liable in U.S. courts. This legislation, also \nknown as the Flatow amendment, needs to be clarified and updated. The \nbill I am introducing today will bring clarity to this law on behalf of \nvictims of terrorism and reaffirm their right to sue and collect \ndamages from state sponsors of terrorism.\n  There are several reasons why the law needs to be improved. First, \nthe courts decided in 2004 in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of \nIran that, contrary to the intent of the Flatow amendment, there would \nbe no Federal private right of action against foreign governments. The \nruling stated that there could only be legal action against individual \nofficials and employees of that government. Second, current law permits \njudgment holders to only seize assets over which a terrorist state has \nday-to-day managerial control, thereby allowing terrorist states to \nhide their assets from the victims who have successful judgments \nagainst them. Third, state sponsors of terrorism, such as Libya, which \nis still responsible for terrorist acts it committed in the past, have \nconsistently abused the appeals process to delay litigation \nproceedings.\n  My new legislation will address these issues and improve the ability \nof victims to hold state sponsors of terrorism accountable. First, it \nwill update the Flatow amendment to improve its enforcement by \nreaffirming the right of private citizens to sue state sponsors of \nterrorism. Second, it will allow for the seizure of hidden commercial \nassets belonging to the terrorist state so that the victims of \nterrorism can be justly compensated. Third, it will limit the number of \nappeals that the terrorist state can pursue in U.S. courts. In \naddition, my legislation will provide foreign nationals working for the \nU.S. Government, if they are victims of a terrorist attack during their \nofficial duties, to be covered by these same provisions.\n  While nothing can bring back innocent lives lost to terrorism, the \nstate sponsors of these horrific acts must be made to pay for their \ncrimes. We are united in our belief that state-sponsored terrorism is \nwrong and that the perpetrators of terrorism must be brought to \njustice. This legislation will also strengthen our national security by \ncombating the desire and ability of foreign nations to both finance and \nsupport terrorism. Most importantly, it will empower those innocent \nvictims who have suffered from terrorism to seek justice through the \nrule of American law.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support justice \nfor victims of state sponsored terrorism by supporting this important \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a Federal income tax credit for Patriot \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when companies make headlines today it is \noften for all the wrong reasons: fraud, tax avoidance, profiteering, \netc. Yet many of the companies that are currently providing jobs across \nAmerica are conscientious corporate citizens that strive to treat their \nworkers fairly even as they seek to create good products that consumers \nwant and to maximize profits for their shareholders. I believe that we \nshould reward such companies for providing good jobs to American \nworkers, and create incentives that encourage more companies to do \nlikewise. The Patriot Employers bill does just that.\n  This legislation, which I am introducing today along with Senators \nObama and Brown, would provide a tax credit to reward the companies \nthat treat American workers best. Companies that provide American jobs, \npay decent wages; provide good benefits, and support their employees \nwhen they are called to active duty should enjoy more favorable tax \ntreatment than companies that are unwilling to make the same commitment \nto American workers. The Patriot Employers tax credit would put the tax \ncode on the side of those deserving companies by acknowledging their \ncommitments.\n  The Patriot Employers legislation would provide a tax credit equal to \n1 percent of taxable income to employers that meet the following \ncriteria:\n  First, invest in American jobs, by maintaining or increasing the \nnumber of full-time workers in America relative to the number of full-\ntime workers outside of America, by maintaining their corporate \nheadquarters in America if the company has ever been headquartered in \nAmerica, and by maintaining neutrality in union organizing drives.\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\n  Second, pay decent wages, by paying each worker an hourly wage that \nwould ensure that a full-time worker would earn enough to keep a family \nof three out of poverty, at least $7.80 per hour.\n  Third, prepare workers for retirement, either by providing a defined \nbenefit plan or by providing a defined contribution plan that fully \nmatches at least 5 percent of worker contributions for every employee.\n  Fourth, provide health insurance, by paying at least 60 percent of \neach worker's health care premiums.\n  Fifth, support our troops, by paying the difference between the \nregular salary and the military salary of all National Guard and \nReserve employees who are called for active duty, and also by \ncontinuing their health insurance coverage.\n  In recognition of the different business circumstances that small \nemployers face, companies with fewer than 50 employees could achieve \nPatriot Employer status by fulfilling a smaller number of these \ncriteria.\n  There is more to the story of corporate American than the widely-\npublicized wrong-doing. Patriot Employers should be publicly recognized \nfor doing right by their workers even while they do well for their \ncustomers and shareholders. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Obama, \nSenator Brown, and me in supporting this effort. Our best companies, \nand our American workers, deserve nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to help Federal prosecutors and investigators combat \npublic corruption by strengthening and clarifying the law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to \nintroduce the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act of 2007, a \nbill that will strengthen and clarify key aspects of Federal criminal \nlaw and provide new tools to help investigators and prosecutors attack \npublic corruption nationwide. This is the time to restore the faith of \nthe American people in their Government. Congress took an important \nstep in that direction today in passing long-awaited ethics and \nlobbying reforms that will tighten restrictions on those of us who hold \npublic office, and those who seek to lobby us on behalf of private \nindustry. But rooting out the kinds of rampant public corruption we \nhave seen in recent years requires us to go further and to give \nprosecutors the tools they need to effectively investigate and \nprosecute criminal public corruption offenses.\n  The most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing our \nown rules. Bribery and extortion are committed by people bent on \ngetting around the rules and banking that they will not get caught. \nThese offenses are very difficult to detect and even harder to prove. \nBecause they attack the core of our democracy, these offenses must be \nfound out and punished. Congress must send a signal that it will not \ntolerate this corruption by providing better tools for Federal \nprosecutors to combat it. This b1ll will do exactly that.\n  The bill Senator Cornyn and I introduce today, like a bill that I \nintroduced in the Senate in January, will provide investigators and \nprosecutors more time and resources to pursue public corruption cases. \nBut it goes a step further by amending several key statutes to broaden \ntheir application in corruption contexts and to prevent corrupt public \nofficials and their accomplices from evading or defeating prosecution \nbased on existing legal ambiguities.\n  The bill will help improve the prosecution of public corruption \noffenses in three fundamental ways. First, the bill would give \ninvestigators and prosecutors more time and resources to uncover, \ncharge, and prove three of the most serious and corrosive public \ncorruption offenses. Specifically, it would extend the statute of \nlimitations from 5 years to 6 years for prosecutions involving bribery, \ndeprivation of honest services by a public official, and extortion by a \npublic official. Public corruption cases are among the most difficult \nand time-consuming cases to investigate and prosecute. They often \nrequire the use of informants and electronic monitoring, as well as \nreview of extensive financial and electronic records, techniques which \ntake time to develop and implement. Bank fraud, arson and passport \nfraud, among other\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\noffenses, all have 10-year statutes of limitations. Public corruption \noffenses cut to the heart of our democracy, and a more modest increase \nto the statute of limitations is a reasonable step to help our \ncorruption investigators and prosecutors do their jobs.\n  The bill would also provide significant additional funding for public \ncorruption enforcement. Since 9/11, FBI resources have been shifted \naway from the pursuit of public corruption cases to counterterrorism. \nFBI Director Mueller has recently indicated that public corruption is \nnow a top criminal investigative priority; but a September 2005 report \nby Department of Justice Inspector General Fine found that, from 2000 \nto 2004, there was an overall reduction in public corruption matters \nhandled by the FBI. This must be reversed; our bill will give Offices \nof Inspector General, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Offices, and the \nPublic Integrity Section of the Department of Justice additional \nresources to hire additional public corruption investigators and \nprosecutors. These offices will finally be able to have the manpower \nthey need to track down and prosecute these difficult but crucially \nimportant cases.\n  Second, the bill contains a series of legislative fixes designed to \nimprove the clarity and enhance the effectiveness of existing Federal \ncorruption statutes, such as the law criminalizing the acceptance of \nbribes and gratuities, and the law that govern mail and wire fraud. The \nbribery-gratuities fix resolves ambiguity in the law by making clear \nthat public officials may not accept anything of value, other than what \nis permitted by existing regulations, that is given to them because of \ntheir official position. Similarly, the bill appropriately expands the \ndefinition of what it means for a public official to perform an \n``official act'' for the purposes of the bribery statute to include any \nactions that fall within the duties of that official's public office. \nThe bill also adds two corruption-related crimes as predicates for the \nFederal wiretap and the racketeering statutes, lowers the transactional \namount required for Federal prosecution of bribery involving federally-\nfunded state programs, and expands venue for perjury and obstruction of \njustice prosecutions.\n  Third, the bill raises the statutory maximum penalties for theft of \nGovernment property and Federal bribery to reflect the serious and \ncorrosive nature of these crimes, and to harmonize these statutory \nmaximums with others for which Congress has already raised penalties. \nIncreasing penalties in appropriate cases sends a message to would-be \ncriminals and to the public that there will be severe consequences for \nbreaching the public trust.\n  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct \nthat we have recently witnessed in high-profile public corruption \ncases, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to give investigators \nand prosecutors the tools and resources they need to enforce our laws. \nPassing the ethics and lobbying reform bill is a step in the right \ndirection. But we must finish the job by strengthening the criminal law \nto enable Federal investigators and prosecutors to bring those who \nundermine the public trust to justice. I strongly urge Congress to do \nmore to restore the public's faith in their Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this important \nlegislation with Senator Patrick Leahy, the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. This bill is yet another example of the great \nthings that can come from bipartisan cooperation.\n  Public corruption is not a Republican or Democratic problem. It is a \nWashington, DC problem. It is a problem in statehouses and city halls \nacross this country. Our citizens deserve to be governed by the rule of \nlaw, not the rule of man. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, \na few rotten apples have a tendency to spoil the bunch.\n  The legislation we introduce today, the Public Corruption Prosecution \nImprovements Act, will strengthen the enforcement of U.S. Federal laws \naimed at combating betrayals of public dollars and public trust. Our \nbill does this both by making substantive changes to public corruption \nlaws and by giving prosecutors new tools to use in their battle against \ncorrupt officials.\n  The Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act increases the \nmaximum punishments on several offenses, including theft and \nembezzlement of Federal funds, bribery, and a number of corrupt \ncampaign contribution practices. For example, it cracks down on theft \nor bribery related to entities that receive Federal funds, by \nincreasing the maximum sentence for a conviction from 10 to 15 year and \nlowering the threshold that prosecutors must prove, from $5,000 to \n$1,000. It clarifies the law in response to several court decisions \nnarrowly interpreting the public corruption statutes. For example, the \nbill broadens the definitions of ``illegal gratuities'' and ``official \nacts,'' clarified that an entire ``course of conduct'' can be the \nresult of bribery, and clarified that intangible property interests \nsuch as licenses can now trigger the mail and wire fraud provisions.\n  Federal investigators who seek to root out corrupt officials will \nbenefit from new tools provided in this legislation. The bill would \nextend the statute of limitations on certain serious public corruption \noffenses, giving prosecutors more time to investigate and build a case. \nIt expands the criminal venue provisions, allowing prosecutors to bring \nthe case against corrupt officials in any district where any part of \nthe corruption occurred. The bill similarly expands the venue for \nperjury and obstruction of justice.\n  Finally, the legislation gives Federal law enforcement what they need \nmost to prosecute public corruption: more resources. Funding of $25 \nmillion for each of the fiscal years 2008-2011 will help enhance the \nability of the Department of Justice and the Offices of Inspectors \nGeneral to effectively combat fraud and public corruption.\n  Importantly, these improvements to current law come with significant \ninput from the career professionals in the Department of Justice.\n  But this legislation by itself is only a start if we want to clean up \nWashington, DC. Two additional reforms, in particular, are necessary: \nthe OPEN Government Act, and earmark reform. The operations of \nGovernment should be as transparent as possible. Quite simply, refusing \nto let the public have full access to Government records is a betrayal \nof public trust. This Senate must live up to its duty to provide \ntransparent government and pass the crucial FOIA reforms contained in \nthe OPEN Government Act.\n  Similarly, Congress too often permits its members to walk ethical \ntight-\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nropes through questionable earmarking practices. The public sees these \nfor what they too often are: handouts of taxpayer money to special \ninterests. I think it is of the utmost importance that we increase \ntransparency in the earmarking process, exposing the process to the \nlight of the day.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Public Corruption Prosecution \nImprovements Act, as well as these other important reforms. I look \nforward to debating these issues in Committee and here on the Senate \nfloor. And I thank Chairman Leahy for his leadership on this and other \nlegislation we have crafted together.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1947. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the quality improvement organization (QIO) program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Baucus to introduce the Continuing the Advancement of \nQuality Improvement Act.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to reform Medicare's troubled \nQuality Improvement Organization, QIO, program. QIOs and their \npredecessor organizations have long been responsible for ensuring that \nthe care Medicare beneficiaries receive is medically necessary, meets \nrecognized standards and is provided in appropriate settings. They are \ncurrently tasked with a wide variety of important roles ranging from \ninvestigating beneficiary complaints of poor quality care to giving \ntechnical assistance to Medicare providers for improving health care \nquality.\n  I have been an advocate of reforming the QIO program for quite some \ntime. About 2 years ago, I initiated an investigation into a number of \nthe QIOs. Those investigations revealed a program that is in desperate \nneed of reform. This program was running with little or no oversight, \nand it was expending more than $1 billion every 3 years with little \nmeasurable results. In other words, I found trouble. Let me elaborate \non a few disturbing things that I discovered. I found that one QIO \nleased residential properties for board members and a CEO. That same \nQIO also used Federal funds to lease automobiles for its top \nexecutives. I also found other QIOs who had board members and staff \nattend conferences, many at lavish resorts.\n  I was not the only one to identify serous concerns with the QIOs. \nOthers identified concerns too. Specifically, the Institute of \nMedicine, IOM, the General Accountability Office, GAO, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, Office of the Inspector \nGeheral (OIG) all identified numerous concerns about the effectiveness \nof this program. These independent organizations also voiced their \nconcerns with the manner in which it is operated and have made \nrecommendations for major reform. Their findings clearly show the need \nto hold the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and the \norganizations that serve as QIOs accountable for the important tasks \nthey must perform.\n  The Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act will ensure \nthat the QIO program is not only effective in improving the quality of \ncare provided to our Medicare beneficiaries, but also that it operates \nin an effective, efficient and accountable manner. Much of this \nlegislation is based on the investigations that I conducted and the \ntroubling findings that I came across and on the work of the IOM, the \nGAO, and the HHS OIG.\n  First, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould focus the mission of the QIO program on quality improvement. QIOs \ncurrently have many diverse responsibilities. As a result, they served \nconflicting roles of both ``regulator'' and ``technical assistant.'' \nThis conflict poses significant barriers to QIOs effectively serving \neither role, and we have come to learn that they really don't perform \neither function particularly well.\n  The legislation would also address this conflict by following the \nIOM's recommendation to make the sole purpose of QIOs to be technical \nassistants for quality improvement and performance measurement. The HHS \nSecretary would be required to transfer all other QIO: responsibilities \nto other entities called Medicare Provider Review Organizations, MPROs, \nin a manner that will support the needs of beneficiaries and be \naccountable to them.\n  Second, the legislation would improve the beneficiary complaint \nreview process that I think is in desperate need of reform. You may \nrecall that in 2006 we read about the plight of Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff \nwent to a QIO and filed a complaint about the care provided to his \nwife, who died. The QIO in that case was unresponsive to Mr. Schiff. He \nwas forced to take legal action to learn what the QIO found out about \nhis wife's death. He should not have had to do that. After all, he was \nthe one who filed the complaint with the QIO in the first place because \nhe thought that someone did something wrong that lead to his wife's \ndeath. It was at that juncture that I learned that the beneficiary \ncomplaint review process was too opaque and ineffective. More \nimportantly, beneficiaries were not being properly served. In fact, I \ncame to learn that complainants often do not receive the findings of \nthe investigation conducted by the QIO. Now I ask; what sense does that \nmake?\n  The Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act would \nrequire MPROs to report the investigational findings to the complainant \nand refer the provider to a QIO for technical assistance and/or the \nappropriate regulatory body for sanctions. In other words, this part of \nthe bill would bring transparency to a process now shrouded in a cloud \nof silence.\n  Third, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould ensure that limited resources go to providers that need them the \nmost. The GAO recently found that QIOs prioritized their assistance to \nproviders who would be easiest to help rather than the providers who \nwere most in need of help. In other words the QIOs decided it was \neasier to take a B plus student and make them into an A student rather \nthan putting their resources into the D student to bring them up to \npar. I guess that way they thought that they would look better and more \nsuccessful. But if you ask me; that is not the best way to spend \nlimited taxpayer resources. Now, this bill will insure that if demand \nfor technical assistance exceeds available resources, the QIOs would \ngive priority to providers that are in rural or underserved areas, in \nfinancial need, have low performance measures or have a significant \nnumber of beneficiary complaints. In other words the help is going to \ngo to those who need it most.\n  Fourth, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould make QIO data more available to CMS and providers for quality \nimprovement and patient safety purposes. Amazingly enough, QIOs are \ncurrently restricted from sharing such data despite the obvious value \nof this data for improving health care quality. This legislation would \npermit the sharing of QIO data with providers for quality improvement \nand patient safety purposes and require CMS to make recommendations on \nhow to improve the data sharing process.\n\n  Fifth, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould promote competition in the QIO program. This is a giant leap \nforward. These organizations are currently not subject to significant \ncompetition because of limitations on who can be a QIO and the \navailability of noncompetitive contract renewals. This lack of \ncompetition has led to a gross lack of accountability and stagnation in \nthe QIO program. This legislation would promote competition by allowing \nother types of organizations to serve as QIOs and eliminate \nnoncompetitive renewals.\n  Sixth, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould enhance governance at the QIOs. During the course of my \ninvestigations I identified repeated failures in governance. I exposed \nboard members who were more interested in helping themselves than \nhelping others.\n  This bill will also address board member conflicts of interest. My \ninvestigations identified numerous incidents of questionable QIO \ngovernance practices and board member conflicts of interest. Since the \nQIO program receives over $400 million in taxpayer funding every year, \nit is reasonable for us to expect not only that QIOs are governed in an \nethical manner free of conflicts of interest, but also that CMS \nappropriately oversees the program. This\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\nlegislation would require QIOs to comply with board governance \nrequirements and would require CMS to establish procedures to address \nconflicts of interest and follow those procedures.\n  Finally, the Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement Act \nwould increase much needed accountability in the QIO program. The I0M, \nthe GAO and the HHS OIG have all questioned the effectiveness of the \nQIO program. This legislation would require the Secretary to perform \ninterim and final evaluations of program effectiveness not only at the \nindividual QIO level, but at the overall QIO program level as a whole. \nAlso, high performing QIOs would receive financial rewards while low \nperforming QIOs would receive financial penalties. Finally, the \nSecretary would be required to submit a more detailed annual report \nshowing performance results of QIOs and MPROs and details on how \ntaxpayer dollars are spent.\n  We have been placing more emphasis on the quality of care that our \nMedicare beneficiaries receive from providers. You see this as we \nrequire more transparency in the Medicare program with the public \nreporting of provider quality measures. You also see this as we \ntransform Medicare from being a passive payer of services of any \nquality to a value-based purchaser. These are important reforms that \nwill help improve the quality of care provided in the Medicare program \nand work toward ensuring that limited resources are used more \nefficiently and wisely.\n  As we move toward a payment system based on quality, the reforms in \nthis bill will position the QIO program to support that transformation \nin Medicare to a quality-based purchaser by making the tools and \nassistance available to help Medicare providers improve the quality of \nthe care they provide. The Continuing the Advancement of Quality \nImprovement Act would ensure the QIO program's ability to provide this \nassistance in an effective, efficient and accountable manner and \ncorrect the problems currently plaguing the program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nGrassley in introducing the Continuing the Advancement of Quality \nImprovement Act of 2007.\n  This bill represents another step in our commitment to improving the \nquality of care provided for Medicare beneficiaries and all Americans.\n  The Medicare program funds Quality Improvement Organizations, known \nas QIOs, in part to work with health care providers to help them \nimprove the quality of care they provide.\n  QIOs have played an evolving role in Medicare. Recently, the QIO \nprogram has received a great deal of attention. Not only did Senator \nGrassley and I have the Senate Finance Committee look into aspects of \nQIO operations, but the Institute of Medicine, the Government \nAccountability Office, and the Health and Human Services' Inspector \nGeneral have all opined about QIOs as well. It seems there is a \nconsensus that the QIO program could be doing more to help improve the \nquality of care.\n  That is not to say that QIOs have not been doing good work and \nproviding valuable services up until now. Quite the opposite. However, \nover the course of time, QIOs have been tasked with a number of \nresponsibilities and the program's mission has become blurred.\n  What Senator Grassley and I found, as well as the IOM, the GAO, and \nthe HHS, OIG, is that the QIO program needs a sharper focus. Its \nmission to improve quality must be clear and unambiguous. Therefore, \nthe Continuing the Advancement of Quality Improvement, or CAQI, Act \nwould focus QIOs on providing technical assistance for quality \nimprovement and performance measurement.\n  The bill would separate the beneficiary complaint process from QIOs \nand give this responsibility to Medicare Provider Review Organizations, \nwhich will be required to report to the complainant and refer the \nprovider to a QIO for technical assistance and/or the appropriate \nregulatory body for sanctions. This will make the complaint review \nprocess stronger.\n  The CAQI Act would ensure that QIOs devote their attention to the \nhealth care providers that need help the most. It would also permit \nsharing QIO data with providers for quality improvement and patient \nsafety purposes.\n  The Finance Committee investigation of the QIO program led Senator \nGrassley and I to include certain provisions we believe will enhance \nthe integrity of the program. So, the CAQI Act would promote \ncompetition by allowing other types of organizations to serve as QIOs \nand eliminating noncompetitive renewals.\n  To ensure ``corporate'' integrity, the CAQI Act would establish \nrequirements for governance and boards of directors at the QIOs, as \nwell as requiring CMS to establish ways to avoid conflicts of interest.\n  The CAQI Act aims to ensure greater accountability for individual \nQIOs, and the QIO program as a whole. It would require the Secretary to \nperform evaluations of the effectiveness of each QIO and the whole \nprogram. QIOs would be evaluated on consistent measures that are based \non nationwide priorities for quality improvement. The Secretary would \nbe required to report to Congress annually on QIO performance, \nincluding how program funds were spent.\n  The QIO program is an asset to the Medicare program and the health \ncare system in general. We have an opportunity to improve its \neffectiveness. We can make it a more useful tool as we continue \nadvancing toward quality improvement. We have a duty to make the \nMedicare program as strong and robust as it can be. The Continuing the \nAdvancement of Quality Improvement Act presents an opportunity to do \njust that. Senator Grassley and I urge our Colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 1949.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Manufacturing Act of 1946 \nto require labeling of raw agricultural forms of ginseng, including the \ncountry of harvest, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss legislation I am \nintroducing with the Senior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, which \nwould protect ginseng farmers and consumers by ensuring that ginseng is \nlabeled accurately with where the root was harvested. The Ginseng \nHarvest Labeling Act of 2007 is similar to bills that I introduced in \nprevious Congresses and developed after hearing suggestions from \nginseng growers and the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to discuss American ginseng and \nthe problems facing Wisconsin's ginseng growers so that my colleagues \nunderstand the need for this legislation. Chinese and Native American \ncultures have used ginseng for thousands of years for herbal and \nmedicinal purposes. As a dietary supplement, American ginseng is widely \ntouted for its ability to improve energy and vitality, particularly in \nfighting fatigue or stress.\n  In the U.S., ginseng is experiencing increasing popularity as a \ndietary supplement, and I am proud to say that my home State of \nWisconsin is playing a central role in ginseng's resurgence. Wisconsin \nproduces over 90 percent of the ginseng grown in the U.S., with the \nvast majority of that ginseng grown in just one Wisconsin county, \nMarathon County. Ginseng is also grown in a number of other states such \nas Maine, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, \nand West Virginia.\n  For Wisconsin, ginseng has been an economic boon. Wisconsin ginseng \ncommands a premium price in world markets because it is of the highest \nquality and because it has a low pesticide and chemical content. In \n2002, U.S. exports of ginseng totaled nearly $45 million, much of which \nwas grown in Wisconsin. With a huge market for this high-quality \nginseng overseas, and growing popularity for the ancient root here at \nhome, Wisconsin's ginseng industry should have a prosperous future \nahead.\n  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious \nproblem, smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is \nconsidered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go \nto great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as \n``Wisconsin-grown.''\n  Here is how the switch takes place: Wisconsin ginseng is shipped to \nChina to be sorted into various grades. While the sorting process is \nitself a legitimate part of distributing ginseng, smugglers too often \nuse it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng with Asian or Canadian-\ngrown ginseng considered inferior by consumers. The lower quality \nginseng is then shipped back to the U.S. for sale to American consumers \nwho think they are buying the Wisconsin-grown product.\n  There is good reason consumers should want to know that the ginseng \nthey buy is American-grown considering that the only accurate way of \ntesting ginseng to determine where it was grown is to test for \npesticides that are banned in the U.S. The Ginseng Board of Wisconsin \nhas been testing some ginseng found on store shelves, and in many of \nthe products, residues of chemicals such as DDT, lead, arsenic, and \nquintozine, PCNB, have been detected. Since the majority of ginseng \nsold in the U.S. originates from countries with less stringent \npesticide standards, it is vitally important that consumers know which \nginseng is really grown in the U.S.\n  To capitalize on their product's preeminence, the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin has developed a voluntary labeling program, stating that the \nginseng is ``Grown in Wisconsin, U.S.A.'' However, Wisconsin ginseng is \nso valuable that counterfeit labels and ginseng smuggling have become \nwidespread around the world. As a result, consumers have no way of \nknowing the most basic information about the ginseng they purchase--\nwhere it was grown, what quality or grade it is, or whether it contains \ndangerous pesticides.\n  My legislation, the Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act of 2007, proposes \nsome common sense steps to address some of the challenges facing the \nginseng industry. My legislation requires that ginseng, as a raw \nagricultural commodity, be clearly labeled with the country of harvest \nat the point of importation or when it is sold at wholesale or retail. \n``Harvest'' is important because some Canadian and Chinese growers have \nginseng plants that originated in the U.S., but because these plants \nwere cultivated in a foreign country, they may have been treated with \nchemicals not allowed for use in the U.S. This label would also allow \nbuyers of ginseng to more easily prevent foreign companies from mixing \nforeign-produced ginseng with ginseng harvested in the U.S. The country \nof harvest labeling is a simple but effective way to enable consumers \nto make an informed decision.\n  I have also made sure that these straight-forward labeling provisions \nare reasonable for the legitimate importers, wholesalers and retailers \nof ginseng. My bill only covers ginseng as a raw root, the form in \nwhich the majority of the high quality Wisconsin ginseng is sold. I \nhave also clarified the legislation to make it clear that retailers are \nonly responsible for transmitting the country of harvest label that \nthey received from the importer or wholesaler to the consumer. So if \nthe retailer never received the country of harvest label, it is only \nthe wholesaler or importer that is liable. Moreover, I added a \nprovision that requires the USDA to conduct outreach to the \nwholesalers, importers, retailers, trade associations and other \ninterested parties during the 180 days provided before the labeling \nrequirement takes effect.\n  Besides the support from the ginseng growers of the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin, I am glad to have the support of the American Herbal \nProducts Association and the United Natural Products Alliance. The \nsupport of both the growers of ginseng and these trade associations \nfocused on herbal and natural products are further testament to the \nbroad support for the legislation Senator Kohl and I introduce today.\n  These commonsense reforms would give ginseng growers the support they \ndeserve and help consumers make informed choices about the ginseng that \nthey consume. We must ensure that when ginseng consumers seek out a \nhigh-quality ginseng root--such as Wisconsin-grown ginseng, they are \ngetting the real thing, not a knock-off.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1953\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to pharmacies under part D; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pharmacy Access \nImprovement Act of 2007. This is an updated version of a bill I \nintroduced last year, and I am proud to bring it back.\n  I am excited that this year's bill is bipartisan. I am happy that \nSenator Grassley has joined me in introducing this bill. Given all of \nour work together on the Medicare prescription drug benefit, I am glad \nhe is a cosponsor. I also am pleased to have our Senate colleagues join \nus on this important piece of legislation.\n  The Medicare prescription drug benefit got off to a bumpy start last \nyear. A lot of the problems have been fixed, and the benefit is \nproviding millions of seniors with access to affordable prescription \ndrugs. Unfortunately, a number of the problems facing pharmacists \nremain. We need to help them.\n  The Medicare drug benefit brought about big changes to the pharmacy \nbusiness. Dual eligible beneficiaries switched from Medicaid to \nMedicare drug coverage. Many more seniors have drug coverage. Dozens of \nnew private drug plans are available.\n  I have heard from pharmacists in Montana who are struggling. They are \ntrying to help their patients. But they face great difficulty. The \nsuccess of the Medicare drug benefit depends on the pharmacists who \ndeliver the drugs. So we have to help them. We must act now, before \npharmacists find that they are no longer able to provide drugs to \nMedicare beneficiaries, or to provide drugs at all.\n  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would do several things to help \npharmacies. First, it would strengthen the access standards that drug \nplans have to meet. It is important that the drug plans contract with \nbroad and far-reaching networks of pharmacies. This bill would ensure \nthat the pharmacies that drug plans count in their networks provide \nreal access to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  It would also help safety net pharmacies to join drug plan networks. \nThese pharmacies serve the most vulnerable patients and should be able \nto continue to do so. Drug plans should not be allowed to exclude \nsafety net pharmacies. Excluding them does a huge disservice to needy \nbeneficiaries. This bill would rectify the problems that safety net \npharmacies have encountered in participating in the Medicare drug \nbenefit.\n  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would speed up reimbursement to \npharmacies. The delays in receiving payment from drug plans have forced \npharmacies to seek additional credit, dip into their savings, or worse, \nas they try to continue operations. This bill would require drug plans \nto pay promptly. Most claims would be reimbursed within 2 weeks. And \nthe bill would impose a monetary penalty on plans that pay late.\n  One of the most common complaints from beneficiaries has been how \nconfusing the practice of co-branding is. Co-branding is when a drug \nplan partners with a pharmacy chain and then includes the pharmacy's \nlogo or name on its marketing materials and identification cards. This \nis confusing, because it sends the message that drugs are available \nonly from that pharmacy. That is not true. To help end this confusion, \nthe Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would prohibit drug plans from \nplacing pharmacy logos or trademarks on their identification cards and \nrestrict other forms of co-branding.\n  This bill would also require that plans provide pharmacists with more \naccurate and updated information about reimbursement rates. Currently, \nsome plans do not divulge to pharmacists how much a particular \nprescription will be reimbursed prior to dispensing. This bill would \nrequire disclosure before a pharmacist dispenses. It would require \nregular updating and disclosure of pricing standards.\n  The problems that pharmacists are facing are real. And they are not \ngoing away. We must act on the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act before \nit is too late for many pharmacists and the beneficiaries whom they \nserve. We have a duty to make the Medicare drug benefit as strong and \nrobust as it can be. And the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act presents \nan opportunity for us to do just that. My cosponsors and I urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Baucus, as well as Senators Lincoln, Roberts, Conrad, \nEnzi, Schumer, Cochran, Salazar, Smith, Bingaman, and Snowe, to \nintroduce the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act.\n  I am pleased with how well the Medicare Part D program is working. It \nhas demonstrated how effectively private sector competition can work in \ndelivering an entitlement benefit. The program has defied official \npredictions and come in under budget by $113 billion compared to the \nbaseline projected in 2006. Premiums, initially estimated at $37 for \n2006, in fact averaged $23; in 2007 they fell to an average of $22. We \nunderstand that this year's bids are even lower and that premiums are \nexpected to fall again next year. The vast majority of Medicare \nbeneficiaries have enrolled in the program, and while there were some \ntroubling start-up problems initially, beneficiaries are very pleased \nwith their plans.\n  At the same time, the first years of implementation of the Part D \nprogram have revealed some areas in which the program can be improved. \nOne is related to pharmacy participation in the program. Changes are \nneeded to ensure that Part D treats pharmacies as Congress intended and \nto make the program friendlier to pharmacists and independent \npharmacies.\n  As Senator Baucus, Senator Lincoln, and my other colleagues and I \ntalked to beneficiaries, pharmacists, pharmacy owners and prescription \ndrug plans about changes that would make Medicare Part D work better, \nmany of our discussions centered around how to make sure that Part D \nworks not just\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\nfor the beneficiaries, the chain drug-stores, and the plans, but also \nfor the local, independent pharmacies, the long-term care pharmacies, \nand the safety net pharmacies that many beneficiaries rely on. That is \nexactly what this bill is intended to do.\n  My colleagues and I hope with this bill to improve contracting for \npharmacies, increase CMS's and prescription drug plans' customer \nservice, and give beneficiaries better access to pharmacies. Let me \ngive you some of the specifics of the bill.\n  First, the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would strengthen standards \nfor ensuring convenient beneficiary access to pharmacies. During the \nfirst two years of implementation, CMS has permitted some plans to meet \nthe pharmacy access requirements in the law by counting non-preferred \nand out-of-network pharmacies. The plans charge higher cost-sharing at \nthese pharmacies to discourage their use and drive utilization to \npreferred pharmacies. Counting non-preferred and out-of-network \npharmacies to meet the access requirements is clearly not what Congress \nhad in mind in establishing the beneficiary access guarantees in the \nlaw. To correct this problem, this bill would require that plans, with \ncertain exceptions, count only ``open'' pharmacies, those that are \naccessible to the general public, in meeting the Medicare pharmacy \naccess standard.\n  It also would require plans to count only their preferred in-network \npharmacies, not the non-preferred pharmacies, in determining whether \nthey meet the access standard.\n  The bill would allow pharmacies to initiate negotiations with plans \nunder the ``any willing pharmacy'' provision regardless of whether they \nhad already rejected, or failed to act on, previous offers from the \nplan.\n  The bill also would help ensure the inclusion of safety-net \npharmacies in a prescription drug plan's network by preventing plans \nfrom specifically excluding 340B entities in the terms of their \ncontracts. 340B entities include federally qualified health centers, \nmigrant health centers, health centers for residents of public housing, \nschool health centers, as well as black lung clinics, entities \nreceiving grants for early intervention for HIV under the Ryan White \nAct, disproportionate share hospitals, and others. They serve more than \nten million people.\n  Many of these entities operate their own pharmacies, which operate \nunder different constraints than other retail pharmacies. They may have \nabbreviated hours or be available only to patients of the 340B entity. \nIf 340B entities' pharmacies are not available as in-network pharmacies \nin Part D, these patients may have difficulty getting their \nprescription drugs.\n  The Model Safety Net Pharmacy Addendum was developed by the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Health Research and Services \nAdministration to facilitate 340B entities' participation in Medicare \nPart D. Because it takes the 340B entities' special circumstances into \naccount, it has appropriate contract language for Part D plans to use \nwhen contracting with safety net pharmacies. Under the bill, plans \nwould have to apply the Model Safety Net Pharmacy Addendum to their \ncontracts if a 340B entity so requests.\n\n  The bill also would require plans to include a contract provision to \nallow these safety net pharmacies to waive cost-sharing if the entity \nso requests. Many safety-net pharmacies waive cost-sharing for their \npatients, but the Part D plan contracts typically prohibit this. Given \nthat 340B entities serve low-income and poor populations, we believe \nthose entities should be able to waive cost sharing for drugs, and our \nbill would facilitate that.\n  We have found that long-term care pharmacies similarly operate under \nconditions different from those of retail pharmacies serving the \ngeneral population. For institutionalized populations, each resident's \ndaily drugs must be specially packaged to help ensure that each gets \nthe drugs meant for her, not for other residents. Long-term care \npharmacies specialize in this, but the Part D rules to date do not \nadequately reflect how long-term care pharmacies work with long-term \ncare facilities, which affects residents' access to these pharmacies. \nOur bill would require the Secretary to establish rules that include \npharmacy access standards for long-term care residents.\n  Another problem that has arisen in the implementation of Part D \nconcerns the ability of beneficiaries to obtain extended supplies of \ntheir drugs from a local pharmacy. Our bill therefore would ask the \nSecretary to establish standards for access to pharmacies that dispense \nextended supplies of covered drugs.\n  We have also heard from our local independent pharmacies that many, \ndespite contract terms, face delayed payments from prescription drug \nplans. Given that the pharmacies must pay for their drugs on a more \nabbreviated schedule, these delays have created cash-flow crises for \nsome pharmacies and put some at risk of closing. As much as I hate to \nlegislate contract terms, I would hate more for the independent \npharmacies in my State to close and my beneficiaries to be left without \na pharmacy. In our bill, we would require plans to pay most pharmacies \nwithin 14 days upon receipt of an electronically submitted clean claim. \nFor paper claims, they would have 30 days. If they were late, the \nprescription drug plans would have to pay the pharmacies interest. If a \npharmacy submitted claims electronically and requested electronic \npayment, the plan would have to pay electronically.\n  Because long-term care pharmacies operate under unusual circumstances \ncompared with retail pharmacies, our bill would allow pharmacies in \nlong-term care facilities, or that contract with long-term care \nfacilities, at least 30 days but no more than 90 days to submit their \nclaims for reimbursement to the plans.\n  Another problem involves how plans use maximum allowable prices as \nthe upper limit of what they will pay a retail pharmacy for the cost of \na drug. What has come to light is that some plans will not disclose to \nthe contracting pharmacies exactly what the maximum allowable prices \nare either when the contract is proposed to them or even after they \nsign the contract.\n  It seems unconscionable to me that a pharmacy would be expected to \nsign a contract where the price term is hidden and not disclosed. In \nthe Medicare program, no other health care providers are subject to \nsigning a contract in which they don't know what they will get paid.\n  Another abusive practice by some plans occurs when they do not update \ntheir maximum allowable prices in a timely manner. When a \npharmaceutical company raises its price for a drug the pharmacy has to \npay that new higher price right away. But the plan might not update \nwhat it pays for weeks. That leaves the pharmacy to absorb the \ndifference. The plans that do this know exactly what they are doing. \nThey know they are making the pharmacies eat the higher cost while they \ndelay updating their payment rates. To address these concerns, the bill \nwould require plans to disclose to pharmacies their ``maximum allowable \ncost'' pricing, and also to update those prices as they change, through \nan Internet website and a toll-free phone number.\n  Similarly, the bill would require plans to update their prescription \ndrug pricing standard at least every seven days. The drug pricing \nstandard changes frequently, and the price the pharmacy is paid is \nbased on that standard, and so it seemed fair to us that the \nprescription drug plans' payments should reflect recent changes.\n  Our bill is intended to improve CMS's and prescription drug plans' \nservice to pharmacies. It would require the HHS Secretary to establish \na pharmacists' toll-free hotline. Prescription drug plans would have to \nestablish separate pharmacists' and physicians' toll-free hotlines, and \nwould have to comply with customer service standards established by the \nSecretary. We hope this will prevent pharmacists being placed on long \nholds when they have customers standing at the counter waiting for \ntheir drugs.\n  We have some questions about pharmacists' average dispensing fees, \nand under the bill the HHS Inspector General would conduct a study of \ndispensing fees, including studying whether the pharmacist is \ndispensing a standard prescription or an extended one; whether the \npharmacist is in a chain store or an independent pharmacy; whether the \npharmacy dispenses specialty pharmacy products, or is a\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\nlong-term care pharmacy. The Inspector General's report would be due \nOctober 1, 2008.\n  I believe that with these changes, the Medicare Part D program will \nwork even better for beneficiaries and for the pharmacies that serve \nthem. As we refine the Medicare Part D program, we want to build on its \nsuccess even as we hope to make it fairer to all the stakeholders \ninvolved, the beneficiaries, the pharmacies, the PDP plans, and the \nmanufacturers. I believe this bill does just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Ms. Stabenow): S. 1955. A bill to \n        authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to make grants to \n        first responder agencies that have employees in the National \n        Guard or Reserves on active duty; to the Committee on Homeland \n        Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, our Nation's first responders are vital to \nprotecting our citizens from everyday crime, and to keeping our \ncitizens safe from fire and health-related emergencies. Our first \nresponders are also vital in the event of disaster, whether man-made or \nnatural.\n  But these same men and women that keep us safe and healthy at home \nare often called upon to fight for our country abroad with the National \nGuard and Reserves; or sometimes they are called to active duty within \nthe U.S. The demands on the Guard and Reserves have become extremely \nheavy during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  However, the demands on first responders here at home do not decrease \nand local fire, police and ambulance services are forced to manage \nwithout key employees.\n  That is why I am introducing the Reinforce First Responders and \nEmergency Employees Deployed Overseas in the Military, or Reinforce \nFREEDOM Act today. My bill will reinforce local first responder \nagencies whose employees are fighting for our freedom overseas. It \nestablishes a grant program through the Department of Homeland Security \nfor first responder agencies that have employees deployed with the \nNational Guard or Reserves.\n  The grants are available to law enforcement and fire departments, as \nwell as public and private ambulance services. Agencies are eligible to \nreceive up to $15,000 for each 3 month period they are without \nemployees serving with the military. Primarily volunteer organizations \nare eligible if they are missing a substantial part of their workforce. \nThe funds from these grants can be used to hire replacement employees \nor for overtime salary expenses. The funds can also be used for non-\nsalary costs that were created by the employees' deployment with the \nGuard or Reserves, or which would alleviate the impact of their \nabsence.\n  Extra funding perhaps cannot fully make up for the loss of crucial \nemployees. But this bill will help ensure that first responder agencies \ncan continue to keep the American people safe when their Guardsmen and \nReservist employees are called to defend the United States of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Smith, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. McCain, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1956. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to provide equitable access for foster care and adoption services \nfor Indian children in tribal areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks by commending \nthe thousands of case workers, foster families, neighbors and friends \nacross the country that work to provide safety, stability, and love for \nthe more than half a million children in the Nation's foster care \nsystem. More than a third of foster children in Montana are Native \nAmerican. Across America, most of the Native American children in \nfoster care are under the jurisdiction of tribal courts. But Native \nAmerican tribes that want to administer their own child welfare systems \nare not eligible for Title IV-E funds to run their own foster care and \nadoption programs.\n  Today I am proud to introduce with Senators Domenici, Bingaman, \nSmith, Stabenow, McCain, and Cantwell the Tribal Foster Care and \nAdoption Act of 2007. This legislation is a demonstration of the \ncommitment on both sides of the aisle to provide tribes with the \nopportunity to care for their own children. Children that need foster \ncare and adoption services because of the abuse and neglect that they \nhave already suffered. This bill provides tribes with the ability to \nserve their children directly with culturally appropriate care and \nunderstanding. The legislation also recognizes the good work of states \nand their collaborative efforts with tribes on behalf of tribal \nchildren.\n  This legislation has had a long history in the Senate and I am \npleased to have been a part of that history since the 107th congress. \nIt has been introduced in every Congress since then always with \nbipartisan support. This bill's time has come.\n  We have worked very hard to fine tune this legislation in away that \nis fair to states and finally gives Tribes direct access to the child \nwelfare system. We want a system set up to protect those that need our \nprotection the most not to exclude the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety from direct participation.\n  The child welfare system is languishing because of inadequate \nfunding. And the system also suffers from a lack of culturally-\nappropriate approaches to help tribal children to find loving, \npermanent homes. I am further committed to working on behalf of our \nchild welfare system with Chairman Grassley and with Senator \nRockefeller who have always been dedicated to child welfare issues. The \nTribal Foster Care and Adoption Act provides a pivotal opportunity to \nensure that tribes across our country have the ability to access the \nchild welfare system. I see this as a first step in making much needed \nimprovements to the country's child welfare system, without significant \ncosts or new federal programs.\n  We owe the first inhabitants of this great Nation and their children \na child welfare system that works for them. We must do all we can to \nprovide help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Clinton, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1957. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide \nprotection for fashion design; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1957, the Design Piracy Prohibition Act. As one who has been involved \nin national intellectual property, patent, copyright and trademark \npolicy development for many years, I can tell you first-hand how \ndifficult it can be to legislate in these areas. The Constitution \nexpressly tasks Congress with the duty to protect the rights of \nproperty owners, including intellectual property owners. And we spend a \ngood bit of time here legislating in the areas of music, art, movies, \ntelevision, radio, books, and so many other things that exist solely \nbecause of intellectual property rights.\n  However, one area of our economy that has been overlooked and not \nbenefited from the legal framework associated with intellectual \nproperty law is the area of fashion design. And yet fashion design is \none area where America enjoys a trade surplus and has clear leaders in \nthe world market. In fact, much of the world apparel and accessory \nindustry takes follows the lead of our world renowned fashion experts. \nHowever, the protections of their designs are not taken as seriously as \nwe take other forms of property rights, thereby, hurting a thriving \nAmerican industry around the world.\n  In an effort to bring some balance to the property rights of \ndesigners, Senators Schumer, Hutchison, Feinstein, Whitehouse, Graham, \nKohl, Clinton, Snowe, and I are introducing this legislation. The goal \nof S. 1957 is to ensure that those who spend their time and money \ndeveloping new and innovative fashion designs are able to secure and \nenforce adequate copyright protections for their hard work. And I \nsupport that goal.\n  As I stated earlier, this is a difficult area of law in which to \nlegislate and the balancing of the rights of property owners and \nconsumers is often difficult. In fact, the U.S. has been changing and \nrefining intellectual property laws for over 200 years and in some \nareas we still have not gotten it right.\n\n[[Page S10805]]\n\n  It must be recognized that this bill is not perfect and there are \nseveral legitimate concerns with the way this bill attempts to protect \ndesigns. I will be working with my colleagues to make improvements to \nthis bill as it goes through the Senate process. Some areas of the bill \nthat need to be improved are: the standard for liability, the \ndefinition of designs in the public domain, and the secondary liability \nprovisions. However, I am certain we will be able to work through these \nissues and move this bill forward.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Schumer, for introducing this \nbill. It takes a strong will, and a strong stomach, to take on the job \nof moving intellectual property-related legislation through Congress. \nI'm sure Senator Schumer is up to the task and I look forward to \nhelping him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 1959. A bill to establish the National Commission on the \nPrevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Violent \nRadicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007.\n  Foreign-based terrorism has weighed heavily in the news and in our \nthoughts for more than a decade. Since the first bombing of the World \nTrade Center in 1993, we have seen foreign-based terrorists attack our \nembassies in Tanzania and Kenya, a Navy destroyer in Yemen, the World \nTrade Center again, and the Pentagon. Timely arrests prevented foreign-\nbased terrorists from carrying out a bombing plot directed at the Los \nAngeles airport and, more recently, attacks targeting U.S.-bound \nflights originating in England.\n  This long-standing and still-deadly threat requires continued \nsurveillance and aggressive action, and will for years to come. But we \ncannot confine our counter-terrorism efforts to attacks organized in \nand launched from other countries. As demonstrated by the bloody \nbombing of the Oklahoma City Federal office building in 1995 and by \nthis year's arrests of suspects in plots directed at JFK International \nAirport and Fort Dix, NJ, domestic radicalization and violent extremism \nare also threats to American lives and American society.\n  The most effective border security will not prevent ``home-grown'' \nterrorists from attacking our citizens. We need to better understand \nthe triggers for radicalization and violence in order to counter the \nthreat of terrorists on American soil.\n  For nearly a year now, Senator Lieberman and I have conducted an \ninvestigation and held a series of hearings in the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee probing different aspects of this domestic danger by \nexamining radicalization in prisons, radicalization trends, the \nInternet and violent extremism, lessons from the European experience, \nand the adequacy of government counter-measures.\n  The harvest of information and insights from these hearings has \nhelped alert us to dangers, guide our oversight activities, and \nformulate ideas for legislative action. The testimony and evidence we \nhave seen persuade me that we need to undertake an even more in-depth \nexamination of the threats of domestic radicalization and violent \nextremism.\n  The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act \nwould provide such an examination. It is a companion measure to the \nbill introduced by Representatives Jane Harman of California and Dave \nReichert of Washington in the House of Representatives. Congresswoman \nHarman has been extraordinarily perceptive in understanding the threat \nof violent radicalization, and her bill's unanimous approval by the \nHouse Homeland Security Committee is a tribute to her leadership.\n  My bill, like the House measure, includes two key initiatives.\n  First, it would create a National Commission on the Prevention of \nViolent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism.\n  Second, it would establish a university-based Center of Excellence \nfor the Study of Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism in the U.S.\n  The Commission would devote itself to a survey of what we know, and \nwhat we need to learn, about the social and psychological breeding \ngrounds of extremism, the process of radicalization, the factors that \ncause people to turn to violence, the processes of recruitment and \ncoordination, and the phenomenon of self-radicalization and ``lone \nwolf'' terrorism.\n  To ensure a broad range of input for the commission, members would be \nselected for their qualifications by the President, the majority and \nminority leaders of the House and Senate, and the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Homeland Security Committees of the House and Senate.\n  The commission's final report, to be delivered within 18 months of \nits initial meeting, would provide a solid base of information and a \nguide for further research and action against the dangers that we face.\n  A ``final report,'' however useful, cannot be the last word in the \nfight against a threat that has been growing for years and may persist \nfor decades. That is why the bill takes the important second step of \nestablishing a university-based Center of Excellence focused on \nhomegrown terrorism, violent radicalization, and ideologically based \nviolence.\n  The Department of Homeland Security currently has 8 Centers for \nExcellence focusing on various aspects of homeland security, such as \nrisk-analysis, food protection, and catastrophic-event preparedness and \nresponse.\n  My bill would empower the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate \na new center or to expand the mission of an existing center. In either \ncase, such a center will provide an institution dedicated to \nresearching and understanding violent radicalization and homegrown \nterrorism, and to developing findings that can assist Federal, State, \nlocal, and tribal governments in dealing with these threats.\n  It is vital, that our homeland-security efforts extend to a \nsystematic and comprehensive understanding of the radicalization \nprocess that turns people living in our midst to ideologically based \nviolence and terrorism. It is also vital that we create an academically \nbased center to sustain high-quality research efforts on this threat to \naugment federal initiatives and to expand and supplement Government \nthinking.\n  This bill, which closely parallels legislation now moving through the \nHouse of Representatives, meets those vital needs. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1960. A bill amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nimprove surety bond guarantees, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today o join Senator Kerry in \nintroducing the Surety Bond Improvement Act, a bill which would \nreinvigorate the Small Business Administration's Surety Bond Guarantee \nprogram. I appreciate Senator Kerry's leadership on small business \nissues and his bipartisan work with me on this bill. Together, our \nprimary purpose is to improve the Surety Bond Guarantee SBG program and \nensure that more small businesses are able to secure the surety bonds \nthey require to compete and grow.\n  Many surety bond companies refuse to bond small businesses because of \nthe greater risks associated with underwriting new, unproven firms. \nCountless new businesses lack the stable credit histories and assets \nnecessary to obtain a surety bond. Without bonding, small firms cannot \nsecure the contracts they need to survive. For many small businesses, \ntheir inability to obtain surety bonds creates a barrier to entry which \nprevents them from competing in defense contracting, construction, \nservices, and other markets.\n  In order to reduce the risk to the surety firms issuing the bonds, \nthe SBA promises to cover between 70 and 90 percent of any possible \nclaims on bonds underwritten through the SBG program. Many small \ncontractors are only able to obtain surety bonds through the SBG \nprogram and establish a bonding history. Over time, these businesses \nwill out-grow the SBG program and will be able to obtain bonds in the \nregular, competitive marketplace.\n  It is critical to understand that the number of participating \nsureties in the\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\nSBG program directly affects the number of small companies that can \nreceive surety bonds. In fiscal year 2000, the SBG program had \n28 participating surety bonding companies and issued 7,034 bonds to \nsmall businesses. As of fiscal year 2006, there were only 10 \nparticipating surety companies that issued 4,709 surety bonds. This \ndownturn represents a 64 percent decline in the number of participating \nsureties and a decrease of 33 percent in the total number of bonds \nissued to small businesses. The sureties argue that SBA's outdated fee \nstructure and other actions, such as unwinding bond guarantees and \nrecent fee increases, make it impossible for them to earn a profit and \ncontinue participating in the program.\n\n  Our bill strives to address the reason behind the program's \ndiminishing participation and increasing inability to help small \nbusinesses. To achieve that goal, our measure would 1. prohibit the SBA \nfrom underwriting a surety bond guarantee after the agency has already \nunderwritten and approved the bond, 2. direct the SBA to promulgate \nregulations to allow surety companies to go to non-binding mediation \nwith the SBA in order to resolve disputes over denied claims or other \nissues, 3. eliminate existing price controls, 4. require the SBA to be \ntransparent in its fee structure, 5. clarify that Congress does not \nrequire the Surety Bond Guarantee program to be entirely self-funding \nor self-sufficient, and 6. raise the principal guarantee amount to $3 \nmillion.\n  We are collaborating with the SBA to reverse the downward trend \nregarding participating sureties and boost the number of small \nbusinesses receiving surety bonding. To accomplish this goal, the SBG \nprogram is working to reduce approval times by bolstering the capacity \nof companies to submit underwriting applications and claim requests \nonline. The program also plans to restructure its field offices and \nconduct outreach to new sureties and small businesses needing surety \nbonding. These reforms, along with the necessary legislative changes \nSenator Kerry and I have proposed today, will help the program attract \nnew sureties and increase the overall number of small companies able to \nsecure sureties underwriting through the program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to strongly support the Surety Bond \nImprovement Act which we wrote after consulting with small business \nowners and surety bonding companies on how best to revitalize this \npivotal program. Without these remedies, the number of sureties in the \nprogram will continue to fall as will the capability of small \nbusinesses to secure surety bonds. For new companies, obtaining a \nsurety bond will become a onerous barrier to entry and competition that \nthey will be unable to overcome. I urge my colleges to work with \nSenator Kerry and me to assist small businesses by passing this crucial \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Carper):\n  S. 1963.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish new separate fee schedule areas for physicians' services in \nStates with multiple fee schedule areas to improve Medicare physician \ngeographic payment accuracy, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a longstanding flaw in the Medicare Geographic Practice Cost \nIndex, GPCI, system that negatively impacts physicians in California \nand several other states.\n  This legislation will allow counties that are underpaid by at least 5 \npercent to be reclassified into a payment locality that reflects their \nown geographic costs.\n  It holds harmless the counties, predominately rural ones, whose \nlocality average would otherwise drop as other counties are \nreclassified.\n  Finally, this legislation is fully offset by requiring that \nindependent diagnostic laboratories comply with state and federal \nregulations. This will allow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices, CMS, to take action against unscrupulous operators, \npredominately in California, that seek Medicare reimbursements for \ninaccurate and unnecessary diagnostic testing.\n  This legislation would benefit physicians who are currently underpaid \nin 10 States: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and Washington.\n  Congressman Sam Farr has introduced companion legislation, H.R. 2484, \nin the House of Representatives, which now has 12 cosponsors.\n  The Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index measures the cost of \nproviding a Medicare covered service in a geographic area. Medicare \npayments are supposed to reflect the varying costs of rent, malpractice \ninsurance, and other expenses necessary to operate a medical process. \nCounties are assigned to ``payment localities'' that are supposed to \naccurately capture these costs.\n  Here is the problem: some of these payment localities have not \nchanged since 1997. Others have been in place since 1966. Many areas \nthat were rural even 10 years have experienced significant population \ngrowth, as metropolitan areas and suburbs have spread. Many counties \nnow find themselves in payment localities that do not accurately \nreflect their true practice costs.\n  These payment discrepancies have a real and serious impact on \nphysicians and the Medicare beneficiaries they are unable to serve. My \nhome State of California has been hit particularly hard.\n  San Diego County physicians are underpaid by 5.5 percent. A number of \nphysicians have left the county and 60 percent of remaining San Diego \nphysicians report that they cannot recruit new doctors to their \npractices.\n  Santa Cruz County receives a 10.2 percent underpayment, and as a \nresult, no physicians are accepting new Medicare patients. Instead, \nthey are moving to neighboring Santa Clara, which has similar practice \ncost expense, but is reimbursed at a rate that is at least 22 percent \nhigher. This means that seniors often need to travel at least 20 miles \nto see a physician.\n  Sacramento County, a major metropolitan area, is underpaid by 4.6 \npercent. The county's population has grown by 9.6 percent, while the \nnumber of physicians has declined by 11 percent.\n  Sonoma County physicians are paid at least 8 percent less than their \ngeographic practice costs. They have experienced at 10 percent decline \nin specialists and a 9 percent decline in primary care physicians.\n  Seniors' Medicare cards are of no value if physicians in their \ncommunity cannot afford to provide them with health care.\n  The underpayment problem grows more severe every year, and the longer \nwe wait to address it, the more drastic the solution will need to be. \nThis legislation provides a common sense solution, increasing payment \nfor those facing the most drastic underpayments, while protecting other \ncounties from cuts in the process.\n  This is an issue of equity. It costs more to provide health care in \nexpensive areas, and physicians serving our seniors must be fairly \ncompensated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10807]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize HIV/AIDS assistance; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria Act of 2003, known as the Leadership Act, the largest \ninternational health initiative in history dedicated to a single \ndisease.\n  Five years ago, there was little hope in Africa and the developing \nworld of an effective response to HIV/AIDS. Tragically, many of the \nnations hardest hit by this disease are among those with the fewest \nresources to draw on for a response. There appeared to be little basis \nfor hope.\n  Today, the pandemic continues. Yet there has been a change, and the \nAmerican people have led that change.\n  The original Leadership Act authorized $15 billion in appropriations \nover 5 years. And in a significant departure from earlier approaches to \ndevelopment, it linked that funding to accountability for goals: \nsupport for treatment of 2 million people, prevention of 7 million new \ninfections, care for 10 million people, including orphans and \nvulnerable children.\n  As many Senators will recall, when this legislation was first enacted \nin 2003, it was done with a certain amount of haste and after a request \nfrom the President for quick action. The G-8 summit was fast \napproaching, but even more importantly, rapid Senate action meant that \nthe program could be established quickly, so that money could start to \nflow quickly to the fight. Given this, the Senate acted swiftly, \npassing the bill almost without amendment.\n  Now we are approaching the expiration of that 5-year authorization at \nthe end of fiscal year 2008. Whatever our misgivings about the \nLeadership Act as we enacted it in 2003, at this point we need to judge \nit by the results it has enabled us to deliver. Those results are \nsimply remarkable.\n  At the time the Leadership Act was announced, only 50,000 people in \nall of sub-Saharan Africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Yet \nthrough March of this year, the act has supported treatment for over \n1.1 million men, women and children, over a million of them are in \nAfrica, in those 15 countries where AIDS was on the verge of wiping out \nwhole generations. In addition to these focus countries, we are working \nwith one hundred other countries as well touching millions of other \nlives. Five years ago, HIV was a death sentence. Now there is hope.\n  During the first 3\\1/2\\ years of the act, U.S. bilateral programs \nhave supported services for pregnant women to avoid transmission of HIV \nto their babies during more than 6 million pregnancies. In over 533,000 \nof those pregnancies, the women were found to be HIV-positive and \nreceived antiretroviral prophylaxis, preventing an estimated 101,000 \ninfant infections through March 2007.\n  Before the advent of the Leadership Act, there was little concerted \neffort to meet the needs of those orphaned by AIDS, or of other \nchildren made vulnerable by it. We have now supported care for more \nthan 2 million orphans and vulnerable children, as well as 2.5 million \npeople living with HIV/AIDS, through September 2006.\n  Effective prevention, treatment and care all depend to a large extent \non people knowing their HIV status, so they can take the necessary \nsteps to stay healthy. The U.S. has supported 18.7 million HIV \ncounseling and testing sessions for men, women and children.\n  Across the act's programs, the majority of services have been \nprovided to women and girls, and a growing number of services are \nreaching children.\n  Our financial investment in this fight has been critical to our \nsuccess, and thanks in large part to the flexibility of the Leadership \nAct, we have been able to obligate over 94 percent of its available \n$12.3 billion appropriated through this fiscal year.\n  In addition to support for the U.S. bilateral programs, the \nLeadership Act has also authorized support for the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund provides an important \navenue for the rest of the world to substantially increase its \ncommitment, as we have done. The U.S. is the largest supporter of the \nGlobal Fund, having provided some $2 billion so far. It is important \nfor the American people to understand and for the rest of the world to \nremember, that the American people are responsible for approximately \n\\1/3\\ of all the funding received by the fund.\n  As we survey the results achieved by this legislation, it is apparent \nthat our efforts have been exceptionally successful. But to build on \nthat success, we must reauthorize the legislation for another 5 years. \nAs we consider how to accomplish that reauthorization task, it is \nimportant to note that the vast majority of the authorities needed for \nthe next phase of our effort are already contained in the current \nLeadership Act.\n  The necessity for new authorities is in the eye of the beholder. Many \nSenators may wish to enhance issues such as TB/HIV, gender, nutrition, \nhuman capacity, infrastructure and health systems, and education. But \nthe current law already articulates and authorizes activities in these \nvery same areas, as evidenced by the many activities in these areas \nthat the act has undertaken under existing authorities.\n  In this case, I believe we should follow the old adage, ``If it ain't \nbroke, don't fix it.'' We have a good, if not perfect, law that is \nsucceeding. In lieu of drafting an entirely new bill, today I introduce \na reauthorization which preserves the bulk of the authorities that have \nenabled the program succeed and makes only minor modifications.\n  The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator has interpreted the existing \nauthorities well and has listened to the Congress and many \nstakeholders. As the Institute of Medicine recently said, the Global \nLeadership Act is a ``learning organization.'' The Coordinator is the \nfirst to admit, as he has before Congressional committees, that we can \ndo better in every area of implementation. But new authorities are not \nneeded; these are issues of implementation. In short, rather than \nabsorbing the time of Congress, the coordinator, as well as \nstakeholders in drafting an entirely new bill, we should empower them \nto continue the work they are doing to improve upon program \nimplementation utilizing the experience of these past 3\\1/2\\ years.\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\n  Let me highlight the basic changes I am suggesting to the existing \nlegislation. First, it would increase to $30 billion the authorization \nfor the next five fiscal years 2009-2013, a doubling of the initial \ncommitment. I recognize that Senators may wish to revisit that funding \nlevel, and I trust that there will be opportunities for them to do so, \nin committee and on the floor.\n  Second, as the Institute of Medicine and others have argued, I \nbelieve we need to keep the bill as free of funding directives as \npossible in order to ensure maximum flexibility for implementation. I \nam proposing that only two funding directives be included, one modified \nfrom its current form, the other maintained as is.\n  The first modification would seek to address the abstinence directive \nin current law. The current Leadership Act requires that 33 percent of \nall prevention funding be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs. \nThe problem with this directive is that some countries need to focus \ntheir efforts not on abstinence per se but on, for example, mother-to-\nchild transmission, an activity which is considered to be nonsexual \ntransmission of HIV/AIDS. The original directive thus forced theses \ncountries to either spend money in areas where they did not necessarily \nneed to spend it or to divert funds from areas where they truly needed \nto.\n  The administration had interpreted and implemented this provision so \nas to include both abstinence and faithfulness programs, the `AB' of \n`ABC,' which stands for Abstinence, Be faithful, and the correct and \nconsistent use of condoms. The directive has been helpful in ensuring \nan evidence-based, comprehensive approach to prevention. The ABC \nparadigm for prevention was developed in Africa by Africans, in order \nto address the wide range of risks faced by people within their \nnations, particularly in the context of generalized epidemics where HIV \nis widespread throughout the population. Recent evidence from a growing \nnumber of African countries shows a correlation between the adoption of \nall three of the ABC behaviors, and a clear association with declining \nHIV prevalence.\n  Before the creation of the U.S. Global Aids Coordinator, the U.S. \nGovernment had relatively little experience implementing behavior \nchange programs for global HIV/AIDS that included the whole array of \nABC behavior change. This was the rationale for the directive, and I \nbelieve it has served a useful purpose. However, I agree with many \nothers that we can improve upon it as we look to the future.\n  The language I propose would provide that 50 percent of funding for \nprevention of sexual transmission of HIV, a sub-set all prevention \nfunding, be dedicated to abstinence and faithfulness. This will enable \ngreater flexibility to countries whose situation mirrors the one just \ndescribed.\n  At the same time, the language would ensure the continuation of \nfunding for abstinence and faithfulness programs as part of \ncomprehensive, evidence-based ABC activities. I think this compromise \napproach is the right one that can win support from across the \npolitical spectrum and provide increased flexibility while ensuring \ncontinued support for comprehensive, evidence-based prevention.\n  There are a number of other directives in the current law that need \nno longer be maintained and the new bill does not contain them. The one \nother directive that I believe must be maintained is that 10 percent of \nfunding be devoted to programs for orphans and vulnerable children, or \n``OVCs''. As I have noted, there were few programs focused on the needs \nof these children before the Leadership Act of 2005 and we remain in \nthe early stages of the essential effort to serve them. This is one of \nthe aspects of our effort that is most strongly supported by the \nAmerican people, the maintenance of this directive will help to ensure \nthat this effort remains focused on those who need our support the \nmost. The directive will also help ensure the success of the Assistance \nfor Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act \nof 2005, a bill I drafted, one cosponsored by eleven of my Senate \ncolleagues, and which the Congress passed in October 2005.\n  Finally, let me describe some new language proposed for the inclusion \nregarding the Global Fund, an organization that enjoys wide support \nhere in Congress. The Global Fund is a critically important partner of \nthe U.S. in our fight against HIV/AIDS. Our contributions are not only \nfinancial, we are also active on its board, and our U.S. personnel \noverseas provide the technical assistance needed for the Global Fund's \ngrants to work.\n  However, the fund is subject to pressures from many donors and in \nmany directions. It has become clear that it would benefit from greater \ntransparency and accountability. In keeping with my concerns with \ntransparency and accountability of international organizations that \nreceive U.S. funding, including the World Bank and International \nMonetary Fund, my proposed language would establish similar benchmarks \nfor U.S. funding for the Global Fund. I don't believe any of these \nproposed benchmarks will be controversial, but if Senators have \nconcerns about any of them, I look forward to working with them to \naddress them.\n  It is also worth noting that the bill would maintain the limitation \nin the existing Leadership Act that U.S. contributions to the fund may \nnever exceed 33 percent of its funding from all sources. This \nlimitation has proven to be a valuable tool for increasing \ncontributions to the fund from other funding sources, such as other \ngovernments, and I believe there is wide agreement that this provision \nshould be maintained as we move forward.\n  In closing, let me turn to the issue of legislative timing. It is \ncritical to the contents of my approach to reauthorization. It is \ncritically important to reauthorize this bill during 2007, as opposed \nto awaiting its expiration September 2008.\n  The US Global Aids Coordinator depends on his implementing partners, \nincluding host governments and nongovernmental organizations, including \nfaith- and community-based organizations, to scale up programs rapidly \nto reach as many people as possible. They have been a critical part of \nprograms success to date.\n  But HIV and AIDS are different from many diseases: once HIV-positive \npersons are provided treatment or orphans enrolled in care programs, \ntheir treatment and care become ongoing commitments for program \npartners. Thus, for partners to continue to scale up programs in 2008, \nthey need assurances of a continued U.S. commitment beyond 2008. These \npartners recognize that at this point, they have only a Presidential \nproposal, not actual reauthorization.\n  In fact, some of my staff on the Foreign Relations Committee have \nrecently returned from countries receiving our assistance and verified \nthis concern. Various ministries of health are refusing to expand the \nnumber of patients currently receiving antiretroviral medication for \nfear that they will not receive enough money in the years to come to \npurchase next year's doses for these new patients.\n  Without reauthorization in 2007, partners have indicated that they \nwill be unable to scale up programs in 2008, and as my staff have \nconfirmed, there is already evidence that some have begun to slow \nenrollment in programs. Without continued rapid scale-up this year and \nnext, we may not achieve the ambitious goals for the first phase of \nPEFPAR, treatment for 2 million, prevention of 7 million new \ninfections, care for 10 million, including orphans and vulnerable \nchildren. However, time will be needed to develop sustainable programs \nwith commitments from our partner countries as we move into the next 5-\nyear commitment from the American people.\n  Thus it is essential that we act before we go out of session this \nyear. I recognize that we face a crowded calendar. But we can do it if \nwe will take the most direct path to passage, a clean bill.\n  This body can be proud of its contribution to the remarkable \nturnaround on the issue of global HIV/AIDS, from concern to action. We \nhave represented well the compassion and generosity of the American \npeople and the demand for accountability by the American taxpayer. I \ncall on my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this bill to reauthorize \nthe Leadership Act in 2007, and to extend the authorities that have \nenabled the American people to make such a difference in the lives of \nothers.\n  I have no pride of authorship. But we need to start the \nreauthorization process now. I welcome the involvement\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\nand inputs of my colleagues. We should let the mark-up and amendment \nprocess work. Secondly, I would welcome the assistance of other \nCommittees and their memberships. Thirdly, I look for strong support \nand guidance from the NGO and faith-based communities. These \norganizations will be key to the reauthorization effort. We will \nrequire the constructive engagement of the administration in this \nreauthorization effort.\n  If we pull together and display the spirit of compromise necessary \nfor good legislation, we can complete the job in 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On May 30, 2007, President George W. Bush announced his \n     intent to double the commitment of the United States to fight \n     global HIV/AIDS with a new $30,000,000,000, 5-year proposal \n     to reauthorize the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n       (2) With the enactment of the President's fiscal year 2008 \n     budget, the United States Government will have committed \n     $18,000,000,000 to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n     Relief (PEPFAR), which exceeds the original 5-year, \n     $15,000,000,000 commitment.\n       (3) After 3 years of PEPFAR implementation, the American \n     people have supported treatment of 1,100,000 people in the 15 \n     focus countries, including more than 1,000,000 people in \n     Africa.\n       (4) PEPFAR is on track to meet its 5-year goals to support \n     treatment for 2,000,000 people, prevention of 7,000,000 new \n     infections, and care for 10,000,000 people, including orphans \n     and vulnerable children.\n       (5) The success of PEPFAR is rooted in support for country-\n     owned strategies and programs with commitment of resources \n     and dedication to results, achieved through the power of \n     partnerships with governments, with nongovernmental, faith-\n     based, and community-based organizations, and with the \n     private sector.\n       (6) United States efforts to address global HIV/AIDS will \n     be multiplied by engaging in partnerships with countries \n     dedicating to fighting their HIV epidemics and with \n     multilateral partners, such as the Global Fund, which can \n     help leverage international resources and build upon the \n     efforts of the United States to combat global HIV/AIDS. In \n     his announcement of his intent to double the commitment of \n     the United States to fight global HIV/AIDS, President Bush \n     reiterated his call for developed and developing countries, \n     in particular middle-income countries where projections \n     suggest many new infections will occur, to increase their \n     contributions to fighting AIDS. HIV/AIDS is a global crisis \n     that requires a global response. The United States currently \n     provides as many resources for global HIV/AIDS as all other \n     developed country governments combined. But only together can \n     we turn the tide against the global epidemic.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to expand \n     PEPFAR, including the expansion of life-saving treatment, \n     comprehensive prevention programs, and care for those in \n     need, including orphans and vulnerable children, in the next \n     5-year period as a signal of the commitment of the United \n     States to support, strengthen, and expand United States and \n     global efforts to address these health crises in partnership \n     with others.\n\n     SEC. 5. UNITED STATES FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL \n                   FUND.\n\n       (a) Authority to Increase Proportional Support.--Section \n     202(d) of the Act (22 U.S.C. 7622(d)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Authority to increase proportional support.--\n       ``(A) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(i) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria is an innovative financing mechanism to combat the \n     three diseases, and it has made progress in many areas.\n       ``(ii) The United States Government is the largest \n     supporter of the Fund, both in terms of resources and \n     technical support.\n       ``(iii) The United States made the founding contribution to \n     the Funds, remains committed to the original vision for the \n     Fund, and is fully committed to its success.\n       ``(B) Authority.--The President may increase proportional \n     support for the Fund, within the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act, if benchmarks for performance, \n     accountability, and transparency are satisfactorily met, and \n     if the Fund remains committed to its founding principles. The \n     United States Global AIDS Coordinator should consider the \n     benchmarks set forth in subparagraphs (C) and (D) in \n     assessing whether to make the annual contribution of the \n     United States Government to the Fund.\n       ``(C) Benchmarks related to transparency and \n     accountability.--Increased proportional support for the Fund \n     should be based upon achievement of the following benchmarks \n     related to transparency and accountability:\n       ``(i) As recommended by the Government Accountability \n     Office, the Fund Secretariat has established standardized \n     expectations for the performance of Local Fund Agents (LFAs), \n     is undertaking a systematic assessment of the performance of \n     LFAs, and is making available for public review, according to \n     the Fund Board's policies and practices on disclosure of \n     information, a regular collection and analysis of performance \n     data of Fund grants, which shall cover both Principal \n     Recipients and sub-recipients.\n       ``(ii) A well-staffed, independent Office of the Inspector \n     General reports directly to the Board and is responsible for \n     regular, publicly published audits of both financial and \n     programmatic and reporting aspects of the Fund, its grantees, \n     and LFAs.\n       ``(iii) The Fund Secretariat has established and is \n     reporting publicly on standard indicators for all program \n     areas.\n       ``(iv) The Fund Secretariat has established a database that \n     tracks all sub-recipients and the amounts of funds disbursed \n     to each, as well as the distribution of resources, by grant \n     and Principal Recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, the \n     purchases of drugs and commodities, and other purposes.\n       ``(v) The Fund Board has established a penalty to offset \n     tariffs imposed by national governments on all goods and \n     services provided by the Fund.\n       ``(vi) The Fund Board has successfully terminated its \n     Administrative Services Agreement with the World Health \n     Organization and completed the Fund Secretariat's transition \n     to a fully independent status under the Headquarters \n     Agreement the Fund has established with the Government of \n     Switzerland.\n       ``(D) Benchmarks related to principles of fund.--Increased \n     proportional support for the Fund should be based upon \n     achievement of the following benchmarks related to the \n     founding principles of the Fund:\n       ``(i) The Fund must maintain its status as a financing \n     institution.\n       ``(ii) The Fund must remain focused on programs directly \n     related to HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n       ``(iii) The Fund Board must maintain its Comprehensive \n     Funding Policy, which requires confirmed pledges to cover the \n     full amount of new grants before the Board approves them.\n       ``(iv) The Fund must maintain and make progress on \n     sustaining its multi-sectoral approach, through Country \n     Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) and in the implementation of \n     grants, as reflected in percent and resources allocated to \n     different sectors, including governments, civil society, and \n     faith- and community-based organizations.''.\n       (b) Extension of Authorization.--Section 202(d) of such Act \n     is further amended by striking ``2008'' each place it appears \n     and inserting ``2013''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1969. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility \nof designating Estate Grange and other sites related to Alexander \nHamilton's life on the island of St. Croix in the United States Virgin \nIslands as a unit of the National Park System, and for other\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Alexander \nHamilton Boyhood Home Act of 2007, a bill to study the suitability and \nfeasibility of bringing resources related to Alexander Hamilton's \nboyhood on the island of St. Croix under the National Park System. I \nwould like to thank Senators Rockefeller, Bayh, Bill Nelson, Brownback, \nHarkin, and Crapo for lending early support to this legislation as \noriginal cosponsors. I especially note the strong support of Senator \nRockefeller, who along with his family, has a special interest in this \npart of the U.S.\n  Too little is known about Hamilton's childhood on the islands. We \nknow he was born as a British subject on the island of Nevis in 1755. \nBy the age of 10 he and his brother James found themselves under Danish \nrule on the island of St. Croix. Alexander's father had abandoned them, \nso his mother Rachel Faucett was the primary care giver and bread \nwinner. It is believed they initially spent their days on a sugar \nplantation at Estate Grange, which was owned by Rachel's sister, Ann, \nand her husband, James Lytton. The Lyttons generously supported Rachel \nand her two boys for a short time. When the plantation was sold, the \nLyttons helped Rachel to set up a store with an apartment on the upper \nfloor in the nearby town of Christiansted.\n  They had been there less than a year and Alexander, as an 11-year-old \nboy, had already taken a job as a clerk at the Beekman and Cruger \ntrading post. This connection would serve him well after his mother \ndied in 1769 and he was left to fend for himself. His early years with \nBeekman and Cruger not only supported him financially, but they \nintroduced him to business, economics, and trade.\n  Hamilton learned a great deal from his surroundings on St. Croix, and \nhis political ideologies as an adult were clearly influenced by his \nboyhood in the West Indies. His mother was known to have the largest \nlibrary on the island, consisting of 34 classical books of various \ntopics. Everyday life and culture must have left an impression on him, \nas well. He was constantly exposed to the brutality of slavery, which \ndrove the plantation economy on St. Croix. His distaste for it as a boy \nwould grow into political opposition to it in America. Historians also \nnote that maturing in the West Indies made him unique among other \nAmerican politicians of the day because he never had any loyalty to a \nspecific State or region. He perceived the U.S. as one unified Nation \nwith a strong central Government. To advocate that belief, Hamilton \nwould later found the Federalist Party in America.\n  Through his work, Alexander made several connections with influential \npeople in the town. As he grew older, they began to recognize his \ntalent and intellect and they decided to send him to New York with the \nfunds to obtain an education. He left St. Croix at age 17, never to \nreturn, and the rest is now a central aspect of our Nation's history.\n  Hamilton went on to be one of the great statesmen of our history, a \nFounding Father who was influential in all of the stages of our \nblossoming Nation. He fought with the colonies during the American \nRevolution and served as General Washington's personal secretary. After \nthe Revolution he was elected to the Continental Congress. He authored \nthe Federalist Papers to advocate ratification of the Constitution, \nwhich he would pen his own name to as a delegate from New York. Of \ncourse, he may be remembered most for his appointment as the first \nSecretary of the Treasury under President George Washington. His visage \nis perpetuated in history on the $10 bill as one of only two non-\npresidential faces appearing on U.S. currency.\n  Alexander Hamilton's immeasurable influence on the progress of our \nNation deserves to be remembered and recognized. The remaining links to \nhis boyhood on the island of St. Croix should be preserved and \nrecognized for the benefit of the people. The Great House at Estate \nGrange is still there today along with a memorial marking the site \nwhere Alexander's mother was laid to rest. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation which would establish and fund a study to \ndetermine the feasability and suitability of a heritage area on St. \nCroix in honor of one of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Reed, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1975. A bill to expand family and medical leave in support of \nservicemembers with combat-related injuries; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, 14 years ago, the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, FMLA, declared the principle that workers should never be forced \nto choose between the jobs they need and the families they love. In the \nyears since its passage, more than 50 million Americans have taken \nadvantage of its provisions to care for a sick love one, or recover \nfrom illness themselves, or welcome a new baby into the family. If \nordinary Americans deserve those rights, how much more do they apply to \nthose who risk their lives in the service of our country? Soldiers who \nhave been wounded in our service deserve everything America can give to \nspeed their recoveries, but most of all, they deserve the care of their \nclosest loved ones.\n  That is exactly what is offered in the Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act, a bill I am proud to have authored along with \nSenator Clinton. The FMLA was the very first bill that President \nClinton signed into law, and I am grateful that his wife, Senator \nClinton, continues to support the principles that I have been fighting \nfor over 20 years. Now, I am also pleased that Senators Dole, Graham, \nKennedy, Chambliss, Reed, Mikulski, Murray, Salazar, Lieberman, \nMenendez, Brown, Nelson of Nebraska, and Cardin are cosponsoring this \nnew legislation today.\n  Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services \nDonna Shalala have been instrumental in this effort as well, through \ntheir thoughtfulness and work on the President's Commission on Care for \nAmerica's Returning Wounded Warriors.\n  It is unsurprising that the commission found that family members play \na critical role in the recovery of our wounded servicemembers. The \ncommitment shown by the families and friends of our troops is truly \ninspiring: according to the commission's report, 33 percent of active \nduty servicemembers report that a family member or close friend \nrelocated for extended periods of time to help in their recoveries. It \nalso points out that 21 percent of active duty servicemembers say that \ntheir friends or family members gave up jobs to find the time. To quote \nfrom the commission's moving report:\n\n       In virtually every case [of a wounded servicemember], a \n     wife, husband, parent, brother, or sister has received the \n     heart-stopping telephone call telling them that their loved \n     one is sick or injured, halfway around the world.\n\n  These loved ones bear a burden almost as sharp as the wound itself. \nThe very least we can give them is the assurance that their jobs will \nbe there when they return.\n  It is for these reasons that the commission recommend that the FMLA \nbe expanded to provide family members of combat-injured servicemembers \nup to 6 months of leave to care for their loved ones.\n  The Support for Injured Servicemembers Act does just that. FMLA \ncurrently allows 3 months of unpaid leave. Given the severity of their \ninjuries, and our debt of gratitude, our servicemembers need more.\n  For the first time, this bill offers FMLA leave not just to parents, \nspouses, and children, but to next-of-kin, including siblings. \nFamilies, not the government, should decide for themselves who takes on \nthe work of caring for their injured loved ones. This bill recognizes \nthat fact, and it is a major accomplishment.\n  Our troops are laying their bodies on the line for us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, every day. Our full debt to them is unpayable. But perhaps \nthe best thing we can do for them is to get out of the way, to make it \npossible for the love of family to heal their wounds. With their jobs \nprotected, more family members will be able to do just that. What this\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nbill does, then, is break down a barrier, between our troops and the \ncare they need the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TESTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1976. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to include a \nprovision on organic conversion in the environmental quality incentives \nprogram; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Leahy and \nBaucus to introduce the Organic Conversion Assistance Act to help \nprovide needed technical and conservation assistance to farmers and \nranchers converting to organic agriculture. I wanted to thank Senator \nLeahy for his leadership on organic agricultural issues and Senator \nBaucus for his long-time support for Montana's farmers and ranchers.\n  My wife and I have spent our careers farming organically on our farm \nnear Big Sandy, MT. Nearly 20 years ago we were struggling to get ahead \nand trying to decide if we could really make it farming while so many \nof our neighbors were packing up and moving away. We knew at that time \nthat if we didn't make some changes to our business we would end up \nlike so many of our neighbors leaving rural Montana for jobs in town.\n  In 1988, we took what was then a risk and converted our farm to \norganic production. Our motivations were mostly economic but partly for \nhealth reasons. We wanted to farm on our own terms and to make more \nmoney. When I farmed conventionally I felt beholden to one big company \nafter another from buying fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, fuel, to \nselling my grain to a corporation and shipping it by rail at high \nprices and we rarely came out ahead. Every season after I would spray \nfor weeds and bugs, I would feel sick for a week afterwards.\n  Organic agriculture let us take control of our farm and our \nlivelihood. More and more farmers are converting to organics as \nconsumer demand soars. Organics is now the fastest growing sector of \nthe food industry expanding at a rate of over 20 percent a year. In \nMontana, we lead the Nation in organic wheat production and are a close \nsecond in the production of organic barley, peas and lentils. Consumer \ndemand for organic products is growing so fast that we are now \nimporting a significant portion of the organic food that is found in \nour grocery stores.\n  In the U.S. we grow the highest quality and safest food in the world. \nI believe that increased production of domestically produced organic \nfoods will help meet consumer demand, help keep farmers on the land, \nand because organic agriculture needs fewer inputs it helps conserve \nour land, and clean up our air and water. But if the U.S. is going to \nkeep pace with imported organic products we need to get more acreage \nunder organic production here at home.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide conversion \nassistance to farmers making the transition from conventional to \norganic agriculture. Currently it takes 3 to 4 years to become \ncertified organic, but during that period of time producers cannot \nreceive the higher price that organics fetch in the market place. \nFurthermore, the shift towards a new way of farming and ranching \ncreates technical challenges for many producers as they change the way \nthey do things. Offering technical and educational assistance as well \nas cost-share funds for conservation initiatives under a certified \norganic plan will provide a needed helping hand to farmers. Making the \nconversion will help keep farmers on the land by putting a bit more \nmoney in their pockets and help our rural communities be viable. Many \nStates have already adopted similar assistance programs and \nagricultural producers nationwide would benefit from having a \nconsistent and available program in years to come.\n  I would appreciate the support of my colleagues as this legislation \nmoves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1977. A bill to provide for sustained United States leadership in \na cooperative global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global \nnuclear arsenals, stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related \nmaterial and technology, and support the responsible and peaceful use \nof nuclear technology; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the spread of nuclear weapons and related \ntechnology and the possibility that a nuclear weapon could fall into \nthe hands of terrorists constitute the most urgent threat to our \nnational security. As experts on this issue such as Henry Kissinger, \nGeorge Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn have all warned, our current \npolicies to deal with the threat posed by nuclear weapons are simply \nnot adequate.\n  We know al-Qaida has made it a goal to acquire a nuclear weapon. At \nthe same time, significant quantities of the material necessary to make \none remain vulnerable to theft in various parts of the world. And, to \nmake matters worse, the world may be on the brink of a new and \ndangerous era with a growing number of nuclear-armed states, as \nillustrated by North Korea's nuclear test last year and Iran's refusal \nto halt its uranium enrichment program.\n  So today, along with Senator Hagel, I am introducing the Nuclear \nWeapons Threat Reduction Act, which provides for sustained U.S. \nleadership in a global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce \nglobal nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons around \nthe world.\n  Securing nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at their source \nis the most direct and reliable way to prevent nuclear terrorism. \nThanks to the leadership of Senators Nunn and Lugar in creating the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program at the Department of Defense, \nthere is no question that we have made significant progress in securing \nnuclear stockpiles. But there are still significant quantities of \nweapons-usable nuclear material that remain vulnerable to theft. In the \ncivilian sector alone, there are an estimated 60 tons of highly \nenriched uranium, enough to make over 1,000 nuclear bombs, spread out \nat facilities in over 40 countries around the world. Many of these \nfacilities do not have adequate physical security, leaving the material \nvulnerable to theft.\n  The insecure storage of nuclear stockpiles has already led to an \nalarming number of attempted exchanges of small quantities of dangerous \nnuclear materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, \nconfirmed 16 incidents between 1993 and 2005 that involved trafficking \nin relatively small amounts of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. \nThat is 16 incidents too many, in my opinion, and 16 incidents that \nshould not have been allowed to happen.\n  Experts believe that a sophisticated terrorist group could \npotentially construct a crude nuclear bomb if it obtained the necessary \namount of plutonium or highly enriched uranium. The 9/11 Commission \nconcluded that a trained nuclear engineer with an amount of highly \nenriched uranium or plutonium about the size of a grapefruit or an \norange could make a nuclear device that would level Lower Manhattan. \nSimply put, our ability to secure nuclear stockpiles around the world \nis what stands between the safety of the American people and a \nterrorism incident of almost unimaginable horror.\n  It is imperative that we build and lead a truly global effort to \nsecure all stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material to \nthe highest standards to prevent them from falling into the wrong \nhands. It is also essential that we make preventing nuclear terrorism a \ntop presidential priority--with the resources, diplomatic effort and \nfunding to match the threat. We need to work with other countries to \nensure effective and sustainable security of nuclear stockpiles and to \nensure that the highest priority is placed on security of those weapons \nand materials that pose the greatest risk.\n  The Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act requires the President to \nsubmit to Congress a comprehensive threat reduction plan for ensuring \nthat all nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at vulnerable \nsites are secure by 2012. The plan must clearly designate agency \nresponsibility and accountability, specify program goals and metrics \nfor measuring progress, and outline estimated schedules and budget \nrequirements.\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\n  To meet this ambitious goal, the bill calls for accelerating U.S. \nprograms to secure, consolidate, and reduce stocks of nuclear weapons \nand weapons-usable material, including highly enriched uranium at \ncivilian nuclear facilities worldwide. Additional funding is authorized \nfor the Department of Energy's Global Threat Reduction Initiative, an \nimportant program that secures and removes high-risk nuclear materials \nfrom vulnerable locations around the world.\n  The bill calls for the United States to work cooperatively with other \ncountries and the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to develop \nand implement a comprehensive set of standards and best practices to \nprovide effective physical protection and accounting for all stockpiles \nof nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material.\n  The bill also authorizes additional funding to improve our ability to \ntrace the origin of nuclear material that might be transferred or used \nin a terrorist attack so that responsible parties can be held \naccountable.\n  Given the nature of the threat we face from nuclear terrorism, we \ncan't succeed if we act alone. Indeed, the danger of nuclear \nproliferation and nuclear terrorism reminds us of how critical global \ncooperation will be to U.S. security in the 21st century. America must \nlead in rebuilding the alliances and partnerships necessary to meet \ncommon challenges and confront common threats. And this legislation \nseeks to provide the tools to do just that.\n  While nuclear terrorism remains a dire threat to our security, it is \nonly one part of the overall threat posed by nuclear weapons. The \nNuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act also addresses the need to reduce \nglobal arsenals and prevent the emergence of additional nuclear-armed \nnations. In all too many respects, the essential bargain that stands at \nthe core of the nuclear nonproliferation regime is unraveling. \nCountries like North Korea and Iran are demonstrating that nuclear \ntechnology acquired for ostensibly civilian purposes can provide the \nbasis for producing nuclear weapons. At the same time, established \nnuclear powers retain large arsenals and are reemphasizing the \nimportance of nuclear weapons to their security.\n  At the end of the Cold War, many had hoped and believed that the \nworld was moving in the right direction to reduce the threat of nuclear \nweapons. America and Russia agreed to significant reductions in their \nmassive nuclear arsenals. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine were \npersuaded to give up their post-Soviet nuclear arsenals. The U.S.-\nRussian Cooperative Threat Reduction or Nunn-Lugar program was \nestablished. In 1994, North Korea agreed to halt its plutonium \nproduction program. And in 1995, over 180 nations agreed to take \nfurther steps to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT, \nand agreed to extend the treaty indefinitely.\n  In the last 6 years, however, these positive trends have stalled--and \nin some cases regressed. While promising to leave the Cold War behind, \nPresident Bush abandoned the very policies his successors had pursued \nto bring the Cold War weapons competition to a peaceful and successful \nend. He unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty. He refused to support ratification of the 1996 Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. He opted for an arms reduction agreement with \nRussia in 2002 that does not include new verification provisions, does \nnot require the dismantling of warheads or missiles, and allows each \nside to stockpile thousands of nondeployed weapons. And after ignoring \nthe findings of U.N. weapons inspectors on the ground and launching a \npreemptive war against Iraq, President Bush lost much of the \ninternational goodwill that is required to mobilize global support to \nstrengthen the beleaguered nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n  The Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act calls for a balanced and \ncomprehensive set of initiatives that would strengthen the global \nnonproliferation regime. The bill authorizes $50 million to support the \ncreation of a low enriched uranium reserve administered by the IAEA \nthat would help guarantee the availability of fuel for commercial \nnuclear reactors. This international fuel bank can play an important \nrole in dissuading countries from building their own uranium enrichment \nfacilities. Additional funding is also authorized for the IAEA's \nDepartment of Safeguards to improve its ability to conduct effective \ninspections.\n  To win the struggle against nuclear proliferation, we must also have \nthe courage to lead by example. The bill calls for talks with Russia to \nreduce the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons and further reduce \nthe number of strategic nuclear weapons in Russian and U.S stockpiles \nin a transparent and verifiable fashion, and in a manner consistent \nwith the security of the United States. It also calls for considering \nchanges in the alert status of U.S. and Russian forces to reduce the \nrisk of an accidental, unauthorized, or mistaken launch of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Other initiatives called for in the bill include reaffirming support \nfor and strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, taking \nsteps to reconsider and ratify a global ban on nuclear testing, \npursuing a long-overdue global agreement to verifiably halt the \nproduction of fissile material for weapons, and fully implementing the \nLugar-Obama initiative that strengthens the ability of friendly foreign \ncountries to stop the transfer of weapons of mass destruction and \nrelated material.\n  With a bold, comprehensive approach and strong U.S. leadership, we \ncan--and must--make significant strides in reducing the threat posed by \nnuclear weapons. America must lead the way again by marshalling a \nglobal effort to meet the challenge that rises above all others in \nurgency securing, destroying, and stopping the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction. This bill, I believe, makes a significant \ncontribution toward that goal, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1978. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to award grants to implement a co-teaching model for educating \nstudents with disabilities; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Co-Teaching Educator \nProfessional Development Act of 2007 to help improve the education of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  A result of the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, and \nthe 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA, is that States, districts, and schools in Rhode Island and \nnationwide have increasingly begun utilizing a ``co-teaching'' model to \nmake sure that students with disabilities have the highest quality \nteachers. Co-teaching is a term that describes a general education \nteacher and a special education teacher jointly teaching students with \nand without disabilities in the same classroom. Co-teaching ensures \nthat students with disabilities receive not only the special \ninstruction, supports, and services they are entitled to under IDEA, \nbut also are taught the same rigorous academic content as any other \nstudents.\n  However, achieving this is no easy task. Successful co-teaching \nrequires that educators truly work together so their knowledge and \nskills truly complement one another. At the end of the day that \nrequires that specialized professional development is provided to these \nteachers.\n  As such, the Co-Teaching Educator Professional Development Act of \n2007 would amend Title II of the No Child Left Behind Act to award \ncompetitive grants to school districts to provide high-quality \nprofessional development opportunities for general education teachers, \nspecial education teachers, principals, and administrators to ensure \nthat these educators have the necessary pedagogical, collaborative, \nplanning, and interpersonal skills to successfully implement a co-\nteaching model and increase the achievement of students with \ndisabilities. Such professional development training would help \nteachers, principals, and administrators address diverse learning and \nstudent needs; clearly define classroom, teaching, and decision-making \nresponsibilities; develop effective communication, problem-solving, \nclassroom management, and conflict resolution skills; and jointly \ndevelop and plan a student's IEP and overall classroom curriculum.\n  In short, this bill provides teachers, principals, and administrators \nwith the skills and tools to help ensure that children with \ndisabilities receive the\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\neducational assistance and support they need and deserve. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work for its inclusion in \nthe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1978\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to provide for school improvement, comprehensive, high-quality \nmulti-year induction and mentoring for new teachers, and professional \ndevelopment for experienced teachers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the School Improvement \nthrough Teacher Quality Act of 2007, to foster the development of a \nhighly skilled and effective teacher workforce capable of improving \nstudent achievement in this country.\n  We are slated to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct this Congress for the first time since 2001. The key to this \nreauthorization will be ensuring that states, districts, and schools \nare given the resources, tools, and support to improve student \nlearning, including targeted, high-quality efforts to improve a school \nwhen it is identified as in need of improvement under the law.\n  Improving teacher quality is the single most effective step we can \ntake to increase student achievement and turnaround failing schools. \nStudies have found that 40 to 90 percent of the difference in student \ntest scores can be attributed to teacher quality. Unfortunately, new \nteachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, face such \nchallenging working conditions that nearly half leave the profession \nwithin their first 5 years, one-third leave within their first 3 years, \nand 14 percent leave by the end of their first year.\n  However, research has shown that offering new teachers comprehensive, \nmulti-year mentoring and guidance cuts attrition rates in half, and \nhelps these teachers become high-quality professionals who improve \nstudent achievement. At the same time, we know that experienced \nteachers also need effective, sustained professional development to \nmaintain and improve their teaching skills.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing the School Improvement through \nTeacher Quality Act of 2007, cosponsored by Senators Murray, Obama, and \nBrown. This legislation amends Title II of the No Child Left Behind Act \nto create a new $500 million formula-based program for school districts \nto provide targeted assistance so teachers in low-performing, high-\npoverty schools get comprehensive, high-quality multi-year guidance and \nmentoring for new teachers and systematic, sustained professional \ndevelopment for experienced teachers.\n  First, this legislation would direct funding to districts with \nfailing schools to help implement a high-quality induction program for \nteachers throughout at least their first two years of full-time \nteaching. This intensive support for beginning teachers would \nincorporate proven strategies such as: rigorous mentor selection; \nongoing mentoring with school-protected release time; research-based \nprofessional development for mentors and school leaders; and research-\nbased teaching practices, formative assessments, and teacher \nportfolios. Research has demonstrated that such mentoring for beginning \nteachers at institutions like the New Teacher Center at University of \nCalifornia, Santa Cruz provides a return on investment, $1.66 for every \n$1\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nspent; increases the new teacher retention rate, to 88 percent after 6 \nyears in some California districts; and strengthens beginning teacher \neffectiveness to such an extent that their students demonstrate \nlearning gains similar to those students of their more veteran \ncounterparts.\n  Second, the School Improvement through Teacher Quality Act of 2007 \nwould offer funding for struggling schools to provide their veteran \nteachers with ongoing professional development and training, including \nhelping such schools develop and implement rigorous curricula aligned \nto State standards and student needs; design and evaluate assessments; \nimplement strategies to improve student achievement and teacher \neffectiveness; train teachers, principals, and administrators in \neffective coaching strategies, analyzing school and student data, and \nstrategies for teaching students with disabilities and English Language \nLearners; and utilize teacher leaders, coaches, or content experts to \nsupport learning and model effective collaboration skills.\n  This assistance would be tied to a modified definition of \nprofessional development based on successful nationwide models such as \nthe National Staff Development Council, with an increased focus on \ncollaboration among teachers, including engaging established teams of \nteachers to plan and develop instruction across grade level and content \narea and to evaluate and analyze data on student achievement and \nlearning goals. This professional development would occur multiple \ntimes per week during the regular work day, and be supported by school \nprincipals through school-based coaches, mentors, or lead teachers who \nallocate time, resources, and structured facilitation to the learning \nteams or cohorts.\n  Lastly, this legislation requires that an external evaluation be \nconducted of the mentoring and professional development programs \nauthorized and supported under this act. Outcomes would be based on \nmeasures such as teacher retention, student learning gains, teacher \ninstructional practice, and parent, family, and community involvement.\n  We must act on this bill and continue to push for increased Federal \ninvestment in improving schools through enhanced teacher quality and \nprofessional development. The stakes are too high, not just in terms of \nmeeting the current highly qualified requirements of the No Child Left \nBehind Act, but to take the next step and ensure that each and every \nclassroom in America is taught by an effective teacher. Teachers are \nthe key to student success and student success will in turn keep our \ncountry competitive in today's global economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work for its \ninclusion in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Teacher quality is the single most important factor \n     influencing student learning and achievement.\n       (2) Studies have found that 40 to 90 percent of the \n     difference in student test scores can be attributed to \n     teacher quality.\n       (3) New teachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, \n     face such challenging working conditions that nearly half \n     leave the profession within their first 5 years, \\1/3\\ leave \n     within their first 3 years, and 14 percent leave by the end \n     of their first year.\n       (4) The rate of attrition is roughly 50 percent higher in \n     poor schools than in wealthier ones.\n       (5) A report by the Alliance for Excellent Education \n     estimated that the cost of replacing public school teachers \n     who have dropped out of the profession is $2,600,000,000 per \n     year.\n       (6) Comprehensive induction cuts attrition rates in half, \n     and helps to develop novice teachers into high-quality \n     professionals who improve student achievement.\n       (7) Research has demonstrated that comprehensive, multi-\n     year induction--such as that provided by the New Teacher \n     Center at University of California, Santa Cruz--provides a \n     return on investment ($1.66 for every $1 spent); increases \n     the new teacher retention rate (to 88 percent after 6 years \n     in some California districts); and strengthens beginning \n     teacher effectiveness to such an extent that their students \n     demonstrate learning gains similar to those students of their \n     more veteran counterparts.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to build \n     capacity and grow effective teachers and principals in our \n     Nation's schools through--\n       (1) comprehensive, high-quality, rigorous multi-year \n     induction and mentoring programs for beginning teachers; and\n       (2) systematic, sustained, coherent team-based, job-\n     embedded professional development for experienced teachers.\n\n     SEC. 3. SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       Section 1003(g)(5) (20 U.S.C. 6303(g)(5)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) permitted to be used to supplement the activities \n     required under section 2501.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to improve the quality of, and access to, long-term \ncare; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Long-Term \nCare Quality and Modernization Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined \nby my\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \ncommitted to improving the financing and delivery of long-term care. \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that national \nspending for long-term care was almost $160 billion in 2002, \nrepresenting about 12 percent of all personal health care expenditures. \nWhile those numbers are already staggering, we also know that the need \nfor long-term care is expected to grow significantly in coming decades. \nAlmost two-thirds of people receiving long-term care services are over \nage 65, with this number expected to double by 2030.\n  Providing quality long-term care services for America's frail, \nelderly and disabled is the priority of nursing homes and assisted \nliving facilities. I applaud their work, but recognize we must do more \nto improve care and contain costs. When you consider that eight of ten \nnursing home residents rely on Medicare and Medicaid for their long-\nterm care needs, it is apparent that Congress has a responsibility to \nimprove these programs so they are sustainable for years to come.\n  That is why I am introducing The Long-Term Care Quality and \nModernization Act of 2007 with Senator Lincoln. This bill will address \nseveral problems nursing homes are experiencing with federal \nregulations, workforce shortages and taxes related to building \ndepreciation. The issue of long-term care expenditures need not be an \ninsurmountable task. It will require action and cooperation by public \nofficials and private providers as we work to find ways to help \nAmericans become better prepared for their long-term care needs.\n  However, we cannot do it alone. Individuals must take responsibility \nand begin planning for their long-term care needs. With our national \nsavings rate in steady decline, I fear the American middle class is \nwoefully unprepared to meet this coming challenges. As we move forward \nin our effort to help individuals stay financially stable in their \nlater years, we must encourage them to purchase long-term care \ninsurance and save for long-term care services.\n  Today, millions of Americans are receiving or are in need of long-\nterm care services and supports. Surprisingly, more than 40 percent of \npersons receiving long-term care are between the ages of 18 and 64. \nSome were born with disabilities; others came to be disabled through \naccident or illness. No one can predict their future long-term health \ncare needs. Therefore, everyone needs to be prepared.\n  Included in the bill I am introducing today is The Long-Term Care \nTrust Account Act of 2007. My legislation will create a new type of \nsavings vehicle for the purpose of preparing for the costs associated \nwith long-term care services and purchasing long-term care insurance. \nAn individual who establishes a long-term care trust account can \ncontribute up to $5,000 per year to their account and receive a \nrefundable 10 percent tax credit on that contribution. Interest accrued \non these accounts will be tax free, and funds can be withdrawn for the \npurchase of long-term care insurance or to pay for long-term care \nservices. The bill also will allow an individual to make contributions \nto another family members' Long-Term Care Trust Account. This will help \nmany people in our country who want to help their parents or a loved \none prepare for their health care needs.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help all Americans save for \ntheir long-term care needs. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1981. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding environmental education, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the No Child Left \nInside Act of 2007, which will provide new support for environmental \neducation in our Nation's classrooms. Given the major environmental \nchallenges we face today, teaching our young people about their natural \nworld should be a priority, and this legislation is an important first \nstep.\n  For more than three decades, environmental education has been a \ngrowing part of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding \nto the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the \n21st century economy, many schools throughout the Nation now offer some \nform of environmental education. Mr. President, 30 million students and \n1.2 million teachers annually are involved in these programs.\n  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many \nschools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental \nprograms. Fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related \nclassroom instruction and field investigations, however effective or \npopular. State and local administrators, teachers, and environmental \neducators point to two factors behind this recent and disturbing shift: \nthe unintended consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act and a lack \nof funding for these critical programs.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would address these two \ncauses. It would provide funding to States to train their teachers in \nthe field of environmental education, and it would provide support for \noutdoor environmental education programs for children and a model \nenvironmental education curriculum. The bill would also create \nincentives, through new funding, for states to develop environmental \nliteracy plans to make sure students have a solid understanding of our \nplanet and its precious natural resources. Finally, the legislation \nwould reestablish the Office of Environmental Education within the U.S. \nDepartment of Education to oversee critical environmental education \nactivities. This legislation has broad support among national and state \nenvironmental groups and educational groups.\n  The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of \nthe dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003, a National Science \nFoundation panel noted that ``in the coming decades, the public will \nmore frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental \nissues, assess risk, evaluate proposed environmental plans and \nunderstand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and \nglobal scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a \nconcerted, systemic approach to environmental education ...'' In the \nprivate sector, business leaders also increasingly believe that an \nenvironmentally literate workforce is critical to their long-term \nsuccess. They recognize that better, more efficient environmental \npractices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for \nthe future.\n  Climate change, conservation of precious natural resources, \nmaintaining clean air and water, and other environmental challenges are \npressing and complex issues that influence human health, economic \ndevelopment and national security. Finding widespread agreement about \nthe specific steps we need to take to solve these problems is \ndifficult. Environmental education will help ensure that our Nation's \nchildren have the knowledge and skills necessary to address these \ncritical issues. In short, the environment should be an important part \nof the curriculum in our schools.\n  I know my constituents in Rhode Island, as well as the residents of \nother States, want their children to be environmentally literate and \nhave a connection with the natural world.

Jack Reed,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, U.S. \n         Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. 20510-3903\n       Dear Senator Reed: As members of the No Child Left Inside \n     Coalition, we are writing to commend you for introducing the \n     No Child Left Inside Act of 2007, and we offer our support \n     for environmental education in the reauthorization of the No \n     Child Left Behind Act. While we applaud the thrust of the No \n     Child Left Behind Act, we believe adjustments are needed to \n     improve environmental consciousness in schools across the \n     country.\n       Our coalition comprises over two dozen national and \n     regional education and environmental organizations. Together \n     we represent more than 7 million citizens who are passionate \n     about the inclusion of environmental education in students' \n     learning.\n       The country is facing a host of complicated environmental \n     challenges, but we are not providing an adequate \n     environmental education to our young people. Indeed, over the \n     past few years many schools have cut back on instruction \n     related to the environment, canceling field trips and \n     meaningful outdoor explorations. Three decades of growth in \n     environmental education has been hampered by No Child Left \n     Behind, even as the nation's environmental issues have grown \n     increasingly complex.\n       We believe it is critical to reverse this trend and provide \n     children with a solid understanding of the planet and the \n     problems it faces. As they will be called upon throughout \n     their lives to sort out various environmental claims and \n     issues impacting their jobs, health, security and \n     transportation, our children need to have the tools to be \n     able to make wise decisions and choices.\n       To that end, we support several changes to the No Child \n     Left Behind Act that would emphasize the importance of \n     environmental education:\n       New funding should be available to help states develop \n     rigorous environmental education standards and improve \n     teacher training.\n       To be eligible for new environmental education funding, \n     states would be required to develop plans to ensure that \n     their students are environmentally literate.\n       These changes will provide the incentives and support \n     school systems need to offer more and better environmental \n     instruction. The rewards are likely to be great. We know from \n     past research that students who take part in environmental \n     education programs become more engaged with school and do \n     better on standardized tests.\n       Our coalition urges that the reauthorization of the No \n     Child Left Behind Act not only improve educational offerings \n     but provide new support for environmental education.\n       Once again, we thank you for your leadership on this \n     important issue.\n       If you would like additional information, please contact \n     Don Baugh, representing the No Child Left Inside Coalition.\n           Sincerely,\n         Pam Gluck, Executive Director, American Trails; Andrew J. \n           Falender, Executive Director, Appalachian Mountain \n           Club; Jen Levy, Executive Director, Association of \n           Nature Center Administrators; Steve Olson, Director of \n           Government Affairs, Association of Zoos and Aquariums; \n           Lori Whalen, Director of Education, Back to Natives \n           Restoration; William C.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the United States \nEmployee Ownership Bank, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am introducing today with Senator Leahy \nthe U.S. Employee Ownership Bank Act.\n  At a time when the U.S. has lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs; \nat a time when we are on the cusp of losing millions of high-paying \ninformation technology jobs, this legislation would begin to reverse \nthat trend by providing employees with the resources they need to \npurchase their own businesses through Employee Stock Ownership Plans \nand Eligible Worker Owned Cooperatives.\n  Specifically, this legislation would authorize $100 million to create \na U.S. Employee Ownership Bank within the Department of Treasury to \nprovide loans, loan guarantees, technical assistance, and grants to \nexpand employee ownership throughout the country.\n  Why is it so important for the Senate to provide incentives to expand \nemployee ownership in this country? The answer is simple: employee \nownership is one of the keys to creating a sustainable economy with \njobs that pay a living wage.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the ESOP Association, a \nnonprofit organization representing approximately 2,500 Employee Stock \nOwnership Plans throughout the country. Let me quote from a letter they \nrecently sent to my office:\n\n       Your legislation is a modest first step in awakening our \n     Government to the fact that in the 21st Century the inclusion \n     of employees as owners of the companies where they work in a \n     meaningful manner should be a key component of any national \n     competitiveness program. If the Senate adopts your \n     legislation, and it eventually becomes law, we assure you \n     that the ESOP community will work constructively to ensure \n     that the loan and grant program you propose works effectively \n     to benefit the employee owners, the employee owned companies, \n     and our American economy.\n  Every day we read in the papers about plants that are being moved to \nChina, Mexico, and a number of other low wage countries. Since a number \nof these factories were making profits, shutting them down was \nunnecessary and could have been avoided by selling these factories to \ntheir employees through ESOPs or worker-owned cooperatives.\n  Since 2000, the U.S. manufacturing sector has lost 3.2 million \ndecent-paying jobs. Put another way, since George W. Bush has been \nelected President, this country has seen one out of every six factory \njobs disappear.\n  In addition, the Associated Press recently reported about a study by \nMoody's which found that ``16 percent of the nation's 379 metropolitan \nareas are in recession, reflecting primarily the troubles in \nmanufacturing.''\n  In other words, about 16 percent of the biggest cities in this \ncountry are experiencing a recession, largely due to the loss of \ndecent-paying manufacturing jobs. I suspect that this problem is even \nworse in rural areas. In my small State of Vermont, we have lost about \n20 percent of our manufacturing jobs over the past 6 years representing \nover 10,000 jobs.\n  Let me just give you an example of some of the jobs that have been \nlost. From 2001-2006 the United States of America experienced the loss \nof 42 percent of our communication equipment jobs; 37 percent of our \nsemiconductor and electronic component manufacturing jobs; 43 percent \nof our textile jobs; and about half of our apparel jobs.\n  Not only are we losing decent-paying manufacturing jobs, we are also \nlosing high-paying information technology jobs as well.\n  While the loss of manufacturing jobs has been well-documented, it may \ncome as a surprise to some that from January of 2001 to January of \n2006, the information sector of the U.S. economy lost over 640,000 jobs \nor more than 17 percent of its workforce.\n  Unfortunately, the worst may be yet to come. Alan Blinder, an \neconomist at Princeton and the former Vice Chairman of the Federal \nReserve has recently concluded that between 30 and 40 million jobs in \nthe United States are vulnerable to overseas outsourcing over the next \n10 to 20 years.\n  Would expanding employee ownership be a cure-all for what ails the \nmanufacturing and information technology sectors? Of course it \nwouldn't. But I strongly believe that employee ownership can and should \nbe one of the central strategies in combating the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs. Simply put, workers who are also owners will not move \ntheir own jobs to China.\n  Today, there are some 11,000 Employee Stock Ownership Plans, hundreds \nof worker owned cooperatives, and thousands of other companies with \nsome form of employee ownership, and most of them are thriving.\n  In fact, employee ownership has been proven to increase employment, \nincrease productivity, increase sales, and increase wages in the United \nStates. According to a Rutgers University study, broad based employee \nownership boosts company productivity by 4 percent shareholder return \nby 2 percent and profits by 14 percent. Similar studies have shown that \nESOP companies paid their hourly workers between 5 to 12 percent better \nthan non-ESOP companies.\n  Yet, despite the important role that worker ownership can play in \nrevitalizing our economy, the Federal Government has failed to commit \nthe resources needed to allow employee ownership to realize its true \npotential, and that is why this legislation is so important.\n  When I was the Ranking Member of the Financial Institutions and \nConsumer Credit Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, I was \nable to hold a hearing on this issue nearly 4 years ago.\n  During the hearing, a number of witnesses told the Subcommittee that \nif Federal loans, loan guarantees, technical assistance and grants were \nmade available for the expansion of employee ownership, factories that \nare now closed and abandoned would be open for business today.\n  For example, the Subcommittee heard from Larry Owenby who worked at \nthe RFS Ecusta mill in North Carolina for 30 years until one day, the \ncompany decided to shut down.\n  Other witnesses talked about factories that were closed in \nMississippi, Alabama and Ohio. All of the witnesses testified in \nsupport of Federal loans, loan guarantees and technical assistance for \nthe expansion of employee ownership. In fact, if this assistance had \nbeen around before the plants had closed, many of them would still be \nemployed today as employee owners.\n  The final point that I want to make is that the Federal Government, \nthrough the U.S. Export-Import Bank, is already providing billions of \ndollars in loans, loan guarantees and other assistance to large, multi-\nnational companies, such as Boeing, General Electric, and Halliburton. \nMany of these companies happen to be some of the largest job cutters in \nAmerica, as they have moved hundreds of thousands of jobs to China, \nIndia, and Mexico.\n  In my opinion, instead of providing corporate welfare to large \ncorporations that are throwing American workers out on the street as \nthey move overseas, we should be providing employees with the tools \nthey need to create and retain jobs right here in the United States \nthrough the expansion of employee ownership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10822-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 292--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 9, \n               2007, AS ``NATIONAL ASSISTED LIVING WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CRAPO submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Hancock, an artist from central \n     Utah, founded a nonprofit organization called Project \n     Compassion, which endeavors to provide, without charge, to \n     the family of a member of the Armed Forces who has fallen in \n     active duty since the events of September 11, 2001, a museum-\n     quality original oil portrait of that member;\n       Whereas, to date, Kaziah M. Hancock, four volunteer \n     professional portrait artists, and those who have donated \n     their time to support Project Compassion have presented over \n     700 paintings to the families of the fallen heroes of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas Kaziah M. Hancock and Project Compassion have been \n     honored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, \n     the Disabled American Veterans, and other organizations with \n     the highest public service awards on behalf of fallen members \n     of the Armed Forces and their families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the members of Project Compassion have demonstrated, \n     and continue to demonstrate, extraordinary patriotism and \n     support for the members of the Armed Forces who have given \n     their lives for the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan and \n     have done so without any expectation of financial gain or \n     recognition for these efforts;\n       (2) the people of the United States owe the deepest \n     gratitude to the members of Project Compassion; and\n       (3) the Senate, on behalf of the people of the United \n     States, commends Project Compassion volunteer professional \n     portrait artists and the entire Project Compassion \n     organization for their tireless work in paying tribute to \n     those members of the Armed Forces who have fallen in the \n     service of the United States.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Project \nCompassion. Project Compassion was founded by Ms. Kaziah Hancock in my \nhome State of Utah. She and the other members of Project Compassion \nvolunteer their time to create gallery-quality portraits of soldiers, \nairmen, sailors, and Marines who have fallen in combat and send them to \nthe families of these troops. These wonderful patriots receive no \ncompensation for their efforts to honor the service and sacrifice of \nthe members of our military.\n  This gift offers comfort and consolation to the family members of \nthose troops who fall in battle. To date, Ms. Hancock and the other \nvolunteers of Project Compassion have presented over 700 paintings to \nthe families of America's fallen heroes. These portraits provide a real \nsense of closure and remembrance to the family members of our fallen \nheroes. Even though the portraits created by Project Compassion members \nare extremely well done by talented artists, they accept no \ncompensation for their efforts, they merely do it out of love.\n  It is my belief that Ms. Hancock and the other members of Project \nCompassion demonstrate extraordinary patriotism and support for our \nservice men and women, and do so without expectation of financial gain \nor recognition.

Res. 295\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally-appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with ADHD have a first-degree relative \n     with past or present ADHD, and that approximately one-half of \n     parents who had ADHD have a child with the disorder, \n     suggesting that ADHD runs in families and inheritance is an \n     important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\n     the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 19, 2007, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10823-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 296--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2007 AS ``NATIONAL YOUTH \n                             COURT MONTH''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Casey, Mr. Thune, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Inhofe, and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions (S. Res. 294, S. Res. 295, S. Res. 296, S. Res. 297, \nand S. Res. 298) were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 294\n\n       Whereas Congress declared bourbon as ``America's Native \n     Spirit'' in 1964, making it the only spirit distinctive to \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the history of bourbon-making is interwoven with \n     the history of the United States, from the first settlers of \n     Kentucky in the 1700s, who began the bourbon-making process, \n     to the 2,000 families and farmers distilling bourbon in \n     Kentucky by the 1800s;\n       Whereas bourbon has been used as a form of currency;\n       Whereas generations have continued the heritage and \n     tradition of the bourbon-making process, unchanged from the \n     process used by their ancestors centuries before;\n       Whereas individual recipes for bourbon call for natural \n     ingredients, utilizing the local Kentucky farming community \n     and leading to continued economic development for the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky;\n       Whereas generations of people in the United States have \n     traveled to Kentucky to experience the family heritage, \n     tradition, and deep-rooted legacy that the Commonwealth \n     contributes to the United States;\n       Whereas each year during September visitors from over 13 \n     countries attend a Kentucky-inspired commemoration to \n     celebrate the history of the Commonwealth, the distilleries, \n     and bourbon;\n       Whereas people who enjoy bourbon should do so responsibly \n     and in moderation; and\n       Whereas members of the beverage alcohol industry should \n     continue efforts to promote responsible consumption and to \n     eliminate drunk driving and underage drinking: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2007 as ``National Bourbon \n     Heritage Month'';\n       (2) recognizes bourbon as ``America's Native Spirit'' and \n     reinforces its heritage and tradition and its place in the \n     history of the United States; and\n       (3) recognizes the contributions of the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky to the culture of the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 295\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally-appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with\n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\n     ADHD have a first-degree relative with past or present ADHD, \n     and that approximately one-half of parents who had ADHD have \n     a child with the disorder, suggesting that ADHD runs in \n     families and inheritance is an important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 19, 2007, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 296\n\n       Whereas the United States is built on strong communities in \n     which all citizens play an active role and invest in the \n     success and future of the youth of the United States;\n       Whereas the sixth National Youth Court Month celebrates the \n     outstanding achievements of youth court programs throughout \n     the country;\n       Whereas in 2006, more than 120,000 youths volunteered to \n     hear more than 130,000 juvenile cases, and more than 20,000 \n     adults volunteered to facilitate peer justice in youth court \n     programs;\n       Whereas 1,210 youth court programs in 49 States and the \n     District of Columbia provide restorative justice for juvenile \n     offenders, resulting in effective crime prevention, early \n     intervention and education for all youth participants, and \n     enhanced public safety throughout the United States;\n       Whereas youth courts address offenses that might otherwise \n     go unaddressed until the offending behavior escalates and \n     reduce caseloads for the juvenile justice system;\n       Whereas youth courts redirect the efforts of juvenile \n     offenders toward becoming contributing members of their \n     communities by holding juvenile offenders accountable and \n     reconciling victims, communities, juvenile offenders, and \n     their families;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local governments, \n     corporations, foundations, service organizations, educational \n     institutions, juvenile justice agencies, and individual \n     adults support youth court programs because these programs \n     actively promote and contribute to building successful, \n     productive lives and futures for the youth of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas a fundamental correlation exists between youth \n     service and lifelong community involvement;\n       Whereas volunteer service and related service learning \n     opportunities enable young people to build character and \n     develop and enhance life-skills, such as responsibility, \n     decision-making, time management, teamwork, public speaking, \n     and leadership, which prospective employers will value; and\n       Whereas youth court programs encourage participants to \n     become valuable members of their communities: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2007 as \n     ``National Youth Court Month''.\n\n                              S. Res. 297\n\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns was created in \n     1907 as the Utah Municipal League to protect the interests of \n     the municipalities of the State of Utah and to promote an \n     active interest in municipal affairs;\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns was the 9th \n     such State league created in the United States and was one of \n     the earliest members of the National League of Cities;\n       Whereas one of the primary functions of the Utah League of \n     Cities and Towns during its early years was to organize and \n     facilitate an annual convention, which remains a key function \n     of the Utah League of Cities and Towns;\n       Whereas nearly 1,000 elected officials and staff from \n     municipalities across the State of Utah attend the Utah \n     League of Cities and Towns Convention each year;\n       Whereas when the Utah League of Cities and Towns was \n     formed, there were 375,000 residents of Utah and 83 \n     municipalities;\n       Whereas nearly 2,500,000 people now call Utah home, and the \n     large majority of these people live in the 243 cities and \n     towns across the State;\n       Whereas, in 1937, the Utah League of Cities and Towns \n     reorganized, employed a full-time staff, expanded its \n     legislative activity, and launched training and other service \n     programs;\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns strives to \n     maintain a strong unity among all Utah municipalities, \n     promoting common interests among municipalities while \n     recognizing each city's unique differences;\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns helped to \n     secure the bid, organize, and host the successful XIX Olympic \n     Winter Games in 2002, and also helped promote a vision of the \n     Olympic Games throughout the region; and\n       Whereas, as the Utah League of Cities and Towns enters its \n     2nd century of service, it remains committed to representing \n     the interests of municipal governments with a strong, unified \n     voice at the State and Federal levels and providing \n     information, training, and technical assistance to the \n     leaders of the cities and towns of Utah as they try to make \n     life better for all Utahns: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 100th anniversary of the \n     founding of the Utah League of Cities and Towns; and\n       (2) expresses its appreciation for the efforts of the Utah \n     League of Cities and Towns to promote civic responsibility \n     and community interest during the past 100 years.\n\n                              S. Res. 298\n\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette, born on September 6, \n     1757, is considered a national hero in both France and the \n     United States for his participation in the American and \n     French revolutions, and is 1 of only 6 Honorary Citizens of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette served heroically and with \n     distinction during the American Revolution, both as a general \n     and as a diplomat, offering his services as an unpaid \n     volunteer;\n       Whereas the first battle the Marquis de Lafayette fought in \n     the American Revolution was at Brandywine, where he fought \n     courageously and was wounded;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette also served with \n     distinction in various other engagements, including the \n     surrender of the British army at Yorktown;\n       Whereas, in 1783, the 2 colonial villages of Cross Creek \n     and Campbellton were merged by the legislature of North \n     Carolina and named Fayetteville, North Carolina;\n       Whereas Fayetteville, North Carolina was the first city in \n     the United States named for the Marquis de Lafayette, and the \n     only city named for him that he actually visited;\n       Whereas, in 1789, the General Assembly and constitutional \n     convention met in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where \n     delegates ratified the United States Constitution, chartered \n     the University of North Carolina, and ceded the western lands \n     of the State to form the State of Tennessee;\n       Whereas during the tour of the United States taken by the \n     Marquis de Lafayette as ``The Guest of the Nation,'' the \n     Marquis was entertained in Fayetteville on March 4 and 5, \n     1825, by leading citizens of the State and community of \n     Fayetteville, including Governor Hutchins G. Burton;\n       Whereas, on the death of the Marquis de Lafayette in 1834, \n     the City of Fayetteville held a large memorial service with \n     an eloquent eulogium on his character and services;\n       Whereas, in 1983, on the bicentennial of the naming of \n     Fayetteville, the Lafayette Society and the great-great \n     grandson of the Marquis de Lafayette, Count Rene de Chambrun, \n     unveiled a statue of General Lafayette in the Downtown \n     Historic District; and\n       Whereas the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina, will hold \n     3 days of celebration from September 6 through 8, 2007 to \n     honor the 250th anniversary of the birth of the Marquis de \n     Lafayette: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the City of Fayetteville, North Carolina for \n     holding a 3-day celebration of the 250th anniversary of the \n     birth of the Marquis de Lafayette; and\n       (2) recognizes that the great City of Fayetteville is where \n     North Carolina celebrates the birthday of the Marquis de \n     Lafayette.\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10840-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10840-S10842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2007 AS ``NATIONAL BOURBON HERITAGE MONTH''\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 19, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL ATTENTION DEFICIT \n                        DISORDER AWARENESS DAY''\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2007 AS ``NATIONAL YOUTH COURT MONTH''\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UTAH LEAGUE OF CITIES AND \n                                 TOWNS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n COMMENDING FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, FOR HOLDING A CELEBRATION OF \n     THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Res. 295\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally-appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with\n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\n     ADHD have a first-degree relative with past or present ADHD, \n     and that approximately one-half of parents who had ADHD have \n     a child with the disorder, suggesting that ADHD runs in \n     families and inheritance is an important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 19, 2007, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 296\n\n       Whereas the United States is built on strong communities in \n     which all citizens play an active role and invest in the \n     success and future of the youth of the United States;\n       Whereas the sixth National Youth Court Month celebrates the \n     outstanding achievements of youth court programs throughout \n     the country;\n       Whereas in 2006, more than 120,000 youths volunteered to \n     hear more than 130,000 juvenile cases, and more than 20,000 \n     adults volunteered to facilitate peer justice in youth court \n     programs;\n       Whereas 1,210 youth court programs in 49 States and the \n     District of Columbia provide restorative justice for juvenile \n     offenders, resulting in effective crime prevention, early \n     intervention and education for all youth participants, and \n     enhanced public safety throughout the United States;\n       Whereas youth courts address offenses that might otherwise \n     go unaddressed until the offending behavior escalates and \n     reduce caseloads for the juvenile justice system;\n       Whereas youth courts redirect the efforts of juvenile \n     offenders toward becoming contributing members of their \n     communities by holding juvenile offenders accountable and \n     reconciling victims, communities, juvenile offenders, and \n     their families;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local governments, \n     corporations, foundations, service organizations, educational \n     institutions, juvenile justice agencies, and individual \n     adults support youth court programs because these programs \n     actively promote and contribute to building successful, \n     productive lives and futures for the youth of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas a fundamental correlation exists between youth \n     service and lifelong community involvement;\n       Whereas volunteer service and related service learning \n     opportunities enable young people to build character and \n     develop and enhance life-skills, such as responsibility, \n     decision-making, time management, teamwork, public speaking, \n     and leadership, which prospective employers will value; and\n       Whereas youth court programs encourage participants to \n     become valuable members of their communities: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2007 as \n     ``National Youth Court Month''.\n\n                              S. Res. 297\n\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns was created in \n     1907 as the Utah Municipal League to protect the interests of \n     the municipalities of the State of Utah and to promote an \n     active interest in municipal affairs;\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns was the 9th \n     such State league created in the United States and was one of \n     the earliest members of the National League of Cities;\n       Whereas one of the primary functions of the Utah League of \n     Cities and Towns during its early years was to organize and \n     facilitate an annual convention, which remains a key function \n     of the Utah League of Cities and Towns;\n       Whereas nearly 1,000 elected officials and staff from \n     municipalities across the State of Utah attend the Utah \n     League of Cities and Towns Convention each year;\n       Whereas when the Utah League of Cities and Towns was \n     formed, there were 375,000 residents of Utah and 83 \n     municipalities;\n       Whereas nearly 2,500,000 people now call Utah home, and the \n     large majority of these people live in the 243 cities and \n     towns across the State;\n       Whereas, in 1937, the Utah League of Cities and Towns \n     reorganized, employed a full-time staff, expanded its \n     legislative activity, and launched training and other service \n     programs;\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns strives to \n     maintain a strong unity among all Utah municipalities, \n     promoting common interests among municipalities while \n     recognizing each city's unique differences;\n       Whereas the Utah League of Cities and Towns helped to \n     secure the bid, organize, and host the successful XIX Olympic \n     Winter Games in 2002, and also helped promote a vision of the \n     Olympic Games throughout the region; and\n       Whereas, as the Utah League of Cities and Towns enters its \n     2nd century of service, it remains committed to representing \n     the interests of municipal governments with a strong, unified \n     voice at the State and Federal levels and providing \n     information, training, and technical assistance to the \n     leaders of the cities and towns of Utah as they try to make \n     life better for all Utahns: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 100th anniversary of the \n     founding of the Utah League of Cities and Towns; and\n       (2) expresses its appreciation for the efforts of the Utah \n     League of Cities and Towns to promote civic responsibility \n     and community interest during the past 100 years.\n\n                              S. Res. 298\n\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette, born on September 6, \n     1757, is considered a national hero in both France and the \n     United States for his participation in the American and \n     French revolutions, and is 1 of only 6 Honorary Citizens of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette served heroically and with \n     distinction during the American Revolution, both as a general \n     and as a diplomat, offering his services as an unpaid \n     volunteer;\n       Whereas the first battle the Marquis de Lafayette fought in \n     the American Revolution was at Brandywine, where he fought \n     courageously and was wounded;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette also served with \n     distinction in various other engagements, including the \n     surrender of the British army at Yorktown;\n       Whereas, in 1783, the 2 colonial villages of Cross Creek \n     and Campbellton were merged by the legislature of North \n     Carolina and named Fayetteville, North Carolina;\n       Whereas Fayetteville, North Carolina was the first city in \n     the United States named for the Marquis de Lafayette, and the \n     only city named for him that he actually visited;\n       Whereas, in 1789, the General Assembly and constitutional \n     convention met in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where \n     delegates ratified the United States Constitution, chartered \n     the University of North Carolina, and ceded the western lands \n     of the State to form the State of Tennessee;\n       Whereas during the tour of the United States taken by the \n     Marquis de Lafayette as ``The Guest of the Nation,'' the \n     Marquis was entertained in Fayetteville on March 4 and 5, \n     1825, by leading citizens of the State and community of \n     Fayetteville, including Governor Hutchins G. Burton;\n       Whereas, on the death of the Marquis de Lafayette in 1834, \n     the City of Fayetteville held a large memorial service with \n     an eloquent eulogium on his character and services;\n       Whereas, in 1983, on the bicentennial of the naming of \n     Fayetteville, the Lafayette Society and the great-great \n     grandson of the Marquis de Lafayette, Count Rene de Chambrun, \n     unveiled a statue of General Lafayette in the Downtown \n     Historic District; and\n       Whereas the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina, will hold \n     3 days of celebration from September 6 through 8, 2007 to \n     honor the 250th anniversary of the birth of the Marquis de \n     Lafayette: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the City of Fayetteville, North Carolina for \n     holding a 3-day celebration of the 250th anniversary of the \n     birth of the Marquis de Lafayette; and\n       (2) recognizes that the great City of Fayetteville is where \n     North Carolina celebrates the birthday of the Marquis de \n     Lafayette.\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/02/senate-section/article/S10842-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  URGING THE PRESIDENT TO DECLARE LUNG CANCER A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 87\n\n       Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death \n     for both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all \n     cancer deaths;\n       Whereas lung cancer kills more people annually than breast \n     cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, \n     melanoma, and kidney cancer combined;\n       Whereas, since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law \n     92-218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and comprehensive research \n     has raised the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer to 88 \n     percent, for prostate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon \n     cancer to 64 percent;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is still \n     only 15 percent and a similar coordinated and comprehensive \n     research effort is required to achieve increases in lung \n     cancer survivability rates;\n       Whereas 60 percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed \n     in nonsmokers or former smokers;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are \n     women;\n       Whereas certain minority populations, such as Black males, \n     have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer incidence \n     and mortality, notwithstanding their lower smoking rate;\n       Whereas members of the baby boomer generation are entering \n     their sixties, the most common age at which people develop \n     cancer;\n       Whereas tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer \n     carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and \n     battlefield emissions are serious problems among military \n     personnel and war veterans;\n       Whereas the August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress \n     Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that \n     funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels \n     characterized for other common malignancies and far out of \n     proportion to its massive health impact'';\n       Whereas the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group \n     identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of \n     integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research \n     consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather \n     than around specific research disciplines;
