Mr. President, I can say with certainty that not one of the \n100 Members of the Senate approaches the work ahead of us this week \nwith a sense of glee.\n  The past American century has been defined, in no small part, by the \nmanufacturing ingenuity, raw power, and limitless possibilities \nembodied by our automobile industry.\n  Packard, Nash, Studebaker, Hudson, Plymouth, they are all gone. There \nare others. Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler are American icons. Yet \nwe now see that all three teeter on the brink of collapse, due in no \nsmall part to their own ineptitude.\n  Although the blame for this desperate state falls squarely on the \nshoulders of those who run the Big Three, the consequences of their \nfailures could broadly impact our entire country. The jobs of millions \nof American workers are at stake, along with the financial security of \nmillions of families. So while we take no satisfaction in loaning \ntaxpayer money to these companies, we know it must be done.\n  Today, the stock market, which will be open for a few minutes more, a \nlittle over an hour, today was up by more than 300 points as I walked \ninto the Chamber today. Why? Because Congress is trying to save \nDetroit. We must act, not to reward the executives of the Big Three for \ntheir failures but to invest in the millions of Americans who could \nface the consequences of their failures.\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\n  I strongly disagree with the Bush administration's refusal to use \nfunds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. They should have done it. \nTARP, that is what it is called. These monies, we believe, should be \nused to help the auto industry.\n  Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Dodd, Congressman Frank, and I wrote the \nPresident last week, urging him to act because of the financial risks \nof the collapse of one or more of the Big Three. The President's \nrefusal to do so requires Congress to take action.\n  I wish to especially thank Senator Chris Dodd and Congressman Barney \nFrank, who worked through the weekend to come up with legislation that \nwill give the automakers a chance to clean house and return to a \nresponsible path toward profitability. It was literally of no personal \nbenefit to Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank for doing what they did; \nit was simply the right thing to do. Their staffs have been heroic \nsoldiers, in their legislative efforts, working literally around the \nclock for the last 4 or 5 days.\n  And because of their efforts; that is, the two chairs and their \nvaliant staffs, we have legislation before us, or soon will have, that \nwill provide funds to see the auto companies through to the end of the \nfirst quarter of next year.\n  But this is no blank check or blind hope. If the companies fail to \ndevelop a plan that will lead to long-term competitiveness and \nprofitability, if they fail to stick to that plan, the loan can be \nrecalled. That is what the intended law says. We require strong \noversight, executive pay standards, and taxpayer protection, such as \nwarrants and a prohibition on dividends, to ensure that taxpayers stand \nto benefit if and when this plan succeeds.\n  There is no perfect or good answer to this problem. No solution will \nsatisfy everyone and no legislation would be cause for celebration. But \nif Senators are willing to work together the next few days, we can pass \nlegislation that represents good legislation, though not perfect, that \nwill enable America's largest single manufacturing base to continue \nand, in the immediate future, bound forward once again to be the power \nof America's manufacturing sector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10790-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Congress returns this week at a time of \ngrave concern about the state of our Nation's economy. Americans are \nworried about the credit markets that serve as the lifeblood of our \nMain Street economy. They are worried about the broader financial \nindustry. And now they are worried about the possibility of another \nmajor convulsion coming from the auto industry, an important source of \njobs throughout America, including my own State of Kentucky.\n  As we consider new legislation this week, we must first ensure that \nwe do no harm to taxpayers later in our efforts to help any one \nparticular industry now. That is why Republicans insist that any \nproposal aimed at helping the auto industry include a firm commitment \non its part to significant and fundamental reform. Troubled automakers \ncannot expect taxpayer help without a serious commitment to change \ntheir ways permanently.\n  Any assistance from Congress would hold the auto industry accountable \nto essential reforms from day one. And it would include enforcement \ncapabilities, including strict, immediate accountability and oversight. \nAutomakers should not expect any new appropriations. Congress will not \ndraw on funds that have already been designated to stabilize the entire \neconomy in order to help one sector of it.\n  As Congress works to help stabilize the broader economy, we cannot \nexpose the taxpayers to new burdens without the promise of avoiding in \nthe future the same mistakes that created these problems in the first \nplace. This is the principle that should guide all of us in this week's \nnegotiations. I am confident it will guide Republicans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10790-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issues facing \nthe crisis in the auto industry as well as the Department of the \nTreasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP.\n  As the economy continues its severe downturn, American families \nacross the country face challenges on a level not experienced for \ndecades. With hundreds of thousands of jobs being lost each month, \nsmall businesses and millions of Americans struggling to meet everyday \nneeds, the Federal Government is being challenged to come up with new \nsolutions. We are clearly in a unique time as we are experiencing an \neconomic downturn unparalleled since the Great Depression.\n  Our Government has already taken a number of emergency actions to \nprevent an economic calamity but new crises continue to develop. The \nlatest and, of course, we think right now the most noticeable crisis is \nthe potential collapse of the domestic auto industry.\n  Unlike many other industries, the auto industry touches millions of \njobs and many manufacturing and service industries throughout the \nNation. We are not talking only about autoworkers in assembly plants, \nwe are also talking about auto suppliers, dealerships, repair shops, \nsteel, glass, and plastic industries.\n  These auto-related jobs are not just in big cities such as Detroit \nand Cleveland, St. Louis, or Kansas City, those jobs support families \nin small- and medium-sized communities across rural America in places \nin my home State such as Dexter, Fenton, Mexico, Riverside, Maryville, \nMoberly, Versailles, and Joplin. I have been meeting with many of these \npeople in the last few weeks.\n  But despite the real need for temporary emergency assistance to save \njobs in Missouri and across the country, I do not support a taxpayer-\nfunded blank check that will prop up failed business models without \ngetting the changes that are vitally needed.\n  It is a disservice to the American taxpayer to throw good money after \nbad, when these big businesses contributed to their problems. I share \nand understand the ``bailout fatigue'' of most taxpayers, a lot of \nfolks in my State, and we are troubled by the Government intervention \nin the private market. But I think it is important to note the failures \nof the auto companies, like the financial markets, are more than just a \nfailure of the markets and the industry. It also occurred due to \nGovernment actions, some of which were pushed by the Congress.\n  Congress helped bring about $4-a-gallon gasoline that pushed car \nsales down before the credit crisis--in which we also had a hand--shut \noff car loans.\n  Our country, however, is facing a unique economic emergency and now \nis not the time to point fingers of blame.\n  It is a time to examine carefully all policy options, including the \noption of doing nothing. But doing nothing for the auto industry would \nmean allowing them to go into bankruptcy. Unfortunately, bankruptcy \ntakes several years, and many consumers would not purchase a car or a \ntruck from a company in bankruptcy. In fact, recent research studies \nsuggest that 20 to 30 percent of shoppers avoided purchasing domestic \nautos in October due to the speculation of bankruptcy. In other\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\nwords, bankruptcy would likely lead to the end of the auto industry. If \nthey were to go into chapter 11, debtor in possession financing is \nrequired to get out of chapter 11, but with the credit markets frozen, \nwhere would they get that money? That is what we are talking about \ntoday.\n  The collapse of the auto industry would not be without cost to the \ntaxpayers. The loss of hundreds of thousands--if not millions--of jobs \nwould severely strain our social safety net, as taxpayer funds would \nhave to be used for unemployment benefits, health care, and other \nnecessary social services.\n  For these reasons, I decided I would not turn my back on families, \nsmall businesses, and communities in Missouri and across the Nation, \nbut I would also not turn my back on taxpayers and simply throw money \nafter the problem. Facing an economic crisis that is only going to get \nworse, I believe--I have believed, as I do now--action is necessary. \nThis is why I worked to craft a bipartisan bill with my colleagues: \nSenators Levin, Voinovich, Stabenow, Brown, Specter, and Casey. This \nbipartisan bill, called the Auto Industry Emergency Bridge Loan Act, \nwould provide temporary emergency assistance to the auto industry but \nhold the companies accountable by requiring specific plans with real \nand significant cost-control measures and cuts. Specifically, the \nLevin-Bond bill includes three key principles. First, the bill must \nhave strong taxpayer protection. This means taxpayers will be repaid \nfor the emergency assistance, and taxpayers would share in the \nturnaround profits of participating automakers. Second, the bill \nincludes executive accountability so that failed executives will not be \nrewarded for poor management. Third, and most important, the bill \nincludes significant financial reform so that recipients of taxpayer \nfunds must demonstrate they have a plan to ensure long-term \ncompetitiveness, health, and profitability by bringing their costs \nunder control.\n  This bill would require all stakeholders--including management, \nlabor, creditors, and shareholders--to make sacrifices. The companies \nmust take real restructuring reform measures that address unproductive \nand duplicative lines and legacy costs that are burdensome. Our \noriginal bill said we must have the Secretary of Commerce make that \ndecision because that is not a decision we in this body can sit down \nand make with stacks of plans in front of us. We want experts in the \nDepartment of Commerce and those they bring in from the outside to \ndetermine whether these plans are workable, whether they meet the \ncriteria. One of the ideas that has been floated is to have a car czar \nto bring together interested stakeholders, including management, \nunions, and creditors, to negotiate long-term financial viability plans \nfor participating auto manufacturers and component suppliers, or we \nneed an oversight board to oversee the use of emergency loan funds and \nimplementation of any completed financial viability plans to make sure \nthe fundamental reforms are made. If there is a czar to be appointed, I \nstrongly suggest and I am sure the current administration would consult \nclosely with the Obama transition team to make sure they had somebody \nwho was mutually acceptable who would work in the Commerce Department \nwith the resources there to advise the Secretary, the President, and \nthe President-elect that these plans are, in fact, viable.\n  It is important to note that the plan we understand is being \ndiscussed--and our bill--does not provide any new taxpayer funds. \nInstead, it uses previously appropriated funds to provide the emergency \nbridge loans under the program. These funds are then to be repaid to \nthat fund to be used for the original clean car retooling program. \nSimilarly, using these new funds will not be allowed to change any of \nthe clean car efficiency requirements originally imposed on automakers.\n  It is encouraging for me and my colleagues to hear in the media that \nmany of the people working on it--the leadership--have stated publicly \ntheir support for the general approach and principles outlined in the \nLevin-Bond bill. While the news has been generally encouraging, we have \nnot seen any details of the bill being developed by the Democratic \nleadership. I have been unable to find out from the White House if they \nhave seen the details or the wording. It is absolutely important, to \nsecure the votes to pass this bill in the Senate, that it contain these \nkey principles: taxpayer protection, executive accountability, and a \nviable long-term plan specifically laid out so that we know where they \nare going. Without that, I do not believe the Senate can or should pass \nthat bill. There must be strong powers to ensure that restructuring \nmeasures will be enforced. The czar should be appointed, if we get one, \nby the administration, in cooperation with the President-elect. \nProviding even a short-term bridge loan without a real enforceable plan \nis not a responsible approach. Funds must be conditioned on a strong \nrestructuring strategy so that the taxpayers have confidence that it is \na bridge loan to somewhere that will lead to long-term financial \nviability, competitiveness, health, and profitability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10791-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10791-S10792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. BOND. Before closing, I offer a few comments on the TARP program. \nSince enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in early \nOctober, the Treasury Department has spent almost all of its initial \n$350 billion under TARP to recapitalize several banks and financial \ninstitutions. It has been reported that the Treasury Secretary may \nrequest the remaining $350 billion as early as this week. Under the \nlaw, the President must submit a written request that details the \nTreasury Secretary's plan to use the additional funds, and Congress has \n15 days to enact a disapproval resolution. However, given the track \nrecord of the Treasury's use of the initial $350 billion of TARP funds, \nit is difficult for many of us to feel confident that the Department \nwill spend additional funds in an effective and efficient manner. The \nadministration is going to have to demonstrate that it has addressed a \nnumber of very serious implementation issues. As a Senator from the \nShow Me State, I expect to see them.\n  Some of these issues are related to the management and oversight of \nthe funds as reported last week by the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO. In its report, the GAO uncovered a number of \nmanagement and oversight deficiencies that raise serious questions \nabout the program's integrity, accountability, transparency, and \neffectiveness. Frankly, the GAO's findings were very troubling. The GAO \npointed to the Treasury Department's inadequate staffing, failure to \nestablish a mechanism to track billions in taxpayer funds provided to \nthe banks, and failure to establish a system on how it would monitor \ncompliance with executive compensation limitations required by the \nlegislation. In other words, it appears the Treasury is unable to tell \ntaxpayers how their funds are being spent and whether the money is \nbeing spent in a reasonable and effective manner. I don't think that is \nacceptable.\n  The GAO also uncovered other troubling findings, such as Treasury's \nlack of action to address the foreclosure crisis. As we all know, the \nhousing foreclosure crisis is at the center of the financial credit \ncrisis. In recognition of this, the EESA included specific language for \nthe Secretary to address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, Treasury \nhas not taken sufficient action as communities and families across the \ncountry continue to be devastated by foreclosures. Loan modification \nefforts are failing, as evidenced by the Treasury Office of \nComptroller--the OCC--data released this morning. According to the OCC, \nabout 36 percent of borrowers were more than 30 days past due on loan \npayments 3 months after their loan was modified and nearly 53 percent \nwere more than 30 days late after 6 months. What is going on here?\n  These findings raise significant questions, if not doubts, about both \nprivate and Government loan modification efforts, including those \nthrough the Department's so-called HOPE NOW Program. As I previously \nwarned, the administration's and Congress's push to use the Federal \nHousing Administration to prevent foreclosures by refinancing subprime \nand troubled loans may end up costing taxpayers a lot of money in the \nnear future. Rescuing the FHA through taxpayer funds is not surprising \nto those who have watched the FHA closely and know they have \nlongstanding management and oversight\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\nproblems and lack of resources. Clearly, a more aggressive, \ncomprehensive, and smarter approach to the foreclosure crisis must be \ntaken if we are to recover from the recession.\n\n  The housing crisis has now spread from subprime mortgages to prime \nmortgages as economic factors impact borrowers' ability to pay their \nmortgages. Due to expansion of the mortgage crisis, it is critical that \nwe find measures to protect and create jobs. The importance of jobs and \nits impact on the housing crisis further raises the importance of \ndevising a responsible rescue package for the auto industry since \nmillions of jobs are at risk--over 3 million jobs in the Nation, \n220,000 jobs in Missouri.\n  TARP has also disappointed me by the ad hoc implementation of the \nprogram. Prior to the creation of TARP, the Department seemed to be \nimprovising on a daily basis its intervention with financial markets. \nOne of our intents in creating TARP was to provide a structure and \ncoherency to the Government's approach to the financial crisis. That we \nhave not seen. Before this and the next administration submit a request \nfor the remaining TARP funds, we expect to have answers to the \nquestions and issues raised by the GAO and others. The Government needs \nto provide more certainty on how it will address the financial and \neconomic crisis and provide answers to taxpayers on how it has spent \ntaxpayers funds already provided.\n  These are very serious times. I want to see action by this Congress. \nI want to see us move quickly. But I also want to see action by the \nauto industry to advise the czar or the Secretary of Commerce, and I \nwant to see action by the Treasury to give us a better idea of how TARP \nfunds are being used, how they will be accounted for, how they are \ngoing to be implemented, and how they are going to be used.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \nissue as to what Congress should do, if anything, with respect to \neconomic aid to General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. This is an issue \nwhich has been very much in the news, with the prospect that one or \nmore of these companies might not survive--probably would not survive--\nin the absence of some aid from the U.S. Government.\n  Last Tuesday, I convened a meeting in Philadelphia attended by key \nexecutives from each of the Big Three, labor leaders, the head of the \nPennsylvania AFL-CIO, the head of the Pennsylvania United Auto Workers \nCommunity Action Program, and the head of the Philadelphia Labor \nCouncil. Also in attendance were dealers, suppliers, and economists to \nreview the situation, to get a background, to understand it better, to \nprovide for the consideration this week of the issue which will be \nbefore the Senate.\n  At that meeting, the Big Three painted a very gloomy picture. Ford \nwas in the best position of the three, having arranged credit some time \nago, and they had a request pending for some $9 billion in standby aid. \nThey were not asking for it, but only want it available in case their \nsituation came to the point where they actively needed it in order to \nsurvive. The CEO of Ford said that if the $9 billion was requested and \nreceived, he would then serve for a dollar a year.\n  The projections from General Motors and Chrysler were considerably \ngloomier than Ford, with the statements made that if they did not get \naid by the end of the year, they might have to go into bankruptcy, or \nto Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The suppliers were very concerned \nabout the impact on their situation. The auto dealers were similarly \nconcerned. Labor is very worried about the loss of jobs. So it was a \nvery gloomy meeting overall.\n  On Thursday, I convened a meeting in the Lehigh Valley. We did not \nhave representatives of the Big Three, but we did have labor locally, \ndealers, bankers, economists who evaluated that situation. I joined \nwith Senators Levin, Stabenow, Bond, Voinovich, and Brown on November \n20 in endorsing legislation to assist the Big Three, to say that it is \nsomething I would be willing to consider in light of the projected \ndifficulties and the ripple effect it could have on the economy.\n  My statement in the news conference which we held and a statement on \nthe Senate floor was that my view was limited to consideration of such \neconomic aid conditioned on the Big Three having plans to move forward \nwhich would present the realistic likelihood that they would be able to \nsucceed. Considerable attention was given in the meetings which I held \nlast week in Pennsylvania to the alternative of bankruptcy, and there \nhave been many who have said bankruptcy would be the appropriate course \nas bankruptcy proceedings were held with the steel industry and the \nairlines, and that was the way to resolve the issue if the Big Three \ncould not survive. One point which all of the Big Three agreed upon was \nthat if one failed, they were all going to fail.\n  The considerations with respect to bankruptcy which were considered \nat the two meetings I held were the contention that bankruptcy would be \nunacceptable to have the survival or having the Big Three come out of \nbankruptcy because of the difference between the automobile \nmanufacturer situation contrasted with the steel industry or with the \nairlines. When buyers are looking for a car or looking for a warranty, \nthey expect the companies to be in existence for protracted periods of \ntime, so that the argument was made that Chapter 11 proceedings or \nbankruptcy generally would not be acceptable.\n  I commented at these meetings, as I did on the Senate floor and in \nthe news conference which the six Senators had on November 20, that the \npublic sentiment is very much opposed to bailouts. After the $700 \nbillion legislation was passed on October 3, I traveled the State of \nPennsylvania and had town meetings. I found the temperature of my \nconstituents was at the boiling point, 212 Fahrenheit, and, in fact, \nthe thermometers were broken. I commented to the town meeting attendees \nthat the vote which was taken in the Senate was a strong vote--74 to \n25--which was a very strong vote, because of the potentially \ncatastrophic consequences of what would happen to the economy. We \ndidn't like the bailout of Bear Stearns or the bailout of AIG, and \nLehman Brothers was not bailed out, and there were major regulatory \nproblems which would be addressed by the Congress. Those who had made \nfalse representations on the balance sheets saying that the companies \nwere worth falsified figures, knowing them to be false--that is fraud--\nand there were investigations, criminal investigations underway, and \nthat as in the Enron situation, people could go to jail for making \nthose false representations. But I make that comment because of the \npublic view which is opposed to the so-called bailouts; that it ought \nnot to be the Government which picks winners and losers, but it ought \nto be the market which picks winners and losers. I repeat what I have \nsaid in prior floor statements which is that the Big Three have a very \nsteep burden of proof and that the Big Three will have to come up with \na plan which is reasonably and realistically calculated to succeed. We \nare now talking about various oversight provisions, talking about \nlimited compensation, golden parachute plans which will make the Big \nThree competitive in a very difficult market, and\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\ntaking a look at the drastic reduction of automobile sales. But one \nfactor came through loudly and clearly, and that was the potential \nconsequences if the automotive industry--the Big Three--collapse, that \nwe would be without the major portion of the industrial base in the \nUnited States, which as we all know in time of national emergency, in \ntime of war, is indispensable for the defense of our country.\n  So my staff and I and my colleagues are all taking a very close look \nat the proposals which the Big Three have made. I had a request to meet \nwith General Motors and we will be doing that tomorrow. We are talking \nto a lot of people who were totally opposed to economic aid from the \nFederal Government. So we have to weigh the consequences as to what \nhappens if economic aid is not given. It is hard to calculate what the \nconsequences will be on the economy, but some of the predictions are \nvirtually catastrophic. We must weigh that against the likelihood of \nthe success of the plans, and it all depends on the quality of those \nplans.\n  I thank the Chair.

This \nis a tremendous loss to our State, and certainly to her husband, former \nGovernor Bruce King, and her sons Bill and Gary and all of the family.\n  Anyone who has lived in New Mexico for any amount of time in recent \ndecades has actually felt they were a part of the King family in a way. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, ranchers or lawyers or pipefitters or \nschoolchildren, the Kings knew virtually everyone in our State, and \nnearly everyone in the State felt they knew the Kings. Certainly our \nState has benefited from the decades of public service the many members \nof the family have given, led by Bruce and Alice. He was the Governor \nof our State three times in three different decades and by his side \nalways was his partner Alice. He was at her side last night.\n  She was always more than just the Governor's wife. She was a leader \nin our State on children's issues. She was the force behind the \ncreation of a cabinet level department, the Department of Children, \nYouth and Families. A vigorous, tireless, undaunted advocate for \nchildren, she lifted them and their issues to the top of our State's \nlist of priorities, and she was their champion.\n  New Mexico has lost an invaluable citizen, one whose accomplishments \nare part of our history and part of our future. She was a great person, \na great friend to many people, including my wife Anne and me.

Mr. President, this week there will be a lot of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate about a bridge loan to the \nautomobile industry in this country. I wish to speak about a bit of it \nhere. It is quite clear that this country faces very serious financial \nproblems--perhaps the most serious in my lifetime. We know that \nthoughtful leadership can help move this country past these problems \nand to address these problems, but they indeed are very serious.\n  Here is a description of the jobs that have been lost since the first \nof this year. Nearly 2 million private sector jobs have been lost this \nyear.\n  This is kind of sanitary and doesn't mean so much in terms of \nnumbers. But every one of those nearly 2 million people had to go home \nthis year to tell a loved one or their family that they didn't have a \njob any longer. A job is what makes much of the other things that are \ngood in our life possible. Nearly 2 million have lost jobs.\n  Most Americans who have some sort of retirement savings, whether it \nis a 401(k) or an IRA, if they have looked--and some have not--they \nhave discovered that 30 to 40 percent of that is now gone, washed away \nby a serious financial crisis. Millions of people have lost their homes \nand millions more will unless something is done. It is one thing to \nlose a home, it is another thing to lose a job; but to lose a job and a \nhome is a devastating blow to the American family. This is more than \nsome sort of normal contraction of the business cycle.\n  I have said before that I taught economics in college. When you teach \neconomics, you teach about the business cycle. There is a contraction \nphase and an expansion phase of the business cycle.\n  This is not a recession that is a result of a contraction phase of \nthe business cycle. This is something very different. This is a \nfinancial collapse, a financial crisis. This is manmade. This is not \nsome force of nature that is visited upon a population. This is a \nresult of reckless business practices by some of the largest financial \nfirms in this country.\n  Unfortunately, instead of dealing with the cause, there is much \neffort now to throw money at the biggest firms in the country that \nhelped steer our economy into the ditch. I am not suggesting there is \nnot a requirement to make a very significant investment in portions of \nthe economy to try to provide buoyancy and some lift to steer this \ncountry out of the recession. But there is an old country saying that \nthe water won't clear up until you get the hogs out of the creek. What \nI see day after day is the movement of money to the very interests that \nsteered this country into the ditch and caused the wreck in the first \nplace.\n  This morning, I read in the Wall Street Journal about the CEO of \nMerrill Lynch, who is suggesting to the directors that he get a 2008 \nbonus of as much as $10 million. Merrill Lynch is one of the companies \nthat has been in some difficulty. In fact, Merrill Lynch has been \npurchased and, as you will note from this chart, the top five banks \nthat received taxpayer funds--I have not only listed them, but I talked \nabout the amount of derivatives holdings they have. A substantial part \nof this recklessness has been hedge fund and CDOs and credit default \nswaps. J.P. Morgan got $25 billion in bailout funds, with $91.3 \ntrillion in notional value as their derivatives holdings. Citigroup got \n$45 billion in bailout funds, plus we have guaranteed $306 billion of \ntheir toxic assets as well; and they have $37 trillion in derivatives \nholdings. The list goes on.\n  Bank of America got $15 billion, and they have $39 trillion in \nnotional value of derivatives. This is what I call ``dark money.'' \nNobody knows where it is; nobody knows who is liable for it; nobody \nknows what kind of exposure this rancid, reckless dark money imposes on \nthe balance sheets of America's financial institutions.\n  We are discovering that some of the largest financial institutions in \nthe\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\ncountry failed, and the Treasury Secretary came to the Congress about a \nmonth and a half ago and said: I want $700 billion, and I want it in 3 \ndays; otherwise, the economy will collapse. He got the $700 billion but \nnot in 3 days.\n  He said: I want the $700 billion in order to buy toxic assets from \nthe balance sheets of some of the largest financial institutions. I \nsaid at that time that I would not vote for it unless provisions \nrequire rulemaking to regulate the kinds of institutions that have \nsteered this country into the ditch.\n  They said that was not possible. Then I said that it is not possible \nfor me to vote for $700 billion if we are not putting regulations into \nplace to give us the protection the American taxpayer needs. So what we \nhave seen now in recent days and weeks is the Treasury Secretary \ndecide: Well, I am not going to do what I said I was going to do with \nthe $700 billion. Instead of buying toxic assets from the balance \nsheets of the largest financial institutions, I am going to invest \ncapital in some of America's largest banks, with the thought that they \nwill expand lending. The credit markets are frozen, and we can get the \neconomy moving again. The Treasury Secretary said: I am not going to do \nwhat I told the Congress I was going to do. Instead, I am going to \nincrease the capital in banks. He got $125 billion and put it into nine \nbanks, some of which didn't want it. He didn't say that as a result of \nthis you have to expand lending or as a result of this you cannot \nprovide bonuses or as a result of this you cannot provide dividends. He \ngave them the money with no strings attached. It made no sense to me at \nall.\n  Some of this money is moving around into the dark crevasses of the \nfinancial institutions that were engaged in some of the most reckless \nfinancial practices I have seen in my lifetime, and with no conditions \nat all. It is interesting to me--and I am not here to make the case for \nthe auto loan. I think the bridge loan to the automobile industry is \nprobably something you have to do to avoid putting 2, 3, or 4 million \npeople on the unemployment rolls at a time when the economy is \nteetering on the edge of a cliff. But the fact is, when the automobile \nindustry executives came to this town, I came to the floor and said it \nwas ham-handed what they did and that they ought to agree to work for a \ndollar a year. They have been making $2 million a month. They have been \ndoing right well. I thought it was a ham-handed approach the first time \nthey showed up here.\n  But the discussion about any bridge loan to the automobile industry \nis a different discussion than the one that happened with all of the \nfinancial industries. When the Treasury Secretary anted up $45 billion \nin total to Citigroup--and they said, by the way, we will also \nguarantee $306 billion of bad assets that you have on your books--did \nhe ask for any conditions on that? Were there any restrictions? Did \nanybody get fired or lose their job in this company? Were there any \nrestrictions on the use of that money? Were there any restrictions that \nthey cannot pay bonuses? Did anybody say that they ought to park their \nprivate jets? No, not at all.\n  The biggest financial institutions have been showered with massive \nquantities of money, with no significant conditions. So today one of \nthe failed institutions--at least one of the institutions that had to \nbe purchased in order to be saved--the CEO says to the board of \ndirectors: I want a $10 million bonus for this year. This is a company \nthat suffered $11.6 billion in losses this year, and the CEO says he \nwants a $10 million bonus. You talk about bone-headed. Are they not \nlearning anything? We are talking about American taxpayer dollars being \nspent around this Wall Street crowd by the Treasury Secretary in \nmassive quantities, without any restrictions that I am aware of. There \nis no accountability. By the way, you cannot even find transparency. \nHere is what we think is happening. By the way, this comes from pretty \ngood reporting from Bloomberg and some others. So far, the federal \nfinancial bailout has put $8.5 trillion in taxpayer money at risk. The \nFederal Reserve programs, we are told at this point, guarantee about \n$5.5 trillion.\n  As you know, they opened their window for the first time in history \nfor direct lending to investment banks at the Federal Reserve Board. We \ndon't know what the taxpayers are on the hook for. Here is what some \npeople have been forced to dig up, after we were promised there was \ngoing to be complete transparency, that the American people are going \nto be part of it. Some reporters have done some work. The Federal \nReserve Program has $5.5 trillion pledged; FDIC pledges $1.5 trillion; \nTreasury Department, $1.1 trillion; Federal Housing Administration, \n$300 billion. So that is $8.5 trillion put at risk so far.\n  The question is, where is the accountability? Where is the oversight? \nWhere is the regulatory schematic that says we are not going to allow \nthis to happen again? I come from ranching country, southwestern North \nDakota. We raise cattle and horses. I understand the notion about \nclosing the gate. You cannot forget to close the gate. Nobody is \nclosing the gate--nobody. I want to remind some folks that part of the \norigin of this goes back almost 10 years to the Financial Modernization \nAct. We were hopelessly old-fashioned, we were told. Senator Gramm from \nTexas led the effort. It was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial \nmodernization bill. There were restrictions in place, such as Glass-\nSteagall and others, relative to investments in real estate and \nsecurities. They said let's get rid of those restrictions. They are \nhopelessly old-fashioned. So Congress got rid of all those \nrestrictions. President Clinton signed it. A good number in his \nadministration supported getting rid of those restrictions. I was one \nof eight Senators on the floor of the Senate who voted no. I said I \nthink we will see massive taxpayer bailouts within a decade. When you \nput together real estate, securities and insurance with banking, you \nare asking for trouble. By the way, add to that a new administration \nthat came in and, for the last 8 years, said we are interested in being \nwillfully blind with respect to regulation. So the Financial \nModernization Act was passed, and it was let them do what they want. \nThey loaded up companies with massive amounts of risk.\n  One other thing, and I have described this before. I want to remind \npeople. This is Countrywide, the biggest mortgage bank in the country. \nThey told people this: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you \nhave late mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other \nlenders? Call us. They said: Come here if you have bad credit. We will \ngive you a loan.\n\n  Milennia Mortgage said: 12 months, no mortgage payments. That's \nright, we will give you the money to make the first 12 months' \npayments. We will pay for it.\n  Here is Zoom Credit: Credit approval is seconds away. At the speed of \nlight we will preapprove you for a loan. Even if your credit is in the \ntank, Zoom Credit is like money in the bank. We specialize in credit \nrepair and debt consolidation. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit, who \ncares. Come to us.\n  They will all be making a fortune. Mr. Mozilo ran Countrywide, and he \nleft with $200 million when the whole thing collapsed. They said: Get a \nloan from us. It is called a subprime loan. It is called a no-\ndocumentation-of-income loan, or a no-doc loan. If you want a no-doc \nloan, we have it. How about a loan where you don't have to pay any \nprinciple at all? Or, even better, you don't have to pay on the \nprinciple or even all of the interest. We will put it on the back side \nof the note. Isn't that unbelievable? Why did they do that? They were \nmaking a massive amount of money. They put these loans out, and then \nthey would securitize them and slice them and dice them like sawdust in \nsausage and then sell them up the line. The mortgage banks sell them to \na hedge fund, or an investment bank sells it to a hedge fund. They are \nall making big fees, grunting and shoving like hogs in a corn crib, \nmassive amounts of money, big bonuses.\n  They built a house of cards. Meanwhile, regulators are dead from the \nneck up, content to be willfully blind. The house of cards began to \ncollapse. When it began to collapse, it caused a significant problem \nwith this entire economy. As I have described, millions of people lost \ntheir homes, millions are out of work, and there will be more in the \nfuture. Unfortunately, the question is, What do we do next? I am all \nfor doing emergency things, and I believe it is very important to do as \nPresident-\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\nelect Obama has suggested. You need to invest to try to get the economy \nmoving again. It makes a lot of sense to me to invest in the kinds of \nthings that produce an asset for the future. We should build roads and \nbridges and repair infrastructure and schools and libraries and water \nprojects--the kinds of things that invest in this country's future--\nbecause all of that puts American people back to work, on payrolls. And \nwhen people are working again, people are consumers again and they are \ngoing into the stores and creating an economy that is vibrant and \nexpanding once again. That is what we have to do.\n\n  There are more things I think that would make some sense, and one of \nthe things I think, in addition to the stimulus program the President-\nelect is talking about, which I intend to be very supportive of, are \nsome tax incentives we should also consider. These things, if you put \nan end date on them, if you make these investments before the end date, \nthey can stimulate economic activity in the short term. For example, a \ntemporary 15-percent investment tax credit for manufacturers and \nproducers in order to buy crucial equipment and machinery purchases; \nextending for 18 additional months enhanced 50-percent bonus \ndepreciation; extending enhanced $250,000 business expensing--all of \nthese things are incentives to say, in this case to businesses, if you \nmake this investment now, there is a tax incentive for doing so.\n  That is also what tends to kickstart this economy--a program that \nwould provide an opportunity for a stimulus investment and a program of \ndirected tax incentives that would get this country moving once again.\n  Mr. Arthur Levitt had a piece in the Wall Street Journal a while back \ntitled ``How to Restore Confidence in Our Markets. A Unified Regulator \nWould Be a Start.'' Let me quote it for a minute.\n\n       Our Nation's financial markets are in the midst of their \n     darkest hour in 76 years. We are in this situation because of \n     an adherence to a deregulatory approach . . . Our regulatory \n     system failed to adapt to important, dynamic and potentially \n     lethal new financial instruments as the storm clouds \n     gathered. Trust in our institutions and faith in the system \n     are . . . imperative to the functioning of our markets. \n     Creating a regulator that stands on the side of investors and \n     oversees the broad market will help restore that trust.\n\n  We don't have a choice. We cannot continue to allow that which has \nhappened in the past to happen in the future. Yet there is no urgent \ndiscussion here about what kind of regulation is necessary. He talks in \nthis piece about the new financial instruments. What has happened in \nrecent years is we have a lot of financial engineers on Wall Street who \ncreate these exotic products. It is all about making money. They create \nall these exotic products that turn out to be unregulated, many of \nwhich you cannot even understand. The question is, are we going to \ncontinue to allow that or will we do something that requires a reform \nof that system.\n  I think we need a financial reform commission that would report back \nin 6 months on how you reconstruct this system, because we can't \ncontinue to allow the system that existed to exist going forward. We \nhave to make changes; otherwise we will be back here in another decade \nwith the same kind of problems.\n  Obviously, we have to pull this country's economy out of the hole. \nThere is no question. That is going to be a hard lift, but I am \nconvinced this country will do that. And it won't be so much what \nhappens in this Chamber as it will be out in the country. I have \ndescribed previously many times that this economy, in my judgment, is \nall about confidence. When the American people are confident in the \nfuture, they do the things that manifest that confidence. They buy a \nsuit of clothes, they take a trip, they buy a car or buy a house. They \ndo the things that represent their confidence in their job, their \nfamily, and their security. That is the expansion side of this economy. \nIt is very hard for people to be confident right now in this economy \nand in the future. We have to do the things that will say to people: \nYou can be confident. We will stop the hemorrhaging of job loss, we \nwill put in place regulations to make sure this never happens again.\n  We have to find a way to make these reforms and changes that are \nsignificant and will give people some confidence about the future. The \nthings we have seen over a long period of time are pretty disgusting. I \nhave described on the floor of the Senate one of the companies--I know \none should perhaps not always use company names. I try not to, but from \ntime to time it is worthy to do so. One of the companies that got in \ntrouble here was a bank called Wachovia; a big bank, as a matter of \nfact. They loaded themselves up with lots of bad assets and had to be \npurchased. They got in a lot of trouble. Well, you know what, this \nwasn't the first time. Wachovia, at the same time it was loading up \nwith bad assets, was buying sewer systems in Germany.\n  Now, why would an American bank want to buy a sewer system in a city \nin Germany? Why? Because they did a sale-leaseback. They bought a sewer \nsystem of underground sewer pipes in a German city and leased the pipes \nback to the city. So there was never any change in the way the sewer \nwas used, but it allowed an American bank to depreciate sewage pipes in \na German city and save themselves hundreds of millions of dollars on \ntheir U.S. tax bill.\n  You know, if you have that kind of mindset going in, it is not \nsurprising to me you are going to buy a bunch of bad assets in pursuit \nof maximum profits. If your pursuit of profits as an American company \nis to buy a sewage system in a German city, it is not surprising to me \nthat they ran into the ditch with bad assets. It is the kind of thing \nthat destroys any confidence people have about this system of ours.\n  This economic system has been a miracle. This economic engine of ours \nhas been the envy of the world. But we simply can't continue in the \ndirection we have seen in recent decades. It is not all one party's \nfault, for sure, but those who have counseled self-regulation of some \nof the biggest financial institutions in this country have done the \nAmerican people no favor. Regulation is necessary with respect to the \nmarketplace. That's just a fact. I know of nothing more important to \nallocate goods and resources than the marketplace. And I am a big \nadvocate of the free market, but the free market needs a regulator. It \nneeds someone who wears a striped shirt with a whistle and calls the \nfouls. What we have seen is some of the biggest financial institutions \nin this country engage in the most reckless, bizarre behavior I have \never seen. Now the American taxpayer is stuck with the bill and the \neconomy is in the ditch, and we are trying to figure out how to pull it \nout.\n  Let me conclude by talking for a moment about the automobile \nindustry. I want to show a chart. This chart shows what has happened to \nauto industry sales this month versus the same month a year ago. \nGeneral Motors is down 41 percent, Ford down 31 percent, Nissan down 42 \npercent, Toyota down 34 percent, and Honda down 32 percent. As I \nindicated earlier, I am not a big fan of the automobile industry. I \ndon't think they have been particularly innovative or on the cutting \nedge in some areas. I think in some areas they have made some real \nprogress. But I think it is very difficult, when you go into this kind \nof economic trouble with a pretty weak balance sheet, and then face the \nloss of 40 percent of your product sales, to then skate through that. \nSo the question is this: Does this industry matter to the country? I \ndon't think you long remain a world-class economic power unless you \nhave a world-class manufacturing capability, and a significant part of \nthat capability in this country is in the automobile industry.\n  I am not someone who would support saying: Yes, let us provide money \nto the auto sector, such as the money that has been provided to the \nfinancial sector. This is a small fraction of what has been provided to \nthe biggest banks in the country, with no strings. We have not seen one \nof those people in front of a committee being questioned about how they \ngot here, what airplane they took to Washington, DC, who is going to \nlose their job, who is accountable, how much of a bonus did you get, \nand how much do you want for next year. None of those questions for the \nbig financial industries. But the auto executives have been here and \nthey have been told there is no bridge loan for you unless there are \nspecific plans, a roadmap, of how you are going to get out of this.\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\n  The only question I ask is this: In a country where we have lost \nnearly 2 million jobs since January of this year, and are teetering on \nthe edge of a cliff with our economy, if we see a bankruptcy, or a \nseries of bankruptcies here, and we see 2 or 3 million more people on \nthe unemployment rolls, what does it mean to this economy? How much \ndeeper will this recession be? How much more difficult will it be to \npull this country out of a steep decline? That is the question.\n  When Secretary Paulson came to us saying he wanted $700 billion in 3 \ndays, I was one of those who said no, and I am glad I did because I \ndon't think that money has been used appropriately. I don't think there \nis any accountability or transparency with respect to the use of that \nmoney. That has to change. We are going to decide in the coming couple \nof days whether we are going to do something here with a bridge loan \nfor the auto industry, with substantial conditions. And if those \nconditions are appropriate, I believe there is a road to a better \nfuture for this industry. I want us to come down on the side of \npreserving millions of jobs. But that responsibility rests with this \nindustry to give us the plans that provide us with some assurance and \nsome confidence about the future.\n  These are extraordinarily difficult times. When I started, I talked \nabout a debate on Wall Street once again about $10 million bonuses for \na failed firm executives. Imagine, there is no culture change here when \nwe have had the kind of financial wreckage that exists in this country, \nand a company that lost $11 billion last year has a CEO asking for a \n$10 million bonus. I ask: Have you lost all common sense? Are you \ntotally disconnected from the world? It makes no sense to me. We have \nto have a deep reservoir of common sense in the way we deal with these \nissues if we are going to get through this, and I believe we will get \nthrough this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am worried about the process we have \nbeen undergoing here in the Senate in recent weeks, and I expressed \nthat concern. I know Senator Dorgan indicated he voted against the $700 \nbillion bailout, and I did, too, for a lot of reasons, one of which was \nI thought it was unthinkable that the Senate, the one body in this \nGovernment that is supposed to look at the long-term effect of a piece \nof legislation on America, was stampeded. I think my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, said we panicked and we threw $700 billion at \none man, the Secretary of the Treasury, and basically allowed him to \nutilize it in any way he chose, although he told us explicitly that he \ndesired to use it to purchase toxic assets--that is, bad mortgages--\nfrom banks so those banks would not have the economic threat of a bad \nmortgage on their books and could be able to lend money and this would \nfix the financial crisis. There was a superhighway and a big truck \nlaying across it, and all we had to do was get this truck off and the \nfinancial markets would be open again. Within a week or 2 weeks, \nSecretary Paulson had changed his mind. Directly contrary to what he \ntold us he wanted to do, he bought stock in 10 banks at hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, the likes of which this country had never seen \nbefore, and we never talked about that one bit in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, $700 billion is an incredibly large sum to commit this \ncountry to. I hope we will get most of it back. I do not believe we \nwill get all of it back. I hope we at least get some of it back. But I \nwould note to my colleagues that 5 years of the Iraq war cost this \ncountry $500 billion. In a few days, we authorized $700 billion. But it \nreally was not just $700 billion because they had added in there a lot \nof pork items. This followed appropriations for $25 billion in loans \nfor the automobile companies that was included in the Continuing \nResolution in September, which was hardly even discussed. It was put in \nthe bill, to my knowledge, with virtually no real discussion in the \nSenate about how to help them transition their plants to make more \nenergy-efficient automobiles--just tacked it in there.\n  But you remember the fear if we didn't pass the bill the first day \nthey brought it up. It had to be passed before the Asian markets opened \nthe next day. It didn't happen. We went a week or 10 days later, and \nthe world didn't collapse. We finally passed the thing, and a lot of \npeople have doubts whether it has helped much at all.\n  Regardless, I just would say that this Senate has responsibilities to \nthe taxpayers of America. When we are talking about tens of billions of \ndollars or hundreds of billions of dollars--the largest expenditure of \nfunds on any one project in the history of this Republic, $700 \nbillion--we need to ask ourselves what this means. One of the things it \nmeans is that everybody else will want to get into the act. Before the \nink was dry on that, here come the automobile companies.\n  Let me say briefly, Americans are going to have to think about this. \nAfter 9/11, we had a little stimulus package--it was little compared to \nthe one we have now--but we sent out checks then. The economy was in a \nstate of nervous exhaustion and a spasm of economic disturbance. Our \ndeficit hit about $412 billion in 2002. I think that was the highest \ndeficit in dollar terms this Nation had ever had. In the ensuing years, \nthrough fiscal year 2007, the deficit fell to $161 billion. Then, \nearlier this year, it was decided it would be a good idea to have \nanother stimulus package, and we sent out these hundreds of dollars in \nchecks to all Americans. It was about $100 billion, a little over $100 \nbillion. We just sent out the checks, and that was supposed to help fix \nthe economy. In that economic slowdown, this September 30, when the \nfiscal year for 2008 budget was ended, the fiscal year, the debt was \n$455 billion--the deficit, for one year.\n  What is going to happen next year? Without counting the $700 billion \nas a loss to the Government, experts are now telling us the deficit \nwill exceed $455 billion. It will exceed $1,000 billion--$1 trillion. \nBut we have to pass another $34 billion or $15 billion, or whatever the \nnumber is, right now because we have to act. We cannot ask too many \nquestions, we cannot have too much debate because things might happen \nfast, and if we do not act you will be blamed for a company failing. I \nwish to say that somewhere along the line this Senate is the body that \nis supposed to ask the questions and slow this train down and actually \ngo through the details and figure out what to do.\n  But I know my good friend Senator Reid, who has the toughest job in \nWashington--they have all been meeting with the Banking Committee and \nthe automobile industry and the White House and special interests and \nlabor unions--all through the weekend, they say. They didn't invite me. \nThey didn't invite a lot of other Members of this Senate. So today they \nplopped down a bill that is supposed to move forward with a temporary \nfix of $15 billion, and we are supposed to say thanks for saving us so \nmuch. One of our Members has said we have to do something in a hurry; \nwe have 48 to 72 hours. Why 48 to 72 hours? We have plenty of time, if \nwe want to, to work at this thing.\n  I know you have heard this statement, that bankruptcy is not a good \nway for the companies to go. Most people, when they think of \nbankruptcy, think of chapter 7 in bankruptcy, which is a liquidation of \na company and its assets. All the people to whom that company owes \nmoney come in and line up, and the bankruptcy judge sells all the \nassets and parcels out what money is left--usually not very much--to \nthose claimants.\n  But there is another very common bankruptcy procedure called chapter \n11; it is called reorganization in chapter 11. You have heard the \nphrase ``They sought protection in bankruptcy.'' If you file for \nbankruptcy under chapter 11, your company continues to operate. Delta \nAirlines--I flew them yesterday--Delta Airlines in 2005 was in \nbankruptcy for over a year. They came out of bankruptcy leaner, having \nconfronted many of their difficulties. They actually bought Northwest \nAirlines. They are doing very well today. They didn't disappear. They \ndidn't lay off all their workers. They\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\ndidn't shut the airline down, they continued to operate. The automobile \ncompanies, if they seek reorganization and protection under chapter 11, \nwill then be in a position to confront their excessive legacy costs to \ndeal with contracts that are pulling them down.\n  I think it was Mitt Romney whose father, in Michigan, was active in \nthe automobile industry. He wrote an op-ed, and he calculated--others \nhave used a similar figure, but I remember his--that an average \nAmerican automobile is carrying a $2,000 legacy cost, the cost that is \na burden on them and keeps them from being competitive in the \nmarketplace. How do you get out of that? They say we will meet and we \nwill talk about it and we will appoint a czar and that czar will make \nthese companies concede these contractual provisions. But contracts are \nnot something you have to concede. A contract is a binding document \nagainst the company or against an individual. An individual doesn't \nhave to concede that contract, and many of them may not. Many of them \nwill say: You guys can concede. You can cut your salaries, unions, but \nI am not cutting my health care benefits because I retired 10 years \nago, and I still expect a health care benefit that exceeds 95 percent \nof the American workers' health care benefits today; I want mine kept. \nWho is going to make them give that up? It cannot be done voluntarily. \nWhat about a dealer and other groups, leaseholders who have claims \nagainst these companies? Why should they give up?\n  But in bankruptcy, the whole purpose is to create an environment in \nwhich a judge can make some decisions about what it is going to take to \nsave the company, to save the jobs. The judge has the power to amend \nthese contracts and to say: The only way this company is going to \nsurvive is you health care guys are going to have to give some; you \nsalaried people are going to have to give some; you executives are \ngoing to have to give some; the dealers are going to have to give some. \nOtherwise, this company is going under. They have witnesses, they take \ntestimony, and they all have the right to have their lawyer there and \nto present evidence. It is under oath, in detail, subject to cross-\nexamination. Certified financial statements have to be produced. All of \nthese things happen in bankruptcy. At the end, a bankruptcy judge, \nafter hearing all of these arguments, will have as his or her goal the \ncreation of a bankruptcy order that will allow the company to operate \nand to keep operating, keep making cars. They will not have to stop \nmaking cars during this whole process. They will continue. But if \npeople cannot make claims against them, they can't file lawsuits. All \nthe lawsuits against the companies, if they can't pay their debts, are \nstayed. It all stops. Nobody can levy against any of the property until \nthe bankruptcy judge says so. I am amazed we are not going in that \ndirection. For some reason, it seems that certain interests are \nobjecting to the normal course of how a company should go about dealing \nwith financial problems.\n\n  I also believe a responsible Senate should be taken aback about the \nway this has all come about. First, $25 billion was slipped in to help \nthese companies move to more fuel-efficient automobiles--that program. \nBut the automobile executives came back a couple of weeks ago, about 2 \nweeks ago, and they asked for $25 billion on top of that--$25 billion \nmore. They say: Just take it out of the $700 billion. We are not able \nto access this $25 billion you have already set aside for us. We have \nto do certain things on environmental issues, and we are not able to \naccess that now. So if we want to do that--and we need $25 billion. \nThey flew in in their big jets. They didn't have any kind of coherent \nplan. Congress and the American people were aghast. They couldn't \nimagine this $25 billion.\n  My State of Alabama is about an average size State--4 million people; \nwe have 7 Congressmen. As I recall, our basic budget for the State is \n$6 billion or so a year, and that includes education and everything \nelse a State needs. So I would say to you, $25 billion or $34 billion \nis a lot of money.\n  These executives go home chastened, and their advisers whispered in \ntheir ears: You guys have to be humble. Don't you understand? You were \ntoo arrogant. You have to go up there--you can't fly. You have to drive \nup in your fuel-efficient automobile before you go back to Congress, \nand grovel a little bit, tell them you did something wrong. If you tell \nthem you did something wrong and grovel and act humble, maybe you can \nget the money.\n  So what did they do? They came back and they groveled and they say \nthey made mistakes and they are so sorry. They want $34 billion. How \nhumble is that?\n  What the problem is--President-elect Obama said it: We want to make \nsure the money we are putting into this company is worth something. It \nis not supposed to be a gift, it is supposed to be a loan.\n  Once you start putting money in a sinking company, as any banker will \ntell you--they refer to it as putting good money after bad--the more \nmoney you put into a corporation, the deeper they have you. You are the \none who is hooked. You are the one who is stuck now because you are in \n$25, $34, $50, $100. What about if we just have another $50 after this \n$100, and maybe we will make it. If you don't help us with another $50, \nyou are going to lose the hundred--right? That is how these things go. \nThat is the way bankers look at this situation, and they will not loan \nthem the money. Bankers are not going to loan them the money because \nthey are too worried about it. The numbers don't add up. Since the \nbankers will not loan them the money, they want to come to us and get \nus to loan them the money and take risks a reasonable banker would not \ntake.\n  Somebody says: Maybe it will not be a lot more than that; maybe this \nwill be enough. It is pretty clear that nobody says the $15 billion \nwould be enough, what we are apparently going to be asked to look at \nwith the bill that was just plopped down a little while ago. But at the \nBanking hearing last week, an independent analyst predicted that it \nwould be $75 billion to $125 billion to avoid them going into \nbankruptcy.\n  So if they are going to go into bankruptcy, how much money do we need \nto help them avoid that? Well, this analyst said it would be $75 to \n$125 billion. That is a lot of money. Maybe they should go into \nbankruptcy first, and then maybe we could see what the real facts are \nand have a judge and a hearing and evidence taken and decisions made. \nMaybe tough decisions could be made and maybe the Government can help a \nlittle bit and help them come out of there and keep these companies \ngoing at a reasonable price.\n  So I would certainly like the competition. We certainly want these \ncompanies to be successful. But it has to be done consistent with the \nvalue and principles of America.\n  There is no reason for us not to assume that we are going to be asked \nfor more and more money to keep these companies alive under the \ncircumstances we are in today.\n  I would ask a couple questions then. First, what certainty do we have \nthat they will not be asking for many times the amount of money that is \nbeing asked for today? I think we are virtually certain. We know there \nis more. Within the bill, I would note, is a statement that we are \nauthorizing--it is not putting up the money yet, it is a big step \ntoward it--we are authorizing the full replenishment of the $25 billion \nfuel efficiency loan program.\n  So the $15 billion that comes out, we are authorizing it, to put in \nmore. The way the language is written, it is pretty clear that it goes \nfurther than that. What it does is it authorizes, on page 3, excuse me \non page 11, the Secretary of Treasury--``is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary of Treasury sums as being necessary for \nthe purpose of replenishing the funds available to the President's \ndesignee under this section.''\n  So first of all it says: Yes, we take the $15 billion out of the \nexisting loan program, but we are putting it back in immediately. The \n$700 billion is not reduced, neither is the $25 billion we have already \nappropriated. Both of those have already been authorized and \nappropriated. We take this money out and we put every penny of it back \nin this same bill. A little slight of hand there; is it not? Sounds \nlike it to me.\n  Then it goes on to have other language that indicates, the way it is \nwritten, it authorizes up to another $25 billion. So authorized in this \nbill, I think it is fair to say, based on our reading of it a few \nmoments ago, since it just now appeared, that we are talking about \n$49.5 billion being authorized\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nfor this problem. That is a lot of money.\n  It is somewhat different than the pitch that all we are doing is \nputting up $25 billion or $15 billion. And they are at least honest \nabout this. They say the $15 billion is just a bridge loan, and that at \nleast by March they will be back asking for more. How much more, $75, \n$125 billion, without once having to submit themselves to the rigors of \na reorganization process that current law provides for big corporations \nand little ones in America under chapter 11.\n  Now, the legislation calls for the appointment of a car czar. That is \nwhat they are calling it. It says this about the car czar. The guy is \nsupposed to be able to meet with these executives, many of whom have \nspent their lives in the automobile industry, and it is going to tell \nthem that: This is not a good idea. This is a good idea. Yes, you can \ndo that. No, you cannot do that. We will not give you money unless you \ndo such and so and tell them how to run their business.\n  This is what it says on page 3, section 3:\n\n       The President will designate one or more officers of the \n     Executive Branch, [a Federal Government bureaucrat] having \n     appropriate expertise in such areas as economic \n     stabilization, financial aid to commerce and industry, \n     financial restructuring, energy efficiency, and environmental \n     protection, to carry out the purposes of this Act, including \n     the facilitation of restructuring to achieve long-term \n     financial viability of the domestic automobile manufacturing \n     industry, and who shall serve at the pleasure of the \n     President.\n\n  Which means the new President will remove the one President Bush puts \nin, I presume, and put another one, or certainly have the authority to \ndo so.\n\n       This designee shall direct the disbursement of the bridge \n     loans or enter into commitments for lines of credit for each \n     automobile manufacturer that has submitted a request.\n\n  Well, does it say anything about the person that is going to tell \nthese companies, you know, we are going to tell them how to do this \nright? What would you tell them? Would you tell them: We are never \ngoing to make anymore big pickups, cancel all SUVs, put all your money \ninto hybrid cars. We do not know how well they are going to sell and \nhow people are going to continue to buy them, but you can only use the \nmoney for these kinds of things.\n  That is a dangerous action for a politician to do. It is odd to me \nthat the provisions of the act call for expertise in financial aid to \ncommerce and industry, environmental protection and energy efficiency \nand not one requirement that the person knows anything about the \nautomobile industry. I know I do not know much about it. I do know \nthis. My father ran an International Harvester, a little town \ndealership, hardly made a living for us. I worked in his shop. I was a \nparts person in his office. He only had four or five employees. They \nsqueezed him out because he was too small, lucky to get out with his \nshirt.\n  I was in high school. I remember that vividly. Well, certain things \nare not financially doable. He was not able to continue to operate an \nInternational Harvester truck and tractor dealership when he could only \nsell to so few customers, that he could not maintain the parts and the \nmechanics and the equipment necessary to maintain a viable business.\n  Things change. He did not ask for a bailout. So the person who is \nsupposed to be working on this is not required to have any knowledge \nwhatsoever of the automobile business but is going to tell them how to \nrun it, apparently. It looks like, does it not, that this would give \nanother unelected official the ``maximum flexibility'' to appropriate \ntaxpayers' money as they see fit.\n  Is this not the same mistake we made with the Secretary of the \nTreasury when we gave him $700 billion to parcel it out to his friends \non Wall Street, however he felt like giving it.\n  Now, the jobs bank, which is a very perverse problem the automobile \nindustry has. It was an agreement they made that would pay employees up \nto 95 percent of their pay not to work. If they have been laid off, \nthey get 95 percent of their pay. It defers health insurance payments. \nUnions have said they would make concessions. That has been touted \nabout. But they were only temporary concessions that the union has made \non this. I am not sure what power a union has to tell a company that \nyou no longer have to pay an employee who agreed by contract to pay him \n95 percent of his salary. How can they abrogate that contract? You can \ndo it in bankruptcy. You cannot do it by voluntary agreement.\n  So I have my doubts about how this can be fixed short of a \nbankruptcy. So I would ask: How can we reach an agreement that would \nbind the union or any other group that has contracts with the \nautomobile industry to follow those agreements?\n  I ask this question, even supporters of the deal admit that a \nbankruptcy may still be needed in the end. So does not this \nmultibillion dollar bailout just delay actual productive restructuring? \nIs it not just a delay? I am afraid it is. It absolutely is unless we \nput more than $15 billion in, because with $15 billion, everybody knows \nthat is not going to be enough to keep them liquid throughout the next \nyear. It is pretty well conceded. So are not we delaying the \ninevitable?\n  I would also add, experts agree that to be successful, everyone makes \nconcessions, must make concessions. So what concrete steps does this \nlegislation require of creditors, suppliers, unions or automobile \ndealers? It does not require any. I will answer that.\n\n  Also, the legislation calls for the development of a long-term \nstructuring plan by the end of March. Doing so would require that \nvarious groups agree. Why do we think they will be able to accomplish \nthis 3 months from now, when they have not been able to accomplish it \nin the last 3 months? How can these parties be forced to agree when \nthey hold valid contracts for the automobile companies?\n  Now, as I indicated earlier, we are taking a big risk without \nensuring that reform is going to occur that would make these companies \nviable. Everyone knows major restructuring needs to be done, that they \nneed to emerge from this process, as I say, as Delta did from \nbankruptcy, chapter 11 reorganization, leaner, more competitive, \nkeeping their employees, giving them a future, providing for their \nretirement and health care as they committed to do but to be able to \nshed unnecessary costs that had the danger of sinking the entire ship.\n  So we know that a banker today would not make a loan to these \ncompanies under these conditions of vague promises of improvement in \nthe future. You think they are not telling their bankers: Oh, we are \ngoing to make progress, if you just loan us money. Companies know more \nthan that. They want some assurance. We represent the taxpayers of \nAmerica. Should we not be more concerned about the assurances too?\n  So we do have a regular order--I will conclude with this remark--a \nregular order in America. If a company gets to the point where they \ncannot meet their payroll, and they cannot pay all their debts, because \nthey have a liquidity, a financial cash flow problem, the procedure is \nperfectly simply, you seek reorganization, you seek protection under \nchapter 11 in bankruptcy.\n  The company continues to operate, the employees continue to be paid, \nand, in fact, one of the highest, I believe the highest, priority of a \nbankruptcy judge is to see that the employees are paid. That is the \nfirst thing that comes with the limited money in a company that is in \nfinancial problems, is to pay the workers for their work, and \nthroughout that process the company can be reorganized. Witnesses are \nunder oath, can testify to the real facts that we in Congress have no \ncapability of ascertaining, and they will be able to present evidence \nthat sheds light on some of these matters. The unions would have their \nlawyers, the dealers would have their lawyers, the suppliers would have \ntheir lawyers and argue a case and a judge is going to have to say: Mr. \nSupplier, you are going to have to take 75 percent of what they owe; \nthey cannot pay you the whole amount. We have to keep this country \ngoing. Mr. Union, you are going to have to accept less. Mr. Dealer, you \nare going to have to accept less. Then we will try to pay this back \nonce we pare this company down and get it leaner and more efficient and \nmore competitive and we are going to send it out there and we believe \nwe can make this work.\n  But if you liquidate the company today, you are not going to get half \nof what you are owed. You are not going to get a fraction of what you \nare owed.\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\nThat is not the right thing. The whole motivation for a reorganization \nof procedure under chapter 11 would be to save the company, to save the \njobs and save the industry. This Senate has no business trying to act \nas some sort of super bankruptcy judge in a reorganization. Our action \nin sending out money enables the continuation of bad behavior. It \npretty closely approximates that psychological syndrome called enabler \nwhere the person who is drinking too heavily, instead of confronting \nthe problem, the person's problem, you give them more money which \nallows them to continue to drink and they don't confront their problem \nand the problem continues to get worse.\n  It is time to confront the problem. Let's save this industry, and \nlet's do so within the legal procedures the Nation has. And at some \npoint if we can help them financially, let's do so. But we need to be \nsure, on behalf of the taxpayers, that we know exactly what the \ncircumstance is, that a full examination of these companies has been \nundertaken. The idea of giving them billions of dollars based on a very \npoor statement of need is not acceptable to the people of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was in error earlier in saying that \nthere was a $15 billion line item in this legislation that we saw. In \nlooking at it with my staff, basically this legislation, if it were to \npass, would authorize the expenditure of $25 billion--really $24.5 \nbillion--to the car companies. It also at the same time states that \neven though that money is coming out of the energy efficiency $25 \nbillion, it also says that $25 billion will be available for \nexpenditure in addition. So that is how I would say that as we read the \nlegislation, it is an authorization of over $49 billion, in reality, to \nthe automobile companies. It would take an additional appropriation for \n$25 billion, but that would be a single step instead of the normal \nlegislative process. It enhances the ability for that to be expended. I \nthink that is a correct statement. There is no reference, as has been \ndiscussed in the papers, about $15 billion. But it authorizes the full \n25.\n  It says: There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \nEnergy sums as may be necessary for the purpose of replenishing the \nfunds made available to the President's designee under this section. It \nalso says: No provision shall be construed to prohibit or limit the \nSecretary of Energy from processing applications for loans under the \nsection. That is the existing $25 billion. So they still will get the \nloans under the $25 billion plus the other. I think in all fairness, \nthe way we read this is a $49 billion authorization, not 25, and \ncertainly not 15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10799-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise to talk about our foreign policy. \nBefore doing so, I wish to point out that I have spent the last 2 hours \npresiding and listening to a number of very strong statements with \nrespect to the automobile bailout and also the proposal that there be \nsome action to limit the next tranche of $300 billion to come on the \nTARP program. I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on those issues. We had a pretty hard vote on October 1 \nwith respect to the TARP program. I was among the overwhelming majority \nof people in the Senate who voted to go ahead with this program, after \nthe assurances of this administration and the people who had been \nnegotiating on our behalf about the danger that the world economy was \nin, the prospect of a cataclysmic effect if we did not do something.\n  I am going to look very hard at this next tranche. We should all \nrecall that the program that was voted to go forward was a program that \nwas going to address the situation of toxic assets. The concern that I \nand many others had about giving one individual the authority in the \nexecutive branch to use these funds in a way that did not have a \nsubstantial oversight was borne out over what has happened. There is a \nvery high bar that will go forward before I personally would vote in \nfavor of continuing to allow the Secretary of the Treasury in an \noutgoing administration to be dispensing these types of funds so close \nto the approach of a new administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10799-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY BAILOUT\n\n  Mr. WEBB.

I am favorably \ndisposed to supporting this loan provision, which is what it is, if the \nright requirements are placed in the proposal. I should point out, for \nall of the information that has gone back and forth over the past 2 \nhours, the irony that Senator Dorgan mentioned, that the chief of \nMerrill Lynch is today arguing for a $10 million bonus for a company \nthat had a loss of almost $12 billion last year. That is a private \ncompany. I won't pass any commercial judgment on that. But it does \nstand in stark contrast to what the CEO of Ford has proposed, going to \n$1 a year, if we can inject some cashflow into their business to \nattempt to get them through this period and back into a situation where \nthey can properly manage their future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10799-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10799-S10800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FOREIGN POLICY DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to discuss another issue I have had a \ngreat deal of concern about for many years, particularly since the time \nI came to the Senate. That is the role of the legislative branch in the \ndevelopment of foreign policy and the abrogation of the legislative \nbranch during this past administration when it comes to foreign policy. \nOver the past nearly 8 years, the executive branch has been a runaway \ntrain. Unfortunately, this isn't simply the Bush administration. It \nalso is the policies that have come out of the Department of Defense \nand the Department of State. We have observed over the past year the \nnegotiation of a future relationship with Iraq that has gotten almost \nno attention in the Congress. This is not simply a SOFA, status of \nforces agreement, as we have seen in dozens of other countries around \nthe world which are implemented pursuant to our legal authority to be \nin those countries. This also is a strategic framework agreement, a \ndocument which defines our future relationship with Iraq, which in Iraq \nhad to be approved by their Cabinet, by their Parliament, and now will \nbe subject to a plebiscite and which, in the United States, simply has \nbeen approved by the signature of one individual out of the Department \nof State.\n  I was among many who began expressing my concern about this a little \nmore than a year ago. I believe it is stark evidence of how the \nlegislative branch, the Congress, has abrogated its constitutional \nresponsibilities in the area of the evocation of foreign policy.\n  I am going to put a map up in the Chamber. It is a very busy map, but \nI want to take time to explain something else. I think it is very \nimportant for my fellow Senators and people over in the other House of \nthe Congress to understand the implications of what has been going on \nin Afghanistan.\n  We have heard throughout the Presidential campaign that we should be \nfocusing our energy away from Iraq and into Afghanistan. We have been \nhaving these types of discussions without the articulation of a clear \nstrategy. We are moving to the point where we are soon going to have at \nleast 60,000 American troops in Afghanistan.\n  When I was there as a journalist in 2004, we had about 10,000 \nAmerican troops in Afghanistan. It is going to be very important, as \nthe new administration comes in, to impress upon not only the \nadministration but individuals in the State Department and the \nDepartment of Defense that they must come forward with a strategy that \nwill\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nenable us to know when the end comes. You do not have a strategy if you \ncannot articulate the end point.\n  We have another very serious problem with respect to our presence in \nAfghanistan, and that is all of the logistical lines into Afghanistan \nare in areas that could cause the United States great concern.\n  This--I am going to draw a circle around it on this busy map--is \nAfghanistan right here. Afghanistan is a land-locked country, as \neveryone in this Congress surely knows. The supply routes into \nAfghanistan are principally through Pakistan: from Karachi up into \nPeshawar, through the famed Khyber Pass, which caused the British such \nproblems and difficulties more than 100 years ago, in through the \nmountainous areas of the federally administered tribal regions and the \nNorthwest Frontier Province very lawless areas where al-Qaida and the \nTaliban operate heavily. So 80 percent of the supplies that go into \nAfghanistan go via land through Pakistan.\n  To the north, Uzbekistan has indicated it probably will not allow \nalternate supply routes if problems occur in Pakistan. Iran, obviously, \nis not going to allow supply routes to go in to supply our troops in \nAfghanistan, which leaves Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan is very close to \nRussia, which we have been in very difficult relationships with, \nparticularly since the incidents in Georgia last summer.\n  So what does this mean? There is an old saying--Frederick the Great, \nsupposedly, was the first to say it--and that is: Without supplies, no \narmy is brave.\n  If you look at this route in Pakistan, over the past 6 months this is \nwhat has happened:\n  In March, there were attacks in the Khyber region that set fire to 40 \nto 50 oil tankers. These are convoys that are not protected by the \nAmerican military because the American military does not operate in \ncombat areas in Pakistan. So in March: 40 to 50 oil tankers.\n  In April, Taliban raiders stole military helicopter engines valued at \n$13 million.\n  In November, 12 vehicles were hijacked near the Khyber Pass. Two \nhumvees were included in the hijackings.\n  Last week, 22 more vehicles were destroyed at a truck stop between \nPeshawar and the Khyber Pass.\n  Yesterday, 145 vehicles, trailers, and containers were destroyed in a \nwarehouse just outside of Peshawar.\n  Today, there was a separate attack at a shipping terminal near \nPeshawar which destroyed 50 trucks carrying containers.\n  This is millions and millions of dollars worth of equipment in an \narea where we in our present policy cannot provide military security. \nWe have Pakistani security forces, we have Pakistani truck drivers, and \nwe are in a very delicate relationship with Pakistan itself.\n  I am hoping that in this type of situation, where 80 percent of our \ncargo is coming in through Pakistan, and where our ability to resupply \nour military from other areas depends on our relationship with Russia, \nthat our new administration and the leadership in the State Department \nand the Department of Defense will take a very hard look at how many \nmilitary people we want to have in Afghanistan, what it is we want them \nto do, how we are going to resupply them, how we are going to conduct \nour relationships inside Pakistan, what our alternatives might be if \nthose convoys continue to be interrupted, and, finally, how we will \nknow when we have concluded our strategic purpose in this part of the \nworld.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10800-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10800-S10801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              ted stevens\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise once again to honor a \ndistinguished colleague and the longest serving Republican in the \nhistory of this body, Senator Ted Stevens.\n  I said it this morning. I will say it again: In the history of this \nNation, no one man has done more for one State than Ted Stevens--no \none. His commitment to the people of Alaska has been as constant as the \nNorthern Star. And the list of things he has done on their behalf in a \nremarkable 40-year career is as vast as the State itself.\n  Today we remember that legendary service, and the man who achieved \nit.\n  Born in Indianapolis 85 years ago this week, Ted Stevens made his \nmark early. At 19, he was flying C-46 transport planes over the \nHimalayas in support of the legendary Flying Tigers. His appetite for \nadventure took him to Oregon and Montana for college, and then to even \nmore exotic places as a pilot in the Army Air Corps. For his bravery, \nTed would receive a Distinguished Flying Cross and an Air Medal. It was \nthe first of many, many honors.\n  A decorated war veteran by his early-twenties, Ted returned to \nCalifornia to resume his studies, and later enrolled at Harvard Law \nSchool. After law school, Ted came to Washington, married a girl named \nAnn, and then set out on a new adventure in the vast expanse of the \nAlaska territory.\n  He would go on to devote the rest of his life to helping the people \nof Alaska achieve the same rights and privileges that those in the \nlower 48 took for granted. And today, the name Ted Stevens is \nsynonymous with the State he loves. It always will be.\n  Who else can say that they helped draw the borders of the State in \nwhich they live? Well, Ted can. As Senator Murkowski put it: ``for \nforty years, Ted Stevens has been Alaska.'' He was there at the \ncreation. And an entire generation of Alaskans have grown up not ever \nknowing the Senate without him.\n  Ted will tell you he works so hard because there is so much work to \ndo. Alaskans don't have the benefit of centuries of infrastructure and \nplanning that much of the rest of the country does. Of the giant \nState's more than 200 villages, only a handful had running water when \nTed came to the Senate. Thanks largely to him, roughly half of them do \nnow.\n  No one has done more for the U.S. Armed Forces than Ted Stevens. He \nsecured funds for the F-117, to replace Air Force One, for unmanned \naerial vehicles like the Predator and Global Hawk, and for a \nreplacement Coast Guard icebreaker and the F-16 program. Ted was \ninstrumental in ensuring funds for early military research on \neverything from breast cancer to AIDS.\n  Ted Stevens once said:\n\n       They sent me here to stand up for the state of Alaska.\n\n  For 40 years, he fulfilled that charge with passion and purpose. And \nthe Senate will never forget Ted Stevens.\n\n\n                              GORDON SMITH\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to honor my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.\n  I have worked with Gordon since coming over to the Senate in 1998. It \nhas been an honor and privilege to serve on both the Senate Finance \nCommittee and Energy and Natural Resources Committee with him. Gordon \nhas a long list of accomplishments to show for the people of Oregon and \nthe Nation. He has served the people of Oregon well, and I know they \nare proud to call him one of their own. His leadership in the Senate \nwill be missed, and it has truly been an honor serving with him.\n  I thank Gordon for all of his contributions to the U.S. Senate, and I \nwish him and his family the best of luck in their future endeavors.\n\n\n                             ELIZABETH DOLE\n\n  Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Elizabeth Dole, who will be retiring from the \nSenate at the conclusion of the 110th Congress.\n  I have worked with Senator Dole since she was elected to serve the \npeople of North Carolina in 2002. I have also had the privilege of \nserving on the Senate Banking Committee with Senator Dole. She has \ndedicated her adult life to serve her country proudly. Senator Dole has \nhad the distinct honor to serve in several capacities such as Deputy \nAssistant to the Nixon administration for Consumer Affairs, as a member \nof the Federal Trade Commission, Secretary of Transportation under \nPresident Reagan, and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. \nBush. Her heart and character can also be summed up by her work as the \nPresident of the American Red Cross and the impact she has had, on not \nonly the lives of Americans, but also those abroad. A person of that \ncaliber will be missed in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\n  I am honored to know her and to have worked with her. I would like to \nthank Senator Dole for her contributions to the Senate and to the \ncountry we both love. I wish her and her family the best in all of \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n\n                             JOHN E. SUNUNU\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to join my fellow Senators to \nhonor a colleague and a friend, Senator John E. Sununu, who is \ndeparting the Senate at the close of this Congress. I have enjoyed \nworking with Senator Sununu over the years--first in the House of \nRepresentatives and later in the Senate.\n  While in the Senate, I have had the great fortune of serving with \nJohn on the Senate Finance Committee. He is a revered advocate of \nfiscal discipline, personal responsibility, and free markets. The two \nof us have stood together on numerous issues--most notably tax--and I \nhave always believed that we could accomplish any goal because I had \nhis voice of conviction and intellect by my side.\n  Representing New Hampshire, Senator Sununu has proven to all Granite \nStaters that he will fight for the simple motto that reads on their \nState license plate: Live Free or Die. Whether the item of the day was \nsocial security, trade, or any other topical issue, including the \noriginal intent of the Constitution, Senator Sununu has proven that he \nis up for any debate.\n  The U.S. Senate will not be the same without Senator John Sununu. In \na time when many politicians try to increase the role of government in \nAmerican life, Senator John Sununu has always bet on the American \npeople rather than government. I will miss John Sununu.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, four of our most valuable Senators will \nnot return next year and we will miss them.\n\n\n                             elizabeth dole\n\n  Elizabeth Dole began her career in public service at about the same \ntime I did. We were both in the Nixon White House in 1969, and since \nthen I have enjoyed following and watching and occasionally bumping \ninto her remarkable career. She began that career at a time when women, \neven if they graduated from Harvard Law School as she did, had very few \noptions. Elizabeth made her options--in the Cabinet, heading the \nAmerican Red Cross and pioneering in a Presidential race in 1999. I \nhave thoroughly enjoyed working with her, as well as knowing even \nbetter Bob Dole during these last 6 years. She truly is one of \nAmerica's most admired women.\n\n\n                              gordon smith\n\n  Gordon Smith is the most eloquent among us Senators. Every Republican \nSenator would say that, and any Democrat who had heard him would agree. \nHe has a quiet way, an intelligence and a way of speaking that commands \nattention and respect. He has his feet firmly planted on the ground in \nPendleton, OR. He understands the private sector. He has been \ncourageous in his willingness to support and chide and criticize his \nparty when needed. He will be sorely missed.\n\n\n                              john sununu\n\n  I met John Sununu when he was a college student and his father and I \nwere Governors of our respective States. He arrives and leaves as the \nyoungest member of the Senate. But, in our caucus, his voice is one of \nthe voices most carefully listened to. His intelligence, his \nphilosophical integrity and his persistence have made him a most \nvaluable player in our Republican Conference. He has a bright career \nahead of him.\n\n\n                              ted stevens\n\n  I have often thought that I should write a book called ``some things \nyou don't know about the people I work with.'' Someday I will. And I \nwill start with Ted Stevens, who flew the first cargo plane into \nPeking, as it was then called, at the end of World War II. This was a \ndangerous, bold mission. It helps to explain the life of this \nremarkable man who helped Alaska become a State and then has defended \nand supported it in the Senate for 40 years. With the departures of Ted \nStevens and two other Senators of whom I have already spoken--Pete \nDomenici and John Warner--the Senate loses more than 100 years of \nservice. More than that, this country loses three men whose view of \nAmerica was rooted in the last years of World War II and the remarkable \nascendancy of our country since then. Looking around the Senate, it \nwill be difficult to find many among those of us who remain with the \nbreadth of vision and old-fashioned patriotism that these men have \ncontributed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10801-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Captain Robert Yllescas\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Captain Yllescas, a native \nGuatemalan and graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died on \nDecember 1 from injuries he sustained from an improvised explosive \ndevice in the mountains of Afghanistan on October 28. He was 31 years \nold.\n  After spending the first 18 years of his life in Guatemala, Captain \nYllescas moved to Nebraska, where he enrolled in the University of \nNebraska-Lincoln and joined the ROTC. He married his wife Dena in her \nhometown of Osceola, NE. A graduate of Army Ranger school, Captain \nYllescas' service included two tours of duty in Iraq and one in \nAfghanistan, where he proved to be an exemplary leader. As the \ncommander of B Troop, 6-4 Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry \nDivision, he led 90 U.S. and 200 Afghan soldiers in Nuristan province. \nHe was awarded the Purple Heart by President Bush on November 10.\n  All of Nebraska is proud of Captain Yllescas' service to our country, \nas well as the thousands of brave men and women serving in the U.S. \nArmed Forces.\n  Captain Yllescas is remembered as a devoted husband, father, and son. \nIn addition to his wife Dena, he is survived by his daughters, Julia, \n7, and Eva, 10 months; and parents Otto and Barb.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. \nArmy CPT Robert Yllescas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10801-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    67TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEARL HARBOR\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \nservice Linda Le provided to the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship over the past 4 years. Linda is a dedicated individual \nwhose penchant for critical insights and creative solutions will be \nsorely missed.\n  Linda first joined the Senate Small Business Committee staff in 2004 \nas a staff assistant. She had previously gained invaluable experience \non financial matters during her career at Fidelity Investments. Through \nhard work and determination here in the Senate, Linda rose through the \nranks, first as a research analyst and finally as a professional staff \nmember. Over the years,\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\nI have come to rely on her knowledge and expertise in the areas of \nsmall business lending, banking, and women's business issues. She is a \nthoughtful member of the Committee's staff who could be relied upon for \nher ideas on how to strengthen legislation to benefit our Nation's \nsmall business owners. Just this year, Linda played a pivotal role in \nhelping me develop legislation to alleviate the small business credit \ncrunch and provide oversight over small business lenders. When Congress \nreconvenes next year, I will push to see that the Small Business \nLending Oversight and Program Performance Improvement Act and the 10 \nSteps for a Main Street Economic Recovery Act are enacted into law.\n  The consummate professional, Linda was always well prepared for \ncommittee hearings, markups and roundtables. She consistently provided \nme with detailed materials that clearly explained complex situations \nand offered proactive and comprehensive solutions to problems regarding \nsmall business lending, access to credit, and women's business \nconcerns. Linda's ability to build and maintain relationships with \nconstituents, issue experts, and staff from other Members' offices has \nserved me and the committee well. In all her years on the Small \nBusiness Committee, Linda has been a passionate advocate for small \nbusinesses and their owners. Her eagerness to make a difference in \npeople's lives is nothing short of commendable.\n  After her tenure here in Washington, Linda is leaving the Senate to \npursue a cause dear to her heart. Soon, she will be heading to Iraq to \nwork as a business development specialist with one of the State \nDepartment's provincial reconstruction teams, or PRTs. PRTs are vital \nto our mission in Iraq, as they are made up of experts who advise the \nU.S. military and local Iraqi government on a wide array of issues, \nincluding economic and business development. Linda's work with the PRT \nwill continue her pursuit of serving others, and will help win the \nhearts and minds of Iraqis in need of this vital aid.\n  Linda Le is a person of remarkable strength and selflessness. And to \nmake her story all the more compelling, her husband Hung, a \ncommunications officer in the U.S. Army National Guard, recently \ndeployed to Afghanistan to serve our country in the war on terror. \nClearly, the word ``service'' has a profound meaning in Linda's \nhousehold.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for listening to us. Please increase domestic oil \n     production now. If it takes 10 years before we see the oil, \n     then do it for the children. Also, please expand nuclear \n     energy research and production.\n     Virginia, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       The price of gasoline has impacted our family budget. How \n     much? I do not know, the price of gasoline continues to rise \n     so quickly it is hard to see the whole impact. A few of the \n     things we need to do are the following: More R dollars \n     spent by the government for alternate energy sources; More \n     nuclear plants are need across the nation; More plants to \n     process the oil into gasoline are needed; More taxes on the \n     oil companies, too.\n     Kevin, Rupert.\n                                  ____\n\n       Yes, we would like to see us drilling for fuel in our own \n     country, exploring all options of new sources and \n     conservation. It is hypocritical to not drill for our own \n     fuel because of the environment and then buy from other (not \n     so friendly!!) countries. We are a small business. We are \n     working on a lower profit margin due to the high prices. We \n     are trying to keep from raising our prices for as long as we \n     can. We are taking steps to minimize our driving. That only \n     goes so far. We support your idea Senator Crapo. Thank you \n     for not signing on to that energy/environment bill.\n     Sandra.\n                                  ____\n\n       What a bunch of nonsense this is when America supports the \n     Middle East so they can build indoor ski areas, palm tree \n     islands out of sand for the mega-wealthy in the ocean and cut \n     off the heads of Christians and Americans on television while \n     we have enough gas and oil for all of America and more right \n     under our noses.\n       What are you, our representatives, thinking? You are all \n     out of control--you speak but you do not act, you type great \n     things, ask for money to support your habit of power seeking \n     at the top, being in the limelight, etc. and you continue to \n     let American go further down in the eyes of the world--not to \n     mention being abhorred by American citizens.\n       There is no respect for the office of the President, whom \n     the press refer to as ``Mr. Bush or just Bush'' not President \n     Bush.\n       You want our story--we are older American citizens, 63 and \n     65 years of age. We were born in World War II. We lived \n     through Korea. We hid under our desks and against walls in \n     elementary school in fear of the bomb which now our \n     grandchildren have to fear. We lost our husbands, brothers \n     and friends for nothing in Vietnam for a corrupt President's \n     wife to continue to have her trucking companies pay huge \n     dividends into their Texas ranch and still cannot say for \n     sure just who killed President Kennedy. Desert Storm was a \n     joke--what did we accomplish there--in and out and did not \n     finish the job. 911 wasn't funny but we still cannot \n     decide how to handle the ``bad boys'' that blew up our \n     world that horrible day. We are being told that it is just \n     another day in the life of people elsewhere--are we \n     supposed to accept that and just move on?\n       And now ``The Changling'' wants to disarm Americans and \n     create a global government--look out for your job--it may be \n     gone sooner than you think. The Program People are winning. \n     We are now disrespected around the world.\n       Now we refuse to win in America for real tax-paying \n     Americans, with citizenship, that have earned the American \n     dream and are courting the illegal people in the country \n     while spitting in my face. My husband just turned 66 and 10 \n     months. Whoopee! He may now have a ``reduced'' amount of \n     Social Security because he needs it now--not 6 years from now \n     when it may not even be available. Here's the breakdown:\n       The Social Security he paid into for 48 years will give him \n     approximately $1650 dollars a month (Rent/Utilities/\n     Insurance/Gas/Food/Medical--probably not enough);\n       The Medicare system which he also paid into for years \n     charges him $93.10 a month to continue to be a part of that \n     system he should have earned by now and is broken at best;\n       A Medicare Supplement, which you have to have to get decent \n     medical care, costs $125+ a month added to the $93.10.\n       A Prescription Supplement runs another $25+ dollars added \n     to the $93.10 and the $125 and we still use $4.00 WalMart for \n     generics when possible;\n       And, we still have no dental, no vision, no disability, no \n     long term care and no respect as doctors continue to refuse \n     new patients on Medicare only.\n       And don't tell us that Socialized Medicine is any better--\n     have a brain tumor in Canada or France or Denmark and wait 6-\n     9 months for the MRI that has to be done in the coffin \n     because you, my friend, died of brain cancer that was \n     operable 6-9 months ago.\n       We have no debt other than our house and one small car \n     payment. We now have to plan one day a week for errands. We \n     calculate the difference between buying groceries at the \n     closer grocery store with the cost of gas versus the savings \n     we might get at the super WalMart. We chose a new doctor \n     closer to the house. We do not go to the dentist twice a year \n     for cleaning and preventative any more. We have not seen the \n     eye doctor in over a year and a half--the old glasses will \n     have to do for a while more.\n       And we still have a business in home and work 40+ hours a \n     week so the government can take back some of the Medicare \n     money they spent on doctor visits and tax 85 percent of the \n     Social Security we earned.\n       What a bunch of nonsense, Mr. Crapo! You people need to get \n     a grip and start acting\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\n     like you care as much about Americans as you do a bunch of \n     thieving, illegal criminals that are robbing us blind and \n     bringing down America. Go get our gas, throw out the \n     illegals, bring down our taxes, put the prisoners that \n     deserve it to work and use the death penalty for the rest of \n     them that cost this country billions of dollar feeding, \n     clothing, housing, educating and medicating when you let \n     small children go without all of the above and live on the \n     streets.\n       You, our government are killing our country--America is \n     coming to an end as we know it--will it be a better place \n     with the ``changlings'' taking over--I seriously doubt it--I \n     even seriously doubt that you will read this far because the \n     truth of the situation in America is something our \n     government, elected representatives of the people--do not \n     want to hear.\n       Want to talk--I'm all for it.\n     Marlee.\n                                  ____\n\n       This note is to urge you to vote to resolve the issue of \n     high fuel costs and the impact it is having on the economy. \n     Please consider off shore drilling, increasing the fuel \n     refining capacities as well as research on viable energy \n     resources. Perhaps legislators should study the impact of \n     legislation before implementation, such as the effects on the \n     economy regarding use of corn for alternative energy. Corn is \n     used in almost all food items as well as in animal feed . . . \n     There goes food costs through the trickle-down theory. \n     Question: do legislators have ``think tanks'' they can use \n     before passing legislation that effects us all in such a \n     massive way? And, why are we not using them?\n       We are semi-retired and live about twenty miles from Coeur \n     d'Alene, Idaho. Being on a mostly fixed income, high energy \n     costs have certainly caused us to decrease our shopping \n     trips, and to buy only those necessities. Monies we have \n     saved for retirement, we now have to spend.\n       Why is it that 14 percent of the population can prevent off \n     shore drilling? It appears that if the U.S. is not going to \n     use this energy, other countries will. I guess it is a case \n     of ``the squeeky wheel gets the grease;'' the rest of us are \n     too busy trying to make a living to lobby.\n       I understand that there has been an auto carbuerator \n     available for years that would increase mileage tremendously. \n     What has happened to this?\n       Incentives for conservation are great . . . And effective \n     as it has a favorable consequence for the pocketbook.\n       We are all for expanding nuclear energy . . . But only if \n     there is a way to rid the world of its byproduct.\n           Regards,\n     Doug and Stevanna, Athol.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate the fact that you are asking for personal \n     stories which helps connect voters to legislation that \n     affects them.\n       My husband and I are your typical American family. We are \n     both young, happy, own our home, have two dogs and two cats. \n     We are blessed to have this life. We live in Boise, Idaho, \n     where I work and my husband commutes to Mountain Home Air \n     Force Base every day. He spends two hours a day commuting, 40 \n     hours a month driving back and forth between Boise and \n     Mountain Home. This, combined with an 8-12 hour workday, \n     means he is home very little.\n       We have been together for three years and every year he has \n     deployed to Iraq. We have not complained about his frequent \n     visits or the minimal compensation that we receive for his \n     leave, because we both understand that it is necessary and \n     important for him to go. But what hurts our family the most \n     is that we are having difficulty affording the gasoline for \n     him to go to work when he's home. We have a fuel efficient \n     vehicle that we are paying the loan on monthly and the gas \n     for commuting is the equivalent of a second car payment a \n     month.\n       I am ashamed that our country is so reactive, that we were \n     not prepared to accommodate new forms of energy that could \n     have spared families and businesses from straining their \n     financial means because of gasoline. I am requesting as a \n     citizen, faithful voter and consumer that Congress take the \n     steps necessary to implement a cleaner, more efficient and \n     renewable form of energy to sustain our economy.\n     Kristin.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was very excited to receive your email and learn of the \n     chance to tell our story of struggle with the outrageous \n     gasoline prices. My husband and I live near the Hunt \n     Relocation Monument in Jerome County. I know you have visited \n     that site, so you are aware how far we are from the nearest \n     towns (about 20 miles).\n       My husband is a school teacher. We have five children at \n     home. I have gone back to school to get my teaching \n     certificate so I can contribute to our income, because we \n     cannot make ends meet on a school teacher's salary. With the \n     rising costs of gasoline, we are spending $700 to $800 a \n     month just on gasoline, which is a quarter of our take home \n     income every month! We still have a house payment, bills and \n     the rising cost of groceries to deal with on top of that. If \n     things keep going like this, we will lose our home. We are \n     rapidly going through our savings just to have the bare \n     necessities.\n       I urge and implore you and our government leaders to please \n     explore the option of opening up our own oil fields, building \n     refineries, whatever it takes to end our dependence on \n     foreign oil.\n     Jim and Janeil, Jerome.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are surviving just fine and will continue to do so. We \n     have cut back on driving to places we would go this time of \n     year and do think about short trips. Is this trip necessary?\n       I am upset with Congress and their lack of foresight in \n     producing energy in this country. You have made it impossible \n     for oil companies to drill in areas that could produce energy \n     now and in the future. And you continually want to blame \n     ``big oil'' for high prices. I do not. And you spend money \n     that we do not have. How did you vote on the recent farm \n     bill?\n       Abolish the code and go to a flat tax, ten percent, with no \n     deductions of any sort. And quit spending!\n     Neil.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for fighting for us, we are getting pinched hard \n     with the increased price for gas.\n       Our family story is not as dramatic as some I am sure you \n     will receive, but it is a picture of Middle America. I work \n     for the Federal Government and have an excellent job for the \n     Orofino area. My wife sells real estate, (need I say more \n     about her recent lack of income). We have two daughters both \n     in high school looking toward possible medical careers. We \n     have been saving for their college education, but with this \n     recent double whammy of housing market crash and high gas \n     prices it looks like we might have to discontinue our savings \n     plan contributions to buy gas to get to work.\n       (I feel like a whiner when compared to the financial crisis \n     some ``on the edge'' families must be facing).\n       A web site http://www.american\n     solutions.com/ has a petition going around to drill here in \n     the U.S. I have read a lot of the site and signed the \n     petition as have many others I know. I read some of the \n     recommended solutions and debunked myths in the solutions \n     forum; I suggest you or staff have a look for some possible \n     answers.\n       Thank you again.\n     Paul and Kathy, Orofino.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family and I live in S.E. Idaho. We have been extremely \n     affected by the high gas prices that have occurred. I will \n     not let my wife drive anywhere unless it is absolutely \n     necessary. She does the grocery shopping and I have got her \n     to only go once every 1 or 2 weeks. The problem with that is \n     that she needs to get out for a 'break', and I won't even let \n     her do that.\n       I feel we in the USA should do everything we can to \n     increase domestic oil production, expand nuclear energy \n     research, find other, cheaper fuels, and conserve as much as \n     possible.\n     Bob.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our family has made efficiency a priority on our automobile \n     travel. There are rarely ``one-stop'' trips being made. Our \n     daughter's, age 12 and 9, are stuck making less plans that \n     require a car trip and when we arrange play dates or outings \n     we try to coordinate carpooling with other parents, to share \n     the load. We have decided to keep our vacation local and will \n     camp in McCall this summer, instead of the previously plan RV \n     trip to the East Coast. I have been a full-time housewife for \n     9 years. Recently, my husband and I have discussed me going \n     back to work to help supplement the cost of food, goods and \n     fuel. When and if I do consider re-entering the work force, I \n     will look for work close to home. We are also considering the \n     purchase of a more fuel efficient vehicle.\n       All of the little things add up and where expenses are \n     concerned I am sure we are like most families who are doing \n     their best to economize while the cost of goods and fuel are \n     rising.\n       Please do to whatever you can to aide in the softening of \n     this economic down turn that we are feeling in Southwestern \n     Idaho. Please help to educate the general public on the \n     issues surrounding fuel use and alternatives. Perhaps, by \n     informing and educating the citizens, we will be able to make \n     better choices on the vehicles we purchase. I think the \n     public deserves honest explanations for what the root cause \n     is on the increase of the cost of fuel. Is it the war in \n     Iraq? Is it our relations with the Middle East? Does the \n     housing down-turn have an effect on the dollar value, which \n     in turn changes the ``value'' of oil? I would love to have \n     the knowledge to explain this to my children, however, the \n     media doesn't inform us with facts . . . and I think that is \n     what we need.\n       Good luck with your endeavor. Thank you for inviting the \n     Idaho citizens to be included in your collective effort to \n     change and improve our fuel crisis.\n     Lisa, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       I will write about the impacts being felt by my wife and I \n     and send it to you later.

Mr. President, when Lavenia McCoy arrived in \nBayfield in 1939 as new teacher, she also went to the library to \nvolunteer. She has served that library continuously: from the small \nspace behind the post office, to the town hall on the east side of the \npost office, to the entire 1100-square-foot building at the corner of \nMill and Pearl Streets, to the new 8200-square-foot library on the \nnorth side of town.\n  Lavenia McCoy was the first person in Bayfield to catalog books by \nthe Dewey Decimal System, a change for the alphabetical order by \nauthor's last name of the 500 or so books. She began serving on the \nLibrary Board in 1948, at the behest of Betty Stock, as secretary. \nAbout 35 years later, Lavenia McCoy became treasurer, including keeping \nthe library's financial records; she did that until 2006. By then the \nbudget had increased from pennies for overdue fees to several million \ndollars, the staff from all volunteer to six paid librarians, the \ncirculation from a few shelves of books to 20,000 volumes, and the \nfinancial records from ledger to computer. Always she encouraged folks \nto use their library.\n  Lavenia McCoy is a lifelong library user, and she is one who is \nwilling to do the work in order to enjoy the privilege. In 2005, the \nLibrary Board named its new library ``Lavenia McCoy Public Library'' in \nrecognition of her contribution. I wanted to take a moment to \ncongratulate her and her service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10804-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRAD SCOTT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr President, today I recognize and pay tribute to a \ngood friend and longtime colleague in public service: Brad Scott.\n  I have known Brad for more than 20 years, first as a dedicated and \neffective employee, and later as a visionary Government administrator.\n  On January 9, 2009, he will step down from his post as a regional \nadministrator of the General Service Administration after 8 years of \ninnovative and dedicated service.\n  We sometimes joke that the term ``Government efficiency'' is an \noxymoron, but not when Brad is in charge. He can make things happen. At \na time when political concerns seem to dominate much of the landscape, \nBrad has worked across the aisle to get things done by focusing on the \ncommon good and doing what is best for Missouri and the Heartland \nRegion.\n  We all know that in the Federal bureaucracy, it is much harder to \ncomplete a project than to derail it or to do nothing at all. Red tape \nis an all-too-real phenomenon. But since Brad came to the GSA in 2001, \nhe has not stopped building.\n  In 2001, he brought a set of successful business policies to a GSA \nregion that was suffering from underutilized space and low return on \ninvestment. He also worked hard to build consensus between local \ncommunities, the private sector and Government on large-scale projects. \nHe was able to revitalize blighted areas in many of our largest cities \nby constructing or renovating iconic buildings that now enhance local \neconomic development. He also permanently strengthened these local \ncommunities by creating and maintaining jobs.\n  Brad's accomplishments are too numerous to name. Several of his major \ncontributions include: the construction of First IRS Center in Kansas \nCity, new Federal courthouses in Cape Girardeau and Jefferson City, and \nthe conversion of the Old St. Louis Post Office into a heavily utilized \nState building.\n  Brad's long list of accomplishments speaks to his vision, dedication, \nand uncanny ability to guide key development projects through the \nbureaucratic maze.\n  Losing Brad Scott as Regional GSA Administrator will be a real blow \nto Missouri but the State has been fortunate to have him in that role \nfor so many years. I know that he will continue to be an active \nparticipant in issues facing Missouri and the region just as he has \nalways been.\n  Brad, thank you for your service and I look forward to many more good \nthings to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10804-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHO BARLEY COMMISSION 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize \nthe 20th anniversary of the Idaho Barley Commission, IBC, this year. \nBarley is grown in almost every county in Idaho, and Idaho ranks second \nin the Nation in barley production. The IBC has been working for \ngrowers for two decades, providing current trends, information and \neducational opportunities to those in the barley industry and \nrepresenting the concerns and needs of barley growers to policymakers \nin Idaho and here in Washington.\n  The IBC plays an integral role in fostering markets at home and \nabroad in Taiwan and Japan and is currently developing malting barley \nmarkets in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia and through the U.S. Grain \nCouncil. It helps ensure that growers' voices are heard in issues like \nFederal farm policy, Federal malt barley crop insurance, pesticide \nregulations and irrigation. The IBC is working with the University of \nIdaho to establish farm business management schools and provides \nservices to growers that include helping farmers optimize herbicide \nusage, boost yields, and cut irrigation costs. The IBC supports \nresearch on barley breeding, pest management, and extension nurseries.\n  The IBC has a successful history of working in conjunction with the \nNational Barley Growers Association, the National Barley Foods Council, \nthe U.S. Grains Council, and the Idaho Grain Growers Association. This \nimportant collaboration helps keep elected officials informed about \ntheir members' needs, policies that work, and those in need of \nimprovement. This partnership has been invaluable to me as I continue \nto work with IBC to address the needs of an important part of Idaho's \nagriculture economy.\n  Congratulations to the IBC on 20 years of support for one of Idaho's \nmost widespread commodities. A healthy barley industry keeps Idaho \nthriving and contributes to our Nation's economy and food \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10804-4", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10804-5", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10804-6", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2008, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 21, 2008, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2040.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nprovide much-needed relief to struggling families across America. The \nUnemployment Benefit Tax Suspension Act of 2008 is a critical piece of \nlegislation that would suspend the collection of federal income tax on \nunemployment benefits for 2008 and 2009.\n  In light of the calamitous labor market, Congress must act to ensure \nthat workers who lose their jobs do not also lose their livelihoods. On \nFriday, the Labor Department released sobering statistics that \ndemonstrated the gravity of the situation we face. In November, the \neconomy shed 533,000 jobs, the largest monthly job loss since December \n1974. Our unemployment rate now stands at a perilous 6.7 percent, a 15-\nyear high. We have lost 1.9 million jobs since the beginning of our \npresent recession in December 2007--including \\2/3\\ of those jobs in \nthe last 3 months alone--and the number of unemployed stands at a \nwhopping 10.3 million.\n  Suspending the federal income tax on unemployment benefits is a \nsimple way to assist our nation's unemployed workers and families. In \nfact, the CBO has estimated that in 2005, of the 8.1 million recipients \nof UC benefits, 7.5 million had incomes of under $100,000. As such, \nmost of the benefits of suspending this tax are likely to go to lower- \nand middle-income families, those struggling harder than ever just to \nmakes ends meet.\n  During these challenging times, taxes on unemployment compensation \nrepresents a burden that unemployed members of our society simply \ncannot afford. Working families are already suffering, with the high \ncost of groceries, an unstable energy market, and the outrageous price \ntag for health care. My bill offers a means to help stimulate the \neconomy by making unemployed workers' benefits stretch farther. While \nit is certainly not a solution to the problem, it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  President-elect Obama has voiced his support for this general idea, \ncalling it ``a way of giving more relief to families,'' and I believe \nthat is the ultimate goal we must pursue in these trying times. I look \nforward to seeing this bill is passed in a timely manner, so that the \nimpact can be immediate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Unemployment Benefit Tax \n     Suspension Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUSPENSION OF TAX ON UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 85 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to unemployment compensation) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Temporary Suspension.--Subsection (a) shall not apply \n     to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007, and \n     before January 1, 2010.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3719. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to suspend \nthe minimum required pension distribution rules for 2008, 2009, and \n2010; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \noffer relief to retirees who are being forced to take so-called \nrequired minimum distributions from their retirement accounts in a year \nin which the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen a staggering 35 \npercent. Because retirees are forced to make withdrawals from their \nretirement accounts, they cannot wait for equities markets to recover \nand must, in many cases, unnecessarily absorb devastating losses. The \nRetirement Account Distribution Improvement Act of 2008 would suspend \nrequired minimum distribution rules until 2011 to allow retirees the \nability to recoup some of their losses.\n  Under current law, individuals who have reached age 70.5 generally \nmust begin to withdraw funds from their IRAs or defined contribution \nretirement plans, including 401(k), 403(b), 457, and TSP plans. The \nwithdrawals must begin by April 1 of the year in which an individual \nattains age 70.5. Failure to take a required minimum distribution may \nresult in a 50 percent excise tax on the difference between what must \nbe withdrawn and the amount actually distributed.\n  In times that equities markets are rising and retirement account \nbalances are growing, required minimum distribution rules are sensible. \nIndeed, they ensure the government gains revenue after years of tax-\ndeferred growth. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing unprecedented \nlosses in equities markets that have caused many individuals to suffer \nsteep losses in their retirement account balances. Indeed, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons has said that retirement accounts have \nlost as much as $2.3 trillion between September 30, 2007, and October \n16 of this year. Forcing individuals to liquidate accounts and pay \nincome taxes on the proceeds, as is required under current law, instead \nof allowing them to wait until the market recovers and continue to \ndefer tax, simply adds insult to injury. Moreover, mandating \nwithdrawals may cause stock prices to fall, hurting other investors.\n  It is for these reasons that I am today introducing legislation to \nwaive minimum required distributions for the 2008 to 2010 period. Under \nmy legislation, retirement plan custodians would be prohibited from \nmaking required distributions unless an individual specifically asked \nthat funds be withdrawn. Plan custodians would have to send individuals \na notification to alert them that they must make an affirmative \nelection to receive funds from their accounts. Finally, to benefit \nindividuals who have already taken a required minimum distribution for \n2008, the bill would allow a re-contribution of those amounts into a \nretirement account by July 1, 2009.\n  I am aware that others have proposed variations on the provisions I \nam introducing today. For example, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson may \nbe considering very short-term administrative relief. While well \nintentioned, this approach does not guarantee meaningful long-term \naction. Meanwhile, others have drafted legislation to suspend minimum \ndistribution rules. Notably, Senators Baucus, Grassley, Kennedy, and \nEnzi, offered legislation, The Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery \nAct of 2008, before the Thanksgiving Recess, a measure that I have \ncosponsored because it includes many worthy provisions such as a one-\nyear waiver of required minimum distribution rules. While I greatly \nappreciate their efforts and hope that we can clear that bill as early \nas today, we must do more. A 1-year waiver of minimum distribution \nrules is simply a good start, but with many predicting a multi-year \nrecession, I believe the waiver should be at least 3 years.\n  Congress must adopt a longer-term approach to helping individuals \nprotect their retirement assets and weather the current economic storm. \nIndividuals may require several years to recoup losses they have \nsustained, and by enabling them to keep assets in their retirement \naccounts until 2011, this bill offers them that opportunity. After 2 \nyears, Congress can reevaluate whether the waiver of current-law rules \nshould be further extended. I urge all Senators to consider the \nbenefits this legislation will provide to millions of retirees all \nacross the United States, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact it in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Retirement Account \n     Distribution Improvement Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TEMPORARY WAIVER OF REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION \n                   RULES FOR CERTAIN RETIREMENT PLANS AND \n                   ACCOUNTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to required distributions) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(H) Temporary waiver of minimum required distribution.--\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\n       ``(i) In general.--The requirements of this paragraph shall \n     not apply in calendar year 2008, 2009, or 2010 to--\n\n       ``(I) a defined contribution plan which is described in \n     this subsection or in section 403(a) or 403(b),\n       ``(II) a defined contribution plan which is an eligible \n     deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) but \n     only if such plan is maintained by an employer described in \n     section 457(e)(1)(A), or\n       ``(III) an individual retirement plan.\n\n       ``(ii) Plans only to make elective distributions.--A trust \n     forming part of a plan shall not constitute a qualified trust \n     under this subsection unless the plan provides that it will \n     not make a payment or distribution during calendar year 2009 \n     or 2010 which would otherwise be made to meet the \n     requirements of this paragraph unless the employee or \n     beneficiary elects to have such payment or distribution made. \n     This clause shall not apply to an employee or beneficiary who \n     is receiving, after the annuity starting date, distributions \n     under the plan through an annuity contract issued by a \n     company licensed to do business as an insurance company under \n     the laws of any State.\n       ``(iii) Election.--An election under clause (ii) shall be \n     made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may \n     prescribe.

(A) with \n     respect to a payment or distribution from an individual \n     retirement plan (as defined by section 7701(a)(37) of such \n     Code), then, to the extent of the amount of the contribution, \n     such payments or distributions shall be treated as a \n     distribution that satisfies subparagraphs (A) and (B) of \n     section 408(d)(3) of such Code and as having been transferred \n     to the individual retirement plan in a direct trustee to \n     trustee transfer.\n       (3) Provisions relating to plan or contract amendments.--\n       (A) In general.--If this paragraph applies to any pension \n     plan or contract amendment, such pension plan or contract \n     shall be treated as being operated in accordance with the \n     terms of the plan during the

or annuity contract which--\n\n       (I) is made by pursuant to the amendments made by this \n     section, and\n       (II) is made on or before the last day of the first plan \n     year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.\n\n     In the case of a governmental plan, subclause (II) shall be \n     applied by substituting ``2012'' for ``2011''.\n       (ii) Conditions.--This paragraph shall

amendment is adopted), the plan or contract \n     is operated as if such plan or contract amendment were in \n     effect; and\n       (II) such plan or contract amendment applies retroactively \n     for such period.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3720. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to suspend \nthe minimum required pension distribution rules for 2008 and 2009; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to temporarily suspend the requirement that persons aged \n70\\1/2\\ and over take minimum distributions from their pensions or \nIndividual Retirement Accounts, IRAs.\n  I offer this legislation because of the economic situation our \ncountry is in at this moment. At a time when our financial markets are \nso greatly unstable, the government should not be requiring people--\nespecially retired citizens likely living on fixed incomes--to take \nmoney out of the markets. If seniors need this money, and want to take \nthis money out of their pension plans, they should certainly be allowed \nto do so. But right now, while the markets are so unpredictable, I \nthink it is wise for Congress to suspend the requirement that persons \naged 70\\1/2\\ and above take mandatory distributions from their \npensions, 401(k)s, and IRAs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will suspend this requirement \nfor 1 year. Recently, forecasters at the Federal Reserve Bank of \nPhiladelphia estimated that the United States will\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nenter into a recession lasting approximately 14 months. While I \ncertainly hope that they are wrong, and our economy begins to improve \nas Congress looks at various ways to stimulate the financial markets, I \nthink we must be prudent in preparing for the worst. A 1 year \nsuspension of the required pension distribution rule would allow time \nfor the markets to stabilize. If, a year from now, our financial \nsituation has not vastly improved, I believe it may be prudent to visit \nthis issue again.\n  This legislation is a simple fix that will have a significant impact \non both the financial markets and the portfolios of our senior \ncitizens. Requiring seniors to take disbursements from their pensions \nor IRAs now will also likely mean that, with the markets at such a low \npoint, seniors will be losing a significant amount of money. Current \ntax law not only is hurting the financial markets with this rule, it is \nalso hurting the wallets of seniors who will see smaller distributions \nand dwindling pensions. If seniors don't need these distributions right \nnow, let them keep their money in their retirement plans until the \nmarkets can rebuild and boost the amount those retirement plans are \nworth.\n  Another provision in this legislation would allow retirees who have \nalready taken distributions in 2008 to reinvest those distributions \nback into their pension plan without penalty. This again would put \nmoney back into the markets if the recipients don't yet need the money \nat this time.\n  I hope that we will be able to weather the current financial storm we \nare in quickly. Through small measures like this one, in conjunction \nwith the larger measures that Congress has already done, we can begin \nto bring stability to the markets. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this and other legislation to help the families in this \ncountry who are hurting because of the economic downturn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK:\n  S. 3721.

A bill to direct the Secretary to take land into trust for \nthe Te-moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Elko Indian Colony Expansion Act of 2008.\n  The Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada includes four \nconstituent bands, each having a separate reservation or colony in \nnortheastern Nevada. One of the Te-moak Tribe's bands--the Elko Band--\nhas a strong need for additional land. While their population has \nsteadily grown, their land base has remained the same for over 75 \nyears. This legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \nmake a reasonable expansion of the Te-moak Tribe's Elko Colony by \ntaking 375 acres of land into trust.\n  The histories of the city of Elko and the Elko Indian Colony have \nlong been intertwined. Elko was established as a railroad town in 1868 \nwith the construction of the Central Pacific, part of the first \ntranscontinental railroad. Shoshone families that had long lived in the \narea camped nearby to work on the railroad and in the area's mines and \nranches.\n  Government officials tried to relocate Elko's Indian families and all \nWestern Shoshones to the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, 100 miles to \nthe north of Elko, when it was created in 1877. The families refused to \nleave, however, and managed to stay in the Elko area. When the \ngovernment's formal relocation policy failed, separate ``colonies'' for \nremaining Shoshone families were established. In 1918, President \nWoodrow Wilson reserved 160 acres for the Shoshone Indians near Elko by \nexecutive order. Another 33 acres were later purchased by the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, BIA, and were made part of the colony by Congress in \n1931.\n  Today the Elko Colony is a thriving community. More than half of the \nTe-Moak's Tribe's enrolled members live and work in Elko, yet the Elko \nColony has one of the smallest land bases of the four constituent \nbands. Over 350 tribal members are forced to live off of the colony \nbecause of a lack of reservation housing. Our legislation would address \nthis need for more land by directing the Secretary of the Interior to \ntake approximately 375 acres of land into trust for the tribe. These \nlands are currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and \nare adjacent to the existing Elko Colony. The land would be available \nfor residential or commercial development, or for traditional uses, \nlike ceremonial gatherings, hunting, and plant collecting.\n  We have received strong letters of support for this proposal from \nboth the City of Elko and Elko County. It is always encouraging when \ncommunities come together to work on a project like this, and we are \ngrateful for their collective work on this effort. I also want to \nhighlight that the city has a number of rights-of-way that cross the \nland in question, and our legislation is designed to protect those \ninterests.\n  This bill will do so much to improve the lives of the Elko Band of \nthe Te-Moak Tribe. We are pleased to bring this legislation to the \ncommittee and we look forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, \nRanking Member Domenici and the other distinguished members to move \nthis bill through the process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3724\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \nresolution recognizing January 2 as National Advertising Specialty Day.\n  An advertising specialty is any item imprinted with a logo or slogan \nand given out to promote a company, organization, product, service, \nspecial achievement or event. The use of advertising specialties has \nhistorical relevance as the industry dates back to George Washington's \nuse of collectible buttons in his presidential campaign in 1789. Today, \nthere are over 750,000 varieties of advertising specialties.\n  The advertising specialty industry is now a major contributor to the \nUnited States economy. The industry employs over 344,000 professionals, \nincluding 9,000 in Pennsylvania. Eighty-five percent of these \nprofessionals are employed in small or medium-size businesses, some of \nwhich gross up to one million dollars per year.\n  The advertising specialty industry has experienced substantial \ngrowth. It has grown annually at an average rate of 4 percent since \n2003 making it a 19.6 billion dollar industry in 2007. Advertising \nspecialties now account for over 14 percent of all tracked advertising \nspending in the United States.\n  It is important to recognize the positive contributions the \nadvertising specialty industry has had on the economy by creating jobs \nand small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support this industry by \ndesignating January 2 as National Advertising Specialty Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/08/senate-section/article/S10816-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 723--TO PERMIT THE COLLECTION OF CLOTHING, TOYS, \nFOOD, AND HOUSEWARES DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES \n                          IN SENATE BUILDINGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
